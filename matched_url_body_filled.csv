https://timesofmalta.com/article/mcast-students-plead-end-union-dispute.1094123,"Final-year students attending the Malta College for Arts Science and Technology said the ongoing union directives have left them feeling unmotivated, anxious and stressed, as they do not know when they will be provided their results.
 For the past month, all staff at MCAST have been following directives issued by the Malta Union of Teachers, after talks over the new collective agreement failed.
 No exam and assessment results are to be provided to students, and no marks will be uploaded onto any platform due to directives. Staff have also been asked to limit communication with students, management and administration.
 “Students are left in the dark and overwhelmed with the situation,” Jordan Galea Pace, a final-year Business Enterprise student told Times of Malta.
 “Students have spent years studying, trying to move forward, and now the uncertainty kills our motivation. Without marks, students cannot apply for masters or internships abroad, and some cannot start working either.”
 Galea Pace, the newly elected vice-mayor of Swieqi, is also a student representative at MCAST’s Institute of Business Management and Commence and has experienced first-hand how the directives have impacted his colleagues.
 “Two course mates, both young men, were in tears in the hallway because they were so anxious and nervous about not receiving their marks and feeling unable to do anything,” he said.
 He said he knew of students who handed in their thesis without receiving any feedback from their tutors.
 Similar directives were ordered last year over the delayed collective agreement. The directives were eventually suspended in January by the union following progress in its discussions, yet those talks came to a halt in May.
 The Commissioner for Education urged the government and Malta Union of Teachers to resolve their dispute at MCAST. While the commissioner acknowledged the fundamental right of educators to engage in industrial action to voice their grievances, it should not cause harm to students.
 Prospective students might have second thoughts about applying for a course with MCAST because of the directives, Galea Pace said.
 Daniela Iraci, another Business Enterprise final student said she was meant to have her viva-voce exam (an exam where students defend their thesis and research), but she has received no feedback if she passed her assessments or exams.
 “I feel bummed because I studied at MCAST for five years and finally I have concluded my studies but with no sight of marks if I have passed or not,” she said.
 “I am supposed to feel relieved after all this hard work but it feels like I did all this for nothing. I understand that lecturers deserve better conditions, but this is just cruel.”
 Nursing students Kylie Mercieca, 20, and Martina Farrugia, 21, raised the alarm about how the directives prevent them from starting their careers as nurses, especially at a time when the shortage of nursing staff needs to be addressed.
 “As aspiring nurses, we have dedicated years of intensive study and clinical practice to serve our community and join the healthcare system,” Farrugia said.
 “The government has always highlighted the important role nurses play in our healthcare system and has encouraged the need to address staff shortage. Yet, this current matter contradicts everything, leaving us in limbo.”
 Mercieca said she and her coursemates were supposed to know if they were going to graduate next week, but thanks to the directives they were still waiting for their dissertation marks.
 “The directives have caused undue stress and anxiety. The removal of assessment marks heightened my anxiety. Not knowing my academic standing made it difficult to stay motivated and confident.”
 The lack of communication with her lecturers, and not receiving any feedback or guidance,  left her feeling alone and unsupported.
 Martina Farrugia said living in the “constant fear of the unknown” has affected her greatly, as she waits for the results of two assignments and her dissertation.
 “In the short run, it is affecting us students, but in the long run it is going to affect everyone, as everyone needs healthcare, and with this crisis, the patients are also going to suffer,” she said.
 The Education Ministry told Times of Malta that MCAST has a financial proposal prepared to be presented to the MUT with the condition that the union immediately suspends the directives.
 “The MUT is refusing to withdraw the directives to the detriment of the students,” a ministry spokesperson said.
 The MUT said there were no updates about the situation.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/mut-government-agree-second-draft-sectoral-agreement.1094538,"Updated 1pm with minister's comments
 The Malta Union of Teachers have concluded another draft agreement about educators' work and pay conditions with the government and will be asking their members to vote on it next week.  
 The agreement will determine conditions for educators in state and church schools.
 The teachers’ union had already reached agreement with the government last May, but union members expressed dissatisfaction with the conditions on offer.
 MUT then froze a vote on the agreement and returned to the negotiating table. 
 That first agreement included a raft of other proposals including revised starting salaries for kindergarten teachers (KGEs) and learning support educators (LSE), quicker salary progression, a one-off payment of €1,000 and an additional allowance of €2,000 for those with more than 20 years' experience, among others. 
 Basic salaries would have stayed the same under the proposed changes, with pay increases effected through increased allowances.
 On Thursday morning, the teachers’ union said in a statement ""discussions with the government have been concluded, and updates have been included in the new sectoral agreement text”. 
 The details are not yet clear and Times of Malta has reached out to the Education Ministry and the MUT.
 From Monday, the union will be holding meetings with teachers so that they can see a physical copy of the agreement. 
 MUT educators will then have between Thursday and Saturday to vote on whether they approve of the latest version of the sectoral agreement.  
 Education Minister Clifton Grima said he was looking forward to seeing the closure discussions within the union so that educators can start to benefit from an unprecedented new agreement.  
 “I welcome the news that the MUT now feels it can go back again to its members with the draft agreement,” he said.   
 The agreement not only shows respect for educators but also a substantial improvement in conditions, he said.  
 Contacted for comment MUT president Marco Bonnici said that the teachers' union negotiated for amendments to reflect members' requests.
 Negotiations over the agreement have been ongoing for months and reached a boiling point in November when a one-day strike was held. 
 Matters also came to a head in spring when MUT said it was considering resorting to industrial action again.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/birdlife-asks-ornis-committee-outlaw-hunting-200m-schools.1099178,"Birdlife has called for hunting to be outlawed within 200 metres of schools after a teacher found a protected European Honey-Buzzard shot close to a Rabat school.
 A teacher who heard rustling in bushes found the protected bird on Monday near the Archbishop’s Seminary, a primary and secondary school.
 Birdlife said the teacher first tried to contact the Environmental Protection Unit but they were unable to help him. Birdlife volunteers then intervened and took the bird to a vet for medical treatment.
 The bird conservation NGO said such illegal hunting could be significantly reduced if schools were declared bird sanctuaries with a 200m buffer zone surrounding them.
 It has now pitched the idea to the Ornis Committee – a government-run committee which it sits on and which is responsible for advising the government on hunting and trapping-related issues.
 “We don’t anticipate any opposition from its voting members,” said BirdLife Malta CEO Mark Sultana.
 “Schools should be places where students can learn to appreciate and connect with wildlife, not where protected species are gunned down just outside their grounds.”
 Birdlife said the Honey-Buzzard was the 22nd shot bird its volunteers have recovered since September 1, when the autumn hunting season began. The police recovered various others, it said.
 Of the 22 birds Birdlife volunteers found, 12 were birds of prey, including species such as Eurasian Hobby, Lesser Kestrel, Common Kestrel and Eleonora’s Falcon.
 “In the last two weeks alone, seven European honey-buzzards have been rescued. Other targeted species include Common Greenshank, night heron, grey heron, little egret, Common Hoopoe, European bee-eater and European turtle dove,” the NGO said.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/stephen-vella-appointed-new-principal-ceo-mcast.1097890,"Stephen Vella has been appointed the new principal and CEO of the Malta College of Arts, Science & Technology (MCAST), the college announced on Tuesday. 
 Presently holding a deputy principal role, MCAST said that Vella was selected following a call for applications in June. They said that he brings with him over two decades of experience in vocational education and a strong track record of leadership within the college. 
 He was educated at Savio College and Stella Maris College and read for degrees at the University of Malta and Falkirk College of Arts in Scotland. He also holds an MBA from the Henley School of Management.
 Vella started teaching graphic design and photography at the Salvatore Dimech School for Craftsmen in 1993 and he was appointed deputy director of the institute in 2003. 
 He has held several roles at MCAST throughout the years, being appointed Director of the MCAST Institute for the Creative Arts in 2008, Head of the Technical College in 2015, General Manager at MCAST Gateway to Industry in 2017 and Deputy Principal for Business Development and Communications in 2021. 
 Vella replaces Joachim James Calleja, whose removal from the post made headlines when he was told that his contract would not be renewed. 
 Calleja had previously complained to the Ombudsman’s Office claiming his dismissal was unlawful and politically motivated.
 Commissioner for Education Chief Justice Emeritus Vincent De Gaetano, concluded that the circumstances of the case showed that Calleja’s dismissal was “both unreasonable and unjust.”

https://timesofmalta.com/article/mut-drops-mcast-directives-union-government-continue-negotiations.1094588,"Students at MCAST are to get their exams and assignment marks, after the Malta Union of Teachers dropped marking-related directives following negotiations. 
 All other directives in place at the college remain in place. 
 In a statement on Friday, the union said the two have agreed on a way forward regarding these negotiations, that will lead to a “satisfactory conclusion” of the agreement. 
 Schedules and meetings have been set, and the union has suspended marking directives.
 Other directives that remain in force include an order to student support services staff to not answer phone calls or act on any communication from administration and management, excluding emergencies and crises.
 Student mentors have also been ordered to ignore any communication from management and refuse to attend outreach sessions with students.
 In a Facebook post, Prime Minister Robert Abela said he was satisfied that the discussions held with MCAST students and MUT members bore fruit. He said while the talks on the collective agreement will continue, students will be provided with their marks to provide them peace of mind. 
  The dispute made headlines over the past few weeks, as MCAST students had raised their concerns about how the situation has impacted them negatively, as exams had been cancelled and their marks remained in limbo until the eleventh hour. 
 The Commissioner for Education also urged the government and MUT to resolve their dispute at MCAST.
 Last week, MCAST principal Joachim James Calleja confirmed his contract was not renewed by the Education Ministry, amid reports he was sacked.
 Calleja previously told Times of Malta that some three weeks ago, the ministry informed him in writing that his contract, which was up for renewal, was not going to be renewed.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/wish-werent-here-mta-ask-residents-feel-tourists.1091830,"Residents across Malta and Gozo are to be asked about their views on the impact of tourism on their lives.
 The Malta Tourism Authority (MTA) has issued a call for tenders to carry out a survey of 600 people in June. The authority has estimated the cost of the survey to be at around €10,000.
 Residents will be asked if they agree with a series of positive and negative statements on topics including whether respondents benefit economically from tourism to whether it causes crowding in bathing spaces. 
 And while the MTA has not indicated how the findings of the survey will be used, it comes at a time of heightened concern about mass tourism across the continent.
 A record three million tourists visited Malta in 2023, according to the MTA, with 40% of visitors coming from Italy or the UK. 
 According to the call issued on Thursday, the successful applicant will “carry out a study for the MTA to better understand the residents’ perceptions and attitudes towards tourism activity on the Maltese Islands.”
 A provisional set of questions issued with the call sheds light on the topics the authority is interested in.
 Residents will be asked to indicate how strongly they agree or disagree with statements such as: “Tourism makes me want to work to keep the Maltese Islands special”, “Tourism helps me pay my bills” and “Tourism fosters a sense of 'community spirit' within me”.
 Residents are expected to be asked if they think tourism helps preserve the country’s heritage and environment, whether it worsens traffic issues and causes overcrowding.
 And they are also likely to be asked whether Malta should remain a tourist destination, if the country should aim to attract more tourists and whether “the positive benefits of tourism outweigh negative impacts”.
 A final set of questions will be supplied to the winning bidder when the tender is concluded.
 Tourism is an important economic driver in Malta and has regularly been touted as a measure of the country’s success by various governments.
  While the government has indicated it wants to attract more “quality tourism” and higher-spending visitors, other parts of Europe have recently tried to stem the tide of visitors, concerned that mass tourism is overly impacting residents.
 Last year, Sardinia introduced a cap on the number of visitors to its pristine beaches, while Venice recently introduced a €5 fee for day-trippers visiting the famous city.
 In July, Amsterdam banned cruise ships from entering the city centre in a bid to curb visitor numbers and pollution. The same month, Dubrovnik in Croatia introduced an educational ‘Respect the City’ campaign and Portugal introduced fines of up to €36,000 for playing loud music at popular beaches.
 When contacted, a spokesperson for the Tourism Ministry said the results of the survey would help the MTA ""to form an opinion, plan and formulate future strategy.""
 He said the survey was being undertaken as part of the government's 2021-2030 strategy and as part of the activities of the Malta Tourism Observatory ""aiming at developing a sustainable tourism industry for the future.""

https://timesofmalta.com/article/last-twelve-months-second-driest-record.1098328,"The last 12 months were the second driest on record according to the Meteorological Office at Malta International Airport.
 From September to August – the most recent ‘precipitation year’ – only 249.8 mm of rainfall was recorded. This is less than half the amount normally registered over the same period.
 Rain was recorded on 58 days out of the 366 days in the precipitation year, totalling “295.5 mm below the climatic norm,” the Met Office said.
 Only 1948 was drier - when just 230.7 mm of rain fell.
 Most months saw below-average rainfall, with only last month registering above-average precipitation, exceeding the monthly norm by 3.5 mm in one downpour on August 22.
 Meanwhile, July was the driest month of the year with no rain recorded at all for the second year in a row, while October last year was the driest such month on record with only 0.2 mm of rain.
 November “offered some relief” however, with 53.6 mm of rain “providing much-needed hydration for crops after a dry start to the rainy season”, the Met Office said.
 That month was also home to the wettest day of the year, when 26.4 mm of rain fell on November 22.
 Over the past 12 months, Malta was hit by 14 thunderstorms and experienced three bouts of hail in November, January and February, with the latter seeing social media flooded with images and videos of ice blanketing the streets.
 Each year, the Met Office - which celebrated its 100th anniversary two years ago - releases reports on the previous precipitation year, which runs from September 1 to August 31.
 Last year's analysis for the preceding precipitation year showed the summer months of June, July and August were all drier than average months.
 According to the Met Office weather forecast on Friday afternoon, the weekend is expected to be cloudy with showers predicted on Monday. Peak temperatures are expected to hover between 26 and 27 degrees Celsius.

 The National Statistics Office said power plants accounted for 67.8 per cent of supply while 21.3 per cent was imported (+ 0.3 per cent ) and 10.9 per cent came from renewable sources. Most of the renewable energy (97%) was produced from photovoltaic panels.
  July saw the heaviest demand, with 334.7 GWh of electricity being supplied, followed by August at 303.4 GWh.
 The annual average demand registered in 2023 was that of 446 MW – a decrease of 5.9 per cent when compared to the previous year.

 The order - which comes into effect on Monday - forms part of a raft of directives issued by their union after talks over the new collective agreement failed.
 Sources told Times of Malta the Malta Union of Teachers has registered a dispute with the college and issued directives after negotiations failed mainly due to the financial aspect of the agreement.
 Lecturers, student mentors, senior research officers, technicians, learning support educators, student services, directors and deputy directors have all been told to follow directives. 
 The action is the same one that the union ordered late last year over a delayed collective agreement. Consequently, MCAST students  walked out of their lectures in January, protesting the action.
 The directives were eventually suspended by the union following progress in its discussions.
 Those talks continued, however, they reached a dead end this week, with MCAST management and the government remaining adamant in their position. 
 Sources said the same situation was being experienced at the Institute for Tourism Studies.
 Student support services staff has meanwhile been ordered not to answer phone calls and not act on any communication from administration and management excluding emergencies and crises.
 They were also ordered not to issue new referrals or assign new cases unless they were deemed high-risk.
 Student mentors have also been ordered to ignore any communication from management and refuse to attend outreach sessions with students.
 All lecturing grades- whether full-time or part-time lecturers - have been asked to withhold assessment marks from students, colleagues, internal verifiers, and management. Marks will not be uploaded onto any platform.
 The staff has also been asked to refrain from any invigilation duties.
 This means that lecturing grades will not distribute or collect assessment papers and will not monitor students to ensure they do not copy during tests.
 The directives also limit communication with students, administration and management.
 Communication with students will be strictly limited to scheduled lectures and designated contact hours. This includes emails, MS Teams and any other online platforms outside of these scheduled times.
 Lecturing grades have been instructed not to attend staff meetings except for those that are timetabled and part of the contact teaching load.
 This directive also includes any CPD meetings organised by MCAST.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/youll-worship-me-santa-cement-statue-greets-students-uom-faculty.1098787,"Santa Cement, the 'patron saint' of concrete and rapid development, debuted at the University of Malta’s campus on Monday.
 Nearly two metres tall, the statue is now greeting students and staff at the entrance of the Faculty for the Built Environment, with a slogan reading: ""Will you worship/adore me (ħa tadurani)?"".
 The statue, created by recent architecture graduate Karl Sammut and student Julian Cassar, is a statement about Malta's ""addiction to cement"" and rapid development.
 “We want students to be aware of the local situation when it comes to the Maltese construction industry and we urge them to address it rather than hide or be afraid to act,” Sammut said. 
  Santa Cement was built during a summer workshop held by the Society of Architecture and Civil Engineering Students.
 The theme was ‘Escape,’ and Cassar and Sammut’s group focused on what many in Malta long to escape from: relentless concrete development.
 Their creation, called ‘Min Ħexa Mexa’, or simply Santa Cement, reflects this frustration.
 They hope the structure stays in the faculty for at least a year:
 “The statue serves as a physical reminder to do better, design better and avoid being pushed around in an industry often run by bullies"".
 Freshers’ Week is usually known for its flashy commercial displays, but Santa Cement stands out as a more direct, thought-provoking statement.
 The duo hopes the statue encourages more activism by students: “Student organisations don’t realise how much power they hold or, if they do, they just do not utilise it"".
 “A student’s voice, free from political ties, can be a powerful force for change.”

https://timesofmalta.com/article/mcast-students-plan-picnic-road-protest-industrial-action.1101387,"Updated 6.20pm
 MCAST students plan to hold two separate protests on Wednesday to raise awareness about the impact of an ongoing dispute between lecturers and the government. 
 The Institute of Creative Arts students are planning a 'protest picnic' on the road between MCAST's Mosta campus and Lidl for 11.45am on Wednesday.  
 In a statement, the students said there was ""deep frustration and uncertainty"" among students due to industrial action by the Malta Union of Teachers. 
 Separately, another protest endorsed by Kunsill Studenti MCAST (KSM), will kick off at 11am at the Students' House Piazza on the MCAST Paola campus.
 Students from MCAST Qormi will join their peers in Paola, staging a carcade on their way to the protest to demand urgent action.
 The directives mean students have had marks and grades withheld and assignment briefs for the upcoming year have not been verified. 
 Staff are also banned from communicating with management and students outside designated hours.
 ""With teachers on strike since October 4, 2024, students feel their educational futures are at risk as they await government intervention while their academic progress is severely compromised,"" the Mosta MCAST students said. 
 ""The situation has become difficult for many students, prompting them to consider dropping out as they navigate the implications of the union's directives.""
 The Paola and Qormi students meanwhile said the unresolved directives threaten to jeopardise their career prospects, limit their chances of progressing within their courses, and reduce their employability.
 ""These longstanding issues have left students feeling exhausted and frustrated, with no clear resolution in sight.""
 Among other directives, the union ordered lecturers to avoid communication with MCAST administration and students outside of designated contact hours, to boycott events and not show up for extracurricular activities and school ceremonies, to refrain from disclosing assessment marks to students or management, not to show up for staff meetings, to limit work to essential tasks like teaching and to halt research activities, including providing support for students who are doing their theses.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/teachers-now-get-written-permission-speak-media.1100394,"Updated 5.30pm with PN statement 
 Teachers must now get written permission before speaking to the media and have to tell their bosses what they intend to speak about.
 The rule forms part of Circular DES 28.2024, sent out by the Education Ministry in late September, and applies to educators at all levels. 
 According to the policy, educators who obtain permission to speak to the media must ensure that their comments reflect Education Ministry policies and objectives and refrain from promoting their personal opinions or making statements that might be perceived as politically biased. 
 Any educator who breaches the policy will be referred to the department for educational services, for ""review and ensuing action"". 
 The rules apply to all forms of media appearances - from TV shows to podcasts, written media and radio - related to educational matters. 
 Authorities say the policy is important to maintain professional standards in education and safeguard the integrity of the educational system. 
 But it has prompted concerns about self-censorship and restricting teachers' freedom of expression, as well as warnings that educators who are also politically active - in political parties, NGOs or other community initiatives - have been effectively muzzled. 
 The directive effectively extends restrictions placed on civil servants - who are also forbidden from speaking to the media without permission - to teachers, academics and heads of schools across the country. 
 Michelle Attard-Tonna, a faculty member at the University of Malta’s department of education, stressed that teachers, like other public sector workers such as doctors and architects, were already regulated by the Public Service Management Code (PSMC) - a code of behaviour for civil servants.  
 ""My question is if they [other professions] also received similar directives and if they think that such a directive makes sense in a democratic society,” she said.  
 “If we want a level of ‘quality education’ - because that is the buzzword at the moment - then we cannot gag the mouth of the teachers; it’s one or the other.”
 Teachers’ union UPE said on Friday that it wants the directive to be withdrawn.
 The Union of Professional Educators said it has written to the director general of educational services, Ritianne Borg Saliba, to outline their concerns about the circular
 It has also asked the Education Ombudsman to investigate it, taking up a request made by independent candidate - and academic - Arnold Cassola. 
 Cassola, who has branded the directive a ""fascist"" one, had a request for the Ombudsman to investigate it rebuffed, on grounds that he is not employed by the Department of Education - a prerequisite for such an investigation.
 Shadow Education Minister Justin Schembri has also asked for the ombudsman to investigate.  
 In a statement the PN said the circular ""stifles the freedom of expression of every educator as an individual and citizen by stating that no educator may voice their personal ideas on the field of education and dictates what may be said"".
 Lawyer and former MP Jason Azzopardi has also been critical of the new rule, saying it effectively muzzles educators and that it suggests the government ""is afraid of its own shadow.""
 The UPE said it has similar concerns about the directive, saying it breaches freedom of expression provisions in the constitution and would effectively work to create an atmosphere of self-censorship among educators, driving them to avoid speaking to the media for fear of reprimand.
 “The restrictions imposed by the circular not only harm individual rights but also deprive society of the insights and expert opinions of educators, which are vital for informed public discourse,” the UPE said.
 Union chief Graham Sansone told Times of Malta that the restrictions were ""unheard of"". 
 ""Is the government saying union officials who work in schools can't speak? That educators involved in politics can't speak? That educators in NGOs have been silenced? 
 
 ""The circular makes it clear all these can't speak freely and say what they think,"" he said. 
 The UPE has now instructed its members to actively assert their right to openly engage with the media, saying it would back them in opposing the circular. 
 It has issued a directive to that effect. 
 Activist group Il-Kolletiv also condemned the directive, saying it was “incomprehensible”.
 “Its only aim is to silence the diversity of voices within education,” said NGO president Jeanette Borg.
  The organisation noted a pattern of work to silence critical voices within the sector – from an ongoing dispute at MCAST to a controversy that erupted at University during freshers’ week.
 “A state that silences its academia is a totalitarian, cowardly and paranoid one,” Borg said. “The minister has no right to silence teachers because he feels threatened by criticism.”

https://timesofmalta.com/article/government-teachers-union-reach-agreement-collective-agreement-deal.1092998,"Updated 9.30pm
 The government and the Malta Union of Teachers have reached an agreement for a collective agreement for educators, following months of negotiations.
 Union members must now vote on the agreed-upon deal before it can be signed and implemented. 
 The MUT told its members during two online meetings held on Friday that the union's council unanimously backed the deal. 
 Following the agreement, ""the MUT will now present the new sectoral agreement to its members for approval,"" a joint government-union statement said. 
 Details about the agreement remain a closely guarded secret and the deal will remain under lock and key: teachers who wish to know its terms before casting their vote will only be able to read the agreement at MUT offices, under supervision. 
  In a statement by MUT, it said members whose grades are included in the agreement and who are in employment with state or church schools are to register to participate in the online vote on the agreement.
 Members also have the opportunity to attend a face-to-face meeting, where MUT will present the agreement to its members. 
 The meeting will be held on Thursday May 30 at 4pm, and attendance is on a first come first served basis due to the capacity of the meeting venue. Another meeting is planned for Gozo. 
 The deadline to register is Wednesday May 29 at 9am.
 No date for a union member vote has been set yet. 
 Negotiations have been ongoing for months and reached a boiling point in November when a one-day strike was held. 
 Matters also came to a head earlier this month when MUT was considering resorting to industrial action again. 
 Then last Friday, the union issued an ultimatum giving the government a week to conclude the sectoral collective agreement for teachers of government and Church schools.
 Since then, there has been progress in negotiations, Education Minister Clifton Grima said. 
 On Friday morning, Grima said the MUT and the government had been meeting almost daily for the last week. 
 ""I have personally attended some of those meetings,"" he said. 
 Prime Minister Robert Abela said on Thursday that the government was proposing ""pay increases for teachers, which were never proposed before in collective agreement negotiations"". 
 Abela welcomed the news on X, formally known as Twitter.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/new-academic-year-focus-students-wellbeing-education-minister.1098553,"The new academic year will be more focused on students’ wellbeing than it has ever been, Education Minister Clifton Grima said on Wednesday. 
 Some 52,000 students returned to schools this week, along with some 11,200 educators. 
 Visiting a number of schools on Wednesday, Grima said it was time for students to once again embark on their education journey. 
 “More than ever before, this journey will be increasingly focused on the well-being of both students and educators,” he said. 
 “This is because we believe our education system must support people’s development while keeping their humanity at the heart of it all.” 
 Graham Sansone, head of the Union for Professional Educators, said the fact that the new collective agreement signed between the Education Ministry and the MUT had not yet been made public was giving rise to anomalies that were frustrating teachers. 
 “The discussion of these anomalies under lots of secrecy has given way to delays that see teachers failing to benefit from certain benefits they should benefit from as per the new agreement,” he said. 
 “School management is also being kept in the dark about special leave and allowance and who exactly is entitled to it.”
 Sansone also noted that while the complement of teachers has been satisfied accordingly, teachers have been given a maximum workload, particularly in middle and secondary schools.
 He also said it was positive to note that the Msida primary school had finally been completed as the model for all future schools, despite the project having been promised in 2013.
 In his address to teachers ahead of the start of the school year, Malta Union of Teachers President Marco Bonnici said the profession should prioritise love, reminding educators of the joy of loving their work, themselves, each other and their students. 
 He said it was a joy to meet educators who spoke passionately about their subject and about sharing their love with others.
 On the other hand, educators who suffered injustice often lost the love they had for teaching which weighed down their work
 Bonnici said the profession was blessed with altruistic people who gave all they had to serve others. However, they must also remember to love and take care of themselves as well as others, even if this required seeking professional help. 
 Professionals should also remember to love and respect each other and refrain from engaging in petty rivalries, jealousy, suspicion and other aspects that can harm workplaces and poison relationships, he said. 
 Ultimately, Bonnici said it was always important to remember the love teachers had for their students, which kept the profession going. 
 For most students, school was becoming the point of reference on which they modelled their behaviour, and therefore, educators should be sensitive towards the role they played in their pupils’ lives. 
 “Human contact is decreasing and some are not bothering to look for it,” Bonnici said. 
 “But we have an obligation to keep up human contact with our students and give them what no electronic equipment can give them: love.”

https://timesofmalta.com/article/swieqi-boosts-night-patrols-target-antisocial-behaviour.1096082,"The police have stepped up patrols in Swieqi following complaints from residents about vandalism by tourists and partygoers from nearby Paceville.
 A spokesperson said that both foot and Rapid Intervention Unit (RIU) patrols have been increased during the night, to curb antisocial behaviour.
 In the last few weeks, Swieqi residents have shared videos and photos on social media showing people smashing car mirrors, broken glass littering the streets and people defecating or urinating on pavements.
 Mayor Noel Muscat and deputy mayor Jordan Galea Pace have been calling for police patrols in Swieqi and for the police station to be opened at night.
 Opened in 2014, the station has been operating as a ‘Community Policing Office’ since August 2020, with a focus on deploying officers on the streets. 
  The police spokesperson said this strategy aligned “with public preference”. A national statistics office survey indicated that 80% of people prefer a visible police presence, while 20% prioritise having a nearby station “which, in this case, is located in Balluta Bay, St Julian’s”, the police said.
 Crimes like broken mirrors and smashed windows fall under the category of ‘damages’ and there have been 27 such reports up until June this year, including 18 cases of hit and run.
 Statistics covering the last 20 years show a peak of 107 damages in 2013 and a significant drop since 2019 when the police received 65 reports of damages, with the numbers falling in each subsequent year.
 It is not clear whether the drop in reports is partly due to the pandemic, which led to a decrease in tourist numbers, or if the station’s conversion to a policing office resulted in fewer reports.
 However, the police attribute significant improvements in crime prevention over the last two decades to the enhanced use of intelligence-led policing and crime data analysis, which have informed targeted policing strategies.
 The spokesperson added: “The substantial decrease in crime can also be attributed to improved cooperation between police departments, particularly the contributions of the Community Policing Team, which has been active in Swieqi since August 2020.”

https://timesofmalta.com/article/gaming-sector-generated-13-billion-last-year.1101229,"The gaming sector’s contribution to the economy grew to more than €1.3 billion last year while the number of new gaming licenses halved, according to an annual report from the industry watchdog.
 Drawing on National Statistics Office (NSO) figures, the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) said the Gross Value Added (GVA) of the sector grew by €55 million, a rise of 4%.
 GVA measures the economic value that each individual sector contributes to a country’s economy.
 But while the sector’s revenue increased, the number of new gaming licenses dropped by half while the number of terminated licenses almost doubled.
 While 31 new licenses were issued in 2022, last year this dropped to 15 as the number of licenses revoked by the MGA jumped from six to 11.
 The authority said it issued 28 warnings against gaming operators last year and almost €173,000 in administrative penalties, including one settlement of €66,500 from a company offering unlicensed gaming services.
 Meanwhile, administrative penalties issued by the Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit (FIAU) - which carried out almost half of the anti-money laundering and financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) checks on gaming operators - reached almost €1 million.
 
 The MGA said seven operators were discovered to be in breach of AML/CFT compliance following 28 interviews conducted by the authority and the financial intelligence agency.
 Inspections of land-based gaming establishments totalled more than 9,500 but fell by a fifth when compared to the year before, with the biggest drop seen in the number of inspections of controlled gaming premises hosting electronic gambling devices, such as slot machines.
 The MGA carried out 1,661 inspections of controlled gaming premises last year, a drop of 15% from the year before and the lowest number of inspections since 2021, when the authority inspected more than 2,200 such premises.
 Meanwhile, 49 websites were found to have “misleading references” to the MGA, with 23 failing to remove the references despite being notified by the authority, which reiterated it regularly published details of such websites to stop consumers falling for “scams”.
 Gaming establishments in Malta continued to see a rise in popularity last year, with Maltese casinos registering over 225,000 new players, an increase of more than 50,000 from the year before.
 Casinos were also visited more last year, with the number of visits to such establishments increasing by more than 130,000 to reach over 925,000.
 Turning to ‘responsible gaming’ – tasked with making sure players gamble for entertainment rather than as a source of income – the authority said it assisted almost 4,500 players last year who reached out for assistance, a drop of around 700 from the year before.
 
 The MGA said it carried out checks on 72 responsible gaming-themed websites and sent out 41 letters to operators identifying issues and areas they could improve.
 Meanwhile, the authority said it received 255 suspicious betting reports from operators and collaborated with law enforcement and sporting bodies on 34 requests for information related to “manipulation of sporting events or violations of sporting regulations.”
 It said it dealt with 45 requests for information from international organisations within the EU and 32 from outside the bloc while making a total of 42 international requests to other organisations.
 Citing an EY study, the authority said almost three-quarters of gaming operators expected to see their revenue increase next year, with more than half saying they expected employment to increase over the next two years.
 Gaming companies also expect to spend more on legal and professional services, technology, communications and marketing services, however.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/architecture-faculty-finds-lastminute-solution-avoid-teaching-tents.1097847,"A study space has been found for architecture students who were previously told they would have to carry out workshop sessions in a “marquee tent”.
 The faculty of architecture has secured a lease for two halls at Campus Hub in Msida, according to the dean, Marc Bonello.
 Students in architecture and civil engineering had raised concerns about the proposal to work in a tent, saying it would be hot in summer and cold in winter.
 The Campus Hub halls will be available at the start of the new academic year, which begins this month.
 “There will no longer be a need to provide a marquee tent for the master’s students, whose design project workshop sessions will be now held within the two spaces at the Campus Hub,” Bonello told Times of Malta.
 Around 50 students will be attending the design workshops at the new location. Undergraduate students are unaffected and will continue holding their workshop sessions within the faculty building.
 Design workshop sessions are typically held in a large studio space where students can freely interact with their tutors on design projects.
 Last month, master’s students in architecture and structural or civil engineering were told design workshop sessions would be held in a marquee tent in the campus courtyard.
 The alternative arrangement was proposed after the Sustainable Living Centre (SLC), the intended location for the workshops, was “not yet available” and a previous agreement to lease off-campus space from the Department of Visual Art had expired.
 Worried students feared a marquee tent would make it difficult for them to carry out their work due to a lack of amenities, such as power outlets and lighting.
 Previously, Bonello said the faculty was “exploring” the possibility of taking over some of the SLC Design Studios by the second semester, meaning students would move into the new studio by January.
 Located just a few minutes’ walk from the University, Campus Hub offers student accommodation, lecture rooms, underground parking and food outlets.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/government-considering-extending-free-childcare-nighttime.1096225,"The government is exploring the option of extending free childcare, for children under three, to nighttime hours to cater for shift workers who work during the night.
 The Foundation for Educational Services has issued a tender for a preliminary market consultation for the procurement of childcare services during weekdays between 6pm and 6am and on a 24-hour basis on weekends and public holidays.
 The service is required in two centres in Malta and one centre in Gozo. The service would have to respect the carer-to-child ratio of 1:6 children for toddlers aged 12 months to 36 months and 1:3 for babies between three months and 12 months. 
 A spokesperson for the education ministry said that the purpose of the tender is to gather insights for the potential extension of free childcare services during atypical hours to support shift workers. The aim is to understand the feasibility of this.
 “This initiative aligns with the electoral manifesto proposal, promising to extend free childcare during unconventional hours. Currently, the free childcare scheme, managed by Jobsplus, offers up to 200 hours monthly to all working parents, redeemable at both state and private childcare centres. 
 “The consultation aims to determine the availability and cost of these services during atypical hours, explore the willingness of private operators to provide this service if economically viable, and consider potential partnerships with the state for subsidised childcare,” the spokesperson said.
 Free childcare is currently available from three months to three years, with state-owned centres operating between 6am and 6pm or 7.30am to 4pm. Private centres have varied hours. 
 The limitation to children up to the age of three - for the purposes of the tender - is due to children enrolling in kindergarten at that age, the spokesperson said.
 “This initiative is a positive step towards supporting working parents by potentially expanding childcare options during essential hours,” he said.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/mcast-principal-confirms-contract-renewed-amid-reports-sacking.1094266,"MCAST principal Joachim James Calleja has confirmed his contract was not renewed by the Education Ministry, amid reports he was sacked on Friday.
 This comes as the post-secondary institution continues to be overshadowed by ongoing industrial action, with the college remaining locked in a dispute with the Malta Union of Teachers over a long-lapsed collective agreement. 
 Calleja told Times of Malta that some three weeks ago, the ministry informed him in writing that his contract, which was up for renewal, was not going to be renewed. 
 He said that since he turned 65, it was practice for his contract to be renewed on a yearly basis. Calleja is now 67 years old. 
 But Calleja insisted he was not made aware of any decision by the ministry to fire him and that he was set to complete his contract until the end of the academic year in August.
 ""Now all of a sudden they publish this, that I am fired because of the disputes. I have evidence of emails from students trying to help them. I have no problem with this, but I am not stifling the issue,"" Calleja said.
 ""I knew nothing about the decision, I was not informed about it,"" he continued.
 ""I received a call informing me about the media report, otherwise I knew nothing about it. I have nothing to do with the ongoing discussions. While I attend the discussions, this is between the union and the government.""
 Calleja said he has been in discussion on ways to mitigate the hardships students have been experiencing due to the ongoing dispute.
 Malta Today said on Friday that sources close to the institute said the ministry informed the MCAST board that Calleja's services ""were no longer required"".
 According to the report, a public call will be issued to find a replacement. 
 An MCAST representative echoed Calleja's comments, saying they found out about the decision to remove him from media reports. 
 Responding to questions, an Education Ministry spokesperson said the decision to remove Calleja was taken weeks ago and that there had ben communication between the Ministry and Calleja.
 “The ministry thanks professor Calleja, who is the longest principal who served in the MCAST management, and under whom progress has been made on various aspects related to the college,” the spokesperson said. 
 In a statement, the Nationalist Party accused Abela’s government of losing control over the situation at MCAST.
 “The responsibility in the negotiations falls on the shoulders of Prime Minister Robert Abela, who promises things but fails to deliver and Education Minister Clifton Grima, who failed to conclude talks with the MUT on the Collective Agreement two and a half years after it expired.”
 The statement, signed by PN education shadow minister Justin Schembri said the failure to conclude collective agreement talks is causing anxiety among thousands of MCAST students. 
 “As always, Robert Abela shrugs off his responsibilities and blames others by firing the MCAST principal when the academic year has only two weeks left.”
 Calleja was appointed principal and CEO of the Malta College of Arts, Science and Technology in June 2018. His position was reconfirmed back in 2021. He also served as Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Education and Employment from 2011 to 2013.
 The news of Calleja stepping down from this role comes as the institution is experiencing ongoing union directives.
 Last month, the Malta Union of Teachers ordered staff at MCAST not to disclose exam and assessment results to students after talks over the new collective agreement failed.
 MCAST students have raised their concerns about how the situation has impacted them negatively, as exams have been cancelled and their marks remain in limbo.
 On Thursday, students set up an online petition asking Prime Minister Robert Abela to intervene and help them get their marks and reschedule their exams.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/university-seeks-stop-dangerous-fuel-station-operating-land-owns.1095999,"The University of Malta is seeking an injunction against the owners of a fuel station, which it says operates on land it owns in flagrant breach of a stop order and poses a serious danger to nearby student facilities.
 The university authorities have already filed proceedings before the civil courts to evict the fuel station owners from the site facing Triq Mikiel Anton Vassalli Road, Msida.
 The Environment and Resources Authority (ERA) had, in June 2019, issued a stop order against JOEM Services Station Limited, the company running the business, to stop its storage and distribution operations that were taking place without the necessary permits.
 The way the station was being operated meant that its activities breached environmental laws and regulations on the control of emissions by volatile organic materials.
 The service station was not equipped with adequate structures and storage facilities, thus posing “great danger”. That was why the ERA issued the stop order, claimed the university in its application.
 The issue concerns two plots of land that became university property by means of two public deeds signed in March 1964 and September 1977.
 The transfer to the university followed an expropriation notice issued by the governor of Malta in 1961 so the property would be used for educational purposes. Then, in 1995, a fuel station on Regional Road, operated through C. Vella and Sons Limited, had to be relocated to make way for the Santa Venera tunnels project.
 That site on Regional Road was expropriated and the university was informed by the Roads Department that the Vella fuel station would be relocated to the two plots belonging to the university. Permits for the new service station were issued on July 11, 1996.
 However, unlike Vella, who was compensated for his expropriated land on Regional Road, the university never received any compensation. In fact, it never signed any form of contract to transfer the land and an attempt to regularise the situation in 1996 never led anywhere.
 In 2012, the service station was sold to JOEM. The university is arguing JOEM is operating the station on land it does not own and which is not being used for educational purposes as originally intended.
 Moreover, although the service station had been targeted by a stop order by ERA five years ago, it had still continued to operate. Such a “flagrant breach” was exposing the university, as owner of the two plots in question, to fines and damages and potential court action by ERA. That meant the university could be hit by daily maximum penalties of €150, leaving it with no option but to seek an injunction.
 The two requirements for such an injunction subsisted, argued the university’s lawyers. The institution had a prima facie interest as owner of the plots. There was also the risk of irremediable prejudice since the university gym and sports complex were close to the service station.
 Since the station owners were facing possible eviction, they would have no intention of addressing shortcomings in such manner as to avert the risk of some disaster, argued the university.
 Lawyers Carlos Bugeja and Jurgen Micallef signed the application.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/noneu-workers-applying-tourism-skills-pass-not-standard-its-boss.1096249,"Non-EU workers applying for a tourism skills pass to work in the hospitality sector are “not up to standard” and many fail the course, the head of the Institute of Tourism Studies said on Friday.
 Pierre Fenech told a conference on tourism that the performance of non-EU workers at tests needed to obtain the sills cards was “shocking”. 
 “Some [candidates] pass phase one of the test but a large number fail phase two,” he said.
 Fenech was referring to skills cards that cost non-EU workers applying for jobs within the tourism sector €474.
 To obtain it, candidates need to enrol for a course. While the first part of the course consists of a hospitality online course, for the second part they have to sit for an in-person test. 
 
 “The candidates are not up to standard. If I were running a hotel or catering establishment, and one of these people applied to work for me, they would not last two minutes,” he continued. 
 “The situation after COVID was desperate and we needed more human resources, however, we cannot continue like this, especially if we want to attract high-quality tourists.”
 When Times of Malta asked for more details about the applicants, Fenech said ITS would reveal the full figures in a press conference in the coming weeks 
 He clarified that applicants who were already working in Malta have already passed the first phase of the course.
 Originally due to be launched in January, the introduction of the pass had been postponed to May over concern by the  Malta Hotels and Restaurants Association.
 On Friday, hoteliers and employers said the course might push away workers from a sector that needed them.
 One employer said the questions were more adequate for management students rather than those applying for housekeeping and dishwashing jobs.
 “These workers are in a state of panic. I feel sorry for them as they cannot answer the questions,” she said. 
 Fenech said the course was “simple” and students could answer questions after spending a couple of hours following the course.

 The biggest group was made up of tourists aged up to 24 (39.9 per cent), followed by those in the 25-44 age bracket (33.0 per cent). In 2023 the biggest age group was between 25-44 years old while the two lower age groups were about equal in 2022.
 Italian, British, and French tourists made up 48.5 per cent of total arrivals.
 Total nights spent went up by 9.8 per cent when compared to July 2023, reaching almost 2.8 million nights. The largest share of guest nights (89.2 per cent) was spent in rented accommodation establishments .
 The average length of stay of total inbound tourists was  7.2 nights.
 Total tourist expenditure amounted to almost €403.9 million, an increase of 20.7 per cent over the corresponding month in 2023. The average expenditure per night was estimated at €145.2.
 The number of tourists visiting Gozo and Comino, including both same-day and overnight visitors, totalled 257,754, or 66.8 per cent of total tourists.
 The NSO said tourist arrivals in the first seven months of 2024 amounted to 1,976,457, an increase of 22.4 per cent over the same period in 2023. Total nights spent by inbound tourists went up by 14.3 per cent, surpassing 12.2 million nights.
 Total expenditure was estimated at €1.7 billion, 23.6 per cent higher than that recorded for the same period in 2023. Total expenditure per person increased to €858 from €849 for the corresponding period in 2023.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/tourism-skills-pass-tests-seeing-50-failure-rate.1098454,"Around half the candidates who sat for Skills Pass tests to work in the tourism and hospitality sector failed the exam process, according to data provided by the Institute of Tourism Studies.
 As of May, non-EU hotel, bar, and restaurant workers have been required to hold a skills card that costs €475 to work in the sector. 
 On Monday, the head of ITS, Pierre Fenech gave an overview of the candidates and results of the Skills Pass tests in the past three months.
  He told a press conference that up to last week, the biggest percentage of candidates who applied for the Skills Card were from Nepal (29%), followed by  India (25%). There were 9% from Colombia, 8% from Philippines and 4% from Pakistan. The rest came from various other countries. 
 44% of those who applied for the Skills Pass had been working in Malta for over a year. The rest are not currently working here.
 
 To obtain the pass, candidates must sit through two examinations. 
 Phase 1 consists of an English test, including ‘Essential English for hospitality’ and a ‘basic Maltese tourism product’ test, where the candidates are tested about Maltese history, culture, traditions and tourist attractions. 
 887 certificates have been issued so far for phase 1 and 885 candidates are sitting for their Phase 1 exam.
 In Phase 2, candidates must sit through interviews, either held virtually at ITS or in a centre in their home country. During the interview, the candidate must pass an English language test and practical skills assessments tailored to the candidate’s chosen job. 
 The exam is 30 minutes long, and the assessor is provided a set of questions at the beginning of the exam. Questions are chosen randomly by computer and candidates are questioned on the topics taught in Phase 1 and basic general questions.
 Candidates who have been living in Malta for more than one year are excluded from sitting for Phase 2.
 According to the data, 99% of candidates passed Phase 1, unlike the 50% of candidates who failed Phase 2. .
  When asked about the failure rate, Fenech said this was due to candidates not knowing the language or their chosen occupation well enough. 
 Overall, 1,233 Skills Pass certificates have been issued in the past three months. That includes certificates issued for candidates who only sat for Phase 1 and those who sat for both phases.  
 Fenech said that 6% of candidates were suspended after they were caught cheating. Some tried to do the test with someone else, looked up answers on their phone or blocked the camera monitoring them. They will need to reapply.
 When asked what feedback ITS has received, Fenech said candidates had commented positively on the Maltese Tourism Product course, and that many said they found it useful for living and working in Malta.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/malta-planning-regulate-airbnb-rentals-what-places-done.1101160,"This week marked Malta’s first foray into the struggle to rein in short-term tourist rentals, with the tourism authority hinting at plans that would require would-be tenants to seek approval from their condominium neighbours.
 Reactions to the news were predictably mixed, ranging from those arguing that the move will hurt homeowners and the housing market, to others saying the plans do not go far enough to solve the problems caused by short-term rentals.
 As Malta finally begins to grapple with the question of how to balance its tourism industry with the peace of mind of its residents, it would do well to look into how some of its European neighbours are trying to tackle the situation.
 MTA’s plans appear to be modelled on Turkey, which introduced new rules late last year in the hope of clamping down on unregulated rentals.
 The rules say that anybody thinking of renting out a property first needs to get unanimous approval from all the other apartment owners in their block before they are given a permit.
 Even if they are given a permit, they can only rent the property out for a maximum of 100 days in a year.
 They would also need to stick a sign at the property’s entrance, clearly marking it out as a rental property.
 And if other apartments in the block are already being used as short-term rentals, they may be out of luck entirely – only 25 per cent of apartments in buildings with more than three units can be used for tourist accommodation (unless a single person owns the entire block).
 Other countries have adopted altogether more draconian measures.
 Barcelona famously vowed to ban Airbnb altogether over the next five years, promising to stop renewing the licences for its 10,000 tourist apartments until there are none left in 2029.
 Several other Spanish tourism hotspots, including Mallorca and  Malaga, will be keeping a close eye on Barcelona, as their own residents push back against overtourism, with the latter now only issuing licences to properties that have their own separate street entrance.
 Florence, where every third home in the city centre is listed on Airbnb, is also following in Barcelona’s footsteps, banning all new listings altogether, with  Venice also likely to follow suit.
 Meanwhile, residents in a neighbourhood in Budapest recently voted to ban short-term rentals in the district from 2026, with the national government saying it is mulling a moratorium on all Airbnb licences while it gets its thoughts in order.
 But outright bans are notoriously difficult to implement.
 Berlin, the first European city to introduce a city-wide Airbnb ban back in 2016, had to row back on its plans just two years later, despite studies showing that the ban successfully cut down on tourism rentals and increased housing supply.
 In place of the ban, Berlin introduced a series of rules that allowed people to rent out their second property for up to 90 days in a year, upping fines for rule-breakers to a staggering €500,000.
 Portugal, too, reversed its plans to stop issuing licences for short-term rentals in many urban areas. The plans had been introduced after local communities piled pressure on authorities to tackle the issue but, just a few months (and one change in government) later, the rules were scrapped altogether, much to Airbnb’s delight.
 Several other cities and countries around the world have tiptoed their way around a blanket ban, instead implementing rules that make it increasingly difficult for landlords to list their property on Airbnb.
 Some have gone down the route of introducing upper limits on for how long a property can be rented out, ranging from just 30 days in a year in Amsterdam, to 90 days in  London and  Austria, and 120 days in Paris.
 Others have gone in the opposite direction, imposing a minimum rental period in a bid to effectively kill off short-term rentals.
 In Singapore, a property can now only be rented out for a minimum three-month period, effectively killing the short-term rental market entirely. The Hawaiian city of  Honolulu introduced a similar 90-day minimum rental period in its tourist hotspots.
 Some, such as New York, have adopted a more creative approach.
 The city introduced a controversial new law last year saying that a property can only be registered for rental if the owner physically shares the living quarters for the duration of the rent and, even then, to no more than two guests at any one time.
 But whether or not the rules have been successful in improving the city’s housing market remains up for debate. Critics say that although short-term rentals plummeted as soon as the rules were introduced, long-term rental prices continued to increase, with the city’s hotels licking their lips as they watch their profits rise.
 Meanwhile, Marseille’s mayor is pushing for laws which would oblige Airbnb landlords to buy another property in the city which they would then put up for long-term rental to increase housing supply in the city.
 How Malta will implement its own short-term rentals rules remains to be seen.
 Current rules state that anybody who wants to rent out their property as a holiday home needs to be licensed by the Malta Tourism Authority.
 Last summer, MTA had over 6,000 licensed properties on its books, a little over a fifth of them in Gozo.
 But MTA figures suggest that this is likely to increase, with over 1,100 new applications for licences received in the first eight months of 2024 alone, as many as in all of 2023.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/skills-pass-tax-credit-employers-want-retain-noneu-workers.1093166,"Tourism and hospitality employers can apply for a 'subsidy' that covers up to 50% of the fee linked to the Skills Pass card for non-EU workers. 
 Non-EU workers in hotels, bars, and restaurants need a skills card costing €475 to work in the tourism sector. As of this month, the Skills Pass is mandatory.
 The 'subsidy' scheme, called Skills Pass Support, was launched on Tuesday through a collaboration between Malta Enterprise and the Institute of Tourism Studies (ITS).
 The initiative is meant to make the Skills Pass more accessible to existing employees in the high-demand industry.
 The 'subsidy' will take the form of a tax credit for employers who apply for the card on behalf of their non-EU workers.
 “By covering part of the financial obligation associated with the Skills Pass, this scheme seeks to foster a more competent and competitive workforce, ultimately contributing to the overall growth, sustainability and quality of this key local industry,” Malta Enterprise and ITS said in a statement. 
 ITS and Malta Enterprise will host an information session about the scheme on June 4 at 10am.
 The session will provide insights into the application process, eligibility criteria and benefits of the scheme.
 Business owners and managers interested in attending the webinar can register by June 3.
 
 The pass, which was originally due for introduction in January, was postponed following concern by the  Malta Hotels and Restaurants Association.
 MHRA had said there was too little time for the industry to comply with the requirements.
 Meanwhile, according to a survey by the Gozo Tourism Association, two-thirds of Gozitan employers said they were not prepared to fork out the costs for the skills card. 
 Non-EU workers seeking jobs in the tourism and hospitality industry can apply for the mandatory online course in English language proficiency, customer care, hospitality and what Malta offers tourists. 
 It will be taught by two artificial intelligence personas called 'Ryan' and 'Clara' and will be needed for work in hotels, bars, restaurants, kitchen staff, housekeeping and front office posts.
 Candidates will also need to be approved by Jobsplus and the police before receiving a one-year work permit.
 By January 2025, any tourism and hospitality workers already working in Malta, and who want to renew their work permit will also need to apply for a skills pass.
 The scheme will then be rolled out to all EU and Maltese workers in the tourism and hospitality industry from January 2026.

 An alarming 85% of respondents believe that the general touristic offer in Gozo is not meeting guests' expectations due to various factors including excessive construction, lack of tranquillity, poor infrastructure, noise disturbances, and cleanliness issues. 
 56% said that their prices and rates remained unchanged compared to the previous year, with 57% also saying that they mostly depend on foreign visitors and 43% mainly Maltese customers.
 While 54% of respondents noted an increase in overall customer satisfaction compared to the same period last year, 93% of the survey participants reported an increase also in their operational costs. 
 The survey highlighted the primary challenges faced by establishments, with 56% citing increased competition, 44% pointing to the economic conditions, and 42% noting the lack of human resources. 
 When questioned about their pricing strategies, 47% of respondents stated that there was no change, while 40% reported the need to increase their prices due to rising costs. 
 Improved online reviews and feedback from clients were reported by 51% of the respondents when compared to the same period of last year, while 56% stated that there was no change in their marketing and promotional initiatives. 
 When questioned about the Skills Pass, a significant 78% of respondents indicated that they have not been affected by the Skills Pass initiative yet, although the other 22% reported a negative impact.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/charmaine-gauci-confirms-no-evidence-back-dog-cat-butcher-rumours.1094321,"Public health superintendent Charmaine Gauci said authorities found no evidence to corroborate claims that a Gozitan butcher was using dog and cat meat to produce Maltese sausage. 
 Gauci's statement, which was further corroborated by a statement from the Animal Welfare Ministry, confirms what Times of Malta reported on Friday.
 The public health chief was speaking after rumours about the butcher went viral, causing panic and disgust in equal measure. Some also claimed that people had fallen sick over the weekend after eating sausages from the butcher. 
 Various media outlets reported the claims and one NGO claimed on social media that the claims about the butcher were confirmed as ""true"".  
 But on Friday evening health authorities told Times of Malta they had no evidence to back the rumours, despite having inspected the butcher and probd the claims. 
 Speaking on Saturday on an RTK103 radio show, Gauci reiterated that.
 ""If there is any hint of information, we begin investigating,"" Gauci said. 
 The butcher shop in question was listed as no longer operating, but health authorities still visited the location more than once and at different times of the day to confirm. 
 Authorities also investigated claims that the sausages were being made at another location, Gauci said. 
 ""We went to several places that could be related to the owner of the butcher shop"". 
 In joint investigations involving the police and veterinary department, health authorities found no evidence that Maltese sausage was even being made, Gauci said. 
 Furthermore, there were no reports from any hospitals of food poisoning that could lead to the case. 
 In a separate statement, the agriculture ministry confirmed that no evidence was found to support the claims but added that investigations into the case are still ongoing. 
 ""This is what happens in every case related to food safety or animal abuse,"" the ministry said.  
 The veterinary health directorate and health authorities regularly conduct inspections to ensure food safety, the ministry said. 
 The agriculture ministry urged consumers to only buy from authorised establishments. 
 They said people should report illegalities but avoid making false reports.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/mandatory-unionisation-well-before-election.1098766,"The government plans to implement some form of mandatory union membership “well before” the end of its term in office, junior minister Andy Ellul said.
 The Labour Party proposed introducing the measure in its last general election manifesto, declaring it agrees with the principle of mandatory trade union membership and “will begin discussions with social partners about the implementation of this measure”.
  The parliamentary secretary for social dialogue said the government has indeed been discussing the matter with social partners.
 “We started from a point where some stakeholders didn’t even want to discuss the issue. We have made advances in the discussion since then,” Ellul said.
 The junior minister said he will announce the way forward in the coming days.
 Ellul said the government is looking at four models of ways to implement the measure and will discuss them in an “open manner” through a public consultation or some other way.
 The four models described by Ellul are: a system in which every employee is a union member; mandatory union membership only for low-wage earners; obliging third-country nationals to be in a trade union; a sectoral system where mandatory membership applies to just some industries.
 He said several organisations are on board, including the General Workers’ Union, UĦM Voice of the Workers, Moviment Graffitti,  Solidarjetà, and  Żminijietna.
 
 As to the timing when legislation on the issue will be enacted, Ellul said: “I think it will be much before the end of the legislature.”
 The General Workers’ Union has been among the most vocal supporters of introducing a mandatory union law, having floated the idea in their 2019 pre-budget document.
 The union had justified its proposal by saying it would boost the fight against precarious employment and exploitation in sectors where unionisation is very low or non-existent, such as construction and tourism.
 The UĦM called for mandatory union membership for low-income workers in spring 2022. 
 The Malta Employers’ Association, the Malta Chamber of Commerce and the Chamber of SMEs had jointly declared themselves against the proposal.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/marriott-upgrades-resort-spa-40m-investment.1092763,"The Marriott Hotel, overlooking Balluta Bay in St Julian's, has upgraded to a five-star resort and spa after a €40 million investment.
 The final phase of the project was the completion and opening of the Cala Lido, Bar & Restaurant, which, the hotel said, sets it apart by bringing ‘Wonderful Hospitality. Always,’ to every aspect of the guest experience.
 “The classification to Malta Marriott Resort & Spa presents an opportunity to invite new and loyal travellers of Marriott Bonvoy’s flagship hotel brand to embark on their next journey of relaxation and exploration. Furthermore, the launch of Cala Lido is designed to meet and exceed the evolving needs of multi-generational travellers, creating a space that is met by comfort, connection, and excitement"",  general manager Alex Incorvaja said.
 The €4M venue gives Malta Marriott an uplift in its leisure proposition through the introduction of an additional large outdoor pool and children’s splash pool, a restaurant & bar, expanded banqueting space, all set within lush, purposely landscaped gardens, complementing a roof-top pool and an indoor pool which forms part of its spa facility. 
  The conclusion of the project was celebrated on Monday with a reception attended by Prime Minister Robert Abela, who said this was another vote of confidence in Malta's tourism industry.
  He said such an investment was made possible because Malta's tourism sector had grown and seasonality had become something of the past.
 The prime minister was taken on a tour of the complex and met workers and the local and overseas management, including David Marriott, chairman of Mariott International.
 He promised the government's continued support for the tourism industry and further efforts to raise standards.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/new-airbnb-rules-affect-threequarters-malta-licenced-holiday-homes.1101286,"As many as three out of every four licenced holiday homes in Malta and Gozo could be impacted by new regulations for short-term lets, according to an exercise carried out by Times of Malta.
 The plans, floated by MTA CEO Carlo Micallef last week, would see landlords who rent out short-let apartments required to get the go-ahead from their condominium neighbours before being granted a licence.
  Landlords currently need a licence from MTA to rent out their property as a holiday home.
 According to MTA data, there were just over 6,000 licenced short-let holiday homes across the Maltese islands as of this summer, 4,625 in Malta and 1,379 in Gozo.
 Nevertheless, the true number of properties on the rental market is likely to be higher. A 2019 Central Bank study found that there were a little under 9,000 properties in Malta listed on Airbnb, going for an average of €80 per night.
 More recently a study commissioned by Malta’s hoteliers found that there were just over 10,000 properties listed on Airbnb and fellow short-let platform VRBO, suggesting that almost half of all holiday homes in Malta operate without a licence.
 An analysis of MTA’s licenced properties suggests that as many as three-quarters of them form part of an apartment block or condominium.
 The remaining quarter are mostly made up of farmhouses, villas and townhouses.
 Holiday homes in Malta, where more than four of every five short-lets are believed to be situated in an apartment block, would be particularly hard-hit.
 Those in Gozo, on the other hand, are less likely to bear the brunt of the plans, with fewer than half the holiday homes on the island believed to be apartments.
  The data shows that of Malta’s 6,004 licenced holiday homes, over three-quarters (4,625) are in Malta.
 Almost half, 1,920, can be found in just three of Malta’s tourist hotspots, namely Sliema, St Julian’s and St Paul’s Bay.
 Valletta is home to over 400 properties with an MTA licence, with Mellieħa, Swieqi and Marsascala also proving popular.
 Meanwhile, Xagħra’s 190 holiday homes tops Gozo’s list, with Għarb trailing closely behind.
 
 Only three towns across Malta and Gozo – Marsa, Mtarfa and Santa Luċija – remain untouched by the Airbnb phenomenon, without a single licenced holiday home.  
 In total, Malta’s licenced holiday homes provide almost 25,000 bed spaces. 
 Tourists staying in holiday homes are frequently blamed for a myriad of problems in tourist hotspots, from littering and excessive noise, to all manners of  unruly behaviour.
 Details on how Malta plans to manage the ever-increasing Airbnb rental market remain scarce.
 Robert Abela has seemingly ruled out a Barcelona-style blanket ban,  telling  Times of Malta that the government will protect the investment of anyone who bought a property to rent it out as a holiday home.
 Meanwhile, reactions to the proposal floated by Micallef were mixed, with estate agents describing them as misguided, while others say the proposal doesn’t go far enough.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/watch-this-crazy-we-cannot-continue-building-hotels-mhra-president.1096233,"Malta can no longer cope with ""excessive development of hotels"", the head of the Malta Hotels and Restaurants Association warned a tourism conference on Friday, describing the situation as ""crazy"".
 Tony Zahra was reacting to a comment that hotels needed more workers to cope with growing demand.
 “The whole of Malta is going up in flames because our power distribution system is not working,” Zahra said, referring to hours-long power cuts across Malta and Gozo in recent weeks.
 “We cannot go on building more hotels and more rooms. It’s crazy,” he said, as the audience remained silent during his intervention.
  Over the weekend, the MHRA already urged the government to stop encouraging the development of new hotel rooms and review rented accommodation and catering licensing protocols.
 The association warned that the rapid growth has led to overcrowded destinations and anti-social behaviour.
 If Malta continued building more hotels, the island would need more tourists and more arrivals. 
 “How will we handle it? Are we going to have more sewage in the sea? Are we going to have more foreign [workers]? Are we going to have to build another hospital?” Zahra reiterated on Friday.
 He said the government was “crazy” to expand the economy the way it did, however, businesses must now focus on improving the situation.
 “If we do not do that, there won’t be any industry left,” he said. 
 “How many times are we going to have people coming to Malta and say, ‘we cannot go swimming’,” he asked.
 Over the past weeks, tourists expressed their frustration over the two-month closure of the popular Balluta Bay, due to E-coli contamination.
 Zahra said the MHRA’s 2022 carrying capacity study, which claimed that Malta would need 4.7 million tourists to sustain its current occupancy availability, had been ignored. 
 “You know what people did with [the study]? They put it in the bin. If you read that report, you would see that we have reached overcapacity.”
 Addressing the conference earlier, Zahra said one of his main concerns was the country’s shift in the tourists it was attracting. 
 He said instead of seeing more families and elderly tourists coming to Malta, the airport arrivals were full of younger visitors.
 “This is a good thing, and we don’t mind it of course, but we must focus on the tourist profiles that will contribute the most to the economy,” he said. 
 ""We have the numbers and we cannot take more. If we take more tourists, we will have more problems than we already have.""
 Zahra also reacted to the decision by the popular ride-hailing platform Bolt decision to increase the fares as a result of the government's clampdown on work permits for third-country nationals. 
 “Mr Bolt, by going against our government (...) you are turning people into slaves,” he said. 
 “Bolt, please remember that you are a guest in Malta, and this is not our traditional way of doing business.”
 The Employment Minister Byron Camilleri has also warned Bolt to stop inflating prices in an attempt to import more workers. 
 According to data published at the conference, the second quarter saw an increase in tourist arrivals and their expenditure, when compared to the same months last year.
 Close to one million tourists arrived in Malta during these months, an increase of 152,000.
 They spent around €850 million, a 17 percent increase from the comparable period of 2023.
 When it comes to occupancy levels, four and five-star hotels saw a slight decrease over 2023.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/tourists-left-without-door-lock-sliema-hotel-room.1096981,"Two tourists were forced to find alternative accommodation after discovering a hole in the door to their Sliema hotel room where a lock should have been.
 Tourist Alan Brooks said the Windsor Hotel refused to refund the May booking and that its management repeatedly failed to show up to meetings about the issue.
 He said he reported the hotel to the Malta Tourism Authority (MTA) only to be told the authority was investigating but provided no further details.
 Calling the hotel a “total scam”, Brooks said he was shocked at the way the authority handled the case, saying “they couldn’t care in the slightest... They’ve failed in every way”.
 Meanwhile, the hotel manager said the floor Brooks and his partner stayed on was closed for refurbishment – including the fitting of new locks – and should not have been sold by the booking agent.
 He said the lock issue had been resolved “way back in May”, the month of the booking, and that he was “shocked” to hear of the incident.
 The manager added that he would have booked Brooks and his partner into an alternative hotel had he known in advance or been present when they arrived.
 A spokesperson for the tourism ministry said the MTA had “thoroughly investigated” the complaint but could not provide further details for legal reasons.
 The spokesperson said the ministry and the MTA believed the complaint had been “misrepresented”, but stressed they took such incidents seriously.
 Brooks and his partner travelled to Malta in May to visit his sister, who has lived in the country for around 10 years. He said he “loves Malta” and, although he had stayed with his sister in the past, he decided to book into a hotel to give her family more space.
  After reading positive reviews of the Sliema hotel, he and his partner decided to book a room for their week in Malta.
 However, after checking in, things took a turn for the worse.
 Upon getting to their room, Brooks and his partner found a gaping hole in their door where the lock should have been. And when they checked other doors on the same floor, it was the same story, he said.
 Brooks said he spoke to around 25 other people at the hotel stuck in the same situation – some, he said, did not even have a door to their room – describing the hotel lobby as being full of angry guests when he went to complain.
 “People said strangers were walking into their room in the middle of the night and some had things stolen... they wanted to leave but most couldn’t afford to book a new hotel,” he said.
 Asked about the general conditions at the hotel, he said “that was the bizarre thing; the rooms were fine”.
 Brooks and his partner left the hotel but kept returning daily after repeatedly being promised meetings with the manager to address the issue. But the manager never showed up, he said.
 Brooks showed Times of Malta a signed document appearing to show the hotel’s management company Sovereign Hotels Ltd promising to refund him for the booking – a refund Brooks said was later refused when requested by booking agent trip.com, which ended up refunding the couple instead.
 Speaking from his home in Dublin, Brooks said he was left feeling “angry and really sad” by his experience at the hotel. “We just hated that this would happen in Malta.”
 Times of Malta found numerous mentions of issues with door locks in online reviews about the Windsor Hotel posted on Google, TripAdvisor and Booking.com.
 The hotel manager said the floor the couple stayed on was closed due to refurbishment works, “but guests apparently went to the floor and used the rooms”.
 Asked about claims of people entering rooms at night and thefts of personal property, the manager reiterated the rooms “weren’t ready to accommodate guests”.
 Confirming the MTA had investigated the incident, he said the issue was resolved “way back in May” when “only a few rooms” did not have locks. He said all rooms were now fitted with “smart locks”.
 The manager added that despite parts of the hotel being closed for bookings due to the refurbishment, some third-party booking agents had allowed guests to book rooms anyway, leaving the hotel overbooked.
 Calling the idea of allocating rooms to guests without a lock “ridiculous”, he stressed the situation was not the fault of the hotel and that he would have found alternative accommodation – if necessary, at a different hotel – for those affected had he known in advance or been present when they checked in.
 He said he was “not aware” of the meetings to discuss the issue, stressing “of course I would have met the guests personally”.
 While still in Malta, Brooks complained to the MTA about his experience and asked the authority to “urgently intervene” describing the hotel as “woefully inadequate in terms of safety and security measures”.
 The authority responded that day, promising him they would investigate and informing him that, should he “wish to follow up on the case”, he should contact the MTA enforcement department.
 But, over the following couple of months, Brooks said he received no updates on his case, apart from repeatedly being told the authority was investigating.
 Two months after his original complaint, he finally received a response from the MTA saying it “together with its legal advisers has determined the best way forward and taken action as deemed necessary” but was provided with no further information.
 Commenting on the MTA’s response to his case, Brooks said the authority had “failed in every way; the regulator has a moral and legal responsibility to tourists in Malta – the buck stops with them”.
 But a tourism ministry spokesperson said the hotel management was “already implementing measures to address the concerns raised” when the MTA inspected the premises “immediately” after receiving Brooks’ complaint.
 He said the authority was “continuously monitoring the situation and will take further action if necessary”.
 Noting there were “discrepancies” between Brooks’ and the hotel’s version of events, the spokesperson said Brooks had been advised to seek a refund privately, noting the MTA “does not have jurisdiction in such matters”.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/gozo-tourism-association-stress-sustainability-2025-budget-proposals.1097318,"Policy in Gozo should be focused on keeping tourism levels on the sister island sustainable, the Gozo Tourism Association said in its 2025 budget proposals. 
 This comes after association members said they are seeing a drop in revenue despite an increase in tourists visiting Gozo. 
 “Gozo as a tourist destination has to be prepared to offer the advertised and marketed touristic product. The upkeep, cleanliness and organisation of Gozo as well as that of the touristic establishments are to reflect and match the expectations of the visitors to the Island. Furthermore, Gozo has to remain competitive in the product and services on offer, whilst ensuring that the visitors get the value for money spent,” they said. 
 To improve connectivity between Malta and Gozo, the group proposed a fourth ferry to replace the Nikolaus and the introduction of a smart ticketing system which will allow people to commute on different transport modes with a common ticket. 
 Discussing the environment, the association said it does not want Gozo to become a small Malta and therefore Malta’s planning policies are not necessarily appropriate to keep in Gozo. 
 To this end, they called for a new regional plan and planning policies specifically designed for Gozo to be preserved as an “island of villages”. 
 Incentives to purchase UCA property should be retained, they said, while those which benefit vernacular and post-war properties where buyers pledge to maintain the integrity of the property should be extended. 
 They also proposed a new fiscal incentive encouraging the restoration of traditional properties and converting them into boutique hotels. 
 A marine reserve should also be established around the Gozitan coast and this should be enforced similarly to the Ċirkewwa marine reserve. 
 In order to promote Gozo as a distinct destination, the GTA also made a series of proposals suggesting upgrades to the island’s tourism product. 
 ECO contribution collected from Gozitan accommodations should be reinvested in strategic upgrading, like kiting areas for the diving community. 
 VAT that is applied to tickets for shows, theatres, fairs amusement parks, concerts, museums and other similar events and facilities should be reduced from 18% to 7%, they said. 
 A new underground multi-level car park to alleviate the lack of parking spaces in Victoria is also needed, they said. 
 A tailor-made tourism investment support scheme should also be implemented to entice local entrepreneurs to upgrade their Gozitan establishments. 
 They also urged the authorities to amend the summer construction break and prohibit all excavation and demolition works from taking place within a 50-meter radius of any MTA-licensed premises. 
 The association also made other proposals aimed at improving marketing Gozo overseas and improving human resources challenges. 
 “Tourism on the Island region of Gozo is also facing several challenges. While all National and Regional policies and strategies are pointing and directing towards a distinct destination, focusing on particular niche markets based on the island’s unique selling propositions, the tourism sector is very much concerned that the overdevelopment of Gozo is jeopardising and lambasting the core of these tourism values, the GTA said in its conclusion. 
 “These overdevelopments, mostly for residential purposes are impacting negatively the character of our little island, a proposition on which the tourism sector has been for years marketing and promoting Gozo with, as well as creating trends which are not naturally touristic.”

https://timesofmalta.com/article/watchbritish-tourist-thanks-receptionist-saving-life-sliema-stay.1101122,"A tourist has credited the quick thinking of a night receptionist at a Sliema hotel with saving her life, enabling her to celebrate her 90th birthday this year.
 Ruth Burton, a British national, expressed heartfelt gratitude to John Cuschieri, 66, the night receptionist at the Preluna Hotel, for his swift actions when she suffered a heart attack in November last year.
 “It’s all thanks to John’s quick thinking that I am here again this November,” Burton said.
  Burton, who turned 90 in May, has been a loyal visitor to the Preluna since 2001. Every November, she travels to Malta to escape Lincolnshire’s cold winters and attend the Remembrance Sunday services. These trips are part of an annual tradition that holds sentimental value, rooted in the memory of her late husband, Alexander Burton, a Navy serviceman.
 However, last year’s visit took an unexpected turn.
 On the evening of November 14, following a game of Uno with her daughter Anne and son-in-law Peter, Burton began feeling unwell.
  “I went to bed and began to feel ill, and then I started to feel even worse,” she recounted.
 At around 2 am, feeling hot, sweaty, and experiencing pain in her shoulders, Burton called reception to request medical assistance.
 “Her voice was very emotional, and I could feel something was wrong,” Cuschieri said.
 Recognising the urgency, Cuschieri promptly arranged for another staff member to cover the front desk and rushed to her room. There, he found Burton shaking in bed and acted quickly to manage the situation.
 “I rushed back down and called the ambulance,” Cuschieri recalls. He also informed Burton’s family, who were staying at the same hotel, ensuring they could accompany her to the hospital.
 An ambulance arrived within minutes. Tests confirmed Burton was having a heart attack, but timely intervention saved her and eventually allowed her to recover.
 Cuschieri, who has worked at the Preluna Hotel for 46 years, says he was just doing his job. 
 “I am positive my colleagues would have done the same thing. I am not special,” he said, crediting only his ability to remain calm in emergencies.
 “This happens quite often – at least once every two months,” he said.
 But Burton remains deeply grateful for the receptionist’s quick thinking, which allowed her to continue her long-standing tradition of visiting Malta for Remembrance Sunday.
 The Preluna Hotel is a popular choice for older tourists during the winter months. Many, like Burton, consider it a second home. Burton and her late husband began visiting Malta each November to attend Remembrance Day services, forging a deep connection with the island.
 Although Alexander did not serve in Malta during his Navy career, he had stopped there during World War II. Over time, the couple developed a strong affection for the island, making it their sole holiday destination.
  “I don’t do any other holidays, just Malta. It feels like you come to live here for three to four weeks,” Burton said.
 Dressed in a vibrant red shirt, a poppy-print skirt and a Maltese cross necklace, Burton proudly displayed her husband’s medals. Since her husband’s passing in 2018, she has continued the tradition, often attending the commemorations with her daughter, son-in-law and grandson Steven who wear’s Alexander’s medals.
 
 For Cuschieri, the heart attack episode was all in a day’s work but over the last year kept thinking whatever had happened to her. 
 “It was like winning the lottery”, said Cuschieri when he saw Burton walking through the doors of the Sliema hotel.
 For Burton, his actions meant the world, and she repeatedly thanked him. A lifetime of memories on the island now includes the moment it gave her another chance at life.
 “I’ll keep coming back as long as I can, and even then, they might have to carry me out!” Burton said.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/jobsplus-directed-update-plans-employment-tcns-robert-abela.1095991,"The government has directed Jobsplus to review its plans on the employment of third-country nationals (TCNs) in Malta. 
 Speaking on One Radio on Sunday morning, Prime Minister Robert Abela said that the government will take all the decisions that are required in the interests of the country.
 “In a few weeks, following extensive consultation, we will have updated plans. These decisions will be ambitious rather than cosmetic because I believe that Malta should have only the required number of foreign workers,” Abela said.
 He highlighted the need for more health and care workers, while noting that the cab and food courier markets are saturated, necessitating strategic decisions.
 “It is clear that the country has enough foreign workers employed in these two sectors, and a decision to refuse new applications for work permits has already been made,” he added.
 The prime minister warned employment agencies that any attempts to circumvent the system would result in rejections.
 “We will not allow the many to suffer for the benefit of the few. While the few may make the most noise and apply more pressure, we know well what the needs of the many are and will act accordingly,” he stated.
 Last week, Times of Malta reported that hundreds of third-country nationals were having their work permit applications refused. 
 On Friday the government confirmed that new applications for cab drivers and food courier work permits by third-country nationals were being turned down due to market saturation.
 The prime minister assured that these decisions will not affect workers who are already legally employed. 
 “Through our actions, employers will be incentivised to treat their workers with dignity. The high turnover of workers is not in their interest because from now on they will not be able to replace their workers at will,” Abela explained.
 On the issue of enforcement regarding tables and chairs, the prime minister emphasised that coordination measures have been implemented between the competent authorities.
 An exercise is being conducted to establish which permits are in place, and where those permits are not observed, actions will be taken.
 “One must understand that every village has its character, and we need to preserve it. In each village, there are also different players, so we need to consult while presenting updated plans,” he said.
 In mid-July, the Lands Authority, the Planning Authority, the Malta Tourism Authority, and the Police took action to remove tables and chairs from St George’s Square in Victoria following months of protests by the archpriest of St George Parish.
 Similar enforcement action was carried out this week in Valletta.
 Abela made no mention in the interview on the ongoing controversy over whether Central Bank Governor Edward Scicluna should resign or be removed over his arraignment in connection with the Vitals hospitals case,

https://timesofmalta.com/article/almost-half-malta-private-holiday-rentals-operate-licence-mhra.1101103,"A significant proportion of private holiday rental accommodations in Malta is operating without the required licenses, according to new data published by the Malta Hotels and Restaurants Association.
 The data, presented as part of a carrying capacity study commissioned by the MHRA and conducted by Deloitte, highlights a disparity between licenced and unlicenced private holiday rentals.
 As of 2023, the Malta Tourism Authority issued 5,771 permits for these units, referred to as holiday-furnished premises.
 However, an analysis of the platforms Airbnb and VRBO found there are some 10,043 properties of this nature listed on the local market. 
 The study suggests that nearly half of private rental properties are unlicenced and operate outside the scope of regulatory oversight.
 The data also suggests that private holiday rentals continue to grow in popularity, with the sector accounting for just under a third of all tourist guest nights in Malta in 2023. 
 A slight jump in popularity has also been observed, with the sector climbing from 31.9% to 32.4% between 2019 and 2023. 
 However, the study also pointed out that private rentals appear to be heavily impacted by seasonality, with properties surging in the summer months but drastically reduced during the winter period. 
 Airbnb data shows that 6,000 entire homes are available for rent in summer, but only around 3,000 are available between January and March.
 The report says this allows operators to keep their occupancy levels comparable to collective accommodation - such as hotels - and redeploy the same properties for longer-term rental during the shoulder months. 
 “The trends observed suggest that this segment is being used opportunistically by individual property owners to maximise on the tourist segment in the summer peak by acting as a spillover to collective accommodation while exiting the market in the shoulder period,” the report said. 
 While the report also highlights a need for tighter regulations around the industry and level the playing field between short lets and traditional hotels, the findings come only days after the MTA announced its plans to introduce new restrictions on Airbnb rentals. 
 The proposed rules will require apartment owners who wish to rent out their property as an Airbnb to get the go-ahead of their condominium neighbours first. 
 Failure to do so will bar a landlord from being able to licence the property as a short-term rental.

 ""A small percentage of that sand turns to dust, which washes into the sea,"" he said.  “I want to emphasize that this is not contamination, and the water is still safe for swimming.”  
  St George's Bay was extended with imported sand in 2004 and the sand has been replenished every few years since by the Malta Tourism Authority.  
 “The sand is made from broken granite with similar characteristics to what was placed in the same beach in 2004, 2007, and 2015,” Bartolo said. The murky colour may remain for a few days until the sand settles. 
  “This phenomenon happens at every (sandy) beach, but natural sand has a lighter colour, so it is not as visible in the water,” Bartolo said.  
 Meanwhile, the Nationalist Party demanded an explanation on Tuesday over seawater contamination in various bays which, in some cases had stretched into weeks. 
 It pointed out that Balluta and St George's Bay were closed for weeks, and no explanation had been given about the cause. 
 The government, the PN said, needed to explain and rectify such problems without delay.
 The statement was signed by shadow tourism minister  Mario de Marco and shadow environment minister Rebekah Borg.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/putting-price-housewife.1093185,"Chef, cleaner, driver, tutor, mentor, manager. These are among the roles that stay-at-home parents fulfil daily as part of their unpaid work – that often comes with night shifts.
 Many would agree that their role is “priceless”. They are investing in the future generation. But can a price be put on this work? What is the cost of a stay-at-home parent?
 The subject came up last month when a woman was awarded almost €28,000 in compensation after doctors left a surgical gauze inside her abdomen following an intervention at Mater Dei Hospital 10 years ago.
 The court noted she was a housewife so there was no loss of employment but this did not mean that her role had no value. It pegged the repayment to the minimum wage.
 This is a common practice in Maltese courts. In 2012, a housewife who was seriously injured when the Save-On supermarket collapsed in Paola in 1990 was awarded €34,000 in damages. The court used the minimum wage as a yardstick.
 In 2010, a court ordered the payment of €69,000 in compensation to the husband and children of a 46-year-old housewife who was killed in a traffic accident 10 years before. The earnings of the woman, who also had a medical condition, were considered as equivalent to a minimum wage.
 But should the worth of a stay-at-home parent be calculated based on minimum wage? The first step is understanding what housework entails.
 “We wake up at work and sleep at work. The hours are long. It’s a lot of jobs rolled into one: cleaning, cooking, driving around and there is the mental juggling of the diverse work that is very draining,” said a woman who shelved her teaching career to focus on her four children.
 She feels there is “no genuine respect” for what stay-at-home parents do.
 “When I was working, I never had time for my children. I did not like that. The care we are giving our children is irreplaceable,” she said.
 Apart from the physical work, she added: “There is the burden of psychologically nurturing the children while you are, yourself, being challenged psychologically.”
 This burden has been named the “emotional labour”, or putting another’s feelings and desires before your own.
 Housework is defined as the unremunerated work of maintaining a household. The European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) lists the categories that involve shopping for groceries, household chores (cleaning, cooking, caring for dependent children and adults) and maintenance, financial and administrative matters and management and planning tasks.
 The next step is understanding who carries out these jobs. According to the Gender Equality Index 2023, issued by the EIGE last October, women across most EU countries still take on the bulk of the responsibilities at home.
 Data on women’s and men’s involvement in unpaid care in Malta show that more women (32%) than men (16%) engage in everyday caring for others. This includes caring for children and sick and elderly relatives. When it comes to cooking and housework activities, 78% of women and 63% of men report doing such tasks every day.
 So how can the value of housework be quantified? Economist Kirsten Cutajar Miller notes that measuring the economic value of these productive activities may be difficult as these are often undertaken outside the market and do not always have an assigned market value.
 The alternative to this assessment is to look at the value of wage rates used to derive these activities – the opportunity cost approach.
 “Using this approach, we look at the value the person undertaking the housework would have earned had they engaged in paid labour. However, this method may be flawed as it implies that the value of the housework changes with the person doing it. For example, the value of the housework undertaken by a high-income earner would be greater than that earned by a low-income earner,” she says.
 Cutajar Miller notes that the EIGE states that 91% of women with children spend at least an hour per day on housework, compared with 30% of men with children, while employed women spend about 2.3 hours daily on housework compared to 1.6 hours for employed men.
 “Using the average wage rate for employed women and men for Malta, which for Q4 2023 was €1,747 for women and €1,905 for men, we might value the monthly average value of housework at €753.40 and €571.5 for women and men, respectively. For a two-adult household (one woman, one man) this represents 46% of the average disposable household income,” she says.
 With this in mind, would it make sense to offer compensation to housewives?
 In 2016, experts forming the Parliamentary Committee for Family Affairs recommended that compensation should be given to housewives.
 This was shot down by experts who said it would backfire by discouraging women to enter the labour market – where they were needed. The Malta Employers’ Association said that implications for employers were that it could potentially lead to a fall in labour supply and increase government expenditure.
 In many cases, couples choose who, if anyone, will slow down on work to handle the children. They find a way to work it out. But issues crop up if the relationship breaks down. The person who slowed down their career ends up at a financial disadvantage.
 The courts in various countries are taking note of this. In Britain, a woman was awarded £400,000 (€470,000) for “sacrificing” her career as a solicitor so she could look after her two children. She won the compensation on top of an equal share of the family’s wealth after her divorce.
 A Chinese divorce court ordered a man to pay his wife the equivalent of $7,700 (€7,000) as compensation for housework during their five-year marriage.
 Financial compensation can help. But it is not necessarily the long-term solution to these situations.
 In a recent article, The Economist wrote: “Many women have no option but to leave the workforce when they start a family – the cost of childcare might outweigh the benefits of a second salary, particularly if working hours and earnings are reduced to accommodate family responsibilities. Legal and financial recognition of unpaid domestic work would change this calculation.
 “But it would be simpler (and fairer) to share domestic burdens more evenly. The division of housework is also unequal in the West, with women shouldering most domestic chores and childcare responsibilities. And family-leave policies are similarly disproportionate, with paternity leave being an average of just 1.7 weeks across the European Union’s 27 countries.”
 Malta is at the lower end of the spectrum. In August 2022, fathers got 10 days’ paternity leave on full pay as opposed to the previous one day. This contrasts to mothers who benefit from 18 weeks, 14 of which are paid.

 More than 35,000 fans packed Ta' Qali for Malta’s largest-ever paid concert.
 Sheeran opened the concert with songs like Castle on the Hill, and kept the crowd engaged with anthems like  Give Me Love.
 Between songs, he shared stories from his career, recalling his early days in English pubs to his global success.
  A standout moment came when Sheeran asked the audience to hold up their phones for A-Team, revealing he once believed it would be a one-hit wonder. He involved the crowd in many songs, performed classics like  Lego House, and featured violinist Alicia Enstrom on  Galway Girl.
 
 In a touching segment, Sheeran spoke about the death of his best friend in 2022, which inspired his song Eyes Closed.

 Top Oscars winner Oppenheimer was in fourth and  Napoleon, which was partly shot in Malta, placed ninth.
  Cinemas in Malta and Gozo screened 385 film titles and registered a total of 594,087 admissions. In 2022, cinemas in Malta and Gozo projected 376 different film titles and had a total of 460,244 admissions.
  There were six cinema establishments with a total of 23 screens and a seating capacity of 3,881 in 2023. Of these six cinemas, two were in Gozo.
 There was an average of 80 screenings per film. 
 Maltese productions, many of which belonged to the short films rather than the feature films category, had 4,884 admissions with a total gross box office of €20,457 in 143 screenings.
 On the other hand, foreign productions, which besides the traditional feature films also included event cinema, had 589,203 admissions with a total gross box office of €4,488,290 in 30,599 screenings.
 The majority of films shown in cinemas were rated as ‘12A’ or ‘15’ in terms of age classification. 28.1 per cent of the films projected in 2023 were rated ‘12A’, while 35.1 per cent were rated ‘15’. On the other hand, only seven per cent were rated ‘18’.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/keep-friendly-let-people-speak-mind-the-man-behind-expats-malta.1097732,"When the government announced back in 2020 that it was planning to send out €100 vouchers after the pandemic, not everyone was impressed.
 Days after the measure was announced, an EU national posted in the Facebook group Expats Malta that the vouchers would only be available to Maltese citizens, excluding non-Maltese residents who paid tax in Malta.
 The post was widely shared and, hours later, the government changed its position, announcing it would also send the vouchers out to non-Maltese residents.
 “Yes, we caused quite a big uproar on that one,” said Expats Malta administrator (‘admin’) Tom Erik Skjønsberg, pointing to the incident as one of the group’s biggest successes.
  The 48-year-old Norwegian joined the group shortly before moving to Malta from the UK – where he was also a member of an expats Facebook group – around six-and-a-half years ago and became a page admin soon after.
 He now lives in the south of Malta with his partner where he works as a customer experience manager for an online retail company based in the UK.
 Since joining, he has seen the group balloon from 60,000 members to more than 145,000, many of whom are likely to be familiar with Skjønsberg’s comments and posts providing advice, links to news articles and, often, a dose of humour.
 “Being the Scandinavian person I am, there’s a lot of sarcasm there... a bit of dark humour and trying to keep it at least a bit friendly – and let people speak their mind,” he said.
 Asked about his role, he said it was not only to provide information but also to “set the tone”, explaining that group members “quite often follow the tone that they see from the admin team”.
 While not the only admin in the group – it has three others, including its two founders – Skjønsberg describes himself as “the most active, the most visible one... I’m the one that’s quite outspoken”.
 Explaining his “motivation is basically to help people”, Skjønsberg said this sometimes extended outside of the group to private messages and, in some cases, in-person meetings.
 “I guess you could call it voluntary work; you help people who don’t necessarily know how things work with Identità, banks, the tax office. So, you give them a little bit of help.”
 Despite his active role in the group, however, Skjønsberg said it does “not take up as much time as many people seem to think”, explaining he checks it on his phone when he can – either while on a break at work or when he has spare time at home.
 Describing the volume of complaints in the group as going “in waves” over the years, Skjønsberg said he was seeing “a lot of complaints” at the moment.
 “As much as the Maltese might not want to hear it, there are a lot of things that could be improved in Malta. Then again, there are a lot of good things as well,” he said, adding he enjoyed life in Malta and intended to stay long term.
 Noting that locals tended to “take it personally” when complaints were voiced, Skjønsberg stressed they should not: “There are problems in every single country, [and] we are not complaining just to complain about Malta; it’s because we want to see things improve.”
  He said that, while the issues raised over the years had remained “very much the same”, policy changes – especially those affecting third-country nations – had given rise to new complaints.
 “The rental market has gone haywire in the years that I have been here; the prices for rentals have exploded and that’s causing issues for some people,” he said.
 Meanwhile, with salary increases “nowhere close to being in line with price [increases]”, conversations on the topic were “a lot hotter now than they were six years ago”.
 But with the group being a platform for people to speak their mind, has that opened the door to racism?
 “We do encounter it quite a bit, though it goes both ways; there are expats here who are quite racist towards the Maltese, and we don’t accept it either way,” he said, adding discrimination seemed to have worsened “in both camps”, however.
 “Overcrowding tends to create a bit of frustration and anger and Malta does have an overcrowding issue, so that has gotten worse.”
 Asked how he and the other admins balanced such concerns with freedom of speech, Skjønsberg explained that, while “the government can’t come after you for your thoughts and opinions, we are not required to give you a free platform”.
 “You can say whatever you want on your own personal profile, [but] you can’t say absolutely everything you want on our platform. We have rules that you need to follow.”
 Despite its name, Expats Malta now includes many Maltese among its members, something Skjønsberg thinks is a good thing: “From my standpoint, it’s a good thing to have local people there as well because they will have knowledge that us foreigners don’t.”
 Would the admins consider changing the name to reflect its broader appeal?
 “It’s had the same name since 2008, so I don’t see any reason to change it; it’s still focused on expats in Malta and that is still our main focus,” he said.
 “I hope that we can continue to be a driving force because we do have some momentum... It [the group] does actually have some influence, so I would like to see that continue and used for good causes.”

 The Gozitan singer delivered an electrifying opening performance during the second semi-final with her pop track Loop, but despite her energy, she failed to garner enough votes to qualify for Saturday's grand finale.
 In an Instagram video posted from her bed, a still sleepy Bonnici expressed gratitude for the experience, despite the disappointing outcome. 
 “I just woke up and I feel so grateful and thankful for everything,” she said. 
 “I just rewatched yesterday’s performance and I am so so happy and proud of the performance and the whole team behind this beautiful Eurovision journey.""
  She acknowledged how while Malta failed to make it through to the final, she repeated how the most important thing for the 25-year-old singer was that she delivered a performance she would be proud of.
 “A performance I can look back to in five, ten years, and just feel satisfied, and feel proud and have no regrets,"" she said.
 ""And that is the exact feeling I am feeling.""
 For weeks now, bookmakers have said the chances of the singer securing a spot in Saturday's showpiece were low. 
 Yet, the singer's morale remained high. 
 ""My heart is so full and I am rarely satisfied, I am very self-critical, but I looked back at the performance and said 'yea, we did that', and I am very happy and proud that as I team we achieved this,"" she continued. 
 She said that she has been bombarded with messages of support and love, which have left her ""lost for words"".
 She ended her video by saying she would also be sharing some ""exciting news"" later on today. 
 The last time Malta made it to the Eurovision final was in 2021 when Destiny Chukunyere sailed through the semi-final with her song Je Me Casse.
 Since then, both Emma Muscat and  The Busker failed to make it through.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/supporters-unite-rivals-revel-valletta-first-relegation-history.1091694,"Valletta football supporters and rivals united - for different reasons - on Sunday as the Lilywhites got relegated for the first time in the club's 120-year history following a defeat to Naxxar Lions.
 Some took to social media noting the relegation might serve as a humbling moment for the capital's team, known for their often overzealous celebrations when they clutch a Premier League title.
 Such parades along Valletta streets usually feature the traditional ‘funeral’ parade featuring caskets representing the other runner-up teams.
 Among others, social media user Simon Galea suggested Valletta supporters look towards rebuilding their team and learning to ""always respect their opponents at all times, including when their team is on top"".
 He warned the winning team should celebrate but never ""try bully or humiliate defeated opponents... remember what goes around comes around. Definitely, no defeated side - including Valletta - deserves to be treated the way Valletta supporters treated their opponents in the past,"" he said, also referring to the traditional 'funeral' parade.
 ""Hope this serves as a lesson,"" he added.
  Another football fan referred to past relegations of similarly ""big teams"" Ħamrun and Sliema.
 Xavier Saliba suggested that like these two teams, Valletta should consider what is best for the club and look ahead for a better future. Ħamrun have just been crowned Premier League champions, he added.
  Some supporters and rivals agreed on one thing: a relegation of the Valletta team was a loss for the island's upcoming football season.
 But others urged football fans not to downplay Naxxar's good team management and forward-thinking attitude. 
 Valletta Football Club announced the relegation with one line on Facebook: ""A heavy defeat to Naxxar confirms our relegation and sends us to play in the Challenge League next season"".
 Reacting to the statement, some said they were not surprised with the outcome at all, and had seen it coming for years.
 Gilmour Peplow suggested the relegation had been four years in the making as worthy people were given the side over the years. 
 ""And let's not start saying we'll be back next year... it will take us a while to recover from the damage we suffered,"" he said. 
 Yvette Jonathan Briffa argued the club was in a crisis and needed to go through a complete overhaul. 
 Another supporter, Steph Spiteri, said the pain will scar the club's fans.
  Similarly, Paola rivals Hibernians FC - the only Premier League team to have never been relegated - put up a one-liner on their Facebook page.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/can-maltese-shows-coax-children-away-youtube.1102174,"A new digital station with entertaining children’s programmes in Maltese has launched to help today’s youngsters learn their native language the way older generations learnt Italian when they were young – by watching TV.
 The project is based on teachers’ feedback from focus groups about children not knowing how to speak Maltese anymore – “it is like a foreign language to an alarming number of them”.
 So, Justin Farrugia and Steven Dalli from Sharp Shoot Media embarked on the creation of Perlina TV, which should be “as good and engaging as YouTube and Netflix, because the biggest culprit behind this problem is that kids only want to watch American content”.
 The producers ‒ one a father who has experienced this issue first-hand ‒ were motivated by the fact that “on a digital platform and in the television world, content for children in the Maltese language is lacking, especially for the very young”.
 Children are having to resort to English content and, as a result, are more familiar with English.
 Their concerns are echoed by teacher of Maltese Marlene Gravina, who agrees that many children are finding Maltese very difficult to learn.
 “It is a daily struggle as many students do not understand basic instructions, and it is also very difficult for them to, for example, follow and listen to a simple story in Maltese,” she acknowledged, adding that they need to be exposed to the language at home too.
 From her experience, Gravina maintains that exposure through TV programmes does work.
 “Like many people my age, when I was young, I used to watch Italian cartoons and series and now I can understand and speak the language quite well, even though I never studied it at school.
 “Personally, I am not a big fan of screentime – especially for children under three. However, the reality is that, nowadays, everybody watches television, and so long as the programmes have good Maltese, this could actually be very beneficial for them and another fun way to increase exposure,” Gravina said.
  Perlina TV, aimed at children under 10, is among other initiatives to tackle this problem.
 In September, the popular animated series Peppa Pig made its debut in homes – in Maltese – in collaboration with  Ċentru tal-Ilsien Malti. And in May 2023, the first children’s educational app entirely in Maltese, Nina u Ninu, was launched to help toddlers learn the language through monthly fun games on different subjects.
 This November, a new and free mobile app, Kuċċarina, also designed to make learning Maltese accessible and enjoyable, was launched.
 The minds behind these initiatives all speak about positive feedback, highlighting the need to save the Maltese language and keep it alive, digitally.
 This latest platform, also in collaboration with Ċentru tal-Ilsien Malti, Arts Council Malta and Rupture, a virtual production studio, will be accessible to the public as an online website and app from the App Store and Google Play.
 It was created in the context of an internet that has no audiovisual material in Maltese good enough to compete with the likes of YouTube and Netflix, which children watch nowadays.
 The aim of Perlina TV is to “immerse children in a colourful world, with heroes speaking in Maltese, legends about princesses, adventures with animals, information on new toys and magical stories,” the producers said.
 Living up to popular content on digital platforms like Netflix and Disney, and luring kids away from these, is a tall order and a big act to follow.
 But the production company behind Perlina TV has said “the focus will be on quality, so children will not feel they are seeing something inferior to what they are used to on foreign platforms”.
 The idea is to be exposed to the language while having fun, and for children to have a safe space to enjoy following audiovisual material while learning.
 Linu Perlinu will take children on an “educational and entertaining” journey around the islands to learn about their history and culture, while kids can follow the animated series of the book Id-Denfil.
 In Għidli li Trid, TV personality Keith Demicoli will connect with the platform through an “innovative” podcast with children – the first of its type in Malta – where young guests will have the opportunity to say what they feel about various topics.
 Viewers pay a subscription each month and have access to several shows and series, be it animated, with real actors, or even puppets, and Perlina TV also has an original soundtrack, sung by a 20-strong kids’ choir.
  On Facebook, the Perlina TV page already has 3.9K followers, while similar tried-and-tested projects are also experiencing success.
 The Maltese version of the globally loved Peppa Pig, which hit Maltese TV screens three months ago, has also received “fantastic feedback” from parents and educators.
 “They have said this has been the most effective form of interaction between kids and the Maltese language that they have seen in a long time,” said Media Exclusive director Ben Camille.
 He welcomed the launch of the new digital station with the same aim – “to save the Maltese language” – but questioned how local productions could compete with children’s “access to the world at the touch of a button”.
 Camille said this means that “if we want to produce something locally and want people to watch it, it has to be as good or better than the platforms that invest billions in kids’ entertainment.
 “How can a local production company convince kids to watch their new animation when competing with a brand like Peppa Pig, for example, whose sales amount to over €1.5 billion in just one year?
 “How can we compete with a brand that has its own line of toys, merchandise, accessories and theme parks. It is like trying to gather some of my friends to play a five-a-side football match vs a team of Real Madrid players. Very challenging!”
 The solution, for Camille, was collaboration: Media Exclusive invested private money, bought the rights of the franchise and used Maltese talent to “make it our own”.
 The results have been “phenomenal”, he claimed, but the challenges are there, the biggest struggle being funding.
 “Unfortunately, kids have no spending power, so income from advertising is not easy. Unless the government decides to support and invest in this, it will be hard to continue.”
 Speaking from his own experience as a father of three, Camille said the younger kids watched Peppa Pig in Maltese – “no questions asked”.
 However, if left too late, once they are over the age of three/four, then it becomes a challenge.
 Smartphone app Ninu u Nina has also been “exceptionally well-received” over the last 1.5 years, according to its founder Francesca Mifsud, who said the results highlighted a strong demand for quality Maltese-language educational content.
 The founder of Magic Games Factory, which created the app, she was aware that it was competing for children’s attention.
 Developing an app and games is a significant investment, especially for a small team, Mifsud said, adding that, despite limited resources, the results have been rewarding.
 The app works on tablets and mobile phones and can be downloaded at a cost, which some users did initially hesitate to pay for. However, she believed “our commitment to quality, safety and child-friendly design justifies the investment”.
 To ensure a distraction-free and secure environment for children, there are no adverts, while the app avoids overstimulating designs seen in some popular children’s content.
 Encouraging feedback from parents and educators has inspired Mifsud to develop a school-friendly version of Nina u Ninu and she is working on integrating its games and activities into classroom settings to make learning interactive, fun and Maltese-focused, offering a fresh take on circle time and other activities.
 “We are actively building the right infrastructure and exploring potential investment opportunities to scale our offerings and reach more children,” she said, adding that a Spotify channel is coming soon.
 Within less than three weeks of going public, over 700 people have downloaded the Kuċċarina app so far, said Dieter Pace, who created it to “preserve our beautiful language while helping locals, expats and kids embrace Maltese in a fun and engaging way”.
 While most users are from Malta, a significant number are from the US, Italy, UK and India.
 The app features four unique game modes that challenge users to master spelling and sentence structure, while a monthly leaderboard shows the top learners.
 Subscribers also unlock access to a special game mode where users can listen to real-life conversations and practise understanding spoken Maltese, while a list of songs and podcasts in Maltese offers another entertaining way to learn.
 “Kuċċarina is more than an app; it is my way of giving back to Malta by ensuring our language thrives for generations to come. I truly believe it can make a difference,” Pace said.
 One mother of three, Anjelica Camilleri de Marco, who shares these concerns about the Maltese language, said she fully supported increasing children’s exposure to it through Maltese TV programmes, and praised initiatives to this effect.
 “However, on their own, I feel this will have limited impact if our children rarely use the language in their daily lives,” she said.
 “The Maltese educational system needs to acknowledge the reality that, whether we agree with it or not, Maltese is not the primary language spoken at home for everyone,” Camilleri de Marco pointed out.
 In her view, children who do not consider Maltese their mother tongue would benefit from learning the language at a slower pace to ensure they develop a proper understanding and a genuine appreciation for it.
 “There is little value in having them read lengthy texts with complex vocabulary before they have a strong foundation in basic vocabulary and verb conjugation,” she said.
 “If we are to give Maltese the importance it truly deserves, we must ensure its use is encouraged across all segments of society, including the expat community, and that its teaching is adapted to meet diverse needs.”
 From a teacher’s perspective, Gravina maintains parents and primary caregivers need to make the effort to speak to their children in Maltese too.
 “I understand this is not always possible,” she acknowledged, listing other options to increase exposure.
 She suggested that when enrolling children in extracurricular activities, they should try to opt for sessions in Maltese.
 Parents could also allocate some designated time every day for a fun activity in Maltese, such as storytelling, outdoor play, or a craft, Gravina said, stressing on the importance of making learning the language fun and exciting, so children do not see it as a chore.
 “Most importantly, when it comes to Maltese, my main aim as an educator is to instil the love for our beautiful and so very precious language. When this happens, learning becomes much easier.
 “I strongly believe it is our duty as educators and parents to make sure future generations learn to love and treasure it too.”

https://timesofmalta.com/article/mediterrane-film-festival-39m-bill-essential-attract-investment.1094696,"This year’s Mediterrane film festival has cost the government €3.9 million, according to the film commissioner, who insists the hefty bill is value for money.
 The second edition of the event came to an end yesterday with the Golden Bee Awards at Manoel Island.
 In the past, the festival has been dogged by claims of lavish spending and a lack of transparency over how taxpayer’s money was being used.
 Asked about the cost of this year’s programme, film commissioner and head of Screen Malta Johann Grech said the bill is expected to come to €3.9 million – slightly higher than the €3.8 million spent in 2023.
 But he said the funding was an “essential means of attracting investment to the country and film decision-makers to the island”.
 He defended flying in actors and directors to take part in the eight-day festival, which includes film screenings, masterclasses and a black-tie award ceremony.
 “Instead of paying for billboards in Los Angeles like other jurisdictions do, we are inviting studio executives, film producers, directors, location scouts and actors to come to Malta and see first-hand what filming in Malta would actually be like,” he said.  
 “While in Malta, people in the film industry are taken to see potential locations for their upcoming projects and see the infrastructure available at hand.” 
 After last year’s festival, Times of Malta reported that international actors, film crew and journalists were flown to Malta in business-class seats and accommodated in five-star resorts.
 The cost of host British comedian David Walliams was not disclosed but he was paid €120,000 to host the Malta Film Awards in 2022, according to a freedom of information request.
 Grech pointed to a report by RSM Malta, a partnership of Certified Public Accountants, which concluded that the total direct and indirect economic impact of last year’s film festival was €7 million.
 He claimed it also led to media and social media coverage that would have cost €17 million had the government paid for it.  
  Grech said that another analysis report will be carried out this year but insisted the festival remains a necessary marketing tool to attract films to Malta in an industry that is increasingly competitive.  
 This year, a Pierce Brosnan boxing biopic was moved from Malta to Leeds after the British government offered an incentive similar to Malta’s 40 per cent cash rebate system. 
 Another production, a biblical-themed movie, was set to be shot in Malta but changed plans and went to Morocco instead.  
 But Grech said that a slow-down in the number of productions this year has more to do with last year’s actors’ strike and the knock-on scheduling conflicts of the talent involved.

 The highly awaited sequel to Ridley Scott’s Academy Award-winning epic debuted at Maltese cinemas on Friday, marking its first public screening locally.
 This premiere has sparked significant excitement, particularly among locals who contributed to the film's production.
 The film, which continues the legacy of the 2000 hit Gladiator, has been highly anticipated by fans worldwide. Its global release schedule has built up momentum, and Malta’s role in the production has been a particular point of pride for residents.
  Among the 50 attendees at Malta's first screening was Alfred Van Malkenhorst, a Dutch national who has lived in Malta for eight years and appeared as an extra in the movie.
 ""I was honoured to be part of it,"" he said, adding that he even managed to spot himself on screen. ""You see me in the monkey scene on the table with a gladiator,"" he explained, his excitement palpable.
 Van Molkonorst also noted that he recognized Maltese landscapes in the movie, particularly those on the island's outskirts, and he described the film as “amazing.”
 His friend Joseph Bucher was equally enthusiastic, calling the movie “a masterpiece” and urging viewers not to pay attention to some of the mixed reviews circulating online.
 “I think it’s just as good as the first one. Thumbs up for everyone involved,” he said, commending the work of the cast and crew.
 Mark John Galea, from Sliema, was captivated by the film’s immersive quality, likening the experience to “travelling back to the time of Rome.”
 He noted how distinctly Maltese locations, such as the landscape and the island’s unique architecture, were seamlessly integrated into the historical setting.
 
 “You could notice it was filmed in Malta, but it brought back the ancient times,” he said.
 Galea added that he plans to watch the movie again once it is available on DVD.
 Shiron Murphy attended the first screening hoping to catch a glimpse of her husband, an extra in the film.
 She described the film as, ""mindblowing""  and was impressed by the production’s visuals including the costumes, set, and action sequences.
 Although she didn’t manage to spot her husband this time, Murphy plans to watch the movie again. Having lived in Malta for eight years, she expressed a sense of pride in seeing the island so prominently featured on the big screen.
 
 For the Maltese audience, Gladiator II has delivered not only a cinematic spectacle but also a sense of pride in their country’s contributions to Hollywood.
 Many attendees at the first screening remarked on how the film showcased Malta’s unique landscapes and architecture, seamlessly blending them into its ancient Roman setting.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/watch-ghoulishly-good-haul-trickortreaters-hit-malta.1100381,"Hordes of ghosts, skeletons and vampires descended on several localities in Malta on Thursday night as children took to the streets for Halloween trick-or-treating.
 It was not only children that got into the spirit of the evening; homeowners armed with hefty supplies of sweets decked out their houses with lights and macabre decorations while parents accompanying trick-or-treaters also donned spooky costumes.
 Hundreds of children attended the annual celebration, turning up in droves to knock on doors in Pembroke, with Swieqi also seeing some trick-or-treating – though, according to residents, less than in previous years.
 “It’s moved to Pembroke now; that’s where the action is,” said one mother with her children at the park before an evening trick-or-treating.
  Small groups of children and parents could be seen walking around Swieqi which, while not without trick-or-treaters, was noticeably less busy than Pembroke.
 Nevertheless, Swieqi residents still seemed enthusiastic about Halloween, with Karl Galea saying he had decorated his house since he was a child but now was inspired by his own children’s enthusiasm.
 “They really look forward to Halloween; the trick-or-treating and the preparation of it all – it's fun, and in Swieqi we still try to keep it something for little kids,” he said.
 He added that while the family was stocked to dish out sweets to trick-or-treaters, they still liked to “scare them a bit as well in a fun way,” while his children Luigi, Eve and Ellie said it was one of their “favourite nights of the year.”
 The scene in Pembroke, however, was a different story altogether, with residential streets packed with large groups of children making the rounds on their quest for sugary treats.
 Six-year-old Thomas Ellul Sullivan said he was “super excited”, with his four-year-old sister Emma similarly “super-duper excited.”
  Father and “fallen astronaut” Boyan Popov said he wanted to dress up to inspire his kids not to be embarrassed by their own costumes – and for their future self-confidence: “When they grow up, no matter how old you are, you can look as cool as you want.”
 One house made quite the impression on youngsters, with tactically placed screens giving the impression of ghoulish hands pressed up against the window. One young boy could be heard saying, “I don’t want to knock; I don’t know what’s inside.”
 Rachel Degray said it was her and her husband James’ second year decking the house out for Halloween, noting that last year saw more than 300 children knock on their door.
 “We loved it and this year we wanted to do something bigger – it was my husband’s idea, we just love Halloween,” she said, adding that she had started buying sweets in August in preparation for tonight.
 Fellow homeowner Patricia Graham said it had taken two days to get her house ready, but it was “a lot of fun, and we get some amazingly lovely and polite children round here,” adding that instead of sweets, the family was stocked with around 1,000 balloons.
  Similar scenes were seen in other localities.
 ""I have lived in Iklin for 35 years and never saw so many children wearing spooky costumes going from one house to another,"" a resident of that locality said.
 Many were accompanied by parents who also got in the spirit and wore masks.
 Meanwhile, Żurrieq hosted a paid Halloween-themed street party in aid of Puttinu Cares, featuring live music, traditional games, emergency services demonstrations, a bouncy castle and street food.
 While Halloween has traditionally been seen as a foreign holiday, perhaps most closely associated with the United States, over the years its popularity has grown in Malta.
 But event organisers and academics say the celebrations are more than just a quest for chocolate.
 Earlier this week, Professor Valerie Visanich from the University of Malta’s Department of Sociology told Times of Malta Halloween functioned as a “cultural spectacle” and a light-hearted opportunity for  self-expression.
 Meanwhile, despite its links to Paganism – in particular, a Gaelic festival marking the beginning of winter – the Vatican insists Halloween actually has significant Catholic roots, with the name deriving from All Hallow’s Eve or Vigil of All Saints’ Day.
 Nonetheless, that did not stop the Gozo diocese last week calling on parishioners to refrain from decorating their homes with “symbols of death”, instead encouraging people to adorn their windows with statues of saints and parish emblems.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/son-boating-hit-run-victim-says-jason-azzopardi-reopened-wounds.1092138,"The son of a man killed in a boating hit and run has hit out at lawyer Jason Azzopardi for “reopening wounds” into his father’s death.  
 In a Facebook post on Monday, Azzopardi made a cryptic reference to Prime Minister Robert Abela and a hit and run at sea in Marsascala 12 years ago.
 “Prime (minister), how long will you hold onto the buoy? The truth of the inquiry will come out. This is not a hit and run at sea. Those from the south have not forgotten what happened in Marsascala in 2012,"" he wrote.  
 In August 2012, Charles Brignone was hit on the head by a propeller while snorkelling in Żonqor, Marsascala. The driver of the boat which killed the 44-year-old was never identified.  
  On Thursday, the victim's son said Azzopardi's post had re-opened questions on his father’s death that he had accepted he would never have an answer for.  
 “Almost 12- years, that’s how long it took for this wound to re-open for me, my mother Josianne Brignone and other family members regarding my father’s case,” Romario Brignone said.  
  Brignone said he personally messaged Azzopardi on whether he had more information to what he published on Facebook.  
 “His reply was simple that he does not know about my father’s case, and that he was not referring to that case but another one”.  
 Romario Brignone said there were no other cases of hit and run at sea in 2012 in Marsascala. 
 “If you tried to use my father’s case for ulterior motives or to send a message you must have no heart. Don’t throw a bomb like that after 12 years without considering anything. Shame. I cannot believe it,” he said.  
 Contacted for comment by Times of Malta, Azzopardi said he was not referring to that particular incident in his post but another.  
 Asked to specify which case he was referring to, Azzopardi would not say.  
 Brignone, an avid snorkeller, was on his annual family camping trip in Żonqor, limits of Marsascala, when he went snorkelling at about 10am on August 4, 2012.
 When he did not return by mid-afternoon his wife, Josianne, called for help and his body was found the following morning.   
 He suffered fatal head injuries after being struck by a boat propeller but investigators were unable to trace the boat involved.

 Earlier this week, hosts Jonathan Abel, JD Patrick and Martina Zammit announced their popular programme would come to an end on Friday after a 10-year run. 
 The trio said they had been looking forward to hosting the final show on Friday on what would have been the 54th birthday of their late mentor Terry Farrugia.
 But on Friday morning they announced on social media that instead of a final live episode, a pre-recorded show highlighting the best moments from their decade-long run would be aired.
 ""The fact that we won't be able to deliver this show one last time makes us incredibly sad,"" they said in a joint statement
  The hosts said they had planned a special three-hour programme filled with personal reflections and guest appearances.
 In response, Vibe FM released a statement denying the trio's claims that the live show was cancelled by the station, stating instead that the show could have gone ahead if the presenters had agreed to ""respectful conditions recommended by management.""
  The specifics of these conditions remain unclear.
 According to the latest Broadcasting Authority survey, the show was the country's second most popular radio programme.

  Colin Trevorrow, who directed the Malta-shot Jurassic World Dominion, and Connie Nielson, a leading actor in Gladiator, are also in Malta this week for the festival.  
 On Monday, Nielsen attended a screening of Gladiator at Fort St Elmo before sitting down for a Q&A session. 
 That event was among several free outdoor screenings being held this week.   
 This is the third year that Malta is hosting the film festival.  Malta organised the Valletta Film Festival before that. 
 The 2023 and 2022 editions were not without controversy.  
 Times of Malta reported last July how the Malta Film Commission paid “exorbitant” fees to fly dozens of renowned actors and film crew to Malta for the first edition of the film festival. The visitors were on business class seats, accommodated in lavish five-star resorts, and in some cases paid for visitors’ “plus one”. 
 Earlier this year, a freedom of information request by the Daphne Caruana Galizia Foundation revealed how the British comedian and author David Walliams was paid a whopping €120,000 to host the Malta Film Awards in January 2022. 
 A report tabled to parliament last February showed that the 2023 addition of the film awards cost taxpayers €3.8 million.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/mel-gibson-reportedly-working-great-siege-malta-limited-tv-series.1098646,"Mel Gibson has said he is working on a limited television series about the Great Siege of Malta. 
 Gibson, who was in Malta earlier this month discussing a potential film project, told the publication Movieweb.com that he was working on a project about the ""incredible story"" of the 1565 Ottoman siege of Malta. 
 The actor and director revealed the project after he was asked about his trip to Malta, where he met Prime Minister Robert Abela. 
 ""I'm also working on a TV limited series about the Siege of Malta, which is an incredible story, and there's only one place to film that, I mean, in Malta,"" Gibson told Movieweb.com.
 ""Because that's where it happened, at these fortresses where 700 knights defended Malta against an onslaught from the Turkish and Suleiman sent 40,000 men and ships and, wow, the knights won. So, it's a pretty crazy, great story.""
 When asked in what capacity he would be involved in the project, Gibson said he was uncertain at this point whether he would star in the show, but said he would like to produce it himself. 
 ""I'd like to be in it, but I don't know if I'll have the time, you know? But I certainly want to be like a producer of it, and I've worked with a very talented writer on the script, so it's going to be good for somebody. I know that it's a great story.""
 Gibson is currently filming the sequel to 2004's The Passion of the Christ, which he co-wrote, produced and directed.
 The new film Resurrection is expected to bring together several actors from the original cast of  The Passion of Christ, featuring Jim Caviezel and Francesco De Vito. Reports say the film will be shot in Israel, Morocco and Italy.

 The website has a black background with a blinking eye —  an image associated with the franchise — the hashtag #HeIsWatching and a countdown set to end on Monday.
 Several local influencers, including singers Matt Blxk and Gaia Cauchi, took to Instagram to post the image of the eye and quote the hashtag.
 The quote is synonymous with the international reality television franchise Big Brother, inspired by the character and symbol Big Brother from George Orwell’s dystopian novel Nineteen Eighty-Four, from where the slogan “Big Brother is watching you” originated.
  The show features contestants called 'housemates' who live together in a house isolated from the outside world and are continuously monitored during their stay by live television cameras and audio microphones. 
 Throughout the competition, contestants are voted out until only one remains and is crowned the winner, winning a cash prize. 
 The show was first broadcast in the Netherlands in 1999, and since 2023, there have been over 508 seasons of Big Brother in over 63 franchise countries and regions. 
 This will be the second TV reality franchise to hit the Maltese screens after the Maltese version of the ITV-hit show Love Island was broadcast for the first time last year. The popular TV dating show is now airing its second season.
 Last year's show was a huge success, with almost a third of the country - 160,000 people - tuning in to watch the first episode.

 The €16 million venue was opened in May and is due to host two Take That concerts in October.
 According to a planning application, which is awaiting recommendation, the three new exit routes are to improve the safety of users.
 It also seeks to link the stage area with the underground backstage area by stairs and lifts.
 So far, the concert area has four exits: three in the front and one by the side.
 Another three – two in the front and one by the side – will be added but will only be used in cases of emergencies, sources explained.
 This was a safety requirement that was demanded by the Civil Protection Department.
  The open-air concert area has not yet been used for large events and has an audience capacity of 17,000 people. 
 Forming part of the Ta’ Qali National Park, the concert project added 52,000 square metres to the national park.
 The site on which the park extension was carried out was previously home to a concrete factory and an illegal dumping site. The concert area had to be raised due to the heaps of rubble and debris left on the site by the factory.
 Plans for the site were first unveiled in 2019 and a public call was issued one year later.
 The project has underground dressing rooms and backstage facilities and a building with a clinic and security control room.
 The park area – which includes the concert zone – features green areas equivalent to 20 football grounds, a theatre, exhibition hall, a piazza, new walkways, fountains and parking for 500 cars.

 Prime Minister Robert Abela expressed his condolences, saying Pitrè had contributed a lot to contemporary art in Malta.
 ""His works can be found all over the world but he was always proud of Malta"" he said.
 They are also due to be displayed in Malta's new contemporary art museum MICAS in the coming weeks.
 ""Malta remains grateful for his artistic contribution,"" Abela said.

 While preparing for the opening ceremony in Paris last Friday, three of them found the time to tell Times of Malta about themselves and what they hope to achieve. Meet Beppe Grillo, Katryna Esposito and Kyle Micallef
 Athletics - Men’s 100m Preliminary Round
 
 Grillo's greatest achievement to date has been clocking a time of 10.23 seconds in the 100 metres at the Balkan Championships, where he also secured Malta’s first bronze medal in the event. That performance earned him a spot as Malta’s wild card in the athletics category for the Olympic Games.
 His says his goal at the Olympics is to surpass his personal best. Ideally, he hopes to reach the semi-finals, a feat he believes is within reach. Grillo transitioned from football to athletics at the age of 14. He describes himself as generally lazy, except when it comes to sports, acknowledging that laziness hinders progress in athletics.
 Judo - Women’s 48kg Preliminary Rounds
 
 Esposito began practising judo at the age of four, training under the guidance of her father to whom she obviously attributes her passion for the sport. Apart from being a member of Team Malta, Esposito's most notable achievements include winning bronze at the 2022 Commonwealth Games and securing silver at this year's Algiers Africa Open following a recovery from injury.
 Regarding her aspirations for the Olympics, Esposito stated: ""I want to leave the mat knowing I gave it my all."" When not competing or training, she says she enjoys being in touch with nature with her friends, family, and dogs. In addition to her accomplishments in judo, Esposito is also a skilled amateur baker.
 Swimming - Men’s 50m Freestyle Heats
 
 Micallef, an Australian native, aims to make himself, his family, and Malta proud at the Olympics by recording a satisfactory time in the 50m freestyle. His greatest achievement has been winning gold in the 50m freestyle and the 4x100 relay at the 2023 GSSE.
 ""I have been swimming since I was two months old,"" said Micallef, who started competing at age seven. A sports enthusiast, Micallef is excited to watch various events in person and meet athletes he has long admired.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/malta-elusive-olympic-dream.1096439,"Almost a century has passed since Malta’s first foray into the Olympic Games, when its nine-man waterpolo team reached the quarterfinals of the Amsterdam 1928 games.
 Ninety-six years later, this remains arguably the country’s most successful showing.
 Since then, over 100 athletes have represented Malta across a further 20 editions of the games, each of them aspiring to compete with the world’s best in their respective disciplines and, perhaps, bag a medal.
 All of them have returned empty-handed.
 There have been some respectable performances over the years, from shooter William Chetcuti’s near misses in 2004, 2008 and 2012, to windsurfer Peter Bonello’s ninth-placed finish in 1984.
 There have also been encouraging results in other competitions, not least last year’s Small Nations Games, where Malta topped the medal count.
 But Malta has largely looked on forlornly as several other world minnows took turns competing for silverware.
 This year, Julien Alfred swept to victory in the women’s 100-metre sprint to bag a first medal for Saint Lucia, population 180,000.
 Closer to home, San Marino – population 33,000, a touch fewer than St Paul’s Bay – took home three medals at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, while Liechtenstein’s 39,000 residents have collected a total of 10 medals over the years, albeit all of them in alpine skiing.
 Malta remains one of only eight European countries – and 74 around the world – to have never seen one of its athletes step triumphantly on an Olympic podium.
 Times of Malta spoke to former Olympians and sports educators to try and understand what is holding Maltese athletes back.
  Former Olympic runner Mario Bonello says that much of the problem boils down to starting athletes early.
 “Are we giving sport enough prominence at school?” he asks, rhetorically.
 “We need to widen participation at younger age levels. We don’t know what talent we have because many children don’t participate in sports in the first place,” he says.
 Bonello argues that given Malta’s small pool of children from which to choose, the country needs to up the ratio of children practising sports higher than that of other countries if it wants to start on an equal footing.
 Bonello says that this requires a root-and-branch rethink of attitudes towards sports in schools.
 Instead of sporadic physical education lessons spread throughout the week, he says, more schools should be looking to emulate the model adopted by the National Sports School to offer students the opportunity to dedicate an hour-and-a-half each day to sport.
 Popular sports broadcaster and educator George Micallef agrees that attitudes towards sport often hold Malta back.
 Micallef, a founder of the National Sports School, is today in charge of sports development and recruitment at the Mediterranean College of Sports, an independent school for children over the age of 11.
 “Malta lacks a proper sports culture that is ingrained from an early age,” Micallef says, pointing to what he perceives as shortcomings in athletes’ “performance lifestyle”, or their mindset and day-to-day habits.
 “Being an athlete is more than training and practising a sport, it’s also about sleeping habits, nutrition, perseverance and how you live your life.”
 
 The problem, Micallef believes, is ultimately cultural and stretches beyond just the realm of sports.
 “We tend to pamper youths, instead of encouraging them to stretch beyond their comfort zone and develop discipline, resilience and autonomy,” he says, arguing that these qualities are crucial for an athlete to deal with sporting setbacks.
 Just look at how many athletes move abroad to advance their sporting careers but don’t stick it out, returning home after just a few weeks or months, he says.
 That’s not to say that it all boils down to culture.
 Micallef believes that Malta still lags behind other countries when it comes to sports science, particularly in areas like sports psychology and data analysis.
 Ultimately, Micallef says, “Maltese athletes lack a holistic development that goes beyond purely technical training”.
 These shortcomings emerge in top-level competitions, where the finest of margins can sway a result, he argues.
 Bonello echoes these thoughts when asked whether Maltese athletes tend to underperform during the Olympics, compared to their usual standard.
 “Not everybody was born with the mentality required to win an Olympic medal,” he says, pointing out that pressures and expectations can sometimes play tricks on even the most technically gifted international athletes.
  Both Bonello and Micallef agree that support structures for Maltese athletes are sorely lacking, with athletes frequently finding themselves between a rock and a hard place when faced with crucial career decisions.
 Bonello recalls how, on several instances, athletes had to withdraw from prestigious international competitions because their dates clashed with exams or coursework.
 In one instance, he says, “an examiner accompanied the athlete abroad so the athlete could sit for an O-level exam during a competition”.
 Micallef believes that “we make children choose either education or sports, instead of helping them develop a dual career”. When push comes to shove, he says, many abandon their sporting dreams to focus on their academic careers.
 “Can you blame them? An athlete’s career is short and can be unsteady. We are losing so many young athletes in this way, especially girls.”
 Former runner Tanya Blake, who represented Malta in the Athens 2004 Olympics, certainly doesn’t think so.
 “I don’t agree that the Maltese athletes gave disappointing performances,” she says. “They all earned their right to be there and would have performed to the best of their ability on the day.”
 More broadly, she believes that Malta’s sporting performances are on the up. “I’ve really enjoyed seeing the progress that Maltese sport has made, especially in athletics,” she says.
 “Maltese athletes have shown that they can excel in the GSSE (small nations games), Mediterranean games and Commonwealth games.”
 But why not the Olympics? And why are we being outflanked by fellow European minnows?
 Part of the reason is experience, Bonello says.
 Athletes from the likes of San Marino (“more or less just another Italian town, at least geographically”) have far more opportunities to travel and train with top Italian athletes in their field and gain crucial competition experience, compared to their Maltese counterparts.
 Still, Bonello echoes Blake’s optimism over the upward trajectory of Malta’s sports, especially in light of what he describes as “unprecedented investment in athletics” over the past three years.
 Malta’s training facilities are “generally very good,” he says, and there have been moves to consolidate the progress through more professionalisation in the sector.
 The setting up of Malta’s first-ever national athletics team in 2020 is key to this, he believes. “This means that we now follow athletes throughout the year, not just at competition time,” he says.
 “We’ve started seeing some results in our strong performances at last year’s small nations games and in the recent European Team Championships.”
 But, he warns, this investment needs to be sustained over time, if we want to see the kind of improvements we expect.
 “And by sustaining the investment I don’t mean just throwing money at the problem, it’s about supporting new and emerging athletes to fulfil their potential.”

 Theuma will today be competing in the 50-metre freestyle. Flores will be competing in the 100m and 200m races, scheduled between September 1 and 2.
 Times of Malta met up with the two athletes a few days before they headed to Paris.
 Maja began training professionally just seven years ago, and since then she has participated in numerous para swimming competitions abroad.
 She recalled how although her parents were divers and her brother a water polo player she would play tennis and football at a young age and didn’t show much interest in swimming.
 However, once her brother began professional training in water polo things changed. She started training in 2015 aged 15 and years later has never looked back. 
 “When I’m in the water, I am in my zone, I forget what is happening around me and just focus on my strokes.”
 Training for the games has been challenging, as Theuma trains 11 times a week – nine swimming sessions and two strength sessions.
 “I train twice or three times a day, and right now, every millisecond counts,” she said.
 “The training has been tough in the past few weeks, but the outcome is rewarding. The main aim is to stay focused on myself and my target and not let anything get in the way of that.”
  When asked what her target was for her race, she smiled and said that was a secret.
 This is not the first time Theuma trained to qualify for the Paralympic Games. During the 2020 COVID lockdown, the young swimmer trained in the sea on her own, yet she failed to qualify for the Tokyo 2020 Games.
 “It was challenging, especially because the games were postponed by a year and I spent so much time training on my own. So when I received the news I was upset,” she said.
 “But I believe everything happens for a reason, and now I have more experience going to Paris. I feel more prepared than before.”
 Theuma is not the only athlete who had their eyes on Tokyo 2020.
 A ‘veteran’ in the sport, Antonio Flores had his eyes set on participating in the Tokyo 2020 Games, yet had to pull out at the last minute after injuring his Achilles tendon.
 “It was very difficult to know I qualified, and at the end of one training session I hurt my leg and then had to drop out,” he said.
 The 34-year-old had first competed in the Beijing Paralympic Games with his club foot.
 “I can say that during that time, I stopped speaking to the athletics team and I stopped watching the sport. I just couldn’t do it at the time.”
 Once the Tokyo Games had passed, he began to heal mentally and began his journey to recovery.
 Now, he feels more prepared than ever to compete in Paris.
  “For Beijing, I was just 18, I could say I was immature and just four years in the sport. Now, I have grown, I know my body more and I am more aware of how to move with my blade. During this time in  Paris, I will appreciate the sport more.”
 The 34-year-old had first competed in the Beijing Paralympic Games with his club foot. His career took a halt when he began to feel pain in his right leg. The pain became unbearable, despite trying to run with a brace.
 “I had two options – either reduce my mobility or amputate my leg and lead more or less a normal life.”
 Flores became an amputee, and with strength and determination learnt how to walk, jog, run and sprint once again.
 “While running with a foot problem is very challenging, it is also the most rewarding,” he said.
 “When you are running, it’s not just an activity, it is spiritual. That moment you are in the air and your foot is about to touch the ground feels like you are flying. It is very difficult to explain the feeling.”
 He believes what he has achieved is a result of discipline and patience.
 “You might not see results overnight, but with discipline and patience, you will get to your goal. When I started running with a running blade, I would fall and struggle, but I always got back up.”
 When asked what his goals are for Paris, he said he did not want to put too much pressure on himself, but wanted to enjoy the games.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/works-35m-cycle-network-begin-coming-months.1101360,"Works on the first phase of a €35 million national cycle network are set to begin in the “coming months” after a tender for the project was finally awarded.
 Once completed, the first part of the cycle network project (C-SAM) will enhance and establish new cycling and pedestrian routes connecting Msida, Pietà, Blata l-Bajda, Valletta and the Valletta waterfront.
 
 “Infrastructure Malta announced its recommendation to award a contract to RM Construction Ltd. The proposed contract is valued at €7,433,721.43,” a spokesperson for the government agency said.
 Times of Malta understands that the appeal period for rival bidders has ended, and RM’s bid is currently undergoing compliance checks. Works should begin once that is complete.
 “Works should begin in the coming months,” the Infrastructure Malta spokesperson said.
 The first phase of C-SAM was originally given an end-of-2024 deadline.
 In October 2022, Infrastructure Malta, under the direction of then transport minister Aaron Farrugia, announced a plan to build between 50 and 60 kilometres of cycling routes over five years.
 In April 2023, the Transport Ministry said that the first phase of the bicycle network project, C-SAM, would focus on the Grand Harbour area and should be completed by the end of 2024.
 Although a tender for the Grand Harbour project was issued later in 2023, sources indicated that it was not awarded due to a lack of compliant bidders.
 The agency issued another tender last June and applications closed in July.

 The incident took place at around 10am on Triq l-Għenba in Attard, when the cyclist, an Attard resident, collided with a parked Toyota Aygo.
 She was treated at the scene before being taken to Mater Dei hospital, where her injuries were certified as serious. 
 A police investigation into the incident is ongoing.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/qala-saints-fc-two-players-charged-match-fixing.1093974,"A Gozitan football club and two players are to be charged with match-fixing by the Malta FA Integrity Unit.
 Qala Saints FC and its player Manuel Xerri, along with Żebbuġ Rovers goalkeeper Leonard Camilleri will be suspended by the MFA after being summoned to appear at a hearing about the incident. 
 It follows an investigation into the top-of-the-table clash in the GFA Division One between Nadur Youngsters and Qala Saints at the Gozo Stadium which ended in a 1-1 draw.
 MFA Integrity Officer Herman Mula confirmed that the “approach” happened before the direct clash between the two clubs on March 17. The Malta FA accused the club and the two footballers of attempting to bribe the Nadur Youngsters player.
 Nadur Youngsters went on to win the GFA Division One title when they finished two points clear of Qala Saints at the top of the standings.
 Mula said Xerri and Camilleri will be facing match-fixing charges while Qala Saints have also been accused as the approach was allegedly masterminded by one of their players in a bid to help his own club.
 Xerri, Camilleri and the club Qala Saints are expected to appear in front of the Malta FA’s Board Control Disciplinary and Ethics Committee on Wednesday to respond to the accusations.
 The charges followed an investigation conducted by both the Malta Police Force and the Malta FA Integrity Office.
 “I can confirm that the Malta FA Integrity Unit has just issued charges against two players, Leonard Camilleri and Manuel Xerri, as well as Division One side Qala Saints, which club is carried in liability by their player’s actions following an attempt to bribe a Nadur Youngsters player,” Mula said.
 “As part of the usual proceedings in such cases, both Camilleri and Xerri have been temporarily suspended from any football activity until the hearing is heard in front of the MFA board.”
 The MFA Integrity Officer said Xerri and Camilleri are also expected to face bribery charges in front of the Criminal Courts in the coming weeks and could face a prison sentence if found guilty under the Law of Manipulation of Sport.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/shooters-escorted-off-km-malta-flight-pilot-rejects-airguns-hold.1092744,"Four Maltese shooters were escorted off a KM Malta Airlines flight on Sunday after the pilot refused to carry their airguns, despite them having the necessary paperwork.
 The members of Malta Allied Airgunners Club (MAAC) were on board the plane to travel home at 8.30pm after taking part in a competition in Belgium when their problems began. 
 “Over the years, we have travelled with AirMalta (former national airline) for different shooting competitions, and this is the first time we ever had issues,” Natal Falzon, one of the shooters, told Times of Malta. 
 “This happened because the pilot refused to have weapons on his plane, despite us having all the paperwork and permits in order. He said ‘his plane, his call, no guns’.”
 The shooters had faced no problems when they flew from Malta to Brussels for the Mamba Target Open in Grupont.
 An airgun fires pellets using compressed air and does not operate with gunpowder. Falzon explained how before every flight, the group decompressed the pressure of the gun before packing it and the pellets in their suitcase to be placed in the hold luggage.  
 They had taken their seats on the flight when the commotion began.
  “We had all the paperwork on our end, yet once the pilot found out weapons were going to be placed on the plane, he decided he did not want our weapons on his plane,” he explained. 
 The ground crew and airport security were also roped into the incident after the pilot requested a specific document from the Brussels Airport to show such weapons were allowed on the plane. Falzon said the security and ground crew staff said they did not know of such a document.
 Despite this, the pilot insisted that no weapons were to board the plane. 
 “We told him that we had everything in order, we had all the police permits, all the forms necessary and followed the necessary procedures to take our airguns on the plane,” he said, yet the pilot did not want the weapons on the plane. 
  Falzon said the Malta Allied Airgunners Club has travelled numerous times with the national airline to compete in competitions abroad in countries like Bulgaria and the UK.
 ""The pilot told us to get off the plane, but we said we were not planning to do so, we had paid and booked everything six months in advance,"" he said.
 By then security and police staff arrived on the plane, and Falzon said the pilot reported him and his colleagues to the police.
 By the end, the group got off the plane as they could not leave their airguns unattended. 
 ""When we got off the plane, everyone was very helpful to us, the ground crew, the consultant, who was on the phone with us for over 30 minutes trying to solve the situation,"" he said.
 He said KM Malta Airlines also reached out to the group, covering their expenses for a flight back to Malta on Monday evening. 
 ""Everyone went out of their way to help us, the situation was created by one man, who was anti-gun and decided he did not want weapons on his plane,"" he said. 
 In a one-line response, KM Malta Airlines said: ""All was sorted out with the passengers early this morning.""

https://timesofmalta.com/article/hamrun-spartans-win-premier-league-title-crush-rivals-floriana-50.1091654,"Ħamrun Spartans produced a rampant performance to crush Floriana 5-0 and retain their status as Malta champions for a second successive season.
  The Spartans, under the charge of Luciano Zauri, needed a win to assure themselves of mathematical certainty to secure the Premier League title and the Reds turned on the style with a rampant display.
  Playing in front of the biggest crowd of the season, where over 8,000 fans thronged the National Stadium, Ħamrun Spartans took the lead after eight minutes when Seth Paintsil headed the ball home from a Ryan Camenzuli’s cross.
  Floriana looked rattled and Paintsil went on to bag his hat-trick when he was first to the rebound from Luke Montebello’s cross to fire home and then he was played in by Jonny to slide the ball into the net.
 Elionay killed off the match as a contest with a fourth goal in first-half stoppage time.
  Paintsil was not finished yet and midway through the second half he grabbed his fifth goal to kickstart the Ħamrun Spartans title party.
 By virtue of their win, the Spartans took an unassailable four-point lead at the top and are now ensured of their tenth league title in their club history.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/marsa-racetrack-danger-horses-say-horse-owners.1097769,"The Marsa horse racing track is in “the worst state ever” and poses a danger to horses, according to their owners, five years after a pledge to transform the venue into a state-of-the-art equestrian centre. 
 Gravel, rather than pure sand, has been spread on the racetrack, leading to concerns about injuries to horses due to compete in just a few weeks.
 Other facilities, including the paddock and the old racecourse cannot be used because they are full of rubble.
  The track, managed by Equidrome Malta and run by Malta Race Track Limited, also lacks essential infrastructure, horse owners say. 
 There are no working generators, meaning night-time races are at risk of being plunged into darkness should there be a power outage. Damaged canopies, supposed to shelter horses from the sun, are also on the brink of collapse. 
 Times of Malta visited the venue after being contacted by furious horse owners, frustrated over the dilapidated state of the track that has been hosting racing since 1869. 
  The conditions come despite promises made five years ago by the government and Malta Racing Club for a €28 million project to transform the area into an international equestrian sport centre by 2023.
 Horse owners said they were told in June that the summer championships could not be held this year to allow work to begin on the regeneration project.
 “We love to race but we still accepted their decision to take a few weeks’ break, particularly given the very hot climatic conditions we had this summer,” a horse racing owner said.
 “But unfortunately, no work has been done to improve the facilities. The facilities are at their worse state ever and I am seriously fearing the wellbeing of my horse.”
  The owner added that the paddock had been closed off after being filled with rubble. 
 “This means that during the 20-minute period between one race and another you have 16 horses which do not have any area to wait before the start of their race.” 
 He said a canopy to protect drivers and horses from the rain and sun has been severely damaged and there is danger that it could collapse and injure someone.
 The horse racing owners complained that sand was brought in to cover the racetrack a few weeks ago but “they brought the wrong kind of sand as it’s full of gravel.”
 Another owner claimed that when the mistake was realised, fresh sand was ordered but it was “mixed with the wrong one and put on the racing track with the result that horses will race on a surface full of gravel with a major risk of injury as could end up with a stone in their nails posing serious consequences.”
 The absence of a backup power source is another pressing issue. 
 “If there is a power cut at the Marsa racing track during a race at night, drivers and horses are put at a major risk of getting seriously hurt,” the owners said.
 The old racecourse situated behind the racetrack is also unavailable for drivers and owners as tons of rubble have been dumped along the course, leaving no space for drivers to run their horses.
 A news conference in Castille in 2019 had promised that the consortium would transform the horse racing track into an international sport centre within four years.
 The project was not just to regenerate the racetrack and the existing polo pitch but was also to include facilities for different equestrian sports including flat racing, horse shows and events. Modern stabling facilities were also promised, along with training and rehab facilities that would ensure the welfare and well-being of the horses.
 There were also plans for the stables of Sheikh al Makhtum of Dubai to organise races for horses brought over from Dubai to run in Malta.
  Horse racing owners also complained that they have little incentive to be successful in the local scene as the prize money on offer is exceptionally low compared to foreign competitions.
 
 “In Malta if you win a premier class race, which is the highest division, you pocket €600. In France, if you win a low-key race you take home €7,000. Of more concern is that in Malta you wait for months to be given the money you have won.
 “Despite all this we are still driven by our passion for the sport, and we still invest in buying new horses even though we have very little return,” one owner said.
 Times of Malta has sent questions to the track management and the sports ministry.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/sasha-gatt-devastating-covid-diagnosis.1096127,"Sasha Gatt realised ""something was wrong"" moments before a race she had spent three years preparing for, the ""devastated"" two-time Olympian said on Wednesday.
 The Maltese swimmer was speaking to Times of Malta hours after testing positive for COVID-19 at the Paris Olympics.
 ""I was devastated because I've been training for three years, including six months in Romania away from family and friends,"" the 19-year-old said.
 Gatt is one of five athletes representing Malta in the Olympic Games.
 Lining up in the first heat of the race, Gatt was up against two other swimmers, namely Singapore’s Ching Hwenn Gan and Chile’s Kristel Kobrich. 
 Gan dominated the race from start to finish as she cruised home in 16.10.13, while Gatt finished a distant third with a time of 17.00.54.
 Gatt's time was over 22 seconds slower than her national record of 16.38.75, which she set in Rome in 2021. Minutes after competing in the 1,500m freestyle heats at the Paris La Defense Arena on Tuesday, she tested positive for COVID-19.
 Despite the race's results and her COVID diagnosis, Gatt said she was ""over the moon"" about the experience and the opportunity to be among the world's best athletes.
 ""I will now focus on my health, get back into training and support Team Malta for the rest of the games.""
 Gatt recalled how moments before she dived into the pool she started to feel unwell.
 She found it ""harder to breathe than usual"" while warming-up for the race.
 “It felt like my throat was closing up, however, I just thought it was the excitement of the race and I just decided to ignore it.”
 Gatt recalled her heart beating ""super fast"" and feeling overwhelmed with excitement.
 ""Hearing the massive crowd cheering gave me goosebumps, and filled me with encouragement to give the best performance of my life.
 ""The moment the arena went quiet, I knew it was time to go and all I thought about was just me, my lane and the race ahead of me.""
 When the race kicked off, adrenaline took over, but after 400m, she found it more difficult to breathe.
 ""I believe everything happens for a reason, and I'm incredibly grateful for every opportunity that comes my way, "" Gatt said, adding that she will never forget the experience.
 ""If you're not winning, you're learning,"" she added. 
 This was Gatt’s only assignment at the 2024 games.
 She had participated in Tokyo in 2021 as one of the youngest Maltese athletes.
  Shooter Gianluca Chetcuti made his debut at the Paris 2024 Games in the Men's Skeet competition. 
 The competition consisted of two days of qualifying events.
 On the first day, shooters participated in three rounds of 25 shots each, for a maximum of 75 targets. On that day,  Chetcuti finished in 28th place with 69 targets hit.
 On the second day (Tuesday) he shot a straight 25 round. In the second and final round of the day, Chetcuti missed three shots to hit 22 each time. 
 He failed to qualify for the final round.
 Judoka Katryna Esposito put on a fighting performance on her Olympic debut on Saturday, but she lost to her competitor Mongolian judoka Bavuudorjiin Baasankhüü.
 Kyle Micallef will make his debut in the men's 50m freestyle on Thursday and sprinter Beppe Grillo in the 100m Preliminary round on Saturday.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/half-way-there-neil-agius-marks-80km-160km-swim.1098414,"Updated Monday, 10.30pm
 Endurance athlete Neil Agius climbed a beach ladder unaided at Għar Lapsi at 9.40pm on Monday, completing a world record 140km non-stop swim, around Malta, Gozo and Comino. 
 A large crowd burst into long applause as the 38-year-old walked to a chair, waving to well-wishers after having surpassed his own world record distance of 125.7km achieved in 2021. 
 ""It was not a swim for me, it was a swim for Malta,"" Agius said in a short comment, looking remarkably well after having been in the water for three days and three nights.
  Belgian ultra-athlete Matthieu Bonne swam 131km around Greece in 60 hours and 55 minutes last year, but his record has not yet been officially verified.
 Doctors quickly checked Agius before he walked up the slipway amid the continued cheers of the crowd. Those welcoming him included Prime Minister Robert Abela and MPs from both sides of the political aisle. European Parliament president Roberta Metsola in a Facebook post said this was a superhuman feat and Neil Agius was ""The personification of ‘Never Give Up’. An inspiration to all of us.""
  His swim will now have to be ratified by the World Open Water Swimming Association, the governing body that oversees this ultra-endurance sport.  
  Agius kicked off his attempt on Saturday at Mellieħa’s Għadira Bay shortly after 9am. 
 At 2pm on Sunday, he had swam clockwise around Malta, made it to Gozo and was rounding the sister island, en-route back to Malta.
 By 7.45am on Monday he had completed 75% of the planned swim.
 He was cheered along by supporters on a small flotilla of boats.  
  Agius set his own record back in 2021, when he swam from Linosa to Malta for a distance of 125.7km and finished in Xlendi, Gozo. 
 This was Agius’ first attempt at breaking that record after he was forced to abandon a similar swim in Spain last year. 
  Agius used the swim to raise awareness about the state of Malta’s marine habitat in collaboration with NGO Wave of Change and marine clean-up specialists Żibel.
 Żibel coordinated three coastal clean-ups during the swim, with a third and final one planned for Monday postponed due to bad weather. So far the collaboration has seen some 790kg of marine waste collected by volunteers who gathered in Spinola Bay, St Julian’s on Saturday, and St Thomas Bay, Marsascala, on Sunday.  
 The public was also invited to collect waste on their own and deposit it in specialised Żibel bins located across the country.   
 All waste collected will be sorted and the aim is to use them to power fully-circular projects.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/maltese-buyer-pays-record-740000-french-race-horse.1097366,"Maltese horse racing owner Steve Farrugia has paid a record €740,000 for a yearling trotter in France. 
 The horse, Nodessa Josselyn, a daughter of two Prix D’Amerique winners Ready Cash and Bellina Josselyn, was bought on Wednesday. 
 It is the highest amount paid for a yearling trotter in the history of horse racing in Europe.
 The record deal was completed during the Argana Yearling Sales at the Deuville ring on Wednesday by French trainers Christophe and Vincent Martens as representatives of the Maltese stable headed by Farrugia.
 The previous record on the Deuville ring was held in this yearling category by Hunter Valley who had posted €400,000 in 2018.
 Trainer Vincent Martens was left speechless at the successful bid.
 “I didn’t expect that. We had set a price and Christophe managed it over the phone with the client,” he said.
 “It’s a great honour to take part in this adventure. She’s a unique being, we had to pay the price. I hope she’ll do well in the race... That’ll be my job, by the way (laughs).”
 Christophe Martens said Farrugia was determined to secure Nodessa Joselyn who he described its pedigree as ""the stuff of dreams"".
 “It’s a crazy price. We’re feeling a bit nervous right now,” Christophe Martens said.
 “We have a client who owns a big company in Malta, with whom we’ve had a recent success, and he wanted the top. We had talked about a limit of €600,000 but he also wanted me to call him during the auction and he didn’t stop. It’s his decision.
 “We’re proud and happy while realizing the responsibility that now falls on us. The pressure is going to be there, but we’re going to have to go to sleep, it’s not going to be easy.
 “She’s magnificent. Her pedigree is the stuff of dreams. We’ll see if we can go to the Prix d'Amerique with her or her products in the future. It’s a big investment. But the priority, right now, is to insure her!”
 It is understood that Nodessa Joselyn will not be racing in Malta but its owners are planning to compete in the French scene, and the deal is a further confirmation that Maltese horse racing owners are keen to invest huge sums on horses in countries like France and the Scandinavian countries.
 Nodessa Josselyn is the daughter of two legendary horses in Ready Cash and Bellina Josselyn.
 Trained by owner Philippe Allaire and Thierry Duvaldestin during his racing career, Ready Cash won 40 of 70 races and had a lifetime earning of €4,282,300.
 He was the richest French trotter in history at the time of his retirement.
 The son of Indy De Vive-Kidea won the prestigious Prix d'Amérique in 2011 and 2012 and was also a two-time winner of the Group I Prix De France and champion of the Prix de Paris along with numerous other graded stakes.
 On the other hand, Bellina Josselyn is a also Prix D’Amerique winner and boasts a lifetime earning of €2,686,170.

https://theshiftnews.com/2024/06/12/gharb-football-committee-resigns-after-mayor-leases-ground-to-rivals/,"A second-division football club in Gozo, Gharb Rangers FC, cannot use its football ground facilities following a decision by the locality’s mayor, David Apap, to lease the ground to football rivals, Victoria Hotspurs FC.
 This decision led to the mass resignation of the Gharb Rangers committee, which said the locality’s mayor did not even inform them about leasing their ground. The Gharb football team currently has nowhere to train and risks being disbanded.
 In their resignation letter, sent to the Gozo Football Association (GFA), the committee members, led by President Joe Cauchi, informed the association they were leaving the club because the mayor decided to lease their facilities to a “third party.”
 Without mentioning Victoria Hotspurs by name, the committee informed the GFA that the mayor did not even consult them on this move and that they ended up without their training ground. This has made their club’s situation impossible to manage.
 Contacted by The Shift, Gharb Rangers President Joe Cauchi confirmed that his club could not use its football ground as Mayor Apap leased it out to football rivals.
 “I have nothing to add to the statement. There is no football club any longer, as all the committee members resigned. We don’t know why the mayor took this decision and for whose benefit. We don’t know anything,” the club president said.
 When asked who owns the ground, the President said it was the property of the local council but has been managed by the football club for years.
 When contacted by The Shift, Mayor David Apap did not want to answer any questions by phone and asked for them to be emailed. The Shift has not yet received his replies to questions sent in writing.
 Sources told The Shift that while Victoria Hotspurs – the Gozo capital’s football team – already had their facilities, they have turned their ground into a parking lot.
 To compensate for their ‘lack’ of facilities, they have now leased the Gharb Rangers ground, locking out the team to which the facilities originally belonged.
 The sources said this latest development was only possible through the intervention of Mayor David Apap.
 This is not the first time Gharb’s mayor, one of the longest-serving in Gozo, has made headlines. In 2013, PN Mayor David Apap, together with his brother Francis, was arraigned in court accused of criminal offences, including usury and money laundering.
 After being forced to resign from the PN, he stayed on as an independent local councillor. Subsequently, he contested the local council elections as an independent through a new political grouping – l-Ewwel l-Gharb – and has been re-elected as mayor ever since.
 Apap denies the criminal charges, but the proceedings remain ongoing in the Gozo Courts.

The swim will now have to be ratified by the World Open Water Swimming Association, the governing body that oversees this ultra endurance sport.    Agius set off from Għadira Bay, Mellieħa, shortly after 9am on Saturday morning.   From there he swam out from the bay accompanied by a squad of young swimmers and a team of support crew that included skippers, medical staff, and several other volunteers.   He then headed southeast and swam along a route that wraps clockwise around Malta.  He swam throughout the night, and on Sunday he circumnavigated Gozo before heading back to Malta.   Off the coast of Marsaxlokk, after 52 hours of continuous swimming, he smashed through the previous world record of 125km which he himself had set back in 2021.   Throughout the final leg of the swim, weather conditions deteriorated and became tricky with outbursts of rain, strong currents, winds, and an increasing sea swell.   All these made this a far more challenging swim than in previous attempts.  Neil had already set a world record when he swam from Linosa to Malta covering a distance of 125.7km in 2021. That swim had also taken 52 hours.    Since then, there have been several attempts but no one has managed to break this record officially.  This is Agius’s first attempt at breaking the record after he was forced to abandon a similar swim in Spain last year.   At the time he had been forced to leave the water after having been  surrounded by a massive swarm of jellyfish.    Since then he has been training, and said ahead of this swim that he felt he was stronger than ever and prepared for the challenge.    Agius used the swim to raise awareness about the state of Malta’s marine habitat in collaboration with NGO Wave of Change and marine clean-up specialists Żibel.  Żibel coordinated three coastal clean ups during the swim, with a third and final on planned for Monday postponed due to bad weather.    So far the collaboration has seen some 790kg of marine waste collected by volunteers who gathered in Spinola Bay, St Julian’s on Saturday, and St Thomas Bay, Marsascala, on Sunday.   The public was also invited to collect waste on their own and deposit it in specialised Żibel bins located across the country.    All waste collected will be sorted and the aim is to use them to power fully-circular projects.

         Ultra-endurance athlete and clean seas activist Neil Agius has surpassed his own world record distance by swimming a total of 125 km, but plans on completing another 40 km before leaving the water.
 Agius hit the 125 km mark shortly after 12.30pm on Monday, surpassing the world record distance which he himself had set back in 2021.
 He hit the distance as he swam along the southern coast near Marsaxlokk after 52 hours in the water. In order for his distance to be confirmed he needs to swim to shore and leave the water on his own, but Agius is aiming to swim a total of 160km.  Agius has been swimming for roughly two and a half days (52 hours), having departed from Mellie ħ a Bay shortly after 9am on Saturday morning. He swam out from the bay accompanied by a squad of young swimmers and a team of support crew that included skippers, medical staff, and several other volunteers.
 He then headed southeast and swam along a route that wraps clockwise around Malta. On Sunday, he circumnavigated Gozo before heading back to Malta.
 You can track Agius' progress in realtime, here.
 Support staff said Neil is in good spirits, but faces a challenging final stretch. Weather conditions are delicate and there is an increasing swell in the sea as well as some rain and wind, which is far more challenging than in previous swim attempts.
 In order to complete the full 160km, Agius will have to swim along the eastern coast of Malta, which presents limited opportunities for Agius to make landfall. The athlete needs to leave the sea via land in order for his swim to be considered complete.
 If he enters one of the support vessels he will have forfeited the swim.
 Neil set a world record when he swam from Linosa to Malta covering a distance of 125.7km in 2021. That swim had also taken 52 hours. Since then, there have been several attempts but no one has managed to break this record officially.
 This is Agius' first attempt at breaking the record after he was forced to abandon a similar swim in Spain last year.
 Lead partner, GO are powering the swim and all Neil's endeavours for the next three years. The Small Island, Big Swim is also supported by VisitMalta, Atlas Insurance and Cisk 0.0, as well as Kia, Garmin and Maypole.

On 5 September, MGRM launches the exhibition ‘The First Walk Under the Rainbow’ at the Malta Postal Museum and Arts Hub in Archbishop Street, Valletta. The exhibition will feature the memories shared by 12 people who either organised or were present in the first Pride march twenty years ago.  Their memories will be illustrated by a series of portraits and anecdotes, alongside archival material that will be displayed in the exhibition that will run until the 14 September 2024.  The interviews narrate the run-up to the Pride march, and the way organisers managed to bring together a small group of activists, allies, politicians and members of the community in a day that made history.  Alongside the exhibition, MGRM is also launching a new publication sharing the same name of the exhibition, which collects the interviews of the same individuals who feature in the exhibition.  The exhibition is curated by Francesca Zammit. Ascend Creative Studio and Johann Agius were the creative minds behind the interviews, videos and photography. The exhibition also includes photos by Alan Carville and archival photography from MGRM’s own archives. The designs featured in the exhibition, publication and videos are by Adam Brimmer.

 Detailed plans to expand on a ‘master plan’ for a motorsports racetrack in Hal Far are in the pipeline, President of the Malta Motorsport Federation (MMF) Duncan Micallef has told The Malta Independent.
 Discussions on the development of a racetrack up to international standard have been ongoing for years, and Prime Minister Robert Abela in 2021 announced intentions to plan and develop a racetrack in Hal-Far. 
 Included in these plans was also the intention to upgrade existing racing circuits in the area. 
 The Malta Independent reached out to Micallef to ask for an update about the racetrack plans and also about a planning application filed earlier this year that would see upgrades made to the existing drag race track. 
 Asked about the drag strip, Micallef explained that the existing drag strip is not homologated to European standards. He said that this investment is intended to get the strip up to FIA homologation standards to open up the possibility of hosting international events on the track. “Amongst them, as we have been promised by FIA themselves, is to be part of the European Championship calendar.”
 Asked about the likely duration of these works, Micallef said that if everything goes as planned, the work on the drag strip should begin in December and take no longer than 10 months to be completed. “I'm calculating that as long as nothing happens and everything goes well, we should be finished by Q3 next year.”
 Micallef said that the quarter mile track, the karting track and the proposed race track would collectively be double the area of the Ta Qali stadium and adjacent football training grounds combined in terms of scale, making it one of the most expansive development projects in Malta.
 Moving on to the topic of the racetrack, Micallef said that they have appointed the best designers in the world to work on the project. “We already paid half their contract free, so we’re in a very advanced state right now. You could say we’re in a position where we can send the detailed application as well.” He said that there is already an overall “master plan” for the area and that they are currently in the process of preparing a more detailed plan. “The master plan was submitted in 2021. Now we’re looking to file more detailed applications.”
 This newsroom did not find a planning application for a master plan on the Planning Authority's Geoserver. 
 However an application with the Environment and Resources Authority (ERA) to determine whether an Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) would be required for the racetrack project had been filed. The ERA website lists that no such EIA is required, but the current status is listed as “awaiting further updates.”
 As for the application to upgrade the drag strip in particular, the planning application was updated on the 26th of January.
 “One needs to understand that this is not a simple process,” said the MMF President, “I’m involved in property development and I know what it requires.” He said that those who complain do so because they do not understand the process and added that those involved in the field understand the process they are going through. “In development, the more time goes on, the more complicated it gets … Nowadays even to build a block of flats is difficult, imagine a project like this.”
 Regarding potential objections to the development, he said that the project is moving along according to policies. “We applied for the permits. I don’t imagine that because we’re doing things according to permits and policies they’re going to be against it now, when this area has existed for 40 years.”
 Micallef concluded by saying that motorsport enthusiasts are in support of MMF’s work. “What we do is for them, I'm a volunteer. If there is someone more capable than me then he'll take my place, in the end it's not mine. This is something we do for our children.”

https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/129148/mfa_insists_it_is_distinct_entity_from_malta_premier_league_after_muscat_charges,"""The Malta Football Association insisted it is a distinct entity from the Malta Premier League when asked whether it is concerned over developments surrounding the latter’s chairman – Joseph Muscat.  “The Malta Premier League (MPL), whilst being a grouping representing a number of MFA members (Premier League clubs), is not a member of the MFA itself, and it is therefore an independent body,” an MFA spokesperson told this newspaper.  Muscat will later this month be charged with accepting bribes, corruption in public office, money laundering and being part of a criminal organisation in relation to the Vitals hospitals deal.  After exiting politics, Muscat went on to become the chairperson of the newly founded Malta Premier League, which brings together the topflight football clubs.   “The Malta FA is indeed in the process of setting up a new commercial entity with MPL, which entity is distinct of any of its shareholders,” the MFA spokesperson added.  Questions on whether the MFA will seek to revise it collaboration with the MPL considering the charges, remained unanswered.  Similarly, questions to the MPL as to whether Muscat will be suspending himself, and whether the MPL board feels comfortable working with him, remained unanswered.  The Malta FA and the MPL will jointly manage a newly established company tasked with organising the Premier League for five consecutive football seasons starting from 2024/25.  The MPL was officially established in August of last year, building on its earlier version, the Malta Professional Football Clubs Association.  A few weeks later, in October 2022, it was recognised by the Malta FA’s Executive Board as the organisation representing clubs playing in the highest tier of the National Championship.  In November 2022, the MPL became an official affiliate of the European Leagues (EL), the organisation that brings together the professional football leagues in Europe. Since then, the MPL engaged in constant dialogue with the Malta FA, to deliver a more attractive, competitive, and sustainable Premier League.  Kevin Deguara case to be assessed by MFA ethics committee after charges   Among those facing criminal charges in the Vitals case is Żabbar St Patrick FC President Kevin Deguara. The club was promoted to the premier division from the Challenge League this season.  A lawyer by profession, Deguara’s company, DF Advocates was involved in a number of deals undertaken by the Labour government since 2013. According to his Facebook profile, he is a director at the American Univeristy of Malta, The Convenience Shop and Dizz Group.   This newspaper reached out to the MFA to ask whether the criminal charges filed against Deguara could land the football club in trouble with MFA regulations  “The Association’s Reputational Risk Management Policy states that insofar as cases relating to officers of a member, the matter should be assessed by the Ethics and Compliance committee, and following its recommendation the matter will be discussed and finally determined by the Executive Committee,” the MFA spokesperson said.  Once formal notification is served onto all concerned, the established procedure will regulate the steps to be taken.  “In any case, any decision taken shall be at such a stage of a precautionary nature, and a final decision shall be taken once all criminal proceedings are final and binding,” the MFA added.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/maltese-researchers-unlock-space-secret-potential-cure.1094362,"A Maltese research group has discovered that human blood in space reverts to its foetal type, potentially leading to breakthroughs for thalassaemia patients, whose haemoglobin is dysfunctional after birth and requires a lifetime of transfusions.
 Thalassaemic patients have a genetic problem in adult haemoglobin, and if a way to bring their foetal blood back to high levels is found, their symptoms can be improved.
 With access to data and blood samples of NASA astronauts, the research group could confirm the adult-to-foetal globin switch in spaceflight and its change back on Earth – a key to unlocking a cure for the millions suffering from the severe hereditary blood condition worldwide and 28 Maltese patients.
 Lead author of the study, Joseph Borg, from the University of Malta’s Faculty of Health Sciences, explained that thalassaemia patients, whom he has been studying for decades, have abnormal blood and could do well with elevated levels of foetal haemoglobin, which replaces the role of its deficient adult counterpart.
  Thalassaemia causes anaemia, resulting in fatigue, weakness, a propensity for other diseases due to immunity and, in severe cases, death. Patients can require blood transfusions every six weeks, a cumbersome treatment that often causes other complications.
 “As the name implies, foetal haemoglobin is found in developing foetuses, and this set of genes ‘switches off’ to give way to adult blood,” Borg explained. “Knowing how this switch is controlled – and goes back and forth – is crucial, to say the least,” Borg said.
  Historically, the gene switch occurred from foetal to adult blood, so the inflight switch is a unique opportunity to observe it both ways, he continued.
 “The plan is to now tease out the key molecules responsible for the switch. We use space to identify the key, and once we hold this, on Earth it can be used to design drugs, molecules and inhibitors to treat the blood disorder.”
 While the key has not yet been found, Borg said “we have now chosen a specific road, with no more turns, trial and error, and we know exactly where we are heading. The data is pointing in right direction”.
 A possible conclusion is that the microgravity in spaceflight may elicit the mechanisms behind the gene switch. In this environment, astronauts experience a decrease in red blood cells, possibly due to bone mineral density loss, Borg explained.
 The question now is why the body and blood of astronauts – healthy adults – ‘feel’ the need to revert to innate foetal genes and expression in microgravity.
 “We do not know yet. But that is the next mission,” Borg said.
 Mission possible
 The research, carried out together with other giants in the academic field, used the space environment to complete another important piece of the puzzle, Borg maintained.
 “We had assumed blood would behave differently and that there would be superior levels of foetal haemoglobin in space because this has already been seen in people living in high altitudes and mountains, where oxygen retention is tighter,” he said.
  During the pandemic, he read articles about the work on astronauts and reached out to NASA to inquire about their blood levels.
 “They said they had never looked at foetal haemoglobin, but they had the data and samples and offered to collaborate.”
 The study tapped into the powerful platform made available by NASA’s GeneLab, which provides a wealth of information linking molecular biology and genetics with space medical sciences.
 The local research team used the tools and machines in place for Malta’s blood screening programme, set up in 1990, to study the data from NASA, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency and private company SpaceX, which manufactures and launches rockets and spacecraft.
 It also involved actual blood samples from their respective American, Japanese and private astronauts before, during and after spaceflight.
 “Our hypothesis was that there would be elevated levels of foetal haemoglobin and it was proven correct,” Borg said.
 Before the end of the year, a number of space missions will be carried out to further the studies, Borg said.
 Meanwhile, an ongoing mission, Polaris Dawn, is taking blood from American entrepreneur, pilot and space tourist Jared Isaacman and his three crew members.
 These missions involve a five-day trip around the Earth, going up to 500km or higher from its orbit, Borg noted.
 Findings would further assist space research to improve the quality of life and safety of astronauts, but they would also be used in “space-for-Earth applications” to make a real difference for patients suffering from blood disorders.
 A key player but not the key
 The paper, ‘Spatiotemporal Expression and Control of Haemoglobin in Space’, has been published in Nature Communications and quoted in a wide-ranging article in the world’s leading multidisciplinary science journal  Nature.
 Borg and his colleagues performed the experiments and wrote the paper, with the contribution of Alfred Buħagiar, Josef Borg and Prof. Alex Felice, who, back in the 1990s, pioneered the now well-established field of research on haemoglobin biology.
 The study carries on from Maltese scientists’ breakthrough research for a cure for thalassemia in 2010.
 Borg had identified a molecule responsible for the switch from foetal to adult haemoglobin that occurs at birth thanks to the discovery of a unique Maltese family, who had high levels of the foetal haemoglobin but did not suffer from thalassaemia.
 The hope was that it would get patients to be transfusion independent, but it transpired that locking down this one gene would not be enough to provide a cure.
 “It is a key player, but not the key,” Borg said.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/in-pictures-malta-night-skies-illuminated-perseid-meteor-showers.1096699,"Stargazers were in for a treat last night as the Perseid meteor showers gave a fantastic display across Malta's night sky. 
 The annual astronomical event, referred to in Maltese as id-Dmugħ ta San Lawrenz (The Tears of St Lawrence), usually occurs when the Earth passes through the debris field of the Comet Swift-Tuttle. 
  As the trail of particles shed by the comet make contact with the Earth's atmosphere, they heat up and glow, streaking across the sky as spectacular flashes of light and becoming meteors or shooting stars.
 Across Malta, enthusiasts gathered in some of the islands' darkest places, hoping to escape the reach of light pollution and watch the astronomical light show.
  In Dwejra, Gozo, with car parks packed full to the brim and the sound of hushed voices occasionally breaking the silence to gasp in awe, it was clear that the public was out in full force to enjoy the event. 
 Joseph Caruana, a professor at the Department of Physics and Institute of Space Sciences and Astronomy told Times of Malta that the occasion marked a peaceful communal affair for the most part. 
  ""On account of the darkness at Dwejra – the very darkness which allows the Perseids to shine – one could not quite see where other people were located,"" he said.
 ""One was reminded of their presence by the hushed sighs which carried across the rugged landscape every time a bright meteor whizzed by. The eerie cries of the cliff-dwelling shearwater, rippling across the water, made for a surreal atmosphere at times.""
 He said such enthusiastic attendance is evidence that people have a growing interest in being able to enjoy natural events. 
 ""People want to be able to enjoy nature. The presence of yesterday's crowd, huddled in separate groups at the best remaining dark site on the Islands to witness this annual celestial event, was, once again, a testament to the public's interest in and fascination with the night sky – a shared heritage of humanity,"" Caruana said. 
  He added it is a shame the site is not afforded all the protection that it merits, including monitoring to combat light pollution in protected dark areas across the country. 
 In Miġra l-Ferħa, Rabat, Daniel Cassar Alpert, who attended a meetup to watch the perseids in the area, said that things were a little less peaceful at times, but quietened down later in the night. 
  ""The atmosphere was a little busy at times with cars arriving and leaving creating some light pollution at those times,"" he said.
 ""However after around 1am most had left and the place calmed down and a fresh breeze made it an enjoyable summer night to sit and relax while enjoying the view above.""
 Last year, stargazing events to watch the Perseid meteor showers organised by the Malta Astronomical Society were marred by light pollution, spoiling the once-a-year event for attendees.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/war-footage-explicit-music-videos-accessible-children-school-tablets.1102474,"Primary schoolchildren have unfiltered access to explicit music videos, war footage and other inappropriate content through tablets supplied to schools by the Education Ministry.
 The tablets are given out to children attending state schools in years 4, 5 and 6, and can be connected to the internet.
 Times of Malta was approached by a concerned parent, whose eldest daughter had informed her that her nine-year-old sister was watching “a naughty video” on YouTube.
 The video in question was titled ‘Do You Want To Play With My Balls’, an innuendo-filled parody of a children’s story, complete with narrator and illustrations.
  The parent said her complaints to the school and ministry have fallen on deaf ears.
 After Times of Malta was granted access to the tablet, it emerged that clips like graphic drone footage from the war in Ukraine, as well as the notoriously explicit music video of the Cardi B song WAP, were accessible.
 On the other hand, attempts to access websites related to pornography, gambling and alcohol were met with the message ‘Access Denied’.
  “I was shocked when I found this out, but other parents might not. Someone at the ministry is clearly not doing their job. I feel powerless because our kids aren’t being safeguarded,” the parent said.
 “The school told us to report the issue to the ministry because they didn’t get anywhere when they tried to flag it themselves,” she added.
 The mother also expressed anger that children were being allowed to access their tablets during breaktime, as well at breakfast and after-school clubs.
 “The school doesn’t have enough staff so the tablets are being used as a kind of babysitter,” the parent said.
  A learning support educator who works at another primary school echoed the parent’s frustrations, saying it was not unusual for school staff to catch children showing each other inappropriate content, and repeating profanity they had heard online.
 “We’re often the first point of contact for parents who complain, but we can’t keep an eye on all the kids at all times. The situation creates a lot of pressure and anxiety for us. We have too many responsibilities as it is. And we can’t supervise them at all when they’re on the school van,” said the LSE.
 The educator wished to remain anonymous due to a directive issued by the ministry stating that teachers must get written permission before speaking to the media.
 Questions sent to the Education Ministry remain unanswered at the time of writing.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/comet-visible-malta-enters-solar-system-80000-years.1098641,"Stargazers are in for a special treat over the next few weeks as they get a very rare opportunity to see a comet that is believed to visit our solar system every 80,000 years.
 Astronomer Alexei Pace managed to take a photo of the comet - Comet C/2023 A3, otherwise known as Comet Tsuchinshan-ATLAS - on Friday at 6 am from Tal-Virtù in Rabat.
 “The photograph shows the comet as a faint but distinct point of light, with its tail pointing towards the upper right-hand side of the image, in the pre-dawn sky above the lights of the Maltese landscape,” said Pace, the former president of the Astronomical Society of Malta.
  This comet has been generating excitement among astronomers and skywatchers alike, as it is expected to become one of the brightest comets visible this year. 
 Comets consist of an ice and rock centre, surrounded by a cloud of gas and dust. They are considered leftovers from the formation of our solar system, about 4.6 billion years ago.
 They orbit the sun in highly elliptical orbits that can take hundreds of thousands of years to complete. Every so often, one of these comets makes its way into the inner solar system. As it gets closer to the sun, frozen gases are released creating the tail we often associate with comets. 
 Comet Tsuchinshan-Atlas gets its longer name from the facilities that first spotted it back in February 2023: the Purple Mountain Observatory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (or Tsuchinshan Chinese Observatory) and the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS). 
 It is currently at a point called perihelion – its closest approach to the sun.  
 Right now it is visible mostly from the earth’s southern hemisphere so from locations like Malta it appears low in the pre-dawn Eastern skies.  It is currently visible through binoculars or small telescopes.
 Pace explains that the comet is predicted to brighten further as it approaches its closest point to the Earth on October 12.
 At the moment it is visible just before the sun rises at dawn. The light dampens it out making it difficult to see with the naked eye.
 After the perihelion, it will not be visible for a couple of days, as it will be “behind the sun”. But when it emerges on the other side  - within about two weeks – it is predicted that it will be visible in the west after sunset.  However, comets are notoriously difficult to predict and a variety of factors can impact their visibility.
 “It will reach its brightness peak around mid-October then it will start getting fainter as it continues along its orbit away and back into the depths of space,” Pace said.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/drop-taboos-around-ai-help-student-learn-use-it.1100457,"An artificial intelligence expert has spoken about the need to drop taboos around programmes like ChatGPT, insisting that students should be encouraged to use it.
 Dylan Seychell, who teaches at the University of Malta’s Department of Artificial Intelligence, discussed AI’s potential in the classroom, advocating for its responsible use by students.
 Seychell sees this approach as a way to prepare students for a world that openly embraces technology, fostering greater productivity and accountability.
 “I took a measure when ChatGPT came out that in every assignment I give out, 10 per cent of the mark is given to using that system and telling me how students use it and what they did,” he said.
 He also suggested that AI could be integrated into homework routines to reduce workload. For example, 1,000-word essays assigned as homework could be reduced to a 200-word classroom exercise, and students could use ChatGPT at home to refine their work.
 This approach, he argued, not only lightens teachers’ correction load but also teaches students to self-edit and learn independently.
 This is why the government should provide every Maltese citizen access to AI systems like ChatGPT.
  Seychell was speaking yesterday at a Times of Malta business breakfast titled ‘Malta Vision 2050: Just Another Slogan?’
 AI could serve as a virtual assistant for everyone, from small business owners to students, helping with various tasks that would boost productivity.
 “Can we look at a country where the government creates some sort of measure where every Maltese person has access to software like ChatGPT, Claude, or the others?” Seychell asked.
 “Like that, we have double the population without having to add another car on the road or needing another apartment.”
 Seychell argued that AI could serve as a virtual assistant for everyone, from small business owners to students, helping with a range of tasks that would boost productivity. 
 His proposal was directed at Economy Minister Silvio Schembri, the keynote speaker at the event.
 
 The breakfast discussion was part of a broader conversation on Malta’s goals for 2050.
 Minister Schembri opened the event with an outline of the government’s vision, focusing on four main themes: innovation and technology, infrastructure, sustainability, and talent development. According to Schembri, these pillars aim to improve the quality of life for Maltese citizens, with a view to positioning Malta as a global leader in sustainable, digitally advanced living.
 Other panellists, including Stephanie Fabri, Silvan Mifsud, Stefano Mallia and Jerome Caruana Cilia, were encouraged by moderator Mark Lawrence Zammit to provide tangible suggestions on how Malta could achieve its Vision 2050 goals.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/watch-mysterious-cloud-sky-spacex-satellites-expert.1094369,"The “air balloon” and “white line” spotted in the sky on Sunday evening were SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket releasing a satellite train into space, according to a University of Malta professor.
 On Sunday evening several people shared photos and videos with Times of Malta and also on social media showing a ""strange"" white ballon-like cloud and “a white line"" trailing behind it.
 It was no UFO.
 According to Professor Joseph Borg, Maltese sky-gazers were witnessing satellites being released into space. 
 These clouds - called 'SpaceX nebula' - and a white line were spotted a couple of hours after Elon Musk's SpaceX completed another launch from the West Coast in the US: the Falcon 9 (a reusable rocket) launched more Starlink mini-satellites into space.
 Starlink is a satellite internet constellation that provides global mobile broadband. 
  Borg, a professor of biomedical science and director of Spaceomix - a Maltese space biotech company - explained that the white line was the satellites being released into space.
 If they are seen soon after release and are still close together, they appear as a straight line. The later they are seen, he said, the more dispersed they get.
 As for the cloud-like formation around these satellites, he said this might be due to several reasons, including rocket launch exhaust.
 ""After the launch of the Starlink satellites, the rocket’s exhaust can create a temporary cloud in space. This cloud is usually visible shortly after launch and can be illuminated by sunlight, making it visible from the ground, "" he said.
 The cloud could also be deployment debris. During the deployment of satellites, small particles or ice crystals might be released, forming a temporary cloud around the satellite constellation.
 Another option could be satellite reflections, explained Borg.
 The satellites’ solar panels and other reflective surfaces can sometimes create a visual effect that looks like a cloud, especially if the sunlight hits them at a particular angle.
 The cloud could also be due to atmospheric effects. High-altitude atmospheric conditions can sometimes create optical illusions or enhance the visibility of the satellite train, making it appear cloud-like.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/you-now-need-eid-check-electoral-register.1098462,"A potential security vulnerability identified on the Electoral Register website has led to the introduction of eID authentication for access to voter information.
 The Electoral Register contains details such as names, surnames, identity or eResidence card numbers and addresses of registered voters. Until August, this data was available as open source.
 The Electoral Commission, which manages the register, said the vulnerability was found during a routine security assessment on its portal in late 2023.
 “In response to this finding, the Electoral Commission promptly authorised introducing enhanced security measures to address the vulnerabilities discovered within the portal. Among these measures was the incorporation of eID authentication,” a spokesperson said.
 A reader informed Times of Malta in August about the changes to the login process. According to the Electoral Commission, the security updates, including eID (electoral identification) authentication, were fully in place by August 2024.
 However, the commission has not clarified whether users who log in with their eID will have their movements on the website tracked.
 The introduction of eID authentication occurred around the time of an ID card racket scandal, in which former MP Jason Azzopardi alleged that around 18,000 identity cards had been fraudulently issued since 2015. Azzopardi claimed marriage certificates and other documents were fabricated by officials from the government agency Identità.
 The scandal is currently under judicial inquiry after a court upheld Azzopardi’s request to investigate the matter. Allegations suggest systemic fraud involving government officials, which could have national security implications.
 However, the Electoral Commission stressed that its new security measures were unrelated to Azzopardi’s claims.
 “The commission is an autonomous entity from Identità,” the spokesperson said, distancing itself from the scandal.
 The commission clarified that the timing of the security upgrade was purely coincidental, emphasising that the eID measures were implemented as a response to internal assessments rather than external allegations.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/national-orchestra-sees-law-data-commissioner.1091693,"Updated 2.47pm with a statement by the national orchestra. 
 The national orchestra said on Monday it had decided to supply information requested by Times of Malta after the data protection commissioner said it seemed to consider itself “above the law”.  
 In a decision published last week, the commissioner ordered the orchestra to give Times of Malta copies of all agreements it has with a Russian-linked foundation that has pumped millions into the local and international music scene.
 The commissioner’s investigation was triggered following a complaint by Times of Malta over the orchestra’s decision to reject a freedom of information request for copies of agreements it has with an NGO called the European Foundation for Support of Culture (EUFSC).
 According to the decision, the orchestra “deliberately and persistently” failed to cooperate with the commissioner’s office during its attempt to investigate whether the orchestra had been justified in rejecting the freedom of information request.
  Times of Malta has reported how the foundation, presided over by Russian-Armenian  Konstantin Ishkhanov, built strong ties among orchestra and government officials, as part of a €12 million splurge on organising music events in Malta and abroad.
 The commissioner said the orchestra’s failure to cooperate with its investigation, coming from a reputable musical institution, is “certainly deplorable and is unacceptable in a democratic society”.
 The orchestra’s board is chaired by Alfred Camilleri, a former finance ministry permanent secretary under both PN and Labour governments.
 According to the orchestra, the agreements with the foundation are exempt from disclosure under freedom of information laws, as they are covered by “legal professional privilege”.
 In March 2023, following the Times of Malta’s complaint, the commissioner invited the orchestra to elaborate on why it felt its agreement with the foundation was protected from disclosure.
 After “several reminders” were sent to the orchestra in April, May and June, the commissioner’s office finally received a reply in July 2023.
 In the reply, the orchestra proposed finding “common ground” with Times of Malta about how to handle the information request.
 It demanded that Times of Malta withdraw its complaint about the rejected freedom of information request, in exchange for being allowed to “access” the agreement with the foundation, whilst agreeing to restrict publication of the actual documents.
 The orchestra further demanded that Times of Malta “must agree that any subsequent publication or media report on the matter should be factual and not speculative, as past reports have been”.
 It further ordered that the orchestra’s “official position” be published alongside any Times of Malta article.
 This approach, the orchestra said, sought to strike a balance between Times of Malta’s right to access documents “while also preventing the misuse of freedom of information requests to generate speculative articles” that could harm the orchestra’s reputation, which it said goes against the spirit of the law.
 Times of Malta rejected the orchestra’s demands, with lawyer Therese Comodini Cachia arguing that they are in clear breach of the law and take an offensive stand towards journalism.
 Comodini Cachia said that the orchestra’s proposal to restrict Times of Malta’s use of the requested documents was a non-starter, as responsible journalism does not allow for complicity in keeping public interest information hidden.
 The lawyer further pointed out that Times of Malta had always reflected the orchestra’s official position in its publications, and had spent months seeking information from the orchestra about its deals with the foundation.
 After the proposal was rejected, the commissioner gave the orchestra a September 2023 deadline to hand over a copy of the documents, so it could decide on the merits of Times of Malta’s freedom of information request.
 Despite further reminders and the serving of an enforcement notice, the commissioner’s requests continued to be ignored by the orchestra.
 In its April 26 decision, the commissioner’s office rebuked the orchestra for its lack of cooperation throughout the investigation.
 The commissioner also emphasised the “urgent need” for legislative changes to give its office the necessary power to “effectively and dissuasively” sanction public authorities that “deliberately fail” to adhere with the orders of the commissioner.
 In a reaction early on Monday afternoon, the national orchestra announced that it had decided to supply the requested information.
 It said it was committing itself to improving its internal procedures so that it could be more efficient in correspondence with entities such as the data commissioner. 
 It also pointed out that as laid down in the decision by the commissioner, two terms were still running., One was a 20 working day limit for the orchestra to file an appeal, and the other was a 20-day limit for the orchestra to supply the requested information if it did not appeal.
 It said it had decided to supply the requested information within the time limit in terms of the law. 
 It also pointed out that it severed all collaboration with the European Foundation for Support for Culture” more than 18 months ago.

 Metsola appears briefly in a segment called ‘breakout elections’, with a clip of her casting her vote at a Sliema primary school. The section also features footage of other women voting, American president-elect Donald Trump and UK Prime Minister Kier Starmer.
 In a voiceover accompanying the segment, Metsola can be heard saying, “2024 will be the biggest global election year in history.”
 More than two billion people across 50 countries – including seven of the most populous nations – were expected to go to the polls this year, according to news outlet  Al Jazeera.
  While the US election arguably dominated the international media landscape, closer to home Europe was also gripped by election fever as the public cast their votes in the European Parliament elections.
 In Malta, Labour won but saw its majority evaporate, losing its fourth MEP to the Opposition Nationalist Party while securing less than half the votes.
 Fortune continued to favour EP president Roberta Metsola, however, who fended off a last-minute challenge from Spanish MEP Irene Montero to be overwhelmingly re-elected to a second term in the strongest win for an EP president in history.
 Meanwhile, in local council elections held at the same time but with results announced later, the Labour Party saw losses but still managed to retain control of 39 local councils, well over half of Malta’s 68 localities.
  Across the pond, last month Donald Trump claimed a ""magnificent"" victory over Democrat Kamala Harris in what has been called one of the most stunning comebacks in US political history.
 Aside from politics, the Google video also shows clips from talk shows and social media, sporting events and music concerts, while taking a look at some of the scientific and technological advancements in the past year.
 More sombre topics are also covered, however, such as the devastating impacts of September’s Hurricane Helene on the Southeastern United States and those addressing mental health issues. Actors Maggie Smith and James Earl Jones, who died this year, also feature.
 The video is the latest in a series of annual videos going back at least as far as 2014, according to a YouTube – owned by Google – page featuring uploads related to the hashtag ‘#YearinSearch’.
 Such look-backs are increasingly common on technology platforms and in mobile applications, with other examples including Spotify’s ‘Spotify Wrapped’ viral marketing campaign and Google Photos’ ‘Recap’ feature.

Three weeks ago, however, with the help of an electronic communication device, the two were able to have a long-awaited chat.
 The pair spoke about Nico’s school, his teachers, and his family. While they were chatting, Ramona decided to film the conversation because she thought no one would believe her. “I listen to that video all the time just to hear his voice. This was the first time I ever heard it and that boy has such a beautiful voice,” said Ramona.
 Nico and his twin sister, Amy, are 12. When growing up Ramona noticed that Nico was acting differently to his sister and when he was one-and-a-half he was diagnosed with autism.
 Due to his nonverbal autism, communication has always been a struggle for Nico. He was seven when he said his first word, “mummy”. “Do you know how happy mum was? She called me, his LSE, our grandparents, everyone. It was a huge celebration for us,” said Amy. 
  Ramona said at first it was very difficult finding a way for Nico to express himself as he rejected the communication system available at the time.
 However, in September 2020 he was given a device that would change his life.  The Malta Trust Foundation was able to provide Nico with an Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) device which helps develop functional communication skills, promotes cognitive development, and provides a foundation for literacy development that also helps improve social communication.
 The AAC device was also built according to Nico’s individual needs and Ramona believes that is why Nico has advanced so far. Today, three-and-a-half years after first being given the device, Nico is still not a big talker and prefers using his device as a mode of communication, but he can now answer questions as well as read and write.
 Ramona said the video of the two of them having a conversation has been very impactful on the entire family. When Amy heard the video for the first time she told her mother, “Ma, today a miracle happened.” Ramona believes the reason Nico watches the video of their conversation so often is because he is proud of himself and his accomplishment. “I always knew my son had a voice. The device just helped other people hear it.” said Ramona.
 As a way of giving back to the foundation that helped her son Ramona will be volunteering in The Malta Trust Foundation’s marathon on Saturday. The marathon Għat-tfall kollha, kollha, kollha will be screened on all local channels from noon to midnight.

 A new electric vehicle (EV) fast charging service has been launched at the Malta Public Transport e-bus charging depot in Floriana. In a statement on Thursday, Tallinja explained that the fast charging service is now being made available to the public in conjunction with EVPoint. The facility was established in 2023 when 30 new electric buses were acquired by Malta Public Transport. The company will now allow owners of electric vehicles to charge their vehicles between 9-6pm between Monday and Sunday at the facility. The fast chargers can provide up to 160kW depending on the vehicle that is being charged. Tallinja’s commercial director, Daniel Grech, said through this collaboration the company was making part of the bus charging infrastructure available to the wider public. “Through this initiative we are continuing to support Malta’s transition towards sustainable transport, offering owners of both private and commercial electric vehicles a fast and convenient charging service,” he said. Each charging point is equipped to support CCS2 connectors, is compatible with most electric vehicles, and facilitates fast charging. Charging times vary depending on individual battery capacities, with a boost that can be given within just 15 minutes, and a full charge between 30 minutes and 90 minutes, depending on vehicle specifications. To maximise availability for all customers, vehicles can only be parked at the charging points for a maximum of 30 minutes after charging has been completed. This time limit encourages fair access to charging resources and enables a higher turnover of available spots, helping to accommodate as many users as possible throughout the day. Customers need to download the EVPoint – Charge Forward App in order to make use of this service. Commercial charges apply and are based on individual consumption. Clear and comprehensive instructions are provided at each charging pole, and users are advised to familiarise themselves with the terms and conditions displayed on-site prior to initiating a charge."
https://timesofmalta.com/article/what-happens-bank-changes-hands.1102138,"Reports of HSBC’s looming departure from Malta were seemingly confirmed last week, with HSBC Malta telling its shareholders that the bank was in discussions with “a number” of bidders.
 APS bank promptly threw its hat in the ring, announcing that it had submitted an offer for the 70.03 per cent stake in HSBC Bank Malta currently held by HSBC Continental Europe.
 Caught in the middle were countless confused customers of both banks left wondering what this all means for their own savings, investments and loans.
 We spoke to several banking experts to figure out what it means for customers when two banks hammer out a deal.
 The short answer is not really.
 The most likely scenario, whenever one bank takes over another, is that anyone who banks with either bank would simply have all their business with the bank – savings, investments, loans, and any other policies – shift seamlessly to the new reality.
 This is what happened when HSBC first landed in Malta back in the late 1990s, buying out a 67 per cent stake in Mid-Med Bank in a controversial takeover, experts say.
 In practice, Mid-Med Bank customers became HSBC customers virtually overnight, with no significant change to any of their daily dealings with their bank.
 Sometimes changes can be almost imperceptible.
 Eagle-eyed HSBC customers might also notice that their bank’s SWIFT code – the code used to identify the bank in international transactions – opens with the letters MMEB, rather than HSBC, as would customarily be the case.
 This is a remnant from the bank’s Mid-Med days, with HSBC holding on to the same banking licence and SWIFT code that the previous bank had once it took over.
 Whether whoever takes over from HSBC retains the same banking licence remains to be seen but, in any case, most customers are likely to experience little disruption to their daily banking activities.
 It depends. Experts say that this ultimately boils down to what sort of business strategy the new bank would want to pursue.
 HSBC frequently describes itself as a “community bank”, and whoever takes over may well decide to continue along the same road, servicing home loans, personal investments, retailers, and so forth.
 But experts say that a new bank could also choose to take a different approach altogether, for instance by gradually shrinking its personal and retail banking portfolio to focus on investment banking instead.
 This sort of shift in strategy would likely mean gradual changes to how the bank operates. So the new bank could, for instance, become a little stingier when handing out personal loans, or it may choose to prioritise servicing some industries over others.
 But, with questions remaining over who would eventually take HSBC’s place, it would be premature to suggest that this will happen.
 As one of Malta’s three systemic banks – banks that are considered too big to fail – HSBC is under the tight scrutiny of the European Central Bank, so any sale would need to have the ECB’s blessing.
 That’s not to say that Malta’s regulator, MFSA, has no say in the matter. Typically, ECB and MFSA would team up to jointly supervise the process before a sale is approved.
 ECB’s scrutiny is no small matter.
 Banking experts say that a routine inspection by the ECB into one of Malta’s systemic banks could last anywhere from two to four months at a go.
 And its supervision over the sale of a bank could be significantly lengthier, typically taking over a year to complete and, in some cases, lasting up to two years.
 The level of scrutiny would also depend on who HSBC’s buyer happens to be and the complexity of the deal. A private equity fund buying into a bank is usually looked at under a tighter microscope compared to when one bank buys out another, experts say.
 Some have suggested that an eventual deal between HSBC and APS could also face other regulatory hurdles, most notably concerns over competition. Whether this is the case, and whether this would lengthen the process further, remains to be seen, but it is likely that APS negotiators will have factored this into their thinking when submitting their bid.
 Ultimately, before giving its green light, the ECB would need to have its mind at rest that whoever is buying HSBC can successfully manage a bank of its size and implement all the safeguards that that entails.
 Reports of the sale are likely to have left many of HSBC Malta’s 920 employees wondering what this means for their future. And what the over 600 employees on APS’ books made of the news that their bank could suddenly double in size is anybody’s guess.
 As in the case of any company takeover, Malta’s employment laws place safeguards around employees’ rights, meaning that new owners cannot tinker with people’s jobs at will once they take the bank’s reins.
 For instance, the law says that a business changing hands doesn’t give either the buyer or seller the right to dismiss employees, and the buyer is obliged to honour all obligations that the seller had towards its employees.
 But what this will mean years down the line remains to be seen.
 Experts say it is fair to expect that there will be some rejigging of personnel and roles once when a bank is taken over, if nothing else to avoid the duplication of roles and responsibilities.
 Just how extensive this rejigging would be is impossible to tell at this point, but unions will no doubt be keeping a close eye on any developments, with the Malta Union of Bank Employees calling for “transparency and fairness” in the interest of bank employees.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/inheritance-tax-rented-agricultural-land-waived.1099168,"Amended at 4.25pm
 People who inherit agricultural land that is rented to farmers will no longer have to pay inheritance tax, the agriculture minister announced on Tuesday.
 Heirs of agricultural plots will also be exempt from inheritance taxes if they work the land themselves and are considered “professional farmers”.
 The new measure aims to promote the use of Malta's scarce agricultural land and improve the country’s food security, minister Anton Refalo said.
 “Agricultural land in Malta is scarce, and it’s important that what little land remains is preserved and used,” he said.
 Inheritance tax for agricultural land stood at 5 per cent of property value, meaning that one would have to pay €5,000 on inheriting a field worth €100,000.
 Landowners had often complained that their rights to enjoy their property were being breached because of rural lease laws. They were also barred from raising rents. 
 Since 2022, the government has changed those rules. Now, landowners who want to raise the rent need to suggest a price to the Rural Leases Control Board, which mediates with the farmers. In order to facilitate the board’s computation, the government then published a legal notice in March 2023 with guidelines on how to value agricultural land for agricultural use.
 In the measure announced on Tuesday, people who inherit agricultural land will also be exempt from the tax if they are “professional farmers,” Refalo said.
 New regulations, introduced this summer put farmers into five categories, depending on the amount of yield produced.
 Categories four and five are considered professional farmers. 
 Crop farmers who harvest more than  €47,000 worth of produce a year are in category four. Category 5 farmers need to produce €84,000 or more. 
 Herdsmen need to have an output equating to €53,000 or more to be classified in category four. They need to produce €64,000 worth of products to be put in category five.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/mhra-calls-greater-discretion-allowing-events-public-spaces.1094343,"The Malta Hotels and Restaurants Association (MHRA) has urged authorities to “exercise greater discretion” when granting permissions for events in public spaces, in a thinly veiled reference to a tourist festival taking place outside Valletta.
 Earlier this week, the 'Festa Rocs' event by ROCS Group, one of Malta's largest travel agencies, came under fire from Valletta Cultural Agency chairman Jason Micallef who called it an ""embarrassment"" to the capital city.
 He described the event featuring large white tents outside the city gates as ""cheap"" and a ""ħamallata"" (uncultured) and said it “ridicules a historical location”.
 In a statement on Saturday, the MHRA said that while commercial activities in public spaces “may be legitimate”, they could “clash with the overall image of the area.”
 Stressing the “high-end” appeal of cities like Valletta, the association said “significant investments” had been made in restoring heritage sites and converting abandoned properties into more upmarket offerings.
 “Any public event or activity that contradicts this vision should be relocated,” it said, pointing to “low-quality stands in front of the Malta Court of Justice selling subpar crafts, disorganised entertainment, and shops cluttering the streets with products.”
 The association said it was ""disappointing that, as the peak tourism season begins, the entrance to Valletta has been overtaken by private commercial activities that do not fit the desired image of Valletta.”
 It said this ""not only creates inconvenience by reducing access to Valletta to a few pathways but also undermines the vision authorities and the MHRA have for the city.”
 But reduced access is an issue its members have come under fire for themselves, when an ambulance forced to squeeze past chairs and tables on a Valletta street in March reignited a debate about the use of public space by catering establishments.
 And in April, residents from several towns gathered in the nation’s capital to protest the private sector’s excessive take-up of public space.
 In seeming acknowledgment of the issue, the MHRA said in its statement on Saturday there were “no clear policies and regulations governing the use of tables and chairs in outdoor spaces throughout Valletta.”
 Fears about the impacts of commercial interests on Valletta have featured prominently over the years, with residents almost seven years ago fearing a commercial takeover as the revamped Is-Suq tal-Belt neared completion.
 And the issue has not gone away since, with a report from UN heritage watchdog UNESCO last year raising concerns about the impacts of commercial development on the capital.
 In its statement Saturday, the association said it was ""working closely with the Malta Tourism Authority (MTA) to ensure Valletta offers a high-quality experience as a unique destination” and called on authorities to “exercise greater care and responsibility” when approving events.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/staff-shortages-disrupting-operations-small-businesses-chamber-smes.1100314,"Staff shortages are the most pressing issue small business owners currently face and the problem is impacting their day-to-day operations, a new survey has found. 
 The findings were revealed in the quarterly SME barometer, published on Wednesday by the Chamber of SMEs. The barometer surveyed 432 small business owners on their opportunities and challenges and is carried out in collaboration with Misco. 
 Almost half of all respondents (43%) said employee shortages were the most pressing issue their business is currently facing. 
 This was followed by unfair competition at 22% and traffic congestion at 18%. 
 According to the survey, staff shortages have become gradually more pressing for SMEs throughout 2024, with the number reaching a peak in Q2 and falling to roughly on par with Q1 again in the third quarter. 
 Back in Q4 in 2023, inflation was the uppermost pressing issue on SME owners' minds.  
 When asked what issue is most hindering their day-to-day operation as a business, staff shortages again ranked as the top issue (28%).
 This was followed by traffic congestion at 16%, cashflow at 12% and low client demand at 11%. 
 A lack of staff was also the second-most (18.5%) cited reason when asked what is hindering their company’s growth as a business. The biggest stumbling block to growth, according to business owners, was high operational costs, which was cited by 21% of respondents. 
 Some 16% said that unfair competition was hindering their growth, while 8.5% said they had no interest in growing at all. 
 When asked to elaborate on what skills they feel are sorely lacking from their workforce,  21% said they found technical skills to be most lacking in their staff complement, followed by adaptability and flexibility (16%) and critical thinking (13.5%) 
 Other qualities small business owners said they found lacking among staff are problem-solving (11%), leadership (9%), communication (8%), self-organisation (9%) as well as digital literacy and customer care (5.5%). 
 Elaborating on the results, the Chamber’s chief operations officer Andrew Aquilina said companies are struggling to meet their human resources needs as it has become more difficult to employ third-country nationals. 
 He also said that many felt that they operate on an unequal footing to foreign businesses in Malta, because these enjoy a more favourable corporate tax rate of 5%. 
 When asked what are the two most important issues in the country that they would like to see the government tackling seriously, SMEs first named a lack of good governance (41%), followed closely by overpopulation (39%) and the level of corruption (32%). 
 When asked if they think the country is going in the wrong or right direction, 80% of respondents said that they believe the country is going in the wrong direction, a figure that has climbed from 72% in Q4 of 2023. 
 The inverse can also be seen in respondents who think the country is going in the right direction, with the figure sitting at 20%, down from 28% in Q3 2023. 
 Chamber of SMEs President Paul Abela said that the government must focus on building a more positive business sentiment and urged the implementation of the 2022 election promise to reduce the corporate tax rate from 35% to 25%. 
 The Chamber is also calling on the government to develop comprehensive strategies to address overpopulation, which is being perceived as a growing concern among small businesses, Abela said. 
 This must include initiatives that focus on urban planning, investment in infrastructure and a roadmap to sustainable and balanced demographic growth.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/economic-update-finds-business-conditions-mostly-unchanged.1098522,"The Central Bank of Malta has issued its latest Economic Update. The publication includes the bank’s Business Conditions Index (BCI) which shows that in August 2024, annual growth in business activity was broadly unchanged from July and remained slightly below its historical average estimated since January 2000.
 The European Commission confidence surveys show that sentiment in Malta increased in August, but remained below its long-term average, estimated since November 2002.
 The strongest improvement was recorded in the construction sector, though the sentiment indicator in this sector remained negative. Additional data showed that in month-on-month terms, price expectations decreased across all sectors, bar among consumers.
 The largest decreases were recorded in the services and retail sectors.
  In August, the European Commission’s Economic Uncertainty Indicator (EUI) for Malta increased compared with July, indicating higher uncertainty, with the largest increase recorded in industry. In July, both industrial production and retail trade contracted on a year-on-year basis. In June, services production accelerated when compared with the same month a year ago.
 The unemployment rate decreased to 3.0% in July from 3.1% in June but remained unchanged from July 2023.
 Commercial building permits in July were higher than a year earlier but lower when compared to a month earlier. On the other hand, residential building permits decreased on both a monthly and an annual basis. In August, the number of residential promise-of-sale agreements increased on a year earlier, while final deeds of sale fell.
 The annual inflation rate based on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) stood at 2.4% in August, slightly higher than 2.3% in the previous month, exceeding the euro area average by 0.2 percentage point.
 HICP excluding energy and food in Malta increased to 2.3%, while remaining firmly below the euro area average.
 Inflation calculated on the Retail Price Index (RPI) rose slightly to 1.5% from 1.4% in July.
 In July, Maltese residents’ deposits increased above their level a year ago, driven by balances belonging to households, financial and non-financial corporations.
 Credit to Maltese residents also increased in annual terms, reflecting higher lending to both the government sector and other sectors.
 In July, the Consolidated Fund registered a surplus of €150.2 million, an improvement of €194.1 million when compared with the deficit registered a year earlier. This was due to a rise in government revenue, which was complemented by a decline in government expenditure.
 Overall, the Consolidated Fund balance registered a €60.5 million surplus for the period from January, from a deficit of €302.4 million in the same period a year earlier.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/hsbc-review-considering-range-options-amidst-reports-aps-takeover.1098013,"HSBC’s strategic review process “is at an early stage” and will “consider a range of options”, the company said in a new announcement published on Thursday afternoon.
 The company was following up on an earlier statement published on Wednesday morning in which it declared that it would be carrying out a strategic review of its 70.03% shareholding in the bank.
 Wednesday’s announcement appeared to confirm long-held suspicions that the bank was looking to exit Malta, much in the same way it had shuttered its doors across various other European countries in recent years.
 Inside sources told Times of Malta that the bank’s global shareholders were in  advanced negotiations to sell its shares to APS, with the two parties reportedly already in agreement over various elements of the deal, including its price.
 A second company statement published late on Wednesday night, reacted to these reports, with HSBC Malta saying that ""it is not aware of any such negotiations taking place between the majority shareholder and APS Bank p.l.c. or any other third party but has requested clarification of the position from its majority shareholder""
 But in a statement on Thursday afternoon, HSBC Malta confirmed that having consulted with its majority shareholder, all options are on the table but insists that “no decisions have been made”.
 Meanwhile, in a separate announcement reacting to media reports, APS said that it is “taking note” of HSBC’s decision to undertake a strategic review.
 The bank did not deny or confirm its intention to buy out HSBC Malta’s operations, simply saying that “all its actions and dealings are invariably guided by the highest standards of good governance and due regard of its various regulatory obligations, including the respect for confidentiality”.
 APS pledged to “keep the market informed through company announcements”.
 Meanwhile, in comments to Times of Malta, PN shadow finance minister Graham Bencini said that if HSBC were to leave, they should be replaced by an international bank of similar stature, rather than by a local operator.
 Bencini said that “should the rumours of a potential exit of HSBC be true, then we certainly hope that the government will immediately attract to our shores other major international banks of the calibre of HSBC”.
 According to Bencini, practitioners within the financial services industry are concerned about the impact that HSBC’s departure could have on “our financial service industry, our economy and on our ability to continue attracting Foreign Direct Investment”.
 Bencini said that while reports of the deal remain unconfirmed, “the uncertainty is certainly not beneficial”.
 If HSBC were to leave, Bencini said, PN would be insisting with the relevant authorities that “employment rights, shareholder and consumer interests, together with the interest of our national banking sector, must be protected and looked after by whoever will be acquiring HSBC”.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/maltabased-funds-licences-revoked.1092697,"A Swiss-owned fund based in Malta has had its licence and that of its renewable energy sub-fund revoked by the financial regulator.
 Last week, the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA) announced it had revoked the licences of TTC SICAV plc and TTC Green Energy Fund over a raft of regulatory breaches.
 TTC SICAV plc had failed to appoint a money laundering reporting officer, a compliance officer and an MFSA-approved auditor, and had neglected to replace its administration, the regulator said in a notice posted to its website.
 The fund had also failed to submit its regulatory reporting and provide required information, the MFSA said.
 As well as revoking its licence, the regulator also ordered TTC SICAV plc to change its name and “remove any reference to licensable activities” from information about the fund.
 The fund and its sub fund are owned by a Swiss investor and were granted a licence back in 2013, according to public records.
 The MFSA noted that the window for appeal was still open.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/hsbc-bank-announces-strategic-review-malta-shareholding.1097903,"HSBC's parent company is to carry out a ""strategic review"" of its indirect 70.03% shareholding in HSBC Bank Malta.
 The announcement was made in a statement to the market issued on Wednesday morning. 
 “HSBC Bank Malta p.l.c. (‘the Bank’) announces that HSBC Holdings plc yesterday evening informed the Board of Directors that it will undertake a strategic review of its indirect 70.03% shareholding in the Bank,” it stated in a statement to the stock exchange.
 “The Bank recognises the important role it plays in Malta’s economy and society and is making this announcement in line with its market obligations, and to support the smooth functioning of the public market. The Bank will make further announcements as and when required.”
 Rumours of HSBC exiting the Maltese market have swirled for years, fuelled by the global bank's gradual pivot away from Europe and smaller markets towards Asia.
 In January, the current head of HSBC Malta brushed aside rumours of the bank’s departure from the country, saying he was hired to lead it “for the long run”.
 “I could speak until I’m blue in the face but you just need to look at what we’re doing in Malta”, HSBC Malta boss Geoffrey Fichte told Times of Malta in his first interview since becoming CEO.
 In 2020, the Financial Times reported that the bank was considering whether to wind down its operations in several smaller markets, including Malta.  
 And in May last year, a Reuters report said that the bank was considering an exit from a dozen unnamed countries in Europe as it focused on growing its business in Asia.
 Fichte, however, remained adamant that Malta had nothing to worry about and pointed to the bank’s €30 million investment in its new headquarters as proof of the company’s long-term commitment.
 It was, he said, “HSBC’s largest investment in a headquarters anywhere in Europe and probably the largest investment of any company in Malta in its own headquarters.”
 The bank last year announced a record pre-tax profit €133.9m and followed it up in the first half of this year  with a pre-tax profit €78.6m, up by €19.3m from the same period in 2023, mainly driven by an increase in revenue due to higher interest rates.
 HSBC bank became the leading international financial institution in Malta in 1999, when it bought the government-owned Mid-Med Bank. It accounts for about half of domestic banking activity.
 The bank originally had a toehold in Malta through the operations of its subsidiary Midland Bank which set up a branch here in 1995.
 
 Four years later it acquired Mid-Med Bank for the equivalent of €191 million amid controversy that the government was selling its shares at too low a price. The government had defended its actions, pointing to the importance of Malta having an important international financial player based here as a means to attract international investment.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/watch-winemaker-celebrates-exceptional-red-grape-harvest-hot-summer.1098763," While many will remember the summer for its stifling heat and roasting temperatures, the island’s largest winery will look back at the summer joyfully for producing the best red grape varieties. 
 Standing in the vine fields of Burmarrad a day before the cabernet grape harvest kicked off, Marsovin owner Jeremy Cassar looked at the bunches of grapes bursting with flavour, ready to be picked.
 The harvest season is long, starting in July and ending early October. The cabernet is the last grape to be harvested.
 “We have certainly experienced a great year when it comes to the red grape varieties,” he said. 
 As he handled the grapes, Cassar noted that the last time the winery produced such high-quality cabernet grapes was in 2007, over two decades ago. “We are at the mercy of nature, so to see such perfect, high-quality grapes is a wonderful surprise and a great reward,” he told Times of Malta. 
  Cassar dived deep into the science behind what makes the perfect red grape variety. He explained how heat stress helps the reds develop the right balance of sugars, which gives the wine the perfect body and structure. 
 “The fact that we did not have too many heatwaves and humidity controlled any potential illnesses that might have cropped up,” he explained. Since the warm temperatures remained constant throughout the summer, the grapes underwent an ‘excellent’ maturation period. 
 “The quality of the grapes and the way they have matured present the grapes in a healthy manner. The level of quality we are experiencing is perfect.”
 Wine lovers will have to wait a while before they can have a taste of these perfect grapes as it will take another two years to age, produce and bottle. 
 “It wasn’t a perfect year as we didn’t get enough rainfall, which can also stress red grapes. However, this stress contributed to better grape quality.” 
 Of course, warmer and drier temperatures also had their downfall for the winery. 
 “We usually harvest around 1,000 tons of grapes but we are down by 25 per cent,” he noted. “This means less Maltese grapes, so less Maltese wines.”
 On the other hand, white grapes suffered slightly due to the hot temperatures.
 Cassar said that white grapes usually prefer cooler climates. He noted how, due to the hot temperatures, the white grapes harvest took place earlier this year. The result of an earlier harvest means the white wines will have a slightly lower alcohol value. 
 “I wouldn’t say it is the best year for whites but it is still a good year,” he said. “I always try to look at the glass half full and note that the quality is up and this year has been excellent for reds.”
  While wine grape producers are at the mercy of nature, Cassar said another challenge wineries face is the lack of agricultural land.
 Although Marsovin harvests its grapes from its privately owned estates, it also relies on the 200 contracted Maltese and Gozitan farmers who also harvest grapes for the winemakers.
 An issue brought up year after year and by other winemakers, Cassar said there need to be more opportunities for young farmers to use government-owned land that is tied up in “the wrong hands”. 
 “We are facing an issue where we have an ageing population of farmers and young farmers who wish to do more but do not have access to the land,” he said. 
  “The government is aware of this issue. We have reached a boiling point, and if the situation isn’t resolved, our agricultural sector will be unrecognisable in the next 10 years.”
 In recent years, more locals and foreigners have grown to appreciate Maltese wine, another pushing factor, he argues, to protect the industry. 
 “Without good source material, you cannot produce a good Maltese wine… It would be a pity if the government does nothing to help the industry survive and to ensure more successful harvests which result in good Maltese products.”

https://timesofmalta.com/article/hsbc-shares-plunge-18-bank-indicates-possible-malta-exit.1097946,"Updated 11.15pm with HSBC statement
 HSBC shares plunged more than 18 per cent in trading on the Malta Stock Exchange on Tuesday, as talk of the bank exiting Malta prompted shareholders to look for an exit. 
 Shares closed trading at €1.35, an 18.2% drop having started the day at €1.60. At one point, shares dropped to a low of €1.30 before recovering slightly. In all, just under 80,000 shares were traded throughout the day. 
 The negative swing meant more than €100 million was wiped off HSBC Malta's value following the day's trading. The bank's shares are now trading at their lowest levels since late March. 
 HSBC Bank Malta announced on Wednesday morning that its parent company was reconsidering its shareholding in the company. Rumours about HSBC wanting to exit Malta as it pivots towards Asia have swirled for years, but the bank had previously dismissed such talk as idle speculation. 
 While it was a difficult day for HSBC Malta on the stock exchange, it was an altogether more positive one for APS Bank shareholders.
 APS is in takeover talks with HSBC, with sources familiar with negotiations saying they are at an ""advanced stage"". The bank, however, has yet to make any statement to the market. 
 HSBC Malta said it was not aware of any takeover talks involving APS or any other third party, adding that it has now asked its majority shareholder [the UK-based HSBC Holdings] for clarification about the takeover rumours. 
 APS shares surged by 11.5% to reach €0.58c per share on trading volume amounting to 66,385 shares. It is the bank's highest closing price since May.
 HSBC is Malta's second-largest retail bank and has been a key player in Malta's banking scene since 1999, when it bought out the government-owned Mid-Med Bank. 
 
 APS, whose majority shareholder is the Church, was established in 1910. 
 While both banks have similarly sized loan books, HSBC has a significantly larger high-street presence.
 That is reflected in the amount of customer deposits held by each bank: according to its 2023 accounts, HSBC Malta has just over €6.1 billion in customer deposits as opposed to the €3.1 billion  held by APS.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/new-semiconductor-competence-centre-open-malta.1101186,"A new centre to strengthen expertise in the semiconductor industry is set to open in Malta.
 Addressing a semiconductor conference on Monday, Economy Minister Silvio Schembri said the competence centre will support industry players and provide opportunities for people looking to enter the sector. 
 The centre is part of a European Union initiative to bolster the semiconductor industry. 
 Schembri highlighted how the sector contributes to just over 30% of Malta’s exports.  
 He said the pivotal role played by the semiconductor industry had led the US, China and the EU to all draw up specific legislation and strategies.
 “Competition is fierce, and the industry has been subject to geo-political tensions,” Schembri said. 
 The government plans to launch a specific strategy for the sector that will dovetail with its Vision 2050 plan, he said. Launched last month, the government's Vision 2050 drive seeks to develop what it calls a ""blueprint"" for Malta's development until that date. 
 Stakeholder consultation for this plan will take place in the first quarter of 2025, and the strategy will be finalised by the end of next year, Schembri said.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/lidl-blocked-buying-zabbar-scotts-supermarket-mccaa.1098298,"The competition authority has stopped Lidl from buying a Scotts Supermarket in Żabbar, citing concerns about the budget retailer becoming too dominant in the southern area. 
 In a decision handed down this week, the Malta Competition and Consumer Affairs Authority said it was prohibiting the acquisition - proposed in 2021 - by Lidl Immobiliare Malta Limited of the Żabbar property on Triq Il-Mina Ta' Hompesch belonging to Said Investments Limited.
 According to the competition office, the purchase by Lidl of the existing Scotts supermarket would have allowed Lidl to strengthen its position in the grocery retail market within a 15-minute drive radius. This would limit market competition in the area. 
 Lidl already operates stores in Burmarrad, Santa Venera, San Ġwann, Żejtun, Safi, Luqa, Qormi, Mosta, Sliema and Victoria. 
 It is currently building a new one in Żebbuġ and has just been given the go-ahead to open a twelfth one in  Qormi.
 The MCCAA's probe into the Żabbar purchase started in January 2021.
 Back then the authority had been informed of Lidl's purchase of two divided portions of undeveloped land in Attard, as well as the Burmarrad and Żabbar grocery retail outlets with their operational permits and with vacant possession from Said.
 The notification also covered a promise of assignment and transfer of leases for the portion of land situated near Scotts Supermarket in Burmarrad and leased by Scotts Ltd as a parking area and the premises in Sliema.
 The office was told Lidl would not be acquiring the business carried out by Scotts Ltd - Scotts intended to continue operating its current supermarket business under the same brand name.
 That same year, the MCCAA gave its go-ahead to Lidl's acquisition of the Burmarrad outlet, a lease of a parking area there and its lease of an outlet in Sliema, saying it did not expect those to damage competition within the grocery retail market.
 However, it expressed reservations about Lidl acquiring the Żabbar property.
 Three years on, the MCCAA this week said it was blocking the deal.
 It noted it had received feedback from various stakeholders, including those active in the grocery retail market about the proposed Żabbar store.
 ""Market participants were concerned that the proposed transaction would strengthen Lidl’s position in the grocery retail market, reduce competition, affect the viability of other players in the grocery retail industry and erode consumer welfare.
 ""The office completed a comprehensive analysis to classify grocery stores with a sales area of 200 square meters or more based on their ability to impose competitive constraints in the market. The analysis evaluated stores on price, range, service and quality, determining that 53 out of 87 stores meet the competitive criteria across at least two of these categories, thus classifying them within the relevant product market.""
 The office also assessed the topography of Żabbar, customers’ willingness to travel, diversion ratios derived from an exit-store survey at the current Scotts store and the supermarket's catchment area.
 ""Based on this analysis, the office considers that a 15-minute driving time is a true representation of reality for the willingness to travel for shoppers to do their groceries,"" it said on Friday.
 ""In its competitive assessment, the office also evaluated the potential for entry, exit, and expansion by new entrants and existing players in the market,"" MCCAA added.
 ""This assessment considered the likelihood of such changes materialising, the timeliness of entry or expansion, and their sufficiency – meaning that any change must have adequate scope, effectiveness, and the ability to be sustained over time to meaningfully influence the competitive landscape.""
 It ruled that the transaction would have solidified Lidl’s market position, widening the gap between its competitors and limiting market competition.
 Furthermore, the current levels of market concentration, as well as the increase in the concentration post-acquisition, indicated a substantial lessening of competition, it said.
 This supported the prohibition of the acquisition due to market concentration concerns.
 ""The remedies offered by Lidl during the period of investigation did not adequately address the office’s competition concerns so that it could be concluded that competition would be preserved on a lasting basis.
 ""As a result, the office has decided to prohibit the proposed transaction.""

https://timesofmalta.com/article/emoney-customers-blocked-accounts.1097848,"Customers of a Malta-based electronic money institution (EMI) say they have been unable to access their funds for several days and have received no response when contacting the company for help.
 They also said they have been unable to make cash deposits with Emoney PLC (‘Em@ney PLC’) for more than a month and have been unable to log into their online accounts since last week.
 A company spokesperson said later on Tuesday that a change in management had caused ""technical difficulties"" with its IT systems and that it is working with customers to restore access to their funds. 
 Over the weekend, the company told customers it had discontinued SEPA transfers – a system for transferring funds between European bank accounts – and did not know when it would be able to offer the service in the future.
 Emoney also said it was permanently discontinuing its debit cards while “already working on a new card project” – less than two months after announcing it was partnering with the General Workers’ Union (GWU) to offer debit cards to its members.
 Three years ago, the company was fined €360,000 by the Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit (FIAU) for a series of anti-money laundering breaches concerning clients involved in passport sales, cryptocurrency and with potential links to organised crime.
 When Times of Malta visited the company premises in Pietà on Monday, it was not allowed in, with staff saying the office was not in a suitable state to accommodate visitors following its recent move to offices in Ta’ Xbiex.
 Staff also said they were unable to reach the company director responsible at the time of the visit and refused to share the director’s name, calling it “internal information”.
  In a later response sent by e-mail that only addressed questions about issues with cash deposits, the company said that service had been “discontinued by the new board of directors which took control of the operations of the company around one month ago”.
 It said that “with all due respect to all clients”, cash deposits were a “very limited niche service used by a handful of clients in 2024 for a negligible turnover”.
 Emoney said the new directors believed the company “should focus on innovative solutions rather than on cash management”.
 As such, there was “no issue to be solved, this service no longer falls under the services the company is going to offer to its customers going forward,” it said.
 The issues affecting the company were first flagged by cannabis association owners, who said they had been left with no other option but to open an account with Emoney when launching due to mainstream banks not offering them accounts at the time.
 Times of Malta understands that most, if not all, cannabis associations had or still operate accounts with Emoney, leaving the sector particularly vulnerable to the recent problems.
 
 But the issues do not appear to be confined to business customers in Malta; comments posted to Emoney’s Facebook page and in a group dedicated to financial services in Malta indicate customers in Italy are also facing similar problems.
  Yesterday, a pop-up on the company’s website said it had “reached a milestone” and was introducing a new IT system, while asking customers to contact its support department by e-mail so it could “explain how to access the new system”.
 But association owners who spoke to Times of Malta on condition of anonymity said that despite repeated e-mails to the company, they have yet to receive further information. 
 One owner said he had been unable to access funds of around €13,000 for five days, adding that while he understood IT issues could happen, “the fact that e-mails aren’t being replied to is worrying”.
 Explaining the login issues, he said account holders used to be asked for their ‘user code’ (account number) and an authentication code provided by SMS. As of this week, the Emoney website requests users to provide their user code and a password.
 None of the Emoney customers Times of Malta spoke to said they had been provided with a password for their account.
  Another association owner said the issues were “affecting us a lot” and that he had been unable to pay salaries since July after not being able to access the more than €4,000 held in his association’s Emoney account.
 “We were told we couldn’t deposit cash but were given no reason; when we asked, they said they were not in a position to tell us,” he said, adding he had contacted the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA) about the matter last month.
 “Now I can’t even log in; I sent an e-mail on Thursday requesting access and I still haven’t had a reply... I’m worried.”
 Association owners also report being given different explanations for the outages; one said they had been attributed to a change in company director, while another said the company had told him they were undergoing a “periodic review” by the FIAU, during which time account services would be unavailable.
 “I don’t understand how they can just freeze accounts, this is unheard of,” one person said. “It’s not as professional as you’d expect a bank to be.”
 Another owner said he had been e-mailing the company “constantly” but had been unable to access his account for three days.
 Describing being asked to contact the company to ask for access to his account “really strange”, he said he hoped to change to a mainstream bank soon.
 Association owners said Emoney charged them an account fee of €1,500 per year.
 While BOV said it has been offering accounts to cannabis associations since August last year, sources said the bank had only started opening bank accounts from April after being assured of associations meeting strict regulations by the authority governing the sector.
 Times of Malta understands that only two cannabis associations have bank accounts with BOV at the time of publication.
 The GWU said that, due to the planned partnership being in its “initial stages, no member has been negatively affected by the potential withdrawal of EMoney’s services”.
 It said that, although it had not been “officially informed of any developments relating to EMoney’s operations”, it was “monitoring the situation” to assess the service’s applicability to its members.
 In a statement on Tuesday, a spokesperson for the company said a “significant change in management” had led to difficulties with its IT (information technology) infrastructure.  
 The spokesperson said the company had encountered “technical difficulties” while changing IT provider from one owned by the previous management, who had also refused to hand over customer data.  
 “Unfortunately, the previous management has also been uncooperative in providing customer data, which has contributed to further delays in releasing funds for some customers,” the spokesperson said.  
 He said Emoney had asked customers to provide updated KYC (‘know your customer’) information and that it had been “working to release funds to several customers who have completed their updated KYC due diligence paperwork.” 
 The spokesperson called the requirement “a necessary step to comply with regulatory requirements and to ensure the continued security and legitimacy of all accounts.” 
 Describing the situation as “delicate and complex,” he said the company was “working around the clock to resolve any outstanding issues” and that it deeply regretted any inconvenience. 
 In a terse response on Tuesday afternoon, the MFSA said supervisory and enforcement actions were carried out in confidentiality.
 It added that enforcement actions were published on the MFSA website.
 Questions sent to the FIAU on Monday remain unanswered at the time of publication.

 Staff standing outside said they had been told to leave the Fort Business Centre shortly before 9am, with fire crews on site saying they attended the scene shortly after.
 By 9.45am, the fire was extinguished and business centre staff began to return to the building.
 No injuries were reported.
 While there were reports of the nearby Quad complex also being affected, when Times of Malta visited the site on Monday morning access to the site was not restricted and business activity was continuing as usual.
  The Fort Business Centre is home to several companies including Evolution AB, a gaming company, and accounting firm Grant Thornton.
 Times of Malta understands that while the MFSA building was not affected by the fire, its staff were also evacuated as a precautionary measure.
 Details of which company’s server room was responsible for the fire were unavailable.
 The fire marked the second blaze to strike Malta on Monday morning, after a car caught fire on the Marsa-Ħamrun bypass, leading to heavy traffic until around 9am.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/hsbc-receives-a-number-bidders-malta-bank.1101661,"Updated 11am with bank comment
 A ""number"" of bidders have shown interest in acquiring HSBC Holdings' indirect 70% shareholding in its Malta bank, according to a company announcement published on Thursday morning.
 It has not revealed the identity of the interested parties and how many there might be. 
 
 Last September,  Times of Malta reported that negotiations between APS and HSBC’s global shareholders had been underway for more than two years, ever since it became apparent that HSBC Malta was looking to wind down its operations.
 HSBC Malta reacted by saying it did not know of any such talks, but in a public announcement confirmed it was carrying out a strategic review and was considering “a range of options”.
 On Friday, Archbishop Charles Scicluna said contrary to what many have suggested, the possibility of APS Bank acquiring HSBC Malta is “far from being a done deal"".
 In a company announcement on Thursday morning, HSBC Bank Malta said it would be convening an extraordinary general meeting to obtain shareholder approval to allow interested parties to conduct due diligence checks and take negotiations to the next level. 
 Times of Malta understands that all of the bids received are non-binding. 
 
 HSBC implied as much in its announcement, stressing that ""no decisions have been made"" and that its parent company, HSBC Continental Europe, ""continues to consider a full range of options"". 
 The extraordinary general meeting can only take place in January at the very earliest, as HSBC's articles of association require a minimum of 46 days to pass from the moment items are added to the agenda of a shareholder meeting to it being held.
 But sources told Times of Malta that the EGM is likely to be held significantly later, in late February or early March.
 Following the announcement, an HSBC Bank Malta spokesperson said the bank will continue to comply with its banking confidentiality and data privacy obligations at all times.
 ""These are continuing obligations for the bank and will remain applicable even during any due diligence process that is undertaken.""
 Rumours of HSBC exiting the Maltese market have swirled for years, fuelled by the global bank's gradual pivot away from Europe and smaller markets towards Asia.
 In 2020, the Financial Times reported that the bank was considering whether to wind down its operations in several smaller markets, including Malta.  
 And in May last year, a Reuters report said that the bank was considering an exit from a dozen unnamed countries in Europe as it focused on growing its business in Asia.
 HSBC has been a presence in Malta since June 1999 when it acquired a 70.03% stake in Mid-Med Bank.
 It is the second largest bank in Malta with a 21% market share, following Bank of Valletta, which has a 44% share. APS is the third largest bank with an 11% share of the market.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/economic-growth-expected-moderate-remain-strong-central-bank.1093759,"Malta’s GDP is expected to grow by 4.3% in 2024 but then ease to 3.5% in 2025 and 2026, the Central Bank of Malta said in a statement on Monday. 
 This represents a marginally downward revision for 2025, but an upward revision for 2026 when compared to the Bank’s previous projections.
 In its report, the Central Bank said that growth in 2023 was primarily driven by net exports, while domestic demand is expected to be the main growth driver in 2024. 
 It also found that private consumption growth continues at a brisk pace while private investment, is expected to gradually recover.
 Net exports are also projected to contribute positively, driven mainly by services exports. Domestic demand is expected to continue leading growth in 2025 and 2026. 
 Employment growth is set to moderate while the average wage is also expected to grow at a faster rate in 2024, partially due to pronounced inflation and a tight labour market. 
 Annual inflation based on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices is projected to drop significantly, from 5.6% in 2023 to 2.4% in 2024, before reaching 1.9% by 2026. 
 Compared to previous projections, inflation has been revised down by 0.5 percentage points in 2024.
 The general government deficit-to-GDP ratio is set to decline to 4.1% in 2024 and narrow down to stand at 3.1% by 2026. 
 The general government debt-to-GDP ratio is set to reach 54.3% by 2026. When compared with the previous projection round, the projected deficit ratio is higher, while the debt ratio is broadly unchanged.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/keep-electoral-promise-25-corporate-tax-chamber-smes-urges-government.1097989,"The government has been urged by the Chamber of SMEs to keep a 2022 electoral promise and lower corporate tax to 25% for local companies in the upcoming budget.
 The proposal is part of a package of 18 recommendations suggested by the chamber to support business and encourage investment and innovation. 
 It said that lowing corporate tax from 35% to 25% would help incentivise compliance and stimulate economic growth. 
 The Labour Party had pledged to lower corporate tax during its last general election campaign and the opposition had made a similar proposal.
 ""Despite being in the electoral manifesto and obtaining cross party agreement, so far we have not seen its implementation, despite its numerous benefits for local businesses and the economy at large,"" the chamber said. 
  Prime Minister Robert Abela recently raised expectations of a planned tax cut of 'historic' proportions that would target the middle class but did not give any further details. 
 The chamber also called for an extension of the tax bracket for the self employed, of which account for around 35,000 workers in Malta.
 The current system means that individuals earning €26,831 pay the same NI as those earning much higher incomes, such as €100,000.
 The chamber, formerly the GRTU, also repeated its calls for a change to the Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA) mechanism, saying it no longer accurately reflects inflation or the financial pressures workers and employers face.
 It suggests that the mechanism could be adapted to offer higher COLA increases for low-income earners, thereby safeguarding their purchasing power.
 One of the Chamber’s key proposals is the creation of a COLA fund. Businesses would fund this through a small percentage of their annual revenues, including contributions from foreign-owned companies.
 The aim is to distribute the cost burden more evenly across all businesses.
 Businesses contributing to the COLA fund would be eligible for a refund, subsidy, grant, or tax credit, equivalent to a set percentage of the COLA costs incurred.
 The Malta Chamber of SMEs represents over 7,000 members across 12,000 business outlets.
 The Chamber's proposals focus on four main pillars: Incentivising Investment, Supporting Good Business, Self-Employed and Micro-Enterprises, and Anticipating the Future of Work.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/housing-expensive-affordable-study-says.1096874,"Housing has become significantly more expensive for first-time buyers over the past two decades... while remaining just as affordable, according to a recent study.
 Over the last 20 years, house prices increasingly outstripped household income, with couples in the early 2000s spending almost four times their combined income on property, and nearly six times their earnings by 2022.
 Meanwhile, single buyers saw property prices rise from around seven times their salary to almost 11 times their annual income over the same period, according to the House purchase affordability for first time buyers in Malta research paper.
 But according to the paper’s author and Housing Authority policymaker, Brian Micallef, despite the increase in prices, housing affordability remained stable.
 Micallef has developed a Housing Affordability Index (HAI) – a metric used by estate agents to measure to what extent an average household can afford a typical home – “specifically targeted for first-time buyers for the period 2000 to 2022”.
  His index shows that despite house prices going up considerably, housing affordability stayed largely unchanged by the end of the two decades – if anything, becoming slightly more affordable.
 Micallef attributes the static affordability – albeit with some peaks and troughs such as the radically lower affordability following the 2008 financial crash – to low interest rates.
 “Price-to-income ratios do not take into consideration financing costs which, until 2022, have been trending downwards over the past two decades. Hence, despite the rise in the price-to-income ratios, the HAI has remained above the threshold value of 100,” he writes.
 But Micallef’s HAI does not take deposits and other costs such as notary fees into account, assuming buyers have already saved enough for a downpayment.
 KPMG data published in November showed the median price of apartments had shot up from around €142,000 in 2013 to €280,000 last year – pushing median deposits up from €14,000 to €28,000.
 And Micallef acknowledges that accumulating such deposits “takes time and is no easy feat, especially in the absence of parental support”.
 Taking the example of a property worth around €217,000 – requiring a deposit of €21,000 – he stresses this “represents more than a year’s salary... and more than half of the minimum income required to qualify for a loan”.
 But despite the radical rise in deposits and price-to-income ratios, Micallef does not seem to believe housing has become less affordable.
 Describing the country as a “nation of homeowners”, he notes home ownership has stayed constant at around 80 per cent.
 He says that while there is an “increasingly widespread preoccupation that housing in Malta is not affordable”, variability of house prices in different areas and “trade-offs” in property type and size could skew the overall picture.
 “These trade-offs could exacerbate perceptions of an affordability crisis especially if borrowers evaluate affordability in relation to some reference group or historical experience, such as their parents or friends.”
 Micallef argues that when looking at housing affordability, one should move away from “economy-wide averages” and instead focus on first-time buyers, “especially those with low-to-medium levels of income” – who, he argues, “differ significantly” from median households.
 And with historically low inflation seemingly at an end, at least for now, something Micallef warns “will exert additional pressure on housing affordability”, he suggests that “going forward, assessments of affordability should move away from simply considering median or averages and instead emphasise the distribution of housing and incomes”.
 Micallef’s study, published recently, comes just a few months after a local architecture firm said a different HAI showed property was more affordable today than it was in the 1980s.

 Independent candidate Arnold Cassola has sent a letter to Judge Joseph Zammit McKeon, asking that the public inquiry looking into the death of Jean Paul Sofia also interview the others who were injured in the building collapse.
 Sofia had lost his life when a building collapsed in Corradino last December. On Monday, following months of pressure, the Prime Minister made a U-turn and announced the launch of a public inquiry.
 In a letter to Judge Zammit McKeon, who will be leading the public inquiry, Cassola said that there were also five people injured in the collapse.
 These were three Albanians aged 53, 24 and 21, a man from Bosnia of 69 years and a Maltese man from St Paul's Bay aged 43. ""They were mentioned on the day of the tragedy, and then vanished,"" Cassola writes.
 ""Strangely, the police never gave updates about their medical states, which they usually do. According to unconfirmed information, one of them lost vision in one eye whilst another lost a leg. According to unconfirmed information, the five injured were paid an amount of money to remain silent and the foreigners were sent back to their countries to make sure they do not speak out.""
 Cassola asked the Judge to identify these individuals and for them to be brought back to Malta to testify in the public inquiry. He also asked that an investigation be conducted examining why the police and medical authorities never provided an update on their condition. ""Who, if true, decided that everything should remain a mystery? Who, if true, ordered that they are to be paid for their silence? Who, if true, decided that they are to be flown out of Malta?,"" Cassola asked.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/man-forgives-cousin-stabbing-because-hungry.1092005,"A  man charged with stabbing his cousin in the shoulder while he was cooking, told police that he “lost control” because he had been fasting all day and could not smoke during Ramadan.
 Magistrate Marsanne Farrugia heard Police Inspector John Zammit testify in the compilation of evidence against Abdelaziz Lakehal, 50, from Morocco who is pleading not guilty to seriously injuring his cousin when he stabbed him in their Zebbug apartment on April 4.
 Ramadan is the holy month in the Islamic calendar. It is a month of fasting, worship, service, communal gathering, and spiritual development. Muslims taking part in Ramadan do not eat or drink anything during daylight hours, eating one meal just before dawn and another after sunset. This year it spanned March 10 and April 9.
 Police Inspector John Sammit explained how the victim went to Zebbuġ police station on April 4, accompanied by his sister. He was bleeding, and was rushed to hospital in an ambulance. The injured man was initially unable to speak, but he eventually told police that his cousin had stabbed him in the shoulder.
 The incident took place at around 7pm. Before the stabbing, Lakehal had been smashing plates and other kitchen items and the victim, who was cooking, had asked him to stop.
 Shortly afterwards, he said, he felt something sting his left shoulder and turned his head to see blood pouring out and the defendant holding a bloodstained knife.
 In his statement to the police, he said Lakehal immediately apologised and said that he did not intend to stab him.
 The victim declared that he forgave his cousin.
 “He told us he was hungry due to Ramadan and could not smoke so he lost control,” the inspector said.
 Inspector Sammut prosecuted with Etienne Savona and Manuel Grech from the Office of the Attorney General.
 Defence lawyer Nicholas Mifsud and legal procurator Colin Galea represented the accused. Lawyer Noel Bianco represented the victim.

Paul Borg, of Ħaż-Żebbuġ, was convicted by a jury of attempting to kill Mario Grech in 2020, and of causing him grievous bodily harm in an earlier incident which took place a year before.  The jury had reached an 8-1 vote on the charge of attempted murder and returned a guilty verdict on every charge other than that of causing wilful damage to third-party property.  During proceedings, it was revealed how four years ago, Borg had flung two brick tiles towards Mario Grech, his neighbour's father, after spotting him working on a property belonging to Grech's son.  According to expert testimony, the force of the impact would have killed Grech, had the latter not acted swiftly and avoided the bricks. A year prior, Borg had also assaulted Grech with a broomstick.  Although defence lawyer Edward Gatt noted that the defendant's actions could not be condoned, he simultaneously labelled the verdict a 'freak verdict'.  The prosecution noted the strength of the jury vote, citing that such should be reflected by the punishment meted.  In its judgment, the Court stated that a punishment towards the minimum was to be applied. It noted that whilst the jury vote was almost unanimous, no wounds had actually resulted.  Borg's wife, visibly emotional, testified that her husband had never caused trouble, and that Mario Grech was always the instigator.  Borg was also fined €4,000.       """
https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/court_and_police/129286/court_orders_pilatus_inquiry_in_muscats_libel_case_against_daphne_caruana_galizia,"""The magistrate in Joseph Muscat's libel case against Daphne Caruana Galizia has ordered the Pilatus Bank magisterial inquiry to be included in the case records.  It emerged during today’s sitting that presiding Magistrate Victor Axiak had handed down a decree in which he ordered the Registrar of the Court to exhibit a copy of the proces verbal of the Pilatus inquiry on a USB drive.   Muscat’s lawyer Pawlu Lia told the court that he had not been notified with the decree and had only just seen it, but objected to the order.   Lia cited article 518 of the Criminal Code, which prohibits the acts of criminal cases being shown to anyone apart from the lawyers and parties involved without special permission of the court - unless they are read out in open court.   In support of his arguments, Lia invited the magistrate to review the decree recently handed down by Mr. Justice Toni Abela rejecting a similar request made in the PN’s civil damages case arising out of the Vitals hospital deal.    “This proces verbal, as far as I know, has nothing to do with [Caruana Galizia’s Egrant] story and I have no knowledge of it. That the court imposes something like this on a party, without me knowing what’s in it, when in libel cases the person making the libellous allegation must be the one in a position to substantiate their story with evidence…” Muscat’s lawyer complained.  Lia told the court that he knew nothing beyond that which had been published in the media. “That is what you are saying. The court does not agree,” replied the magistrate.  Defence lawyer Joe Zammit Maempel added that the decrees and proces verbal were going to be exhibited in their entirety, in around four weeks time in a separate constitutional case being heard by Madame Justice Doreen Clarke. Zammit Maempel added that he had summonsed Robert Aquilina to testify today about its conclusions.  Lia asked his counterpart what exhibiting the inquiry file would prove, but was called out by the magistrate. “You are not being reasonable. This is also in the interests of your client,” explained the court, pointing out that the case had originally been filed as urgent.   But Lia insisted, telling the magistrate that the Criminal Court had already “investigated the articles and reached its conclusions on the basis of what the defendant testified on three separate occasions. “  “What has emerged in this case, did so through a breach of the law, by someone who now wants to be hailed as a hero…” Lia said, being called to order by the magistrate before he could finish.  The lawyer earned himself further rebuke when he told the court that the person who was leaking this information was committing a crime, later clarifying that he was referring to Aquilina, but “this court is willing to lend him an ear.”   Zammit Maempel replied that “so far it is your client who is facing criminal charges.”  In reply to Lia’s question about the relevance of evidence against his client emerging from cases which weren’t his and which he didn’t know anything about, Zammit Maempel retorted that it was “because what happened in Pilatus Bank came out of Egrant.”  The lawyer went on to inform the court that on June 17, the proces verbal would be exhibited as part of the Constitutional case filed by Repubblika against the AG which is being heard by Madam Justice Doreen Clarke.  Magistrate Axiak therefore adjourned the case to July.   The libel case had been filed against Daphne Caruana Galizia by former Prime Minister Joseph Muscat following a 2017 story published on her Running Commentary blog, which claimed that a secret offshore company, Egrant, had been set up in Panama in the name of Muscat’s wife, Michelle.  In the wake of the story’s publication, Muscat had requested a magisterial inquiry to investigate those claims.  That inquiry which had been conducted by then-Magistrate Aaron Bugeja, had concluded there was no documentation linking the Muscat family to the Panama company, with a UK-based forensic accounting firm also failing to find any evidence linking the Muscats to Egrant Inc on the servers of now-shuttered Pilatus Bank.   Muscat’s insistence on continuing the case had earned him a rebuke in 2019 from the Council of Europe’s Human Rights Commissioner, who had pointed out that the ongoing libel cases were putting unwarranted psychological and financial pressure on the journalist's heirs. Dunja Mijatović had argued at the time that such persistence could translate into an intimidation of the murder victim’s family and that it cast doubt on the Maltese authorities’ commitment to finding and bringing the masterminds of Caruana Galizia’s assassination to justice.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/police-hitandrun-trial-go-ahead-six-years-simon-schembri-lost-arm.1094378,"A breach of rights claim by Liam Debono, blocking his trial over the hit-and-run incident that severely injured traffic policeman  Simon Schembri, was definitively thrown out on Monday morning. 
 Debono is awaiting trial over the near-fatal incident which took place in May 2018 when the then-17-year-old was driving a third party’s silver Mercedes without a licence or a seat belt when he mowed down the officer.
 Schembri was dragged several metres along the tarmac surface of the Luqa road where the incident took place, suffering extensive injuries to his limbs, upper body and lungs. 
 One of his arms had to be amputated. The injuries resulted in some 60 per cent permanent debility. Schembri has since retired.
 The underage driver was arrested after a police car chase.
 He was subsequently arraigned, pleading not guilty to grievously injuring the victim and a raft of other charges stemming from that incident. 
 The youth was granted bail during those criminal proceedings, months into the compilation of evidence. 
 
 But in May 2019 he landed in fresh trouble when he was spotted by an off-duty policeman driving a beige Fiat Uno in Luqa. His “slouching” position behind the wheel triggered the officer’s suspicion. 
 A month later, Debono was found guilty of that separate incident whereby he had breached a court-imposed driving ban, bail conditions and previous court orders.
 He was condemned by a Magistrates’ Court to a five-year effective jail term, a 10-year driving ban and forfeiture of some €60,000 in bail money.
 Debono did not appeal that conviction. 
 But two years later, in April 2021, he filed constitutional proceedings claiming that his fundamental rights were breached. 
 His claims were twofold.
 Assisted by a legal aid lawyer, Debono argued that since his personal lawyer had refused to assist him in the separate proceedings concerning the second incident and refused to renounce his brief, he was deprived of his right to appeal. 
 Other lawyers would not take up the brief unless his previous lawyer granted the client release. 
 Debono also argued that he was targeted by negative publicity which would likely prejudice his position at the trial over the 2018 incident and that also breached his fundamental rights. 
 His case was thrown out by the First Hall, Civil Court in its constitutional jurisdiction last year because the applicant had failed to exhaust ordinary remedies. 
 Debono appealed that decision and the Constitutional Court delivered judgment on Monday. 
 Chief Justice Mark Chetcuti, together with Justices Giannino Caruana Demajo and Anthony Ellul, observed that with respect to Debono’s first claim, all he had produced was his own “brief and bare” testimony.
 Debono had insisted that he could not appeal the five-year conviction because his personal lawyer refused to grant his release. 
 But when asked if he had tried to engage a lawyer, Debono replied, “No, no. I didn’t [have one]”.
 He said his own mother had ended up in police custody two days after the Magistrate’s judgment and he thus had no help. 
 However, the court observed that Debono produced no other independent evidence to corroborate his version.
 Nor had he sought assistance from the Legal Aid agency during the 15-working day timeframe for the appeal. 
 He had, in fact, been assisted by a legal aid lawyer when the judgment was delivered in 2019 and he had immediately given notice of appeal.
 Although the state-funded lawyer was appointed to assist him before the magistrate but not at the appeal stage, there was no evidence that the legal aid agency had refused or failed to extend that assistance to the filing of an appeal. 
 The Constitutional Court also questioned why Debono waited two years after that conviction before filing his breach of rights case.
 As for the alleged negative coverage by the media, the court observed the case concerning the hit-and-run incident “shocked the country, [and] so one would expect extensive coverage by the media”.
 However, the applicant failed to prove that he was targeted by a “harsh media campaign” that could prejudice potential jurors and result in a lack of fair trial. 
 Moreover, there was nothing stopping Debono from opting to have his case decided by a judge without a jury if he feared that jurors might be impartial. 
 He could also ask his lawyer to request the judge to address jurors, directing them to base their considerations only on evidence produced in court. 
 That was something the judge could do even without being asked.
 And in case of a guilty verdict, the accused would have the right to appeal to a superior court presided by three judges. 
 When all was considered the court turned down Debono’s appeal. 
 Last year, pending the outcome of these constitutional proceedings and with his criminal trial put off sine die (indefinitely), Debono was granted bail after a psychologist told the Criminal Court that she had witnessed ‘gradual improvement’ in the accused’s behaviour.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/live-blog-chris-cardona-testify-vitals-case.1096995,"Chris Cardona did not read a Memorandum of Understanding with Vitals Global Healthcare before signing it back in 2014, the former minister testified on Wednesday.
 Cardona, who served as minister between 2013 and 2020, said he signed the MOU and others like it because he was “told to do so”.
 “I signed it and that’s it,” he said of the MOU, which he said he only saw on the day of it being signed and again when he was questioned about it by the National Audit Office, years later.
 He said there was nothing unusual about that, as MOUs were not legally binding and preceded advanced due diligence work. He signed several such MOUs as minister and often did not know much about them, he testified.
 The MOU with Vitals focused on a proposal to develop a hospital and medical school in Gozo and it was allowed to lapse because the government decided it wanted a “total revamp” of the national healthcare system, Cardona said.
 That MOU preceded a public procurement process to revamp and run three state hospitals – a process awarded to the MOU signatory, Bluestone Investments through its subsidiary Vitals Global Healthcare.
 But Cardona said he had nothing to do with the broader concession and only knew what the media has reported about it.
 The National Audit Office had concluded in 2020 that Vitals should have been barred from bidding for the hospitals deal, given its MOU with the government.
 That deal was annulled by a court last year, which concluded it was tainted by fraud. A magistrate’s probe into the deal led prosecutors to charge former prime minister Joseph Muscat with corruption, bribery and money laundering in the deal.
 Former minister Konrad Mizzi and Muscat’s former chief of staff Keith Schembri are among others facing criminal charges.
 Summoned to testify in the case on Wednesday, Cardona recalled top Malta Enterprise official Mario Galea telling him to “just sign the MOU”. 
 “They told me we have to sign this MOU. It was to set up a sustainable health system and its main drive was to attract medical tourism. It referred to a Gozo Medical Complex. I signed it because I was responsible for Malta Enterprise.”
 Cardona said he believed the MOU was signed at the Office of the Prime Minister but categorically excluded having ever discussed it with Muscat, the prime minister at the time.
 “If he were, I would recall,” Cardona said.
 Apart from Cardona, the court heard testimony from a number of top officials at PWC, which was engaged by Bluestone, Vitals and Steward Health Care, which took over the concession, on various occasions between 2014 and 2022.
 PwC was initially engaged by Bluestone to work on its business plan for the MOU signed with the government, then again to help draft the company’s bid for the hospitals concession.
 In their testimony, company officials emphasised that their work was purely advisory, to “help” clients.
 “We were just the modellers”, director Angelique Spina said. “At the end of the day, the model belongs to the client.”
 That characterisation drew a note of exasperation from defence lawyers, who said it was not clear what the firm was paid to do.
 “Our job is not to verify [documents],” the witness replied. “We updated numbers in an Excel sheet concerning the financial package. And we handled project management.
 When pressed on the firm’s work – “even I could input numbers into Excel,” defence lawyer Stefano Filletti remarked – the witness said the sheet was a complex one with several figures that required expertise.
 The client was happy with the work done and ultimately submitted that document, she added.
 A representative of legal firm Ganado Advocates also testified. The firm was engaged by Projects Malta to advise on how to award an eventual hospitals concession, and advised the government that it should do so through a public request for proposals, lawyer Antoine Cremona testified.
 Privatising the hospitals could not be done through a simple MOU, Cremona said, and the firm considered the MOU that the government had signed with Bluestone to be a “non-entity”.
 “The only issue was that it could have given some undue advantage to third parties,” he testified. Ganado raised that issue, he said, but stopped short of advising the government to exclude the company from the project.
 The government went ahead and prepared a public procurement process for the privatisation deal, Cremona said, and asked Ganado for input on the concession’s wording.
 Cremona said that the firm had various concerns about the way in which an initial draft of the concession was amended by the government, and circulated a second draft in July 2015.
 It never got a reply to that email and had nothing else to do with the project, Cremona said.
 1.58pm That’s all for today’s court session. The next sitting is scheduled for September 23 and is likely to be a long one – eight witnesses are due to testify. 
 We’ll have a summary of the day’s key points of testimony available at the top of this article very soon. Thank you for having joined us for this live blog. 
 1.54pm The witness is on the backfoot here – defence lawyers are pushing her to explain, in tangible terms, what exactly PWC did for Bluestone. What does “modellers” mean, they want to know.
 The witness says that financial models were highly complex and that their job was to ensure numbers provided tallied. 
 “We were updating the financial package numbers in the Excel sheet. We made sure that the numbers reflected the work. Another task was project management, which although sounding simple, is not simply a checklist,” the witness says. 
 That prompts some derision from defence lawyer Stefano Filletti, who says “even I could add numbers to an Excel sheet.” 
 It was a very complex sheet, the witness replies, and one that required expertise. 
 When it came to Steward, their work was more focused on accounting issues. Steward had in-house accountants but required more technical expertise, she says. 
 1.28pm PWC director Angelique Spina testifies. Spina helped with a number of the company’s assignments with Bluestone. She repeats what her colleagues said – that initial onboard raised no red flags, that the company prepared various documents at the company’s request, and that their contact person was Ram Tumuluri. 
 Spina says that the brief concerning the RFP was much bigger in scope and involved significant capital expenditure.
 But PWC were “just the modellers”, she says. “At the end of the day, the model belongs to the client.”
 12.56pm The next witness is PWC partner Lucienne Pace Ross She recalls the firm looking up Mark Pawney and Ram Tumuluri as part of initial KYC (Know Your Client) procedures when engaged by Bluestone, but found no red flags. 
 The first engagement letter was to help Bluestone draft a business plan. The second was to help the company with its RFP submission. Then in July 2015 they were asked to help the company update its financial model, and in May 2016 they were asked to review a model prepared by the company’s financial advisors.
 In July 2016 they were asked to carry out a high-level assessment of the concession and in November 2022 they were engaged by Steward Health Care [which effectively bought out Vitals] to help update financial projections. 
 Those weren’t the only jobs PWC did for Bluestone and later Steward: it also provided technical accounting advice and tax advisory services to them, the witness says. Its two last assignments were not executed as PWC terminated its services to the client after a court annulled the hospitals concession. 
 12.45pm Defence lawyer Stefano Filletti wants to hear more about Ganado’s view of the MOU. Cremona says the firm “gave no weight” to the MOU, as they believed the concession should be granted through a public procurement process. The MOU was a “non entity”, Cremona says.
 “The only issue was that MOU could have given some undue advantage to third parties.”
 Answering a question by defence lawyer Jason Grima, Cremona says he is not aware that Projects Malta “wanted to cancel that MOU”. 
 That's all from this witness. 
 12.38pm Ganado worked on the project for five-and-a-half months and saw nothing illegal about it. The firm or its representatives was not asked to testify in the magisterial inquiry into the case.
 The witness highlights issues which “did not make legal sense” to them. One was the fact that the concession could be extended. Another concerned the MOU – other firms could contest it, he said.
 The witness is asked if they you advised that the company signing the MOU [Bluestone/Vitals] should be excluded from the RFP. “No, but we said that it could give rise to contestation,” Cremona replies. 
 12.26pm Answering questions from defence lawyer Giannella de Marco, the witness says Ganado was not involved any more in the case after that July 24 email. 
 Pressed by De Marco, he says Ganado was also engaged by the government to work on arbitration proceedings involving the [now annulled] concession. 
 He says, when questioned, that Ganado never met Joseph Muscat to discuss the concession. 
 12.15pm  Cremona says their letter of engagement with Projects Malta was signed in 2015. There was just one letter of engagement.
 Ganado was informed of the MOU in the first phase of their legal advice, he says. But in their view, the concession had to be opened to public bids as part of a competitive RFP process. “No MOUs,” he says.
 The Irish expert engaged to assess EU law also believed that was the best practice. And that advice was taken up. 
 12.10pm Ganado was engaged by Projects Malta but dealt with their instructing counsel, Mifsud Bonnici. The company was paid for its work, Cremona says. 
 The magistrate wants to know more about the “great sense of urgency” surrounding the project.
 Cremona recalls David Galea pressing, but says that more generally “there was always a sense of haste in the project.” 
 12.05pm Ganado sent a first draft of the concession text to Mifsud Bonnici, Galea and other team members on July 11. 
 “They came back with substantial amendments,” Cremona recalls. Those amendments were “not viable” in Ganado’s view, he says. 
 Ganado sent a second draft on July 24. They never received a reply and never heard anything more about the project, Cremona says. There was one other email on July 25 regarding a labour supply agreement, but it had nothing to do with the procurement team.
 “We were never involved in evaluation, negotiations with bidders or adjudication,” he emphasises.  
 12pm Cremona says the firm was never explicitly told that the government had accepted its advice to issue a public call for the concession, but that they surmised that after Mifsud Bonnici contacted them in March to give them points to include in the RFP.
 Other firms were also working on the project, he says, recalling that RSM [an audit firm hired as consultants on the project and headed at the time by George Gregory] had sent a draft ahead of the March 27 RFP issue. 
 Towards the end of May, Ganado was again approached by Mifsud Bonnici and David Galea of BEAT [another consultancy firm engaged]. They were asked to draft the legal side of the concession agreement, to provide government with a legal backbone when negotiating throughout the summer.
 11.52am Lawyer Antoine Cremona is the next witness. He works for Ganado Advocates, who provided services to Projects Malta and Health Ministry ahead of the RFP. 
 The firm provided services between February and July 2015, he recalls. Ganado partner Stephen Attard led that effort and the work came after Attard was approached by lawyer Aron Mifsud Bonnici to help with a foreign investor in the health sector.
 Their job was to work on a public service concession.
 “Our role was to give advice on what legal framework was needed for the investment,” Cremona recalls. “It was not a real estate deal, but it needed public procurement.”
 He notes that the EU had at the time issued a directive regulating public service concessions. That directive had not been transposed into Maltese law yet, but Ganado advised that it should still be taken into consideration. An Irish expert was tasked with providing advice on that.
 Mifsud Bonnici gave them a presentation about the project on February 12, Cremona testifies.
 “We got information in bits and pieces. We were still trying to understand what the project was about. It concerned the state hospitals.”
  How many hospitals, asks AG lawyer Rebekah Spiteri.
 “I cannot answer on the spot, because I don’t recall exactly,” the witness replies.
 He recalls Mifsud Bonnici and other consultants involved in the project acting with “a great sense of urgency”. But he also notes that it’s not unusual for clients to have pressing deadlines.
 11.39am Questioned by defence lawyer Jason Grima, Ganado says that he did not testify in the magisterial inquiry into the Vitals deal and says nobody spoke to him about the case. 
 He also denies that PWC had anything to do with Bluestone/Vitals auditing.
 “We were never involved in audit accounts,” he says. Nor did PWC see company accounts before they were signed by the company’s auditor. 
 That’s all from this witness. 
 11.36am Lawyer Vincent Galea again asks the witness whether the business plan presented was realistic. 
 The magistrate steps in. Was the project feasible? Was it doable? 
 “At that point in time, yes,” the witness says.
 He denies [following a question by Galea] that police searched his offices. 
 11.28am The magistrate takes over questioning. How did PWC help Bluestone with its business plan and RFP submission, she asks the witness. Ganado recalls having to look into Barts for their work on the MOU business plan, as well as into the potential of attracting medical tourism.
 He emphasises the “very intensive” work PWC did over a two-month period. 
 Bluestone presented four volumes of documents to the government and PWC helped put those together, he says. 
 11.16am Answering questions from defence lawyer Stefano Filletti, the witness says Vitals Global Healthcare was incorporated into Bluestone’s structure “later down the line”.
 He is asked if PWC provided tax advice to Vitals after it won the concession. The witness says a colleague of his is better placed to answer that, as he was not involved.
 “We helped the client make a presentation to the government. It took place at Castille and I don’t recall exactly who was present,” the witness says.
 The presentation concerned Bluestone’s MOU pitch for Gozo, he says, and it took place in January 2015.
 Filletti pushes the witness to state what other work PWC did for Bluestone and Vitals.
 He says that in July 2016 it helped Bluestone Special Situations with their financial planning and continued to provide services “over time”.
 Did PWC also provide services to Vitals, the lawyer asks.
 “Eventually yes, but I’m not the person best placed to answer that. We assisted with project financing,” the witness says. That work concerned tax advice and reviewing tax advice by a UK company that was engaged by the client.
 11.05am Defence lawyer Giannella de Marco pushes the witness to distinguish between the MOU and RFP work. 
 “The MOU was limited to Gozo. The RFP was not. It was a totally different thing,” he says. He confirms that the MOU had expired by the time the RFP work was done.  He also confirms that PWC needed a second engagement letter when it was asked to work on the RFP. Tumuluri was their contact throughout. 
 And you saw nothing untoward when working on both these engagements, the lawyer asks the witness.
 “No,” he replies. 
 Defence lawyer Vince Galea asks the witness if PWC noted any red flags when taking on Bluestone as a client. Ganado says they did not.
 The NAO concluded that the projections in the proposal was not realistic, Galea tells the witness.
 
 “It wasn’t our business plan, it was the client’s,” Ganado replies. “Our job was to bring business projections together.” Galea asks if PWC handled the financials. 
 “We helped the client make financials,” Ganado replies.  He says that the company discusses financials with clients and points out what it believes is not appropriate, “but at the end of the day it’s for the client to decide what plan to follow.” 
 Galea asks the witness: was there anything you didn’t agree with but signed anyway? 
 “We didn’t sign anything,” the witness says. “We only helped the client issue the business plan.” 
 He reveals that PWC did further work for Bluestone after it won the concession. That work concerned helping the company source financing. But the witness says he was not involved in that. 
 10.56pm PWC was tasked with helping to design that business plan.
 Bluestone’s ultimate beneficial owner was Mark Pawley but his designated agent was Ram Tumuluri, Ganado recalls. Tumuluri was their point of contact.
 Bluestone brought over doctors and an architect to see the place, he says.
 Ganado says he saw the MOU after they were engaged by Bluestone. “I recall that it was specifically for a Gozo medical complex and they had to present a feasible business plan by January 2015. It was about Gozo alone,” he says.
 Then when the RFP [for the actual hospitals concession] was issued, Bluestone again approached PWC for help.
 “We were asked to provide input. Again, doctors and experts came from abroad and PWC met these experts,” the witness recalls.
 The Gozo business plan was submitted in January 2015, he says. Then came the RFP work, which had a broader dimension including St Luke’s Hospital etc.
 Ganado is asked when the company was paid. He says it issued an invoice after every engagement. Those were paid by Bluestone.
 10.50am Michel Ganado is a management consultant and partner at PWC. He is asked about his company’s role in the hospitals concession. He tells the court that they were contacted by Bluestone [Vitals’ parent firm] in 2014.
 They had an MOU with the government to present a business plan for Gozo Hospital, the witness recalls. 
 10.45am Cardona is again asked why the MOU was not followed up.
 Again, he reiterates that it did not match the government’s plan for the health sector. 
 The magistrate interjects. So why was it signed? 
 Cardona says the MOU was not legally binding and was needed “to know where it could lead to.” 
 “I think at that stage there was no due diligence, or enhanced due diligence. That’s the norm.”
 Can you exclude that Dr Muscat was present at the signing, the magistrate asks Cardona.
 “If he were, I would recall,” Cardona says. 
 He is asked what he knows about the subsequent Request for Proposals. 
 “Only what I know from the media,” Cardona says. 
 And that’s all from the former minister. The next witness, Michel Ganado, is called. 
 10.43am Joseph Muscat’s lawyer Vince Galea questions the witness. The experts seem to be saying that MOU was somehow illegal or illicit, the lawyer tells the witness. Did you see anything of the sort, anything untoward? 
 “No, no, no. Nothing at all. Absolutely not.” “I never spoke to Dr Muscat or anyone about this MOU,” he adds. 
 10.42am Cardona says he believes the MOU was signed at Castille and “definitely not” at his ministry. He says he’s not sure if anyone else was present for the signing. 
 He is asked what the practice is for such signing ceremonies. 
 “Some MOUs were signed abroad, or at the ministry,” he says. “People from my ministry probably spoke to me [about it]. I had two permanent secretaries, Pauline Mamo and Nancy Caruana. But I cannot with certainty say whether any other public officials were present at the signing.”
 “As for MOU, what I know is that it did not remain in force. And I don’t recall if I signed anything else in relation to it. I don’t have any access to emails now.”
 10.39am Cardona looks closely at the MOU. It’s dated 10/10/14.
 “I saw it on the day I signed it and when I testified before the NAO [National Audit Office], he says. I don’t have any copy.”
 [The NAO concluded that Vitals should have been excluded from bidding for the hospitals concession as the MOU they signed months prior suggested “collusive behaviour” between them and the government].  
 So you just went and signed, Cardona is asked? “Yes. They told me we have to sign this MOU. It was to set up a sustainable health system and its main drive was to attract medical tourism. It referred to a Gozo Medical Complex. I signed it because I was responsible for Malta Enterprise.”
 He reads from the MOU. “The investors are interested in ..construction of hospital and medical school”.
 “It was tied to those deliverables and solely Gozo,” Cardona tells the court.
 “Government later said that it wasn’t interested in furthering that MOU because it didn’t fit into government’s plan to reform the sector. I believe that ME later withdrew it.” 
 10.31am Cardona speaks about the Vitals MOU. 
 “If I recall well, this one was pegged to deliverables. And it was not renewed because it did not lead to what the government wanted.” 
 Cardona expands on that. “It only related to Gozo and not St Luke’s [hospital] etc. The government wanted a total revamp of the system.” 
 10.30am Cardona tells the court he was only involved in the MOU’s signing, as he was politically responsible for Malta Enterprise. He recalls Mario Galea [a top Malta Enterprise official who would go on to become its CEO] telling him to “just sign the MOU”. 
 “I would have many MOUs to sign and some were not followed up,” he says. Their aim was to entice foreign investment to Malta, he says, before professing ignorance.
 “I don’t even know what all these MOUs were about,” he says. 
 10.24am Cardona is keen to emphasise that he was “explicitly” asked to testify about the Memorandum of Understanding with Vitals [which he signed as Economy Minister], and not the hospital concession subsequently awarded to the company. 
 Cardona tells the court he’d like to take a look at the MOU as he “only saw it once”. “I signed it and that’s it,” he says of the 2014 document. 
 The court obliges, and Cardona is handed a document from one of the six boxes of evidence resting in front of the magistrate's bench. 
 10.20am Good morning and welcome to this live blog. Magistrate Rachel Montebello enters the courtroom and the court is in session. 
 We're going straight into it, with Cardona as the first witness.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/body-24yearold-marzia-maatouk-brought-back-malta-tripoli.1101718,"Updated: Funeral postponed
 The body of 24-year-old Marzia Maatouk, who was found dead in Libya six months ago, was repatriated to Malta on Thursday night, bringing some closure to her family who are still seeking answers on the circumstances surrounding her death.
 The Maltese Foreign Affairs Ministry confirmed the details to Times of Malta on Friday, saying the flight from Tripoli marked the end of months of discussions and arrangements between the ministry's Consular Services Directorate, the Maltese Embassy in Libya and the Libyan authorities.
 Members of her family were also in Libya this week to identify her body, the ministry said.
 The young Maltese woman was tragically found dead in the Libyan town of Gharyan last May.
 ""Earlier this week the Maltese Consul in Libya travelled to Gharyan, circa 120 kilometres from Tripoli, to facilitate the transfer of the body to Tripoli,"" a ministry spokesperson said.
 ""Within a few days, the Embassy concluded all necessary administrative preparations for the repatriation. The body of Marzia Marimar Calleja Maatouk arrived in Malta on Thursday night.""
 Marzia fled Malta by sea with her husband Jomic Calleja Maatouk, in August last year, after he was sentenced to prison for drug-related crimes.
 They were both on Europol's most wanted list and remained missing for months before they were tracked down in Libya.
 She was found dead and her husband, who was described by a magistrate as a ""lethal weapon"", was arrested.
 Initially, the family were told she likely died by suicide but were then informed the body was being kept in Libya for investigations into possible foul play.
 ""During a meeting with the Office of the AG earlier this month, the Embassy received confirmation that the ongoing inquiries had been concluded, and the body could be repatriated,"" the ministry said on Friday.
 It remains unclear, however, whether Libyan investigators found evidence of foul play. In the meantime, her husband remains detained in Libya.
 When contacted for comment, her family confirmed the body arrived in Malta on Thursday and thanked all those who supported them during this difficult time.
 In an interview with  Times of Malta in July, the heartbroken family opened up about the ordeal, saying they desperately needed answers and closure but they did not even yet know where her body was.
 On Friday morning Marzia's family shared the details of the funeral which was initially scheduled to take place on Saturday.
 Later in the afternoon, however, they announced they were forced to postpone it ""after a magisterial inquiry was opened"".
 ""In this life, you must continue to suffer even after your death,"" her brother Marvin wrote in a Facebook post that was addressed to her.
 ""Marzia's funeral will not take place tomorrow, contrary to what we announced earlier. A magisterial inquiry was opened and we had to cancel it.""

https://timesofmalta.com/article/muscat-warpath-those-fix-injustice-judged.1092016,"Joseph Muscat lashed out on Monday following news that he is to face criminal charges, saying the police and attorney general had breached his right to a fair hearing.
 Muscat noted that he had not been questioned by investigators before charges against him and others were filed in court.
 He described that as an “obscenity and abomination”. 
 “Those who dirtied themselves with this injustice or looked the other way instead of fixing it will be judged harshly by the people in the short-term, justice in the long run and by history forever,” Muscat wrote on Facebook.
  Several Labour insiders told Times of Malta those words appeared to be a veiled attack on Prime Minister Robert Abela and his ministers.
 It is unusual for prosecutors to file criminal charges against suspects without having first questioned them, criminal lawyers told Times of Malta.
 They said it is also unusual for people charged with crimes related to fraud or money laundering to be arraigned through a court summons, rather than under arrest. Suspects arraigned under summons are free to return home after they plead not guilty and do not have to request bail.
 Times of Malta reported on Monday that prosecutors from the office of Attorney General Victoria Buttigieg have  filed criminal charges against Muscat, Konrad Mizzi, Keith Schembri and more than a dozen other individuals and companies.
 They are suspected of having committed crimes in connection with the now-annulled deal to privatise three state hospitals. That deal was negotiated and signed by the Muscat government and annulled by a civil court last year, which found that it was tainted by fraud and that top government officials had colluded against the national interest in the way they handled it.
 A magisterial inquiry that was tasked with assessing whether Muscat, his ministers and top officials committed crimes in connection with the deal was concluded last week.
 Muscat has spent the past year battling the inquiry process, saying the magistrate that led it is biased and out to get him.
 Last week, he said the state’s institutions “are working against Labourites”.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/ghirxi-family-insist-independent-inquiry-look-aspects-murder.1097304,"Murder victim Nicolette Ghirxi's family are insisting that an independent inquiry should still be held into her death. 
 This comes after the Social Policy Ministry announced on Wednesday that it would be launching an inquiry to investigate the professional support Ghirxi received from social services before her murder. 
 But this will have a more limited scope than what the Ghirxi family are asking for and in a statement on Wednesday, they said that the ministry announced their decision to launch this inquiry without consulting them. 
 ""The family insists on their original request for an independent inquiry called by the Prime Minister, according to the powers granted to him through Article 4 of Chapter 273 of the laws of Malta,"" they said. 
 ""This should be wide in scope to establish all the circumstances that led to Nicolette's murder and to determine whether the state fulfilled all of the obligations expected of it to prevent the murder and protect her life."" 
 The family added that it expects to be consulted and involved in the making of the terms of reference for this board. 
 Ghirxi was stabbed to death in her Swatar apartment earlier this month. 
 Her former partner, Edward Johnston, is suspected of killing her. He was later shot by the police following a three-hour standoff in St Julian's, during which he was brandishing what later turned out to be a replica Beretta pistol. 
 Following the family's first request for an independent inquiry, the Office of the Prime Minister announced that the Independent Police Complaints Board would review the police force's conduct on this matter. 
 Ghirxi's close friend and her lawyer later told Times of Malta that Ghirxi was discouraged from sitting from a risk assessment when she went to report Johnston to the police in April. 
 In response, the Foundation for Social Welfare Services denied that its risk assessors talked Ghirxi down from undergoing a risk assessment, publishing two affidavits attesting to this and saying Ghirxi confirmed that she did not get a risk assessment in writing.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/man-arrested-msida-breakins-balconies-roofs.1092044,"A woman who last month said she had to move out of her Msida place because of repeated break-ins in her apartment block has hailed police work leading to an arrest.
 ""I can sleep soundly at last"" Christine Amaira said in a Facebook post.
 Earlier the police said that they had arrested a 26-year-old Syrian man for allegedly breaking into several houses in Msida and Gzira, gaining access through roofs and balconies.  
 
 The arrest was made on Sunday after the man, who was identified during intensive investigations, was seen jumping over several roofs during a surveillance operation. He was arrested as he came out of a house in Triq C De Brocktorff after a burglary.
 The police said investigations are continuing.  
 Times of Malta last month reported how Amaira was forced to leave her apartment because of repeated break-ins in her apartment block.
 ""At last I can sleep soundly once more,"" she wrote on Facebook on Tuesday while thanking the police for their investigations and for the support given to her and other residents.
 ""I do not wish anyone to go through what we have endured. One word of advice: Be mindful of your home security. And those of you who have just bought or are about to buy a property should ensure that the developer has control over whoever holds keys or access to the place. Make sure that the apartment block is sufficiently secure,"" she wrote.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/man-pressured-marginal-role-drug-trafficking-conspiracy-spared-trial.1101110,"A man facing trial over “one isolated episode” allegedly linking him to a drug trafficking conspiracy 12 years ago, will have his case decided instead by a Magistrates’ Court.
 Ivan Cachia, now 47, landed in hot water after giving in to his father’s request for help back in 2012.
 It all started when the suspect's father, Paul, agreed to hide some drugs belonging to a third party on his farm at Aħrax tal-Mellieħa. He was to keep the drugs only overnight and was promised €1,000 for the job. 
 At the time, the accused’s mother was seriously ill and his father needed the money to help pay for her medical treatment. 
 He let his son in on the plan, asking him to lend a hand that night. 
 The son refused outright, immediately wary at the mention of drugs. But he ultimately let himself be swayed by his father, relenting only because the family was in dire need of funds for his mother’s treatment.
 On the scheduled date, the father and son headed to the farmhouse at around 8.30pm. An hour or so later, a speedboat transported Jose’ Xerry who soon arrived at the farmhouse, accompanied by the accused’s father. 
 The Cachias had dug a hole in a field.
 “Joe had a sort of sack in his hand and he was holding it with one hand and he was the one who dropped it into the hole,” the accused later told investigators.
 The father and son covered the sack with soil and then tipped a wheelbarrow load of cement on top to secure the hiding spot. 
 The son got no payment for his role. His father never got the promised €1,000 but ended up in great trouble because the drugs mysteriously disappeared during the night. 
 Both father and son were criminally charged over their alleged involvement in the drug trafficking conspiracy. 
 They both pleaded not guilty.
 The Attorney General decided in terms of article 22 of the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance that both father and son were to be judged by a Criminal Court under a bill of indictment, thus spelling harsher punishment.
 Two years ago, a judge upheld a request by the father’s lawyers to reverse the AG’s decision and sent the case to be decided by a Magistrates’ Court. 
 A bill of indictment was issued in respect of the son in 2022 and his lawyers filed an identical request in terms of article 22(2A)(b) of the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance.
 The AG objected. 
 When delivering judgment the Criminal Court, presided over by Madam Justice Natasha Galea Sciberras, observed that the defence’s request pivoted on their claim that the accused allegedly played “a very minimal role”.
 He allegedly “marginally” helped his father and was not promised any reward. 
 After examining the records of the case, the judge noted that the amount of drug allegedly hidden in Cachia’s farmhouse was not known. 
 In his statement to the police, the son referred to the drug as “cannabis soap” but he could not tell how much there was since he never saw the contents of the “sack” in “Joey’s” hand. 
 He simply said it was roughly “one foot square and one foot high.” 
 No one had seen the drug. 
 The police also confirmed that they only had the accused’s account to go by. 
 The court also observed that the plan to hide the drug was allegedly hatched between the father and “Joey”, who was known for his alleged involvement in drug trafficking and transportation of illegal migrants.
 The son had no direct contact with Xerry and acted under pressure, only agreeing to help his father because he was aware of the family’s financial difficulties.
 He had no knowledge of the extent or nature of the conspiracy and made no financial gain. 
 Moreover, he cooperated fully with investigators and was allegedly involved in a solitary episode that was truly minimal.
 He therefore deserved mitigation of punishment. 
 The judge also observed that the accused’s father had been sent back to the Magistrates’ Court. 
 It “would make no logical nor legal sense” for the son to be judged by a Criminal Court when he allegedly played a smaller role than his father, said the judge, upholding his request and ordering the case to be decided by a Magistrates’ Court.
 The maximum punishment in trial by jury is life imprisonment, whereas at Magistrates' Court the maximum punishment is 10 years imprisonment.
 Lawyers Franco Debono and Kathleen Calleja Grima are defence counsel.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/man-acquitted-raping-exgirlfriend.1094669,"A man has been acquitted of raping his former girlfriend after a court found that prosecutors had failed to prove that the sexual encounter was non-consensual.  
 The trial was held behind closed doors this week, with the case dating back to 2019. 
 The two had met as students. They reconnected years later and the two began a short-lived relationship. 
 The woman told police that problems soon arose. He took out his anger on her, she said, and sex was always violent to the point of making her bleed. 
 She said that she decided to end things after around three months. They met in Valletta and had a break-up conversation. 
 As they were heading home, the accused asked the woman to join him for a meal at a fast-food restaurant in Qormi. 
 The prosecution argued that this was a ploy to get the woman into his car and rape her, because, they said, he only saw her as an outlet for his sexual frustration. 
 The woman alleged that he forced himself onto her in the car, after they had eaten their food. 
 She said he penetrated her with his fingers, despite her repeatedly telling him to stop as she began to cry. 
 After he took her home, she spoke with a friend about what had happened and decided to report the incident to the police. 
 He was accused of raping the woman, with the prosecution initially asking the court for a prison sentence between nine to 30 years should he be found guilty. 
 This was later revised to a request for a sentence between four and 20 years, to reflect more recent changes in legislation. 
 The trial started on Tuesday, with the court delivering judgement on Saturday morning. 
 The defence insisted throughout proceedings that the sexual encounter was consensual and that the way the woman had described the accused was highly out of character.
 The court heard from friends of the accused, including his ex-wife, all of whom testified that he was a calm and kind man, if not somewhat naive but always dependable. 
 In her judgement, Madam Justice Consuelo Scerri Herrera criticised the police investigation into the case, notably miscommunication that led to a police report being filed two days after the incident occurred and subsequently the failure to open a magisterial inquiry to preserve evidence.
 The judge observed that while the accused never denied that this sexual encounter occurred between them, he maintained that it was consensual.
 While the woman had tried to paint a picture of the accused as a man obsessed with violent sex, it was she who had introduced violence to their sex life, she said, with the court noting one message where the man told the woman they should hold off from sex for a month after the woman told him she had bled after a sexual encounter. 
 Meanwhile, the accused’s character witnesses all maintained that these elements were foreign to him, with his ex-wife noting that he had never asked her for such activities and that she would not have permitted them if he had. 
 The court was not convinced that the incident was not consensual, particularly as evidence pointed to the fact that the woman was still in love with the accused, despite having called things off between them. 
 Her personal history also showed that the woman was not well-equipped to handle breakups, with the court observing that she found the woman’s character to be “impulsive and emotional”. 
 “The court is not satisfied that this accusation has been sufficiently proven, because while the prosecution did not succeed in proving its case beyond a reasonable doubt, the defence, which is not obliged to bring forward any proof, has managed through its witnesses to present a reasonable doubt,” the court said. 
 Judge Scerri Herrera instead found the man guilty of the lesser charge of offending public morals for performing a sexual act in public and sentenced him to a two-week prison sentence, suspended for one year. 
 Lawyers Franco Debono and Marion Camilleri appeared for the accused.

https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/130522/live_muscat_schembri_mizzi_back_in_court_as_compilation_of_evidence_continues,"Former minister Chris Cardona is set to testify in the compilation of evidence against Joseph Muscat, Konrad Mizzi, Brian Tonna, Karl Cini and more than a dozen other individuals and companies.
 Reading from the list of witnesses that the prosecution had requested, the magistrate listed former minister Chris Cardona, Cardona, who had signed the original Memorandum of Understanding with Vitals, Malta Enterprise, Jobsplus, INDIS, Projects Malta, the clerk of the House of Representatives and the Auditor General, as well as witnesses from the steering, evaluation and negotiation committees that had participated in the selection process before the concession was granted to VGH.
 Twenty witnesses - representatives from Malta-registered banks - were heard in under an hour.
 The witnesses had been summonsed to confirm whether the banks they represented held any accounts registered to Kasco Engineering Company Ltd or MTrace PLC, either presently or in the past, and for eighteen of them, the answer was ‘no’.
 The monotonous procession of negative replies finally came to an end with the final two witnesses, representing BOV and HSBC. 
 It emerged that MTrace had banked with BOV from January 2016 to December 2023, while Kasco Engineering Co Ltd held five active accounts with the bank. Statements for the accounts for the duration of the companies’ relationship with the bank were exhibited. Mtrace had never opened or operated any accounts at HSBC, the court was told, but Kasco Engineering Co Ltd held five HSBC accounts since 2004. All of the accounts were now closed, the last being shut down in 2017, its representative informed the court.
 Magistrate Rachel Montebello, who had allocated two hours for today’s sitting, was not amused when the prosecution informed her that the last witness summonsed for today had been heard, around 45 minutes after the sitting started.
  
 The magistrate told the prosecution that she wanted to hear as many prosecution witnesses as possible before the acts of the case have to be sent back to the AG, and then have the foreign experts and forensic accountants who assisted the magisterial inquiry testify in a separate hearing, after that.
 The case was adjourned with the next sitting to take place on August 8.  "

Through this case Schembri, together with Joseph Muscat, Adrian Hillman, Karl Cini, Brian Tonna, Nexia BT, Clarence Conger Thompson and David Meli are challenging the freezing orders imposed on them in separate criminal proceedings in which they are charged with accepting bribes, money laundering and trading in influence, amongst other offences.  One of the central arguments in their appeal is that the Court of Appeal, composed of the same three judges (Chief Justice Mark Chetcuti, Mr. Justice Giannino Caruana Demajo and Anthony Mr. Justice Ellul), had already declared that there had been collusion between Steward and high ranking Government officials in the civil case filed by former PN leader Adrian Delia.  The appellants are arguing that this meant that the judges had already expressed an opinion about the individuals who are now criminally charged over the Government’s fraudulent hospitals deal with Vitals Global Healthcare.  In a decree handed down yesterday, the court rejected their request to call the Registrar of Courts to the witness stand in order to exhibit a copy of the court file pertaining to the criminal case against Shaukat Ali Chaudry, as the merits of the two cases were different.   In addition to this, the court pointed out that, in any case, parties to criminal proceedings are bound not to make the acts of the case public.  When the case was called this morning, Keith Schembri’s lawyer, Edward Gatt, verbally informed the court that the parties were jointly requesting the recusal of the three judges.  The court ordered that the request be made formally, in writing, with four days for the opposing counsel to file a reply.   The case was adjourned for a decision on this issue, to be given on September 23.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/21yearold-gets-harsh-warning-magistrate-burglary-charges.1094440,"A 21-year-old man from Żurrieq was given a dressing down by a magistrate on Tuesday after he was accused of breaking into and burgling his mother’s house earlier this month. 
 Magistrate Yana Micallef Stafrace warned the youth that he was “wasting his life”, despite people trying to help him make the right choices. 
 The court heard from Police Inspector Colin Sheldon how on June 19, the police received reports that the accused, Luke Cremona had broken into and damaged his mother’s Birżebbuġa property on the previous day, while she was not at home. He also allegedly stole items from the property.  
 On June 20 the police tried to arrest Cremona at his home but were informed that he had an appointment with his probation officer. The session with the probation officer came to an abrupt end when the accused began to smoke in her presence. 
 Later, the probation officer was to take Cremona to the police station in her car, but a scuffle broke out, and he pushed the officer out of the car and drove off. The police found the car abandoned near a butcher shop.
 Cremona was arrested after a three-day search, during which he failed to attend a court sitting over a separate case and failed to sign the bail book.
 On Tuesday he was also accused of breaching a protection order previously issued by a magistrate in favour of his mother. He pleaded not guilty to all charges.  No request for bail was made, but defence lawyers asked for therapy to address the accused's problematic behaviour.
 When asked what he does for work, Cremona said he is self-employed and previously owned a mobile phones shop. 
 “Be conscious of your actions now, as they can ruin your life,” she warned Cremona. 
 “I have no obligation to tell you this, but I am listening to my conscience. You are the same age as my  son, so young, do not destroy your life. Do you understand me?” she asked Cremona, to which Cremona said yes, and told her that he had a drug problem.
 “So you make others rich, while you end up homeless or worse,” she said. 
 “I remember being your age, but one day you will be older and people will not be so kind to you. You need to be the future of this country, not the problem,"" the magistrate said.”
 The accused was remanded in custody.
 Lawyer Francesca Zarb was defence counsel. Police Inspectors James Mallia and Colin Sheldon and AG lawyer Brendan Bonnici prosecuted.

https://maltatoday.com/news/national/131402/at_united_nations_malta_keeps_searise_threat_and_climate_crisis_on_agenda,"Prime Minister Robert Abela told a United Nations General Assembly session discussing the threat of sea-level rise and the climate crisis that the major challenge was staring the face of countries even should tey remain in line with climate action plans.
 “Everyone’s efforts are important, because this is a challenge that threatens humanity as a whole,” Abela told the meeting, which was addressed by UNGA president Dennis Francis and UN Secretary-General António Guterres.
  “We cannot reverse our agreed-upon obligations, and we must remain focused on clean economic actions that should lead to the goal of a reduction of 1.5 degrees as laid down by the Paris Agreement,” Abela said.
 The Maltese premier said the threat of sea-level rise affected everyone economically, saying small state-islands like Malta were at the forefront of this challenge.
 In its two-year term as a Non-Permanent Member of the United Nations Security Council, Malta used its presidency to place the climate crisis on the agenda, more specifically with the phenomenon of rising sea levels.
 “Malta will continue to support the discussion on seriously addressing sea-level rise. We must act together today before tomorrow,” Abela said. “As an international community we must have a strong legal framework that also addresses this phenomenon in a bid to create an international order when so many different interests are at stake.”
  Also in New York, deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ian Borg joined the President of Cabo Verde José Maria Neves and the Prime Ministers of Tuvalu and Belize Feleti Teo and John Briceño to co-host a high-level event on climate mobility.
 The meeting, which included the participation of key leaders from another 17 UN member states, was held on Wednesday as part of the 79th United Nations General Assembly (UNGA 79), which is taking place in New York this week. Borg highlighted the serious consequences of climate mobility on small island developing states (SIDS) at risk of disappearing due to sea level rise and called for global solutions for their survival.
 “The impending disappearance of a nation carries more than just legal and physical consequences – it also concerns the identity of entire populations. Our identity is what defines us. We are tied to our homeland by family and friends, livelihoods, traditions, and the memories of loved ones who have passed.”
 As a threat multiplier, climate change magnifies the impact of other factors, such as poverty, loss of livelihoods and tensions relating to dwindling resources. Such chain reactions ultimately lead to conflict and displacement of people.
 “This is why we need comprehensive actions and solutions,” Borg said. “Addressing climate change as a root cause of displacement is crucial to breaking this cycle and finding lasting solutions. We cannot afford to lose any more time.” 
 Deputy Prime Minister Ian Borg also held several meetings in his role as the 2024 Chair-in-Office of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), including a meeting of the OSCE Troika, and meetings with the foreign ministers of three OSCE participating states, including Kyrgyzstan, Russia and Serbia.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/consultation-new-height-limitation-policy-closes-12-hours-deadline.1094071,"Public consultation over a controversial proposal to amend height limitations closed abruptly on Monday, despite a Planning Ministry spokesperson telling  Times of Malta feedback about the policy is welcome until the end of the day.
 On Monday, those who referred to the public consultation website for guidance on how to submit their feedback about the proposal found that the consultation had closed at least 12 hours before the official deadline. 
 The Planning Authority launched a consultation to amend a policy in Development Control Design Policy, Guidance and Standards - a controversial document commonly known as the DC15.
 Previously, height limitations were set by the number of floors that could be built in any given area, as set out by the local plans. However, an annexe included in DC15, Annexe 2, laid out a table in which the maximum allowable heights of buildings previously indicated as floors, had now been converted into metres. 
 Should the amendments to policy 35 of DC15, which regulates allowable building height, be accepted, it will formalise this interpretation of the guidelines. 
  Public consultation was set to close at midnight - at the end of Monday.
 Astrid Vella, from Flimkien għal Ambjent Aħjar was on an RTK103 radio programme on Monday morning, urging people to contribute to the public consultation when a listener informed her the consultation had closed.
 She claimed ""the sudden and unannounced closure of the consultation at 10am reveals the sham nature of the consultation process and the motivations behind it"".
 When asked to clarify whether consultation had closed, a Planning Ministry spokesperson told Times of Malta “The PA can confirm that the public consultation will close at midnight tonight”.
 As of 5pm, the website is still showing the consultation as closed.
 However, NGOs are encouraging people to continue emailing their concern to consultation_dc15@pa.org.mt. 
 Din l-Art Ħelwa’s President, Patrick Calleja meanwhile said that if consultation was still open, the authorities should update the public consultation website so as to avoid confusion among people who wanted to submit feedback.
 Din l-Art Ħelwa, Flimkien għal Ambjent Aħjar, Għawdix and Moviment Graffiti have all spoken out against the proposed policy amendment.
  Calleja warned the proposal would undermine recent court decisions.
 Additionally, ""adopting this amendment could change the whole aspect of current streetscapes with just two or three floors, especially if the area happens to be on the border of a UCA"". 
  In a statement, Għawdix said that by ""potentially expanding the allowable number of building levels for various facade heights, the revision of P35 risks encouraging developers to maximize building heights, further straining local services and diminishing the quality of life for residents.""
 ""This approach undermines the original intent of DC15, which was to promote a context-driven approach to development rather than a one-size-fits-all height allowance.”

https://timesofmalta.com/article/students-take-part-international-environmentthemed-exhibition.1102246,"Local students have contributed to an international exhibition by highlighting the ecological significance of Chadwick Lakes.
 The exhibition, an international initiative organised as part of the Global Network of Water Museums, was hosted by the Għajn Centre, a community space in the Nigret area of Rabat that aims to raise awareness about the challenges facing the water sector.
 Under the guidance of renowned artist Joanne Mizzi, students created 34 artworks inspired by their educational experiences at the Chadwick Lakes trail, using visual art to express their understanding of local biodiversity and freshwater ecosystems.
 Four of the artworks were selected for inclusion in the AQUAPLAY section of the WAMU-NET website. This global digital platform, supported by UNESCO, aims to raise awareness about water heritage, pollution, and sustainability by engaging children worldwide.
  Environment minister Miriam Dalli, who attended the exhibition, said that educating children on sustainability was one of the most impactful investments that could be made.
 ""By introducing these concepts through creative and engaging activities, we empower students to explore vital themes like biodiversity and water conservation in ways that resonate deeply with them. These initiatives educate and inspire young people to become future ambassadors for sustainability,” Dalli said.
 Amanda Zahra, professional officer at the Energy and Water Agency, highlighted the Centre’s ongoing efforts.
 “The Għajn Centre welcomes students every day to learn about responsible water management and sustainability. While we work tirelessly to promote these values, events like this give us the opportunity to showcase our initiatives on an international stage. It is a proud moment for us and reflects our commitment to educating future generations,” she said.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/rockfall-fomm-irrih-bay-exactly-year-architect-warning.1096761,"Part of Fomm ir-Riħ bay has been closed off because of a rockfall and the danger of further collapses, exactly a year after an architect's warning on Times of Malta.
 The Public Works Department said it had inspected the site and there was a high probability that more rocks and clay would fall off the cliff face.
 The area was therefore being closed off as a precaution. 
 A year ago Times of Malta quoted architect Alex Torpiano warning that the unstable nature of the Fomm ir-Riħ area could see people getting injured due to frequent collapses.
 Torpiano had warned that people who use the public path that leads to the beach, as well as swimmers who approach the shore by boat, could be at risk as the area has been prone to frequent collapses. Two significant collapses were recorded in March and November of 2021.
  Last month a 22-year-old woman, Mirabelle Falzon died after being crushed under a rockfall in Marsascala. She had been swimming in an area known as Munxar, within the limits of St Thomas Bay, when the tragedy happened.
 In July last year people on a boat reported a lucky escape when rocks fell into the sea at the area known as Tlett Ħofriet, Delimara.
 The area is frequented by adventurous visitors who reach it by kayak or boat, or by those willing to trek down to the beach. Marsaxlokk council subsequently warned visitors to be cautious. 
 Also last year, in February, a large boulder crashed onto Popeye Village, damaging one of the small structures of the popular tourist attraction.
 Last year the authorities warned people to stay clear of the cliff face at Għar Lapsi, limits of Siġġiewi, which is in danger of collapsing. Parts of the cliff face were closed off by a steel net some years ago but several people sneaked through gaps to lounge right under the crumbling cliff face.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/calls-grow-prime-minister-revoke-mellieha-heights-development.1101800,"Updated 4.35pm
 Calls for the Prime Minister to revoke a controversial agreement for a 109-unit apartment complex in Mellieħa Heights have intensified following his recent comments.
 Robert Abela acknowledged the Mellieħa Heights controversy and told Times of Malta that publicly owned green spaces should not be tendered for development unless they serve a social purpose.
 “I had said that where there is this type of land, unless it is needed for social reasons, issuing a tender [to develop] should be avoided,” Abela said, following revelations that T&S Property Holdings had obtained planning permission for the project.
 The government had sold the 4,000-square-metre plot to T&S Property Holdings on a 50-year perpetual lease with an annual payment of €380,000. The deal allows the lease to be redeemed.
 Mellieħa mayor Gabriel Micallef, a vocal critic of the project, has sent a letter to Abela urging him to “put his words into action”. Micallef called for the agreement to be revoked and the land repurposed as a community project.
 “As Prime Minister, you hold the power and the moral responsibility to rectify this injustice by using the law to expropriate this unspoiled land and return it to the public,” Micallef wrote in his letter.
 Speaking to Times of Malta, Micallef said Mellieħa lacks untouched green spaces and proposed turning the site into a park or garden with a reading area for residents. The Mellieħa council will be ready to take this land under its care,” he said.
 Opposition to the project came to a head in October, when residents and council members joined a protest against it. Critics argue that the project contradicts the government’s stated goals of preserving green spaces.
 T&S Property Holdings has defended the project, citing its designation as a development site since 1965. However, Micallef dismissed the 2006 local plans that reaffirmed the zoning as “outdated.”
 Meanwhile, the NGO Il-Kollettiv insisted the government already has the power to revoke the Mellieħa Heights agreement. Calling for accountability within the Planning Authority, the activist group questioned how T&S Property Holdings secured planning permission “in record time” of just two months.
 Il-Kollettiv has also highlighted another development in Mellieħa involving a 26-room guesthouse and 28 apartments. The land for that project was sold for €151,000 under an emphyteusis agreement, which allows the lease to be redeemed within 15 years. The NGO noted that the architect is Gilbert Bartolo, brother of former tourism minister Clayton Bartolo.
 Il-Kollettiv said it has urged the National Audit Office to expand its investigation to include both developments in light of these concerns.
 PN MPs Robert Cutajar and Ivan Castillo, as well as then-PL MEP Cyrus Engerer, have all previously backed the Mellieħa Heights residents’ calls not to give away the land.
 A spokesperson at the Office of the Prime Minister told Times of Malta that Abela stood by what he said last week outside parliament.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/adpd-committed-foster-green-eu-policies-climate-change.1093022,"If Malta is serious about its fight against the effects of climate change, the people should support the Green Party, which is committed to pushing for effective measures and policies to mitigate the effects of climate change, it said on Saturday. 
 During a press conference at Birżebbuġa, ADPD chairperson and MEP candidate Sandra Gauchi said recent polls have shown that voters are concerned with the effects of climate change. 
 “We want an economy of well-being, not an economy that fattens the pockets of those who are polluting the air, water, land, and environment,” she said. 
 “It is obvious that the country is affected by the impacts of climate change, and now we have no other choice but to act now. We are already late.”
 The ADPD members noted how different localities have been impacted by pollution and climate change, and focused on the seaside town of Birżebbuġa. 
 Melissa Bagley, ADPD deputy chairperson and Birżebbuġa local council candidate said residents have been impacted by the industrial development of the locality in recent years. 
 On Friday, NGOs reiterated their call to withdraw the planning application to change the local plan for Qajjenza in Birżebbuġa.
  The application seeks to change the local plan so that it allows six blocks of apartments and offices, going up to eight storeys, on the former Enemalta gas storage facility. 
 Bagley said the party is also against this application, and said the land should be provided back to the community. 
 ""Instead of giving the residents the much-needed open space they need for recreational purposes, they are now faced with the prospect of having hundreds of flats added to the area, which is bound to affect their quality of life.  So here we see that the government is keen on putting profit before people.""
 Closing the press conference, Gauci said it is in the interest of the voter to vote for a European Union that provides a better quality of life and fights the effects of climate change. 
 ""Whatever is said during the election campaign, the reality remains that if we do not respect the limits that nature itself imposes on us, we will end up badly,"" she said. 
 ""The protection of nature, the environment, and the land and sea of our country means the protection and the well-being of all of us today and tomorrow.""

https://timesofmalta.com/article/joseph-portelli-replace-xlendi-hotel-13floor-residence-block.1093702,"Gozitan construction mogul Joseph Portelli has abandoned plans to rebuild the Xlendi Hotel but instead applied to develop a 13-floor residential complex with 46 units, a shop, and underlying garages and car spaces overlooking the scenic bay.
 The plans have attracted a considerable number of objections from nearby residents who are fearing for their safety as well as environment NGOs who are pleading with the Planning Authority to stop the “piecemeal destruction of Xlendi”.
 Through PA1633/24, Excel Investments, jointly owned by Portelli, Daniel Refalo and business partner Mark Agius, replaced a previous application to build a new four-star hotel instead of the former Xlendi Hotel Resort and Spa for which they already obtained a demolition permit.
 Instead, the latest application ditches the touristic aspect of the development and proposes a seafront residential complex with a mix of one-, two- and three-bedroomed apartments. Some of the units will have a jacuzzi on their terraces which the plans make it a point to point out will have “non-slip tiles”.
 The plans for the project on Triq San Xmun and Triq il-Puniċi in Xlendi in Munxar were prepared by architect Alexander Bigeni.
 In its 2020 application to redevelop the hotel, Excel Investment had said that the demolition was the first phase of the project.
 The application had drawn concerns from dozens of objectors, but the PA had given its green light since it was considered as an application to demolish a building that was not worthy of preservation.
 Excel’s original application for phase 2 proposed the development of an 88-room, four-star hotel over 14 floors.
 These plans had attracted hundreds of objections, only for the company to withdraw the plans and go back to the drawing board. The developer came back with a proposal to build a residential complex with 51 apartments and two shops, but this application was mysteriously withdrawn before it was even considered by the PA.
 Instead, a fresh application was submitted in March proposing one shop instead of two and five fewer apartments. The PA’s target date is to complete the screening process by July 5.
 Independent MEP candidate Arnold Cassola tersely described the plans as an “obscenity” (moqżiżata) by Portelli.
 The Munxar council did not object to the application but simply asked to be kept informed throughout the process.
 Gozitan NGOs Għawdix, Wirt Għawdex and Din l-Art Ħelwa all objected to the proposal, insisting that it breached planning policies. They said the development will severely disrupt the surrounding area, residents’ quality of life, natural environments, and the touristic appeal of Xlendi.
 They said the proposed development ran counter to the Gozo and Comino Local Plan in at least four ways, particularly concerning the height which was not in line with the height
 limitations. The local plan states that the impact of any development should “be contained so that the scenic qualities and the tourist experience of the area are not compromised”.
 They also pointed out that the Gozo and Comino Local Plan considers Xlendi valley as “one of the more important
 valley systems on Gozo” and scheduled as a Level 1 area of ecological importance and a site of scientific importance given its ecological, geological, geomorphological and scientific properties.
 “Approval of this development would signify a deliberate intention to continue ruining Xlendi,” the Wirt Għawdex committee added in its objection.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/local-plans-review-mean-development-groups-insist.1101263,"Any review of the local plans must not lead to further development, a number of residents' groups and NGO Il-Kollettiv insisted on Wednesday.
 Noting statements made by the prime minister and the  leader of the opposition, the groups said that a review of the local plans without a suspension of development in rationalisation zones would effectively lead to more construction. The rationalisation zones are areas where development was given the go-ahead some 15 years ago after having initially been outside development zones. 
 The groups said the government should also introduce measures to eliminate various loopholes in secondary policies which have led to a spate of applications for tall buildings on the limits of urban conservation areas. 
 In July the groups called for a moratorium on the rationalisation zones, suspension of large projects, the enforcement of buffer zones around UCAs, and the refusal of applications for new roads opening virgin land for development. 
 “The Prime Minister and his Cabinet had been insisting that local plans could not change, now the tune is starting to change. We wonder if this is a way to justify the shambolic way in which the change in the St Julians Local Plan is being carried out, or a ploy to further weaken the protection afforded to our towns by the local plans,” said Wayne Flask, Secretary of il-Kollettiv.
 “It’s worrying to hear the prime minister implying that rationalisation zones are here to stay. These are the main source of anger for many residents, especially in towns where the borders are no longer recognisable, and whose identity is being rapidly lost to development. In Zurrieq and the surrounding region, the plan is to create one huge agglomeration of built-up land, which will result in the destruction of the green belt, lead to more congestion, and generate overpopulation.”
 Back in July, the resident groups held a press conference in Zurrieq where they highlighted the issues in their towns. They then wrote to the Prime Minister and Planning Minister, in a letter signed by the Għaqda Residenti taż-Żurrieq, Għaqda Storja u Kultura Birżebbuġa, Għaqda Storja u Kulturali Marsa, Inħarsu Santa Luċija, Residenti tal-Imqabba, Residenti tal-Qrendi, Residenti ta’ Ħal Safi, Residenti tas-Swatar, Siġġiwin Nieħdu Azzjoni, Sliema Residents Association, Marsaskala Residents Network, Marsaxlokk Heritage, Wirt iż-Żejtun and il-Kollettiv.
 No reply has been received yet.
 The groups called on the prime minister and the leader of the opposition for a serious discussion on their points for a planning reform, also noting how both major parties have publicly admitted their availability to meet big developers.

 The target is one of 22 included in the National Biodiversity and Action Plan (NBSAP) for 2030, which was published on Thursday. 
 According to the document, by 2025 a plan will be developed to ensure the target will be reached by 2030.
 “By 2027, a standard system for the evaluation of management effectiveness of Natura 2000 sites is developed and assessments are carried out periodically,” the document reads. 
 Back in March, Ħondoq ir-Rummien, near Qala in Gozo was formally designated as a Special Area of Conservation by the Environment Resources Authority.
 The designation means that Ħondoq ir-Rummien has been given top environmental protection and the government officially recognises the natural importance of the area. 
 Special Areas of Conservation usually include natural habitats and species of flora and fauna and offer a high biodiversity value. 
 The document is Malta’s second National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan, the first launched back in 2012, covering the period till 2020.
 The plan includes 22 targets and 78 actions and NBSAP aims to protect Malta’s biodiversity by “providing strategic direction, addressing local challenges, and aligning with international agreements.”
 The document includes five key policy areas, which delve into the restoration of nature and biodiversity loss, using biodiversity sustainably, awareness raising, and enhancing implementation and cooperation.
 A number of the targets in the document have previously been announced, including Target 6, which promises that by 2030, 50% of the most harmful invasive alien species affecting protected areas will be duly managed. 
 This will be done through the recommendations of the National Strategy for Preventing and Mitigating the Impact of Invasive Alien Species (IAS), which was launched back in 2020.
 Target 8 reads: 
 “By 2030, pollution from all sources, inter alia, excess nutrients, pesticides, chemicals, plastics, noise and light is prevented, controlled or minimised to levels that are not harmful to biodiversity in line with EU and international commitments.”
  One of the actions for this target is that by 2027, ‘quiet areas’ will be outlined on land while taking into consideration the harmful effect of noise on wildlife. 
 A Noise Action Planning in Malta document, dated June 2011, includes identifying and protecting quiet areas in Malta. 
 Certain action points are policies or measures already set up and implemented. 
 The biodiversity plan was launched at Xrobb l-Għaġin, another site soon to be declared a Special Conservation Area, by Environment Minister Miriam Dalli. 
 Speaking during the launch, Dalli said 95% of the goals of the previous strategy were addressed and more than half of them were obtained. 
 She said currently, 28.5% of Maltese land is protected. She said 35.5% of Malta’s Fisheries Management Zones are designated as Marine Protected Areas. 
 “The results of these positive achievements are paying off, that is why we are seeing more frequent sightings of sea species such as dolphins and turtles,” she said. 
 ""This plan is our commitment to safeguarding Malta's natural heritage for future generations. Together, we can ensure a sustainable and biodiverse country.""

https://timesofmalta.com/article/spearfishermen-attempt-cliffside-escape-illegal-night-fishing.1096027,"Two spearfishermen attempted to climb a cliff in l-Aħrax in Mellieħa at night to escape from police after being caught red-handed fishing illegally at night.
 The NGO Malta Rangers Unit members were patrolling the area last Saturday at 9pm when they spotted a group of 25 people. While most were on land, five were spearfishing with lights in the open sea, an illegal activity under Maltese and European law.
 Spearguns were spotted on land that appeared planned for later use.
  Given the large number of people, the rangers contacted the Fisheries Department, which promptly arrived on site with the police and the Rapid Intervention Unit. The authorities blocked the vehicles of the accused.
 As a result, the fishermen switched off their lights, leading to an hour-long search along the coast. They started climbing the cliffside to escape, but a ranger - watching from the cliff edge above them - urged them to stop climbing because of the dangers caused by the uneven surface.
 “Our first concern was their safety. The second concern was why they would go to such lengths to avoid being caught for a smaller crime,” said a spokesperson for the rangers.
 The fishermen had no choice but to be guided by the rangers to find their way back up since they had walked too deep into the bouldered area without any knowledge of the topography.
 The accused eventually gave up trying to escape. The police elevated the spearguns and fish.
  The rangers said they have recently seen a lot of undersized and illegal catch during night-time.
 Last month, two men were caught in the exact location trying to spearfish at night. The Malta Rangers Unit and the Fishing Department also apprehended them.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/public-urged-join-neil-agius-swim-help-power-nationwide-clean-ups.1097014,"On August 31 the public can join ultra-endurance athlete Neil Agius in a nine-hour swim that the activist hopes will raise funds for coastal clean-ups. 
 The public swim forms part of Agius’ training programme as he gears up to attempt a world record open water sea challenge next month.
 The nine-hour training session that is being opened to the public will be held at the National Pool Complex in Tal-Qroqq on August 31 from 3pm to midnight. 
 The event, organised in collaboration with SportMalta,  aims to foster a sense of community among swimmers of all levels. 
 “This community swim is more than just a training session,” Agius said. “It's about inspiring people to get active, embrace the power of the ocean, and contribute to a cleaner, healthier environment for future generations.
 ”The event will feature timed swim lanes catering to all levels, allowing participants to enjoy a structured workout and gain unique insights into the world of ultra-endurance sports while Agius prepares for his greatest challenge yet,"" SportMalta said in a statement on Wednesday.
 “We view this event as a valuable opportunity to advance our mission of promoting sport and physical activity, bringing us closer to our goal of creating a healthier, more inclusive and successful Malta"".
 The event is open to swimmers of all ages and abilities, with entry fees set at €10 for children and €15 for adults. Places are limited, and early registration is encouraged.
 Funds raised during the public training session will help finance a series of community clean-ups that will take place while Agius attempts his upcoming world record swim in September. 
 That challenge will see Agius swim the open-sea route along the coastal waters of the entire Maltese archipelago, covering approximately 160km. 
 The challenge is expected to take three days and will require an estimated 175,000 strokes. If successful, Agius will break the current world record for the longest non-stop, unassisted, current neutral sea swim, which he himself holds.  
 It will be Agius’ first attempt at breaking the record after he was forced to abandon a similar swim in Spain last year. 
 In September 2023, Agius required medical attention after he swam into a swarm of jellyfish spanning several kilometres off the coast of Mallorca. 
 Agius is using this year’s swim to raise awareness about the state of Malta’s marine habitat with the aim of inspiring collective commitment to protecting the Mediterranean Sea.
 NGO Wave of Change, which Agius founded, is teaming up with marine clean-up experts Żibel for a series of initiatives tied to the swim.  
 Żibel will be coordinating three coastal clean-ups around the island, which the public is invited to join.  
 The NGO will also be facilitating individual and smaller community clean ups through the use of designated  Żibel Tribe bins, with all marine litter to be collected and managed by the NGO with the aim of making new sustainable products.
 With over 149,500kgs of waste collected by Żibel to date, the problem is far from solved. 
 “As an island nation we depend on the Mediterranean sea for almost everything, it is arguably our most important asset. As Maltese, it is in our heritage and our duty to care for the Mediterranean,” Żibel founder Andrew Schembri said.
 To book your spot in the public swim, send an email on neil@neilagius.com with the number of people who plan to join and any preferred timings.
  Agius has been training intensively for months to prepare for the challenge. 
 This is the first time Agius will be attempting a swim at the end of summer. 
 His training is more intense than ever before, swimming for 10 hours approximately four times a week in the height of the Maltese summer heat, while still maintaining a full-time job. 
 He is swimming for longer periods under higher tension and pushing himself to reach his maximum capacity more often. 
 Agius is supported by a team of around 25 volunteers and professionals made up of medics, swim observers, navigators, skippers and crew, motivators, media, and a nutritionist, who will ensure that he remains safe and healthy throughout the swim.
 In anticipation of the swim he has worked with leading sleep deprivation experts, developed a specialised breathing technique, and prepared mentally for the challenges that such a lengthy challenge poses.  
 The athlete has developed The Ocean Mindset, a mindfulness technique which has fuelled his current swim and these tools are being adopted and used by many of his current partners including GO, the lead partner powering this swim and all Neil’s endeavours for the next three years. 
 The Small Island, Big Swim is also supported by VisitMalta, Atlas Insurance, Cisk 0.0, Kia, Garmin and Maypole.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/second-turtle-nest-season-discovered-ghajn-tuffieha.1094733,"Another turtle nest - the second one this summer - was discovered at Għajn Tuffieħa.
 But the nest was too close to the surface and the shore, so Environment and Resources Authority (ERA) and Nature Trust Malta (NTM) officials moved the nesting to Golden Bay (Ir-Ramla tal-Mixquqa).
 Volunteers discovered another turtle nest at this same bay last month.
  The nest was found during a routine morning patrol by NTM volunteers. But its proximity to the surface and the shore made the nest vulnerable if weather conditions became unfavourable.
 To maximise its chances of survival, ERA and NTM coordinated an emergency operation to transfer the eggs to a safer location at Golden Bay. The new site has also been cordoned off to ensure no direct trampling on the nest.
 Beachgoers are being urged to act responsibly as excessive noise, trampling and light close to the nesting area might pose a threat to eggs and any hatchlings.
 People who notice any turtle activity should immediately report it to ERA on 2292 3500 9999 9505.
 Volunteers are needed to help with monitoring and other tasks related to this turtle nest. Those who wish to volunteer can get in touch on turtle.naturetrust@gmail.com

https://timesofmalta.com/article/watch-local-hedgehogs-inbreeding-lack-green-spaces.1096891,"The spread of construction and new buildings in green areas is causing Malta’s hedgehog population to become inbred, according to Nature Trust Malta.
 Vince Attard, the CEO of the organisation that cares for injured wildlife, said they had noticed this worrying trend which is leading to increased health problems among the hedgehogs that come to their treatment centre.
 “Before, when there were less buildings, there were what we call natural corridors, which would allow hedgehogs to move between villages, for example from Marsaxlokk they would go to Marsascala or Żejtun,” Attard said.
 “Now we are cutting off the connections between green areas, which causes a lot of interbreeding because the community continues to mate with the same individuals in the area.”
  Attard added that aside from the genetic problems that could lead to hedgehog population collapse, the closing of these natural green corridors for wildlife has led to greater incidence of diseases such as ringworm.
 “It is a huge battle that we are helpless to fight,” he said. “We have hundreds of hedgehogs that come in to be treated for ringworm every year and it’s a long process because it takes them between 12 to 16 weeks to heal.”
 This is why, Attard continued, it was more critical than ever for Malta to protect its countryside.
 “We appeal to the authorities to consider that, aside from having green open spaces for people to enjoy, we need to take care of our natural open spaces because they are home to our biodiversity.
 “The more it shrinks, the more footprint of our natural areas that we lose, the more we risk losing this species.” Attard also thinks the same could happen to other endemic animals in Malta, such as the native species of shrew. Due to its insular nature, if Malta does not increase efforts to protect its countryside, these species could be lost for ever, he said.
 The volunteers who work with the rescued hedgehogs at the Xrobb l-Għaġin Wildlife Rehabilitation Centre are currently studying the ringworm problem among the Maltese hedgehog population.
 If left untreated, the fungus can be deadly as it causes their skin to dry up and lose all their spikes, weakening them.
 But with treatment, the hedgehogs eventually are able to regrow their spikes and are released back into the wild once they test negative for ringworm. “These cases are increasing. Roughly 500 of the 1,200 calls for rescues we receive are about hedgehogs,” Attard said.
 “We do see a mix of babies needing to be rescued after the mother has died or hedgehogs who have been attacked by dogs or cats, but half of the patients we have right now need to be treated for ringworm.”

https://timesofmalta.com/article/cassola-calls-investigation-pa-sanctioning-sannat-penthouses.1097054,"Arnold Cassola on Thursday asked the Ombudsman to investigate the planning authority’s sanctioning of penthouses in a Sannat development linked to construction mogul Joseph Portelli. 
 The sanctioning is linked to the development of apartment blocks with pools in rural Gozo which was proposed in two different applications in 2020 and 2021.
 Activists had insisted the applications could not be judged singularly and in a vacuum, as they formed part of an attempt to fragment a mega-development to avoid the scrutiny such a large project would require. 
 In one of the applications (PA2035/21), Mark Agius, a developer and business partner of Portelli, applied to excavate a site and construct 29 apartments, 20 basement garages and a pool. The proposal was approved in 2021.
 Heritage NGO Din L-Art Ħelwa had filed an appeal against the PA’s approval. When the  Environment and Planning Tribunal also approved the development, it took the issue to the law courts.
 In March, Chief Justice Mark Chetcuti noted that the EPRT had incorrectly applied policies when it approved the development.
 The court noted that the approved pool and penthouse floor level should not have been approved, and the permit for this part was revoked.
 However, by then both the pool and the penthouses had been constructed and an application (PA/03869/24) to sanction two of the illegal penthouses was filed by Tarlochan Singh.
 In the application, Singh declared he is not an owner of the entire site, but is authorised to carry out the proposed development through an agreement with the owner.
 Flimkien għal Ambjent Aħjar and DLĦ protested the sanctioning with the latter applying for the revocation of the sanctioning permit.
 Cassola meanwhile asked the Commissioner for Environment and Planning within the Office of the Ombudsman to look into the matter.
 ""The sanctioning of these illegal structures raises serious questions about the integrity and responsibility of the PA.
 ""It is worrying how a court decision - which clearly declared that the development is illegal - has been ignored,"" Cassola said, adding that the move created a dangerous precedent that could potentially negatively impact the public's trust in the planning system. 
 He urged the commissioner to look into whether the court ruling was taken into consideration during the sanctioning process, and whether there was any outside influence or irregularities that could have led to the sanctioning of the illegal structures.
 Meanwhile, DLĦ has appealed the sanctioning decision, saying it believed the process had been ""carried out in a secretive and opaque manner by means of an expedited summary process"".
 The NGO said the application contained no reference to the previous permission which had been revoked by the court and even though a summary application cannot be processed if the application does not comply with plans and policies, the PA went ahead and approved the application.
 ""The PA has acted with complete disregard for the rule of law, making itself complicit in rule-breaking and abusive practices. DLĦ will not turn a blind eye to this flagrant disregard of the law,"" it added.
 ""The PA must be reined in and the individuals responsible for this shameful episode must bear responsibility for their actions.""
 Similarly, FAA said the PA had set itself above the courts, meaning rule of law no longer existed in Malta.
 ""The implications of this are extremely serious. The ordinary citizen is being denied the basic elements of justice, as this annuls citizens' efforts, funds and basic rights to seek legal redress against abuse, shaking the very foundations of our democracy.""
 FAA said the PA has ""sunk to new lows of conspiring to encourage unlawful acts"".
 By 'legalising' the two penthouses the PA had defied the highest court:
 ""The PA and the EPRT, along with the Superintendence of Cultural Heritage, are persisting in sinking this country into a mire of illegalities.
 ""This latest violation of a court decision issued by the Chief Justice endorses the perception that we are living in a country where Joseph Portelli and his fellow developers have ultimate power over laws and court, like a Mafia state.""
 In an open letter to Planning Minister Clint Camilleri, a group of NGOs expressed deep concern for the sanctioning of the development and called for a “thorough review of current practices and urgent action” to remedy the situation. 
 The letter, sent by the group Għawdix, said it is unacceptable that Malta’s planning system allows developers to continue building throughout the appeals process with no restrictions. 
 Such a situation is creating a lose-lose situation for both appellants, who are left with a hollow victory as the development would already have been completed, and the applicants, whose buildings end up in legal limbo. 
 They recalled Prime Minister Robert Abela’s promise to reform this system but noted that, despite a public consultation on the matter having closed last November, there has been no change. 
 “Allowing a development to proceed while an appeal is pending, only to retroactively sanction it after a court has ruled against it, effectively nullifies the authority of the judiciary. It creates a scenario where developers can flagrantly ignore legal rulings, secure in the knowledge that they can simply apply for retroactive approval. This practice is an affront to justice, erodes public confidence in the planning process, and sends a clear message that the Planning Authority’s decisions are beyond the reach of judicial oversight,” they said. 
 “Minister Camilleri, it is your duty, as well as that of your Ministry, and the Government that represents the people, to uphold and protect the public interest, safeguard our rights as citizens, and ensure the rule of law in this country. We trust that you will treat this matter with the urgency and seriousness it demands, and take the necessary steps to restore justice and fairness to Malta's planning processes.”

https://timesofmalta.com/article/60-loggerhead-turtles-hatch-translocated-nest-golden-bay.1097113,"A total of 60 turtles hatched out of a second loggerhead nest over three days in Golden Bay.
 This nest was discovered on July 1 in Għajn Tuffieħa but had to be translocated to Golden Bay as it was too close to the sea and at risk of being lost.
  The nest was excavated on Friday by the Environment and Resources Authority, Nature Trust Malta and a VET to assess its status.
 The nest held a total of 74 eggs, 60 of which hatched successfully. A group of 25 hatchlings needed to be helped out of the nest.
  This is the first hatching of a translocated nest in Malta.
 Six more nests are expected to hatch in the coming weeks.
 ERA is urging a higher degree of caution near the nests during this increasingly sensitive time.  
 Should the public be present during a hatching event, no lights or flashes are to be used and noise is to be kept to a minimum.
 ERA also thanked the public and volunteers for their cooperation and efforts this season.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/mda-activists-took-law-hands-vandalised-illegal-pool.1094723,"Activists who defaced a pool that was built illegally in Qala by developer Joseph Portelli were slammed by the Malta Development Association on Monday for ""taking the law into their hands"".
 The protest was held on Saturday when the activists lit flares and sprayed paint on the walls as they chanted “ Mill Qala sas-Sannat, il-liġi għal Allat [From Qala to Sannat, laws are for the Gods] and  Tiżfnu għad-daqqa tal-iżviluppaturi [You dance to the tune of developers].
 Portelli excavated the pool site without a permit. Despite having breached the law, the Planning Authority and its appeals tribunal, the EPRT, both approved the ODZ development.
 Objectors persisted and in March, a court revoked the permit the PA had granted Portelli. But by then Portelli had already built the swimming pool, as planning laws allow developers to proceed with works while appeals processes are ongoing.
 In its statement on Monday, the MDA said that while it acknowledged the right to protest, this did not mean that one could take the law into his own hands with actions that breached public order, such as when property was infiltrated and vandalised.
 Saturday's actions reflected serious inconsistency by the lobby group, which alleged illegality of the site while breaching the law itself, the MDA said.
 ""It is unacceptable for individuals to take the law into their own hands and it should be the authorities who act and penalise such acts.""
 The association said it acknowledged shortcomings in the planning system and it continued to hold that reforms should be carried out to stop abuse, not least by developers who gave the industry a bad name.
 Discussion on change should be held within the parameters of the law through constructive dialogue, the MDA said, adding that it was ready to take an active part in the process.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/everywhere-covered-apartments-alarm-new-building-proposal.1093911,"Proposed revisions to the way that building heights are interpreted could give rise to additional floors being allowed to be built, sparking concern from conservation groups. 
 The Planning Authority is currently running a public consultation to amend a policy in Development Control Design Policy, Guidance and Standards, a controversial document commonly known as the  DC15.
 Previously, height limitations for buildings were set by the number of floors that could be built in any given area, as set out by the local plans. 
 However, an annexe included in DC15, Annexe 2, laid out a table in which the maximum allowable heights of buildings previously indicated as floors, had now been converted into metres. 
 Should the amendments to policy 35 of DC15, which regulates allowable building height, be accepted, it will formalise this interpretation of the guidelines. 
 Speaking to Times of Malta, architect and Din l-Art Ħelwa president Patrick Calleja said that when it comes to urban conservation areas, the door has been left wide open to interpretation. 
 According to the revision document published by the PA on the consultation, building heights in the UCA that do not exceed the height of their street facade will be determined by a “streetscape analysis”, while any additional height above this will be assessed based on the policy that regulates setback floors. 
 It also says that when UCA buildings face open areas, such as piazzas, the countryside or a seafront, a setback of at least 4.25 metres will be required. 
 “If height limitation in the UCA will depend on the streetscape then it means it is open to interpretation,” Calleja said. 
 “The impact will be felt all over Malta, even in the UCA. Buildings at the border of the UCA could be built up to five floors, obstructing views of UCA buildings. We’re going to see everywhere covered in apartments.” 
  Calleja and DLĦ are urging people to object to this policy because they say it will allow developers to squeeze in an extra floor into their developments thus creating denser buildings that will increase crowding and further strain the public infrastructure that supports them. 
 Calleja also pointed out that the 2007 local plan interpretation document makes it very clear that considering the number of floors is a key point in assessing whether a development is suitable. 
 “Floors are also centres of activity generation. This is a very important concept and not giving it the due consideration will result in increasing the development intensity in an area over and above that which is statutorily indicated in a local plan. Therefore, unless the local plan’s policy or its interpretation indicates otherwise, development proposals should strictly adhere to the number of floors stipulated in an approved local plan,” the interpretation document reads. 
  DLĦ are not the only ones raising concerns about this, with Wayne Flask of il-Kollettiv calling the move “another planning disaster”. 
 Flask said that this reform would see several areas in Malta opened up to developments of up to five storeys, running the risk of “ruining” villages and which “guarantee years of prolonged construction”. He claimed that the policy will also lead to the sanctioning of several illegal buildings. 
 “In an attempt to satisfy a building lobby that doesn’t have anywhere else to build, this change in policy will assure more floors for developers and less quality of life for the general public,” he said. 
  Flimkien għal-Ambjent Aħjar is also urging its members to object to the policy change, highlighting that the policy is unclear on precedence in the UCA. 
 “With this consultation, we are unable to determine if the policy will be changed for building height limitations for Urban Conservation Areas, as we are given a small part of the policy, with some changes and some others staying the same,” they said. 
 “This blanket increase of one floor on traditional townhouse areas designated as one, two or three floors and will further undermine these areas, allowing five-storey apartment blocks in Malta’s towns and villages with no consideration for existing streetscapes.”
 Objections can be sent via email to consultation_dc15@pa.org.mt until Monday, June 17.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/ngos-decry-appeal-outrageous-development-permit-in-xaghra.1096008,"A coalition of environmental NGOs in Gozo has hit out at the approval by the Planning Commission of a development application which will see a six-unit ridge-edge development in Xagħra, overlooking Marsalforn valley. 
 Din l-Art Ħelwa, Wirt Għawdex and Għawdix said strong objections had been raised over several issues, including breaches of development control design policies and standards.
 Among others, Policy P33 states that such a number of units forming part of an internal residential development is not allowed, and  all new residential units are required to have direct frontage onto a public road. Yet none of the units within the proposed development fronts a public road, the only access to the site being through a narrow alley in a small street.
 Objections were also voiced during a meeting of the Planning Commission. But Commission chairperson Martin Camilleri contended that although the proposed units do not front a public road, they front a valley, the NGOs said.
 The coalition said it was shameful that NGOs had to continue assuming the role of authority officials, whose job it is to properly scrutinise development applications 'but instead seem intent on bypassing policies and proper screening'.
 The NGOs said they were also concerned that the zone had long been known to feature caves, and archaeological finds were made in the area in the past. The first was made by Rev. Francesco Mercieca in December, 1938.
 Yet in its submitted representation, the Superintendence of Cultural Heritage simply remarked that the proposed development is “a relatively moderate proposal not exceeding commitments” and that it “does not challenge the lie of the land along the ridge”, and therefore it did not object. It noted that the applicant was to inform of any accidental discoveries, but, did not impose any archaeological monitoring despite the context of the site in question, the NGOs said.
 The Environment and Resources Authority was likewise nonchalant about the application and did not object to the felling of trees, simply requesting that they be transplanted to a site in Qala, where they are to be maintained for three years.
 Din l-Art Ħelwa, supported by Wirt Għawdex, and represented by Perit Tara Cassar, has lodged an appeal.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/it-matter-life-death-dangerous-rabat-rubble-mountain-reduced.1097580,"Updated 8am
 A quarry that was illegally backfilled to become a “rubble mountain” in rural Rabat will begin to shrink following fresh enforcement action, the authorities have pledged.
 The site in the Lunzjata area has grown several storeys high despite previous Planning Authority (PA) enforcement notices against Tlata Ltd, owned by Paul Falzon. 
 But, now, the authorities say their latest action will reduce the construction rubble that neighbours fear has become dangerous.
 “The Planning Authority took the initiative so that no new material is allowed on the site,” a spokesperson for the Environment and Resources Authority told Times of Malta.
 
 “Meanwhile, material in the area will be taken out, meaning that stockpiles will be reduced.”
 Last week, a neighbouring farmer spoke of his fears for his safety and property due to falling boulders or a landslide.
 Angelo Giordmaina said the quarry was backfilled to ground level about four years ago but continued to grow afterwards.
  “The danger here is a matter of life and death,” the 63-year-old warned. “A boulder could roll down and hit me, or the entire mass of rubble could come crashing down in a landslide.”
 Architect Godwin Abela, who surveyed the quarry, which is visible from kilometres away, had advised all activities stop immediately “to avoid potential tragedy”.
 There are already two active enforcement notices from the PA dating to 2005 and 2009.
 In April 2019, Tlata Ltd applied for a PA permit to “backfill the existing quarry, construct a concrete batching plant and establish a concrete block manufacturing plant”.
 The application was refused, but the backfilling continued regardless. In the same month, the Environmental and Resources Authority issued a stop-work order against Tlata Ltd.
 
 ERA said that Tlata Ltd is being fined daily because of the infringement.
 Replying to questions, a PA spokesperson said their initiative to reduce stockpiles at the site is being enforced by “regularly monitoring the site”.
 Meanwhile, last week Arnold Cassola said he had asked the Ombudsman to investigate government inaction over the illegal backfilling. 
 On Wednesday morning, the independent candidate said in a statement the Commissioner for the Environment had started an investigation into the workings of the PA.   
 Cassola's complaint was about the illegal dumping of rubble for the last 15 years and the lack of any enforcement on the part of various government authorities including the PA.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/watch-former-mep-cyrus-engerer-joins-leadership.1094700,"Former Labour MEP Cyrus Engerer has joined the leadership of a recently formed activist NGO that has promised to set up a new political party by the next general election.
 In an interview with Times of Malta, Wayne Flask and Matthew Borg – co-founders of  Il-Kollettiv – confirmed Engerer had joined the NGO as its vice-secretary a few weeks ago but said it was too early to tell whether he, or anyone else, would contest on the new party’s ticket come next election.
 “Our priority right now is to set up internal structures that would allow members to join. We’d rather strengthen our activism before we move on to discussing the political party. But we have a vision and we have a strategy to get there,” Flask said.
 “It’s a pleasure to have a [former] MEP join us, because he chose us knowing we cannot pay, when he could have maybe taken up some lucrative job or posting elsewhere.”
 Il-Kollettiv (which literally translates to ‘The Collective’) was unveiled last April as a new activist group that will help residents across Maltese localities organise themselves to fight excessive development, social injustices and inequality, among other issues.
  Along with Borg and Flask is also Jeanette Borg, the NGO’s president and one of its co-founders.
 Engerer had publicly expressed support for the group on the day it launched. At the time he was still an MEP and it was not yet clear whether he was going seek re-election, and he eventually did not.
 ‘No conflict of interest’
 Times of Malta contacted Engerer, asking him whether he has resigned from the PL now that he holds a leadership role in an NGO that plans to create its own political party.
 “Technically, I remain a member of Partit Laburista because my membership is paid,” he said, adding that he did resign from the party last year over the government’s stance on the Jean Paul Sofia public inquiry, after he was prevented from attending a parliamentary group meeting that discussed the issue.
 “Since I was not allowed to join online (as I had done for all other meetings while being abroad on parliamentary duties), I decided to resign because I could not agree with an internal system that does not even allow for the airing of views – let alone be in a position to help change them.
 “Although my resignation was not accepted and I continued to receive invitations to parliamentary group meetings and other events, I chose not to attend any of them – apart from the following one that had then discussed the terms of reference of the public inquiry.”
 So, does he think he will have a conflict of interest now? Not really.
 “Since Il-Kollettiv is an NGO, there is no conflict of interest since the principles and beliefs defined in Partit Laburista’s statute are in line with those of  Il-Kollettiv,” he told  Times of Malta.
 “In the same way that my membership in MGRM [Malta Gay Rights Movement] was never in conflict with my membership in Partit Laburista.”
 Asked to say whether he has plans to contest the next general election on the new party’s ticket, Engerer simply said “Il-Kollettiv is an NGO, not a political party”.
 A party will emerge 
 In the interview earlier this week, Borg and Flask explained that Il-Kollettiv will not itself be turned into a party, as the NGO must continue the necessary activism in several localities.
 Rather, the new party will emerge out of it and will be up and running and have candidates contesting on its ticket by the next general election.
 Engerer hopes his knowledge and experience in policy, decision-making and campaigning in Malta and the EU could be an asset to the NGO.
  Not a third party
 Borg, the NGO’s treasurer, insisted it is unfair to dub it as another “third party”. Third parties have been doomed to live in the shadows of the big parties because referring to them as ‘third parties’ implies they are third best.
 “It’s like there are two big parties and the rest are fighting it out at the bottom to see who gets to slide in between the two big ones,” he said.
 “We’re not attempting to create a third party, but another party. Our aim is to build a strong relationship with the residents. We don’t just go to the locality and tell them they can object to some application. We help them spearhead their own fight themselves.”
 If they are activists, then why didn’t they join the many other existent activist groups, like Moviment Graffiti?
 Il-Kollettiv is different, they said, because unlike the others, it aims to produce and push forward political candidates to run for office.
 “We wanted to go a step further, because you never see activists run for office,” Borg said.
  Borg and Flask are aware, however, that the smaller parties have so far failed to break the electoral glass ceiling time and time again. They are trying to crack it by proposing drastic electoral reform days after election results were published last month, and by staying as close to the people as possible – “unlike the many politicians who say they are close to the people but in fact are out of touch with voters’ realities”.
 The 135,000 voters who did not vote for the big parties in the MEP election are a testament to that, they believe, and Il-Kollettiv is tapping into that potential.
 A coalition with whom?
 Even if their candidates were to be elected in the next general election, in the absence of a majority they would likely need to form a coalition with one of the big parties.
 Asked which party they might feel comfortable with, Borg and Flask said that decision lay way into the future. They must first develop their electoral manifesto and see what the big parties would come up with in theirs.
 For now, they are sticking to empowering residents to take up fights for the common good. They say they have already scored a few significant victories in Żurrieq, Qrendi and Safi, where development applications were frozen or refused after residents set up associations, organised press conferences and took to the streets in protest.
 “When residents work together they grow closer together and feel part of the fight,” Borg said.
 Flask added: “We’d also like to see this process work in other localities without the need for our intervention. One group which already works really well autonomously is the Marsascala Residents Network. These examples give us great courage.”
 The left too fragmented?
 Voters significantly switched to small parties and independent candidates in the MEP election, but there were not nearly enough of them to hit a quota. Furthermore, their topmost preferences were spread across too many different candidates. Consequently, no candidate garnered enough switchers’ votes to make it through the electoral system and get elected.
 Do Borg and Flask feel like their new party will eventually add even more to the fragmentation which ultimately made it harder for everyone to get elected?
 They do not think so and insist that the values of several independent candidates clash with theirs. One of those is Conrad Borg Manché, with whom Flask said he does not agree in principle.
 Flask is a long-time critic of the big political parties, but he managed to identify some good things that Robert Abela and Bernard Grech did during their tenure.
 Rent reform was one of Abela’s best decisions, he said, and Grech impressed him the most with the latest electoral result, not so much the MEP election result as the local councils one.
 “The PN regained the majority in Gozo despite the fact that the PL made Clint Camilleri the government’s planning minister,” he said.
 “However, both parties now need to decide whether they will govern for the people or for the developers, because so far, neither party has concretely and consistently come out against excessive development.”
 Meanwhile, asked what pushed him away from the PL, Engerer said “the party stopped being the catalyst of change” and instead of embracing diversity and encouraged critical thinking, it took on a narrative and made policies aimed at the party hardcore.
 “Fortress mentalities in parties lead to the ‘everyone is against us’ idea which is dangerous and which builds walls rather than bridges,” he said.
 “It also gives the impression that some are superior to others, leading to arrogance and the ridicule of the rest.”

https://timesofmalta.com/article/bernard-grech-challenges-labour-back-metsola-ep-president.1094184,"Bernard Grech has challenged Labour to back Roberta Metsola’s candidacy for European Parliament president.
 “I hope that Robert Abela will, for once, set aside partisan interests and back a person who has brought recognition and respect to Malta’s name internationally,” Grech said as he entered parliament on Wednesday.
 “Abela ran a campaign of fear in which he continuously attacked Metsola as a warmonger. Now I hope he will change that narrative and give her the backing she needs.”
  Metsola is the frontrunner to be named EP President after she secured the unanimous backing of MEPs within her political grouping, the European People’s Party, to be its candidate for the post.
 The EPP is the largest grouping within the European Parliament. But it does not have an absolute majority of seats, and Metsola’s nomination must be approved by a majority of MEPs for her to be reelected to the presidency.
 If successful, she will be the second MEP and first woman to serve as EP president for two terms, after Germany’s Martin Schulz.
 Metsola is only the third woman to hold the post of European Parliament president and was the youngest-ever person to serve in that role when she was first appointed in January 2022.
 Labour MEPs form part of the EPP’s rival group, the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D).
 The S&D has not yet said whether it intends to back Metsola’s bid or push for another candidate to assume the parliament presidency.
 Abela has yet to comment on Metsola’s candidacy or say whether he will instruct Labour’s three MEPs, who form part of the S&D grouping, to vote in her favour.
 When Metsola was first elected in 2022, the S&D had backed her. Metsola was elected with an overwhelming majority of 458 out of 690 votes on that occasion.
 The European Parliament president is elected for two-and-a-half years and represents the parliament in its relations with other EU institutions and the outside world.
 The president also signs the EU’s budget and any laws passed by MEPs.
 Speaking later in the day during an interview on NET, Grech reiterated his challenge to Abela.
 “I hope Robert Abela and the Labour Party place the national interest before partisan interests and back Metsola’s candidacy,” he said. 
 Grech used that interview to express concern about news that the EU Commission will seek to open excessive deficit procedures against Malta for its budget overruns. 
  The Labour government was financing corruption and paying millions to its insiders while allowing public finances to fall into debt, he said. 
 A Nationalist government would cut excessive spending, he said, adding that he hoped the government would not try and fix this issue by resorting to austerity and reducing aid given to vitizens. 
 “This problem was caused by Robert Abela and (finance minister) Clyde Caruana, not by the Maltese people. They are paying the price for the government’s poor policies,” Grech said.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/public-service-expo-costs-exceeded-15-million-mp-claims.1101553,"The Public Service Expo held earlier this year cost over €1.5 million, well above the €680,840.38 initially reported by the Prime Minister in reply to a parliamentary question, Nationalist MP Claudette Buttiġieġ said on Monday.
 Speaking in Parliament,  Buttiġieġ detailed how it took 31 parliamentary questions to reveal the total expenditure of €1,531,051.78.
 She criticised the prime minister for providing incomplete information, saying details about direct orders and tenders remained undisclosed. 
 The expo, held from May 15 to 17 at Ta’ Qali, showcased work by various entities within the public service. 
 In June, Buttiġieġ had asked the prime minister in parliament how much the event cost. The reply cited only €680,840.38.  
 Buttiġieġ pointed out that her question was not how much the Office of the Prime Minister spent at the expo but rather how much the expo cost.
 According to  Buttiġieġ, 18 ministries contributed to the funding. The Economy Ministry spent the most, with €70,926.00, followed by the Environment Ministry at €62,490.00. The Lands Ministry recorded the lowest expenditure at €30,925.00.
 The substantial discrepancy in reported figures raises concerns about transparency in government spending and the accessibility of financial data related to public events, the Nationalist MP said.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/malta-high-commission-london-owes-722000-congestion-charges.1092996,"London is claiming the Maltese High Commission owes it £722,915 (€848,000) in unpaid congestion charges accumulated over the last two decades.
 This was published in a list of unpaid fees and fines amassed by some 160 diplomatic missions based in the UK capital over the last 20 years – totalling £143.5m (€168.3m).
 The figures were published by Transport for London, the UK government body responsible for transport.
 When asked about this, a spokesperson for Malta’s foreign affairs ministry said: “As the document published by Transport for London indicates, this long-standing matter relates to many diplomatic missions based in London. In this regard, Malta is addressing this request in the same way as other missions and in line with applicable international conventions.”
 The issue has been going on since 2020, when the UK foreign secretary issued a written ministerial statement revealing his officials have written to “a number of diplomatic missions and international organisations” to “press for payment” of money owed relating to the congestion charge.
 The congestion charge scheme involves a £15 (€17.60) daily fee for driving within an area of central London between 7am and 6pm on weekdays and between noon and 6pm on weekends and bank holidays.
  Various diplomatic missions, including Malta’s, are arguing they are exempt from paying the charges in accordance with international law. They are quoting the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and stressing that the congestion charge is a tax from which diplomatic missions are exempt.
 But Transport for London is insisting it is not a tax and should be paid.
 In the document listing the overdue fines, Transport for London wrote: “We and the UK government are clear that the congestion charge is a charge for a service and not a tax. This means that diplomats are not exempt from paying it. The majority of embassies in London do pay the charge but there remains a stubborn minority who refuse to do so, despite our representations through diplomatic channels. We will continue to pursue all unpaid congestion charge fees and related penalty charge notices and are pushing for the matter to be taken up at the International Court of Justice.”
 In the document, it goes on to list the total unpaid fees accrued by diplomats between the launch of the congestion charge in London in 2003 and the end of last year.
 The American Embassy tops the list with charges amounting to £14.5m (€17m) and is followed by the Embassy of Japan with £10.1m (€11.8m) and the High Commission for India at £8.5m (€9.9m).
 The lowest bills were accrued by the Embassy of Finland and the High Commission for the Commonwealth of Dominica, with £120 (€140) each, and the Embassy of the Republic of Togo, with a £40 (€47) bill.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/pn-calls-fresh-protest-monday-bartolocamilleri-scandal.1101603,"The Nationalist Party is to hold another protest outside parliament next Monday over the Clint Camilleri-Clayton Bartolo scandal, Bernard Grech said on Tuesday as he lashed out at the prime minister for not demanding Camilleri's resignation.
 The PN held a protest over the issue last week and Bartolo was forced to resign from the Cabinet and the Labour parliamentary group on Tuesday, although the prime minister said that was over a different matter.
 Camilleri and Bartolo have been under pressure since a Standards Commissioner report found they abused their position by granting consultancy jobs to the former's partner.
 When people take to the streets in protest they become unbeatable, Grech said in parliament as it discussed the budget estimates of the Ministry of Justice.
 He said that while Bartolo buckled under pressure and resigned, Clint Camilleri had yet to acknowledge that his position, too, had become untenable.
 ""The prime minister is weak. He knows he has huge internal problems and he is trying to hide them.  We are here to remind him that when you put the lid on the pot, the water boils quicker,"" he said.
 ""This prime minister is betraying the people because he keeps defending fraud.""
 Earlier on Tuesday, Abela announced that Bartolo was stepping down as tourism minister and as Labour MP. The prime minister said he had taken decisions after he learnt of  new claims involving Bartolo's wife.  
 Grech observed that since the scandal was revealed three weeks ago, the government attempted to make a joke of the people's protests and Bartolo was only willing to apologise, thinking it was enough.
 ""He has no shame, and the prime minister defended him, saying that the apology was enough,"" Grech said.  
 ""Today the people won against those who thought the people's money is theirs.""
 Grech went on to list some of the most recent allegations of ""fraud"" within the government, including the scam which saw benefits handed to people who falsely claimed severe disability, the racket in the granting of driving licences,  Rosianne Cutajar's ITS consultancy contract and the hospitals deal.
 Justice, Grech said, wasn't simply the courts or the judiciary, but a need for the people to live in a country that treated everyone fairly.
 ""On the contrary, the people feel the government has stolen their money and pigged out on it,"" he said.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/parliament-pays-tribute-late-former-mp-karl-gouder.1099183,"Robert Abela and Bernard Grech delivered heartfelt tributes to former MP Karl Gouder on Tuesday, urging fellow MPs to emulate the late politician's unwavering kindness, honesty, and patriotism.
 The government and opposition leaders were speaking during a special, 30-minute parliamentary session honouring the 45-year-old who shocked the country when he died suddenly last month.
 Gouder, a former PN mayor and MP, was touted as the party's next general secretary. 
 Gouder's family was present in parliament's strangers' gallery on Tuesday, and parliament published and distributed his first parliamentary speech, as is tradition.
 Speaker Anġlu Farrugia said the speech, which dates back to May 2010, shows Gouder was always ready to learn and seek the truth in all that he said.
 Abela said he first got to know Gouder as a fellow schoolboy. Both went to St Aloysius College but Gouder was a year younger.
 Abela said that even as a young man, Gouder had ""a sense of joy"" and as a member of parliament would debate arguments but never resorted to personal attacks.
 ""It's hard for me to speak about someone with whom I was in school. Karl never changed, and I confirmed that when we met in parliament years later,"" he said.
 ""Karl left us, but he also left many living memories. He has bestowed on us a sense of duty and responsibility, to behave like he did in this house - to seek reconciliation.""
 Abela said Gouder's funeral evoked a sense of unity that he only felt in one other funeral - that of young athlete Jake Vella, who also died last month after battling a long, gruelling illness.
 ""There was the feeling of a country that united behind one person,"" he said.
 ""Karl was a fellow student, a personal friend, and a man who gave his all for his country.""
 Gouder's party leader, Bernard Grech, said his death hit him almost as hard as that of both his parents, who also died in his four years as Opposition leader.
 He praised Gouder for his work on the PN's 2024 MEP election campaign, saying he was the ""backbone"" of that effort. 
 Gouder was there for all those who needed him, the PN leader said, noting how, in the days after his death, many people had shared screenshots of his words of encouragement and support to them.  
 ""Karl had a sense of unity - he sought to bring people together, not divide them and he knew how to do it gently without compromising his values,"" Grech recalled. 
 He had taken the Jesuit teaching of being a man for others to heart and lived that way. 
 ""He would find time for everyone and listen to everyone,"" Grech said. ""Karl took care of everyone. Let's be more sensitive and take care of each other like he used to.""
 Speaker Anġlu Farrugia also spoke in Gouder's memory, describing him as an upstanding gentleman.
 ""You had no choice but to love Karl,"" Farrugia said. 
 He also shared an anecdote.
 ""In 2023, I was going through a tough time, health-wise. He would text me every week, to ask how I was and whether I needed anything. And he would text me every year on my birthday,"" Farrugia recalled.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/abela-says-let-institutions-work-asked-vitals-inquiry.1093093,"Prime Minister Robert Abela returned to the “let the institutions work” mantra on Monday when asked whether he was concerned by the details that emerged from the magisterial inquiry into the hospitals concession.
 He echoed a call by President Myriam Spiteri Debono on Saturday to allow the courts to decide the case with serenity.
  “Now is the time to let the judges evaluate the evidence. These halls behind me rely on evidence and this is what they will be examining…the magisterial inquiry is not evidence but just a collection of facts…now the court will have to decide whether there is enough to convict anyone of a crime. This is the exercise that will start from tomorrow,” Abela said while speaking to journalists outside the law courts.
 In a clear reference to Steward Healthcare, Abela said he had taken political decisions back in 2020 without commenting on the guilt or otherwise of persons, which was a responsibility entrusted to the courts. “It is not up to me to declare whether anyone is innocent or guilty,” he said.
  Last Saturday, President Spiteri Debono called for “normality” to prevail in the coming days and insisted that nobody should provoke or fall for provocation, amid heightened political tensions ahead of the arraignment of former Prime Minister Joseph Muscat on Tuesday. 
 Although she did not mention it directly, the president was ostensibly referring to a show of support planned outside the courts during the arraignment.
 Prime Minister Robert Abela has warned PL supporters not to fall for a ""trap"" or be provoked though he did not specify what he was referring to. A Strong police presence is expected for tomorrow's protest.
 “Every citizen is free to act within the parameters of the rights given to him by the constitution. However, common sense and prudence dictate that in order not to fall for provocation, you should not seek provocation or, worse still, make or render yourself its agent,” Spiteri Debono said in her statement.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/this-eurovision-metsola-tells-meps-singing-bella-ciao-orban.1099214,"European Parliament President Roberta Metsola struggled to keep a group of left-leaning MEPs in check on Wednesday morning as they protested Viktor Orban’s presence with a rendition of the anti-fascist anthem Bella Ciao.
 “This is not the Eurovision,” Metsola told the plenary as singing rang out following Orban’s speech.
 The Hungarian prime minister was in Strasbourg to present the country’s priorities halfway through its EU Council presidency.
 As President Vladimir Putin's closest ally within the European Union, Orban's government is at loggerheads with its partners on a host of issues -- from stalling aid for Kyiv, to what the bloc sees as weakening the rule of law at home.
  Orban depicted a continent in crisis, with the Ukraine war on its doorstep and an acute ""migration crisis"" - declaring that ""the European Union needs to change.""
 Lawmakers listened respectfully - with occasional applause from sympathetic members – but the floodgates of criticism were burst open by the Bella Ciao rendition that tail-ended his appearance.
 Orban critics then took the floor and one by one let fly at the Hungarian leader with a message summed up by Green co-leader Terry Reintke who told him: ""You are not welcome here"".
 Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen, speaking right after Orban, pushed back hard - taking aim at Budapest's hampering of EU support for Kyiv and refusal to join Western efforts to arm Ukraine to fight off Moscow.
 ""There is only one path to achieve a just peace for Ukraine and for Europe, we must continue to empower Ukraine's resistance with political, financial and military support,"" von der Leyen said.
 When Hungary assumed the EU's rotating six-month presidency in July, Orban went off script: embarking on an uncoordinated Ukraine ""peace mission"" to Kyiv, Moscow and Beijing that sparked fury in Brussels.
 In her forceful address von der Leyen targeted Orban's eagerness to push for an early peace deal with Putin over the Ukraine invasion - assailing those ""who blame this war not on the invader but the invaded, not on Putin's lust for power, but on Ukraine's thirst for freedom.""
 Speaking next, the leader of the conservative European People's Party Manfred Weber likewise slammed his rogue diplomacy under the EU banner as ""a big propaganda show for the autocrats.""
 Orban's uncoordinated trips prompted von der Leyen to order top officials to skip a series of meetings organised by Hungary's presidency - a de facto boycott - and his parliament address was twice delayed.
 The commission chief skewered Orban's tough talk on migration - accusing his government of ""throwing problems over your neighbour's fence"" with the early release of convicted people-traffickers.
 And she took aim at a Hungarian visa scheme for Russian nationals - calling it ""a back door for foreign interference."" 
 One speaker, Dutch MEP Gerben-Jan Gerbrandy of the centrist Renew party, depicted Orban as a character in a ""bad movie"" - a ""Mini-Me"" to Putin, or former US president Donald Trump - ""who looks, talks and acts exactly like Dr Evil, but just sits on his lap.""
 Hungarian opposition-leader-turned-MEP Peter Magyar lamented that Hungary under Orban's rule ""has gone from a bright star to what is officially the poorest and most corrupt country in the European Union.""
 Given a right of reply, Orban accused the EU chief of using the commission's power as a ""political weapon"" to attack Budapest, and complained that a Hungarian-led new group in the EU parliament, the Patriots for Europe, was being unfairly denied positions of authority. 
 ""We are never going to accept that European unity means that you tell us what to do and that we should keep quiet,"" he said.
 Patriots member Jorge Buxade Villalba was one of several lawmakers who rallied to Orban's defence, calling his speech ""a breath of fresh air in this parliament.""
 ""Women are safer in Budapest streets than in Brussels,"" he said. ""And if you were not so sectarian, we would see Hungary's government has a way of making a better life.""
 Ahead of Orban's speech, various political groups staged photo-op protests outside the hemicycle, with one banner reading ""No cash for corrupt"" - in a reference to the billions of euros on EU funds for Hungary currently frozen over rule-of-law concerns.
 Since returning to lead his country in 2010, Orban has moved to curb civil rights and tighten his grip on power, repeatedly clashing with Brussels over rule-of-law issues.
 But Orban has pointed at hard-right electoral gains from Italy to the Netherlands and Austria - and the rising influence of his Patriots for Europe - as evidence the political climate in Europe is slowly but surely shifting in his favour.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/plans-mqabba-asphalt-plant-scrapped-robert-abela-announces.1092690,"Plans for an asphalt plant just 500 metres away from people's homes in Mqabba have been scrapped, Prime Minister Robert Abela announced on Sunday.
 ""We cannot have the asphalt and tarmac industry inching any closer to residents, and so today I can proudly announce that the proposed plant in Mqabba will not be built,"" he told supporters at an election campaign rally in Żurrieq.
 ""Thanks to the work of Minister Silvio Schembri and INDIS we have found a solution that means the plant will not be built next door to the residents of Mqabba,"" he said.
  The issue concerns plans submitted to the Planning Authority last year for the relocation of the BIP Ltd tarmac plant from Ħal Far to a disused quarry in Mqabba, relatively close to residential areas.
 The issue had sparked controversy last November, when residents of Qrendi, Mqabba, Żurrieq, Kirkop and Siġġiewi took to the streets in protest, saying the relocation was ""madness"" and expressing concern over the impact the plant would have on their long-term health.
 The local councils of Qrendi, Mqabba, Safi, Rabat, Żurrieq, Kirkop and Siġġiewi had also declared they were against the plant’s relocation, and so did ADPD, describing the move as ""ill-placed"", along with the PN.
 
 On Sunday Abela did not say much else about the plans for the plant, but it is understood that the private operator has dropped his relocation plans.
  Abela said this was not the first time the government had closed down plants that were negatively impacting people's health in the south of Malta and he also vowed to never allow untouched public land to be given up for speculation.
 ""Untouched public land within development zones will not be given up for speculation and if it is to be developed, it will only be developed as is necessary for the needs of the community,"" he said.
 He said the government also intends to create new, public open spaces through Project Green. One of them is Pjazza Karmelitani in Żurrieq, which is within the development zone and will be transformed into a new open space.
 This was just one of many other greening projects lined up for the area, he added.
 It was the government that truly gave these projects the importance they deserved, and not the ""establishment"", he said.
 Abela spent most of the first part of his speech listing the government's projects in the economy, infrastructure and the environment, before telling his supporters that on the contrary, Bernard Grech and Roberta Metsola had ""not even one proposal"" to improve people's lives.
 They do not have a plan for you or the country, and neither for their work in Europe, he said. Rather, their only plan was to divide and destroy the country.
 ""They have a cruel plan to destroy the good that we're creating together. They're doing everything to divide us, to instigate, provoke and dishearten. While we were launching our manifesto, they were going about with two protests, not one,"" he said.
  ""Again this week, they went abroad, to the European Central Bank, to harm our country. How vile do you have to be to go to the ECB and ridicule one of our Maltese brothers?""
 He was speaking about former finance minister and current Central Bank governor Edward Scicluna, who faces criminal charges linked to the Vitals hospitals deal. MEP David Casa has written to the ECB about the case. 
 ""They will not succeed. They will not manage to stop our economy - the machine that has been producing so much good, that has been raising pensions, the minimum wage, children's allowance and so many other social benefits,"" he continued.
 ""Join me against those who want to wage a holy war against you and your beliefs. If you believe in a united Malta where there is true justice, more rights and unwavering work towards peace, June 8 is your best opportunity to send a clear message.""
 He then delivered a warning. The people needed to fight back ""in absolute calm"", in ""a positive way"", he said.
 ""Do not ever seek confrontation, because we are different than them. We love our country.""

https://timesofmalta.com/article/a-need-discuss-abortion-one-major-decision-ahead-says-abela.1093788,"The introduction of abortion is among the discussions that the country needs to have even if it could be unpopular, Prime Minister Robert Abela said on Monday.
 Speaking after a three-hour meeting of the Labour Party's executive and parliamentary group, Abela said:  ""The discussion on abortion is one of the topics we need to talk about,""  while adding that he was not saying that abortion should be introduced.  
 He said the country had for too long been afraid to discuss the topic in a mature way even when hundreds were criminalised for having an abortion.
 ""Even if the discussion does not result in the introduction of this right, we would have had an informed discussion instead of keeping people in fear,"" he said.
 This, he said, was not a matter of winning votes but of responsibility. 
 
 Earlier on Monday Abela said that the electorate expected courageous decisions from the government in the wake of Saturday's elections.
 ""The PL needs to take necessary decisions for the country, even if they are not immediately popular but will be appreciated in the long term,"" he said. 
 Four years ago, on becoming prime minister, Abela had said that he was opposed to the introduction of abortion, warning that if former prime minister Joseph Muscat proposed it, he would oppose him.
 On Monday evening, Abela said that other topics that needed to be discussed were euthanasia and reforms in the family court.
 Abela insisted that the decision a few months ago to revise a law that would allow terminations when a woman's life was in grave danger was not a mistake. It had achieved its purpose by allowing doctors to intervene when a pregnant woman's life was in danger, and thus women were now better protected, he said.

 The Opposition leader hit out at Prime Minister Robert Abela's government for targeting vulnerable people as part of a ""vote stealing"" exercise linked to disability benefits.
 On Thursday, Times of Malta revealed how Abela’s cabinet approved a  presidential pardon for disability applicants who had benefitted from fraudulent payments.
 In justifying the pardon, Abela said that the applicants - many of whom have been hauled to court - had been put through “trauma.”
 For Grech however, the “trauma” was one of the government’s own making.
 “Prime Minister, you are the one who put them through this trauma. It was a vote-stealing exercise, targeting the vulnerable, for votes.
 “For the prime minister, power is more important than people’s dignity. You and your ministers put them through this trauma,” Grech said.
 The Opposition leader said the government was just recently caught engaging in another vote-stealing scheme during the run-up to the June European Parliament and local council elections.
 Ninety-nine people were found to have switched their address to that of a yet uninhabited government housing block in Siġġiewi, in what the PN says is an attempt to influence the council elections in the locality.
 Grech said Labour was fearful of the PN’s strong lineup for the Siġġiewi local council election, and was therefore trying to steal votes through gerrymandering.
 “We caught them and we took them to court. We will now await justice. We are not saying these 99 people should not vote, but they should vote where they are currently living,” Grech said.
 The Opposition leader also pointed out the government was once again set to send cheques to people before an election.
 In 2022, an international election monitoring body said the government’s practice of sending out election cheques violated international standards.
 Grech urged people to use the June election as an opportunity to send a “clear message” that better leadership is needed in Malta.
 The PN is set to launch its election campaign during an event on May 1.

 Glenn Micallef left a good impression on the committee that grilled Malta's nominee for the EU Commission.
 Micallef – who at 35 is the youngest of the 27-person proposed college – will be responsible for finding ways of involving young people in EU policymaking.
 In its evaluation letter following the November 4 grilling, the Committee on Culture and Education (CULT) said Micallef ""gave a convincing impression of his aptitude to be a member of the College of Commissioners and to carry out the specific tasks assigned to him"". 
 The evaluation letter was made public on Wednesday morning, hours before the European Parliament approved the new commission for the next five years. 
 To be confirmed, the College of Commissioners need the endorsement, en bloc, of a majority of the votes cast. Of the 688 votes cast by MEPs, 370 gave the go ahead, while 282 voted against.
 In it, CULT chair Nela Riehl noted that Micallef showed a clear commitment to key values of diversity, fairness, solidarity, democracy, gender equality and social inclusion.
 ""Overall, he demonstrated a very positive attitude to engaging with the members, notably through future participation in structured dialogues with the EP"". 
 Throughout the grilling, Riehl added, the commissioner-designate was able to answer members' questions with openness and clarity. In general, he showed a good grasp of the different policy areas.
 However, ""on occasions, his replies focused on headline policy priorities and lacked some details on future budgetary aspects within his portfolio,"" Riehl noted on the committee's behalf.
 The committee added that some specificities, such as on the future culture compass could have been better explained and a detailed overview of the explicit cooperation between the directorate-general for education and that for communications was equally absent.
 ""Coordinators were expecting a comprehensive overview on the future of the European Solidarity Corps programme as well as a stronger commitment in engaging with young people with fewer opportunities,"" the chair said in the letter, adding that coordinators expect a thorough follow-up by Micallef on these issues in the near future.  
 The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, which were also present at the grilling, greenlighted Micallef's nomination, saying he was ""qualified"".
 According to data published by Politico, Micallef seems to have also left an impression on all major political groupings in the European Parliament except for two right-wing groups. 
 Apart from the go-ahead from the European People’s Party - the parliament's biggest grouping - he even got a nod of approval from the Eurosceptic right-wing European Conservatives and Reformists Group.
 Before the vote on Wednesday, MEPs debated the new commission's programme with its President Ursula von der Leyen.
 Ahead of the vote, most parliamentarians from the EPP, S&D and Renew were expected to vote in favour. 
 PN MEPs Peter Agius and David Casa both told Times of Malta they will be backing up Micallef's nomination. Metsola, as parliament president, could technically vote in favour as a majority of leaders of the parliament's various groupings have officially decided to back the commission. 
 But some - most notably Spanish members of the EPP - expressed outrage that Spain's former civil defence minister Teresa Ribera has been made a commission vice-president. They said Ribera is responsible for massive failings that exacerbated the destruction of floods in Valencia last month. 
 Rebels were also expected within the S&D, as some of its MEPs are angered by the nomination to executive vice president of Italy’s nominee Raffaele Fitto, who forms part of Giorgia Meloni's coalition. 
 Maltese S&D MEPs Alex Agius Saliba, Daniel Attard and Thomas Bajada all backed the commission's nomination. 
 The greens were split, Politico reported on Tuesday, while the parliament's more fringe groupings - the Patriots, Sovereigntists and Left were expected to vote against.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/malta-climbs-press-freedom-index-countries-got-worse.1091851,"Malta climbed 11 places on the World Press Freedom Index in 2024 - largely because the situation in other countries deteriorated.
 The index, compiled by Reporters Without Borders (RSF) and published on Friday, ranked Malta in 73rd place - up from 84th place out of 180 countries. 
 When comparing how EU member states fared on the index, Malta scored second to last.
 
 Greece was the only European country that ranked worse than Malta in 88th place, while Hungary - which the report singled out as a place where politicians are actively trying to shrink the media landscape for independent journalism - scored the third worst among the member states in 67th place.
 “Given the insignificant improvement of its score, [Malta's] progress by 11 places in the World Press Freedom Index can be attributed mainly to the deterioration of the situation in other countries,” Pavol Szalai, Head of the EU-Balkans Desk at RSF said.
 “The recommendations resulting from the public inquiry into the assassination of Daphne Caruana Galizia have not been implemented, while full justice has still not been served in this key case for the fight against impunity in Europe.”
 Szalai added that the Maltese government also failed to resolve issues related to the independence and sustainability of the media, provide more robust access to freedom of information or adequately protect journalists from SLAPP suits. 
 “The media landscape continues to be deeply polarised. However, the recently adopted European Media Freedom Act brings hope for improvement even in Malta,” he concluded. 
 According to the RSF ranking, press freedom in Malta was found to be in a “problematic” situation, sitting in the middle of the scale that runs from a “good” situation to a “very serious” situation. 
 From the 180 countries ranked by the index, only eight countries were found to currently have a “good situation” for press freedom. 
 Norway retained its top spot on the list, followed by Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands.
 Ireland, which last year was ranked the second-best country for press freedom, slipped six places and was ranked eight on this year’s list.
 Meanwhile, on the other end of the spectrum, the report found that Eritrea was the worst place in the world at maintaining a free press within its borders, followed by Syria, Afghanistan and North Korea. 
 Explaining the bottom ranking, RSF said that since being completely taken over by the Taliban, Afghanistan has incessantly persecuted journalists and slid down 44 places in the ranking.
 It also described both Syria and Eritrea as a “lawless zone” for the media, with both countries seeing a record number of journalists being detained, disappearing or being held hostage.
 RSF found that around the world press freedom is being threatened by political authorities, despite them being the supposed guarantors who are supposed to ensure its longevity. 
 Never has this been more evident than in this year’s political indicator - one of five used to score countries for the ranking - registering a global average fall of 7.6 points. 
 Governments are failing in their role to provide a safe environment for journalism to flourish and safeguard the public’s right to access independent and reliable information, the report’s authors said. 
 ""As more than half the world's population goes to the polls in 2024, RSF is warning of a worrying trend revealed by the 2024 World Press Freedom Index: a decline in the political indicator, one of five indicators detailed in the Index,” Anne Bocandé, RSF editorial director said.
 “States and other political forces are playing a decreasing role in protecting press freedom. This disempowerment sometimes goes hand in hand with more hostile actions that undermine the role of journalists, or even instrumentalise the media through campaigns of harassment or disinformation.
 ""Journalism worthy of that name is, on the contrary, a necessary condition for any democratic system and the exercise of political freedoms.”
 Correction May 3, 2024: A previous version stated that Malta ranked 81st last year.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/i-want-talk-election-pm-skirts-query-fearne-disciplinary-action.1092133,"Prime Minister Robert Abela on Wednesday refused to say why the disciplinary code for public officials did not apply to his deputy Chris Fearne, who is due to face criminal charges in court.
 ""We're 30 days from an important election for the European Parliament and local councils and I want to talk about the PL's proposals,"" he told Times of Malta outside Parliament. 
  Abela was asked why Fearne was not being treated like any civil service employee facing criminal charges who would be automatically suspended on half pay until they cleared their name. 
 But Abela refused to entertain the direct question, saying he would rather focus on the EP and local council election which was just a month away.
 ""I replied to every possible question on the inquiry. We had two full days of questions with detailed replies. The case is now in court and we need to talk about how we're going to improve our country,"" he said. 
 Abela said that during the next 30 days, he wanted to explain to people how the Labour Party was proposing to improve various localities.
 He was speaking to Times of Malta moments after  he told parliament that Fearne would remain as deputy prime minister unless the inquiry clearly linked him to a crime.
 Fearne, who serves as deputy prime minister and EU Funds minister, is set to be charged with fraud and misappropriation in connection with the €400m deal to privatise three state hospitals.
 As health minister, he oversaw the deal between 2019 and last year, taking over that role from Konrad Mizzi.
 He is among dozens of people to be prosecuted, though he said earlier on Wednesday he has not yet been formally notified of the charges against him.
 The prosecutions come as a result of a years-long magisterial probe into the deal.
 The Nationalist Party said everyone cited in the inquiry and who holds a public post should resign, singling out Fearne and Central Bank Governor Edward Scicluna, who will also be charged.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/teen-arrested-suspicion-placing-homemade-bomb-outside-labour-hq.1093251,"A 19-year-old man was arrested overnight on suspicions of having placed a homemade bomb outside the Labour Party's headquarters on Thursday. 
 The explosive device was found inside a waste bin outside of the building. 
 It is understood that police zeroed in on the teen at a garage in Ħamrun, where he had been living. 
 Police later clarified that the suspect had been picked up from a site in Triq Guze Pace in Sta Venera. 
 Explosive material was found in that garage and the residents of the apartment block on top of it were evacuated from their homes as a precaution. 
 The material found in the garage is known as TATP,  a volatile explosive that is also called 'mother of Satan'. It is often used in terrorist attacks as it is potent and can be made out of household supplies.
  Residents who spent the night out of their homes are expected to be able to return there later this morning.
 The suspect was identified through CCTV footage, with sources saying that police had received reports of the man ""acting oddly"" in various other places on Thursday.
 He was wearing the same clothes as the person spotted on CCTV outside Labour HQ. 
 An explosives team was called to Mile End on Thursday after the building's security officials spotted what was described as a ""small device"" outside the Labour Party's headquarters. 
 Neighbours also reported hearing a ""small explosion"" coming from a dust bin very early on Thursday morning. 
 No one was injured in the incident but the building was evacuated while a police investigation was conducted. 
 The building was given the all-clear for people to return by 1pm.

 Party leader Sandra Gauci said at a press conference that there was no doubt that former prime minister Joseph Muscat, his chief of staff Keith Schembri and former minister Konrad Mizzi had to be held to account for their actions.  
 But in the meantime, the health service could not keep up with demand and waiting lists were growing longer. That was what the consequences of fraud and corruption were about.
 Indeed, action should have been taken earlier, with the scandal already evident in a 2020 report by the Audit Office which made clear that this was an arranged concession designed for public funds to be used for private gain.
 Jack Tolu, ADPD treasurer and election candidate, said the health sector in general had suffered while the Vitals fraud was underway, but none more than the mental health sector, with the mental health hospital reduced to a disgrace.
 As a consequence of the scandal, some of society's most vulnerable people found a lack of support and care and were placed at greater risk.
 Party secretary Ralph Cassar said the EU needed to ensure that all member states had access to affordable medicines and effective medical care.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/malta-winning-country-manfred-weber-tells-epp.1101355,"“For the European People’s Party, Malta is a winning country,” Manfred Weber told 150 EPP delegates gathered in Malta for the party’s political assembly being hosted for the first time by the PN.
 He also commended Bernard Grech for the Nationalist Party’s strides in the polls.
 “Halfway through the mandate, three seats – that is your success,” he remarked, highlighting the party’s progress in last June’s European Elections and recent polls which put the PN ahead of the PL by a slight margin.
 The assembly kicked off on Thursday afternoon at the PN headquarters in Tal-Pietà and will continue on Friday.  
 It meets three to five times a year and brings together the EPP leadership and the international secretaries of its member parties.vIt defines the political positions of the EPP between each congress, deciding on membership applications and political guidelines.
 The two-day meeting gathers key figures including European Parliament President Roberta Metsola and European Commission Vice-President Dubravka Šuica to discuss pressing European challenges.
 Former prime minister Lawrence Gonzi, former PN leader Simon Busuttil, and nationalist MEPs David Casa and Peter Agius were among the attendees.
 In his opening address, PN leader Bernard Grech expressed pride in hosting the event in Malta, highlighting the nation’s commitment to European values. 
 He reaffirmed the PN's dedication to democracy, human rights, and the rule of law, underlining Malta’s role despite its small size.
 Grech called for bold action to address pressing challenges, including rising living costs, climate change, migration, and digital transformation.
  He emphasised the need for sustainable economic policies, a just green transition, shared responsibility in migration, and technological innovation that safeguards human rights. He also stressed the importance of European solidarity and inclusivity.
 Grech wrapped up his speech with a call for unity and collaboration, urging EPP members to ensure Europe remains a beacon of democracy and progress, with Malta contributing as a strong and integral voice within the European project.
 Weber meanwhile acknowledged Malta’s intensive political culture and stressed the need for change under the socialist-led Labour government, which he criticised for doubling the national debt, and neglecting middle-class living conditions and the rule of law.
 He pledged the EPP’s unwavering support for the Nationalist Party, emphasising the shared goals of competitiveness, controlled migration, and sustainable implementation of the Green Deal.
 Reflecting on the EPP’s broader achievements, Weber noted the increase in EPP-led governments across Europe. He championed leaders like Metsola and Ursula von der Leyen, praising their stewardship of key European institutions.
 ""For the EPP, there is no small or big country. We have the EP President from the smallest country and the EC President from the biggest country. We are the pro-European party of Europe, and we will only work with parties that are pro-Ukraine and pro-rule of law.""
 Addressing pressing global issues, Weber called the war in Ukraine a defining moment, condemning Iranian-made drones killing civilians.
 He affirmed the EPP’s commitment to EU enlargement in the Western Balkans and advancing Mediterranean priorities.
 “The EPP is strong, united, and ready to lead Europe forward,” Weber concluded.
 Earlier Weber also fielded questions on allegations of investigations into his 2019 political campaign and replied that “so far only journalists are writing about this but judicial state authorities have not called an investigation”.
 “Campaigns are audited by the EP ten times and over.  There is no reason to be concerned,” he said.
  Former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko also addressed the EPP’s assembly.
 Observing a minute’s silence for Ukraine’s fallen heroes, Poroshenko declared optimism in the face of prolonged conflict, saying ""Putin will be defeated because we stand together"".
 He urged the West not to fear escalation, asserting that a third world war is already underway, citing Iranian drones, North Korean soldiers in Russia, and Chinese missile components used by Putin’s arsenal.
 Poroshenko stressed NATO membership for Ukraine as vital for peace in Europe, calling for full military support and enhanced air defences for his country.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/imprisoned-home-man-waits-urgent-knee-operation-10-months.1093817,"Story updated on June 18.
 A man who was imprisoned in his own home for eight months as he waited for a knee replacement operation to be able to walk again and step outside has finally been given a date.
 Mario Carbone has been unable to walk and leave his Cospicua home due to the pain since August and has been in a wheelchair since January – when he was hospitalised following a fall at home.
 “My father just turned 63. He worked all his life, sunrise to sundown, to provide for his three children, so my mother could stay home and take care of us. Now he cannot enjoy his retirement because the system failed him,” his daughter, Daniela, said.
 She explained how her father, who worked as a labourer, had knee problems for many years. Finally, after years waiting, he had a knee replacement operation on his right knee in October 2022.
 The operation was a success, and he was recovering nicely. Then in February 2023, he had an accident and hurt his knee, leaving him in a lot of pain. Three months later, he was seen by the surgeon who operated on him and was told that the case was too severe now, and the family needed to see another specialist.
  By August, Mario was told by a doctor at a private clinic if he was not operated on soon, he would end up in wheelchair, his daughter said.
 “He was also told that he would get operated on in September 2023,” she said.
 She said that surgeon Dorian Xuereb took interest in Mario's urgent case and a date for an operation had finally been set.
 According to a recent reply to a parliamentary question, 510 knee replacement operations were carried out last year between January and November.  Until October 2023, there were 991 people on the waiting list for a knee replacement.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/make-day-joseph-muscat-dares-critics-reopen-egrant-case.1101232,"Joseph Muscat has welcomed the prospect of an inquiry into Panama company Egrant being re-examined, saying it would give him a chance to “prove the conspiracy theorists wrong once again”.
 In a right of reply sent to Times of Malta on Tuesday morning through his lawyer Charlon Gouder, Muscat said he had nothing to hide.
 “There are those who might argue that now the Egrant case should be reopened,” the former prime minister said.  
 “As I said numerous times when such a possibility was floated, including by the said court experts who salivated at the idea of getting paid even more public funds: Make my day!
 “I have nothing to hide and will only take further satisfaction in proving the conspiracy theorists wrong once again.”
 Muscat was responding to a Times of Malta article which noted that a court expert he wants criminally prosecuted had played a major role in the 2018 Egrant inquiry.
 That probe was requested by Muscat himself and centred on allegations that the offshore company was secretly owned by his wife, Michelle.
 The inquiry found no proof of that and was unable to establish who owned the company. It concluded that signatures related to the firm were falsified and that the testimony of key witnesses, most notably that of former Pilatus Bank employee Maria Efimova, contained some significant discrepancies.
 One of the court experts who worked on the probe, Miroslava Milenovic, also played a key role in a separate probe into the hospitals concession signed by Muscat’s government, which was annulled last year on the basis of fraud.
 That probe led to criminal charges against Muscat and others. They all deny accusations.
 Muscat and other defendants last week asked the police to investigate Milenovic because she was listed as a “forensic accountant” in the Vitals probe but did not hold an accountancy warrant.
 Milenovic was also described as a “forensic accountant” in the Egrant inquiry.
 In his statement on Tuesday, Muscat said he was precluded from commenting on his ongoing criminal case due to a court order to that effect.
 However, he argued that in the Egrant case, the work of court experts was just one of the inputs the then-magistrate leading the probe took into account.
 The magistrate “confronted versions, asked questions, made his own assessments and came up with his own report”, Muscat argued.
 “Secondly, given that I was the victim in the Egrant frame-up, I never had the opportunity to confront Ms Milenovic in court,” he added.
 Muscat said he would delight in disproving the Egrant allegations a second time. 
 The former prime minister made similar statements in a July 2023, interview, when he dared critics to request a second Egrant inquiry but warned them he would then sue them when the probe cleared him. 
 “A good boxer has to be able to take as many punches as he can give. But I will then be punching back,"" Muscat said at the time.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/6-million-650-couples-ivf-waiting-list-get-private-treatment.1092792,"Around 650 couples on the waiting list for IVF treatment will be able to receive it at a private clinic, thanks to a €6 million investment from the government, Health Minister Jo Etienne Abela said on Tuesday. 
 The investment was announced by Prime Minister Robert Abela earlier this month. 
 The government already fulfilled its promise to refund the cost of IVF-related medicine for couples who choose to undergo the procedure privately. The separate investment was announced earlier this year, where it was announced around 285 prospective parents who underwent the procedures last year were to benefit from the refund. 
 The Health Minister said the government will enter into negotiations with one private clinic in Malta that is licensed to offer all IVF services. 
  Abela said the government could not ignore the 650 couples who are on the Mater Dei Hospital's IVF procedures waiting list and said couples will receive a ""holistic service"" with all costs covered. 
 He said special attention will be paid to the age of the prospective mothers, highlighting that older women will be a priority to have the procedure as soon as possible. 
 “We cannot guarantee success in such a procedure, but we are ready to commit and cover the costs from the beginning to the end of the procedure for each couple,” Abela said. 
 Few details were provided during the press coverage, apart from Abela saying all treatments will be covered, such as consultations, importation, or distribution of gametes, and those who need to use IVF using a donor will also be offered this service. 
 Further details were provided in a press release published shortly after the press conference, where it was explained that within six months the services will be provided to the 650 prospective parents.
 Out of the 650 couples, 300 include people who will be doing IVF treatment, and around 200 others who are in the process of freezing and storing fertilised eggs and are waiting for 'embryo transfer'.
 Another 100 people waiting for IVF using 'donor oocytes' or 'donor sperm', and around 50 prospective parents who will be given intrauterine insemination service (IUI), a treatment that gives sperm a better chance to fertilise an egg, as well as the Preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) service where necessary.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/malta-hit-rise-covid19-cases.1094454,"Malta is experiencing an increase of COVID-19 infections, with three deaths and 232 confirmed cases since the beginning of the month. 
 The latest figures released on Tuesday show the number of cases more than doubled in two weeks. 
 A health ministry spokesperson said ""precautions"" were being taken at Mater Dei where 83 people with COVID were treated since the beginning of the month but stressed that none were admitted to intensive care.
 He said no new variant has been recorded with all patients being treated for a mutation of the Omicron varient.
 
 According to figures compiled by the health ministry, new cases were as low as zero in March and remained in single digits throughout April. 
 But new cases began to increase in mid-May before spiking in June. Malta registered 32 new cases during the week of June 3-9 before surging to 84 cases registered between 17 to 23 June.
 
 The spike in cases coincides with the European Parliament and local election results, when huge numbers of people crammed into the election counting hall in Naxxar. However, health authorities have given no reason for the rise in numbers.
 The spokesperson said the precautions being applied at Mater Dei Hospital over the rise of cases are those applicable to transmissible respiratory infections such as influenza.
 “Persons admitted with symptoms suggestive of respiratory infection are tested through a respiratory screen and positive cases are isolated in line with ECDC protocols,"" he said.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/watch-free-preventive-hiv-treatment-introduced-next-year.1102151,"Preventive treatment against HIV – PrEP and PEP – will be available for free next year, Jo Etienne Abela said. 
 The health minister told Times of Malta that funds were allocated for such free treatment in the 2025 budget and said the measure will cost “millions”.
 PrEP is a medication taken before sexual activity and prevents HIV transmission. PEP is a treatment that needs to be taken within 72 hours after a high-risk sexual encounter.   
  A 30-day supply of PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis) costs around €57, while PEP costs over €600. Providing PrEP and PEP for free is in the Labour Party’s electoral manifesto. 
 Last week, activists called on the government to follow through with its electoral promise in a joint statement by Checkpoint Malta, HIV Malta, MGRM, Moviment Graffitti, LGBTI+ Gozo, ARC – Allied Rainbow Communities and Aditus.
 “Activists once again reiterated the need for free PrEP and PEP. Countries which have introduced free PrEP and PEP, or that have highly subsidised it, have seen dramatic reductions in new HIV rates, in contrast to the reality of Malta’s ever-increasing rates of new HIV acquisition,” the statement said on World Aids Day.
 On Thursday morning, Abela said the government would be publishing its sexual health strategy for public consultation “in the coming days”.
 Providing HIV preventive treatment for free is part of that plan, he said.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/emergency-room-wait-times-reached-810-hours.1092200,"Waiting times in Mater Dei Hospital’s emergency room has reached an average of eight to 10 hours, with Health Minister Jo Etienne Abela set to announce expansion plans for the building this month.
 Malta Union of Midwives and Nurses president Paul Pace told Times of Malta at a media event that patients at the emergency room are having to wait up to 10 hours until they can be fully processed by medical staff.
 “In emergency, we have what is called the waiting time – which is the time you spend waiting until a doctor can see you, and processing time – which is the time you spend in the emergency room until you are either sent home or admitted to a ward,” Pace explained.
 “As the situation  is today, we are seeing that waiting time is taking from eight to 10 hours on average, and obviously when processing takes long, it’s going to affect the waiting time as well.”
 The health minister, who also attended the media event, told Times of Malta that the government is working on a multi-phase action plan to tackle space and time issues at Mater Dei, with the primary focus being doubling the number of cubicles in the emergency room from 35 to 70.
 The plans, the minister said, are set to be announced this month.
 Other phases of the expansion plans will include moving administration workers out of the Mater Dei building and transferring the outpatients to St Luke’s Hospital, expanding the ITU and expanding the cardiology department, with plans to add a third operating theatre there, he said.
  “It’s not enough to just create more space at the emergency because we also have to think downstream, that is where patients are going to end up after they’ve been processed by emergency,” Abela said.
 “There are prime areas of the hospital which could be used to offer care to patients that are currently used for administration, for example. These areas need to be vacated.”
 An expression of interest to find suitable office space for administrative staff had already been issued, the minister said.
 “They cannot remain on site,” Abela said.
 “Everyone can agree that Mater Dei was built to meet the needs of the population at the time and today we know that the reality is different. Space is limited and it must be used to cure patients.”
 However, Pace added that while investing in infrastructure is a good step forward and a move that the union supports, it is critical that investment in human resources is kept at the same pace.
 The emergency department is understaffed as it stands, Pace said, and would need to be increased further to make use of double the space.
 “The number of cubicles will double from 35 to 70 but, at the moment, we’re not even using all of them because we don’t have enough nurses,” he said.
 “Today emergency is working with some 40 nurses less than needed, and with the new cubicles the minister has mentioned, we will need another 85 nurses.”

https://timesofmalta.com/article/the-maltese-healthier-longer-anyone-europe-report-shows.1098583,"The Maltese are healthier for longer than anyone else in Europe, an international survey has shown, confirming previous findings.
 A Eurostat survey issued Thursday reports that among the EU countries, Malta recorded the highest number of healthy life years at birth in 2022 for women (70.3 years), ahead of Bulgaria (68.9 years) and Slovenia (68.5 years). 
 In contrast, Denmark had the lowest number of healthy life years for women (54.6 years), followed by Latvia (55.4 years) and the Netherlands (56.3 years).
 The highest number of healthy life years for men was also recorded in Malta (70.1), followed by Sweden (67.5) and Italy (67.1), while the lowest ones were found in Latvia (53.0 years), Slovakia (56.6 years) and Denmark (57.1 years).
  In 2022, the number of healthy life years at birth in the EU was 62.6 years on average, 62.8 years for women and 62.4 years for men.
 Life expectancy at birth for women in the EU was, on average, 5.4 years longer than that for men (83.3 years compared with 77.9 years).
 Healthy life years - free from activity limitations - represented 75% and 80% of the total life expectancy for women and men, respectively.
 Therefore, on average, men tended to spend a greater proportion of their somewhat shorter lives free from activity limitations, the survey says.
 Most of the data on health status and health determinants come from two surveys: the EU statistics on income and living conditions (EU-SILC), which provides annual data on issues like long-standing illness or health problems  and the European health interview survey, which provides every five years a large variety of data on health status.
 In 2017 the European Observatory’s Health Systems in Transition Report had also shown that Maltese people live on average 90 per cent of their life in good health, better than any other European country. The trend was maintained along the years, with a Eurostat report in 2022 saying that  Malta had the second longest healthy life expectancy in the European Union, surpassed only by Sweden.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/government-spent-105m-outpatients-block-plans-scrap-mam.1098471,"The government wasted €10.6 million in planning a new outpatients block and acute psychiatric facility at Mater Dei Hospital before scrapping the idea, and it is now about to spend another €10m on planning an alternative, the MAM Medical Association of Malta said on Tuesday.
 
 The acute psychiatric facility and outpatients block were projected by then Health Minister Chris Fearne. Three years went into their planning and the ideas were extensively discussed and supported by all stakeholders, the MAM said.
 ""Unfortunately, (current health minister) Jo-Etienne Abela has scrapped all these plans and without proper consultation, wants a completely different plan cramming five acute psychiatry wards on top of the Emergency Department while the outpatients block is being scrapped completely,"" the association said.
  ""The decision to modify plans will require a new expenditure of another €10 million on plans, a delay of at least two years to start actual construction and another two-to-three years for completion,"" it said.
 It also pointed out that there is a February EU deadline for the completion of the new health hub in Paola and should that deadline be missed, the EU may seek recovery of €50m of its funds allocated for that project.
 The association urged the health minister to prioritise patients, stick to the original plans and get on with construction.
 ""While MAM still trusts that Minister Abela has good intentions the current impression is that millions (of euro) are voted for health, but nothing gets done,"" it said. 
 Meanwhile, Paul Pace president of the Malta Union of Midwives and Nurses said that his union was never consulted, and never agreed, with the plans for the new outpatients building.
 He said in a reaction to the MAM statement that the nurses’ union was in favour of shifting outpatients to St Luke’s Hospital as this would ease traffic congestion and parking problems at Mater Dei outpatients and free the building to be used as a mother-and-child space.
 Some 900 patients visit outpatients daily he said.
 “MAM is objecting to shifting to St Luke's as that will stop the consultants from leaving the hospital early,” he said.
 In reply to the MAM’s statement, the Health Ministry said on Tuesday that the doctor’s union had been selective in their facts and left out important details that contextualise the government’s vision to proceed in the way that it did. 
 In a statement, the ministry said that at the time that the plans were being drawn up the government was not in control of either St Luke’s or Karin Grech hospitals and plans are already in motion to regenerate these buildings and re-integrate them into the public healthcare system. 
 “The MAM is aware of this and so it cannot on one hand criticise that nothing is being done with these buildings and on the other hinder work that is going to lead to these hospitals to start fulfilling important roles in our country’s healthcare system,” the ministry said. 
 They added that by actioning these plans they would be avoiding eliminating the Mater Dei helipad. 
 While the MAM has a leading role to advocate for its members' rights, this does not include becoming an arbiter of strategic management or infrastructural projects in the sector, they said.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/edward-scicluna-opens-stepping-aside-insists-remains-governor.1096101,"Edward Scicluna says he was prepared to go to the European Court of Justice to fight any attempt to remove him as Central Bank governor - and only agreed to step aside temporarily ""until I clear my name"". 
 Speaking to Times of Malta for the first time since he reached a compromise with government, Scicluna insisted he remains governor with his full salary.
 “Had the prime minister relieved me of my duties, I would have resorted to the European Court of Justice and had I won I would probably have been refunded my lost income.
 ""I will step aside only for the time being, but I will remain governor until the end of my term,"" he said.
 Scicluna described how he was called in to Castille on Tuesday during a lengthy cabinet meeting. It was convened by Robert Abela with the intention of removing Scicluna after a court ruled there was sufficient evidence for him to stand trial over the hospitals deal. 
 
 “I took legal counsel when it became apparent that I was going to be relieved of my duties because that would have been illegal,"" Scicluna said.
 He said the prime minister and cabinet appointed three senior ministers, his former colleagues in cabinet, who were tasked with convincing him to avoid going down the legal route.
 Scicluna did not mention the names of the ministers involved but Times of Malta understands they are Owen Bonnici, Ian Borg and Michael Falzon. 
 “They asked me to consider this proposal.  At first, I was reluctant to accept because I am resolute that I was not taking people for a ride.”  
 Scicluna said that the arrangement was not imposed on him.
 He continued: “I would have preferred staying at my desk but at the moment I cannot until I clear my name.  It could be a few months down the line, but I will clear it.”
 Scicluna confirmed that he will be retaining his salary.
 
 Scicluna said that the terms of the agreement respect the autonomy of the Central Bank of Malta and are according to the provisions of the Central Bank of Malta Act (Chap 204).
 Article 8(3) (a) of the CBM Act states: “In the event of the absence of the governor, the governor shall designate a deputy governor to perform the duties of the governor… and the deputy governor so designated shall have and may exercise the powers and perform the functions of the governor.”
 Alexander Demarco, deputy governor since January 2014, will be filling in for Scicluna. 
 Scicluna had been adamant all along that the prime minister could not fire him from office, even though he has been charged in court with fraud and misappropriation in relation to the Vitals hospitals case.
 “I was not challenging anyone.  Every institution is governed by its own rules and conditions and members have duties and responsibilities towards the institution they belong to.  The prime minister can ask ministers to resign but he cannot ask them to forfeit their seat in parliament,"" he said.
 As governor of the central bank, Scicluna sits on the governing council of the European Central Bank.  “Not even the ECB requires my resignation”, he said.
 “In Malta we are not familiar with the role of Central Bank Governor.  We never realised how important it is.  The EU Treaties, the Statutes of the European Central Bank and even Maltese law are worded in such a way as to prevent governments from playing dirty tricks.""
 Article 14 of the ECB treaty says that “a governor may be relieved from office only if he no longer fulfils the conditions required for the performance of his duties or if he has been guilty of serious misconduct.""
 Article 8 (5), of the CBM Act lays down that ""The governor and the deputy governors may be relieved of their office only if they no longer fulfil the conditions required for the performance of their duties or if they have been guilty of serious misconduct.""
 In 2019 the ECJ ruled against the Latvian government when it tried to remove Ilmārs Rimšēvičs from head of the country’s Central Bank.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/ivf-treatment-goes-private-public-hospital-clinic-closes-upgrade.1096887,"The first patient files of 178 people awaiting fertility treatment have been sent by the government to a private clinic so that the couples can start the long-awaited process of becoming parents.
 These patients are among the 650 who have been on the waiting list to receive treatment at the state-owned Mater Dei IVF clinic, which will be  undergoing refurbishment to improve the technology used.
 The target to reopen is later this year.
 “The contract between the government and Hope Fertility and IVF clinic has been signed with a commencement date of August 1, 2024. 
 To date, a total of 178 patient files have already been sent to Hope clinic to start the evaluation process, also since most cases have been waiting for more than six months, and new testing and screening need to be carried out,” a Health Ministry spokesperson said.
 Applications for treatment of the 178 patients have already been approved by the regulatory authority, the Embryo Protection Authority. Meanwhile, new patient lists are being sent to Hope daily, the spokesman said.
 In June, Health Minister Jo­Etienne Abela announced that the clinic that carries out IVF procedures at Mater Dei will be closed for six months while it is being expanded and upgraded, with patients sent to a private clinic instead.
 The government allocated €6 million so that around 650 couples, who are on the Mater Dei waiting list, could get their treatment at Hope Fertility and IVF clinic.
 But before that could happen, the health authorities had to secure the procurement of new equipment to replace that purchased in 2014, when the clinic started operating. 
 That process has started but some parts are pending.
 “The procurement started in May 2022 and 23 calls for tenders were published for 92 pieces of equipment and 55 consumables/materials/reagents. All of them are awarded except two calls of highly specialised critical pieces of equipment for collecting, processing, storing and distributing gametes/embryos. Final calls for offers closed on July 22,” the spokesperson said.
 
 Asked what would happen to couples who could not afford to wait longer for treatment at Mater Dei, and went private at their own expense before government signed the agreement with Hope, the spokesperson said that “patients who opted to do their treatment at the private clinics, irrespective if they were on the waiting list of MDH or if they just opted to do their treatment privately in Malta, would get a refund of their treatment medication with effect from January 1, 2023.”
 To date, 84 applications have been received by the Embryo Protection Authority from both patients undergoing treatment at Hope and patients undergoing IUIs (intrauterine inseminations) at other registered clinics.  These applications total to a refund of €236,043, he said.
 There would be further refunds for medication given to patients undergoing treatment at MDH as of January 1, 2022.
 The authority has so far approved over 780 applications, which amount to €1.2 million, pushing total refunds above €1.4 million.

 Tests on three slippers and two boots revealed the products contained chemicals - namely cadmium, lead, phthalates and paraffin - that exceeded the legal limits.
 While phthalates are normally used as plasticisers to soften and increase the flexibility of these materials, paraffin is used as a flame retardant, while lead and cadmium in dyes and paints give colour.
 However, the presence of these chemicals is restricted due to the potential harm to human health, the MCCAA said in a statement.
 A total of 10 children’s clothing and footwear products, including printed T-shirts, matching sets, slippers, and rain boots were tested. 
 While the clothing items passed the test, the footwear was not found to be compliant with the applicable regulations. 
 MCCAA said any Maltese consumers who purchased the products should immediately refrain from using them. They should also be contacted directly by the seller to arrange for a refund of the recalled product.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/ministry-looks-scrap-paola-health-centre-contract.1096931,"The government is mulling severing ties with the contractor responsible for the Paola health hub, after a series of missed deadlines in the project’s final stages means it has been unable to open its doors to the public.
 Audit firm Grant Thornton has been tasked with analysing the repercussions of terminating the contract.
 A notice announcing the €20,000 direct order to the audit firm, issued in April, appeared in a recent edition of the Government Gazette.
 The direct order asks Grant Thorton to help authorities reach an “informed decision on whether to terminate the contract re the Paola Regional Health Hub and the respective repercussions”.
 Sources within the health ministry told Times of Malta the move comes in the wake of a series of missed deadlines that have stalled the government’s final takeover of the building.
 Although construction work has been completed, sources say the contractor has missed as many as 17 deadlines in recent months, most linked to certification and quality control. The government cannot sign off on the project and take over the building until this certification is completed, sources say, otherwise, it would be assuming responsibility for any issues that could later emerge.
 The dispute has spilled over into the courts, with arbitration proceedings between the contractor and the government currently underway. Submissions in these proceedings have been filed recently, with government sources expecting an outcome in the coming weeks.
 The Paola health hub has had a troubled history from the get-go.
 It was first announced over a decade ago but never got off the ground because the government did not have a title to the land.
 The project was eventually greenlit in 2017, with the site of the former Paola boċċi club earmarked for a €39m investment that would cater for  almost a third of Malta’s population.
 At the time, the authorities had said the health centre would open by 2020.
 The project soon hit a bump in the road when several bidders objected to the decision to award the project’s tender to SP BB International JV, a consortium made up of Bonnici Brothers, Ray Vella and Pantalesco, among others. In a series of appeals, bidders argued that the adjudication process was tainted.
 An adjudication board ordered that the bids be re-evaluated, with the Department of Contract reversing its original decision and awarding the project to the Egron-Technoline consortium, whose bid was €4m cheaper than the original winners.
 The almost-completed health centre, now named the Vincent Moran Health Centre, after the late doctor and Labour health minister, came under the spotlight again in the days leading to last June’s MEP elections, with the authorities promising that it would be opening “in the near future”.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/17-marathons-10-days-maltese-athlete-completes-epic-run.1097004,"A Maltese athlete has completed a challenge to run the equivalent of about 17 marathons in 10 days across Thailand.
 Stephen Sammut Nurminen says he was the first person to run from the west to the east of the country and raised almost €6,000 for charities that supply food to homeless and vulnerable people. 
 The 38-year-old was supported by a team including his partner, a videographer, a driver and his pet dog, Nemo.
 As well as mountainous terrain, he battled temperatures of over 40 degrees and the humidity was “something I have never experienced before”, he said.
  The challenge involved running the 748km distance between the western city of Mae Sot to the town of Mukdahan, on the border with Loa, a distance almost equivalent to 17 marathons. 
 He ran 75km a day and completed it late on Tuesday after 136 hours and 38 minutes. 
 “I must admit, I feel a bit empty this morning, and I already miss being out there, running on the road,” he said.  
 “I am not as tired or sore as I imagined but that is all thanks to the great care we gave my body during the run. The team, especially my partner, were amazing in making sure that I always had what I needed, before, during and after every run.""
  The run was not without its lows, including one heartbreaking moment on day seven, after the athlete was joined by a new running mate, a stray dog the team nicknamed Chai. 
 After keeping pace with the team for 63 kilometres, Chai got bitten twice by other stray dogs but was sadly hit and killed by a ""speeding maniac"" four kilometres shy of the end of that day's run.
 The athlete said Chai's death devastated the team. 
  Sammut Nurminen and his team faced other challenges, including keeping safe from the strong sunrays and staying rehydrated. 
 Another key element during his run was to keep his feet dry to avoid any painful blisters- an important lesson he learnt back in 2022 when he had to cut a Sicily run short, albeit after 240 kilometres. 
 While his original challenge was to cover 765 km, Sammut Nurminen explained that the team took another road to get to Mukdahan, as the original one was full of traffic. 
  Despite the lows, the athlete and his team experienced many beautiful memories together.
 “I was also blessed to see my team grow and become closer day by day and the hospitality of the Thai people in each town that we passed through.”
 The athletes’ test of resilience, patience and determination were all for a good cause, to raise funds for Soup Kitchen OFM and Dar Hosea. 
 Valletta-based Soup Kitchen OFM provides prepared meals three times per week for people in need, as well as legal and psychological help. Dar Hosea aids vulnerable women exploited into prostitution. 
 He aimed to raise enough funds to distribute 5,000 meals for both charities and so far, the athlete has raised €5,978, which translates into 1,495 meals. Donations can still be sent through his GoFundMe page.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/watch-health-id-doublechecks-aimed-cutting-human-error-minister.1097621,"New instructions for healthcare workers to double-check patient’s identities are primarily intended to cut down on human inputting errors, Health Minister Jo Etienne Abela said.
 Abela admitted that a circular issued to government healthcare staff on Tuesday, which instructed staff to confirm the patient’s identity by asking for their ID number, full name and date of birth, was in response to recent allegations of identity theft.
 “We don’t live in a bubble. We obviously take note of what is happening around us,” Abela said when asked why this measure was only introduced now.
 Abela admitted that health authorities had come across “several situations where there were mistakes” but insisted that most inconsistencies are down to human error, often at the point when a person is registered to the system.
 “Whoever is inputting patient details is human and humans all make mistakes. Even a single changed digit can bring up somebody else’s records.”
 Abela said that the new measures are intended “to make sure that our system is more robust” and do away with as many of these “mistakes” as possible by beefing up the verification process.
  “I’ve worked in hospitals, even in Malta, in which there are different ways to identify patients,” Abela said. “Improving our level of security in the public health service is a positive step.”
 Allegations of identity fraud hit the limelight in recent weeks, after former MP Jason Azzopardi called for a magisterial inquiry, claiming that some 18,000 identity cards were issued on the back of documents fabricated by Identità officials since 2015.
 The fears grew over the following weeks, with a spate of reports of possible identity theft being flagged, including within Malta’s healthcare services.
 One man who visited a healthcare clinic for a checkup in August discovered, much to his dismay, that his medical records listed him as having died in March.
 Meanwhile, at least a dozen others say they faced similarly surreal scenarios, from phantom hospital appointments to diagnoses of illnesses they never contracted.
 Elsewhere, scores of people reported receiving letters from telecoms company Epic addressed to people who never lived at the listed address.
 Suspicions over the possible racket intensified late last month after a man admitted to fixing letterboxes to residences to provide addresses for residence permits for third-country nationals.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/now-bald-son-shaves-off-hair-solidarity-cancerpatient-mum.1094228,"A cancer-patient mother has described her “shock” after her footballer son shaved off her hair – and then joined her in solidarity by turning the razor towards his own head.
 Sam Diamond travelled to Malta last week to spend some time with her sons before starting chemotherapy in the UK and decided to shave her hair off as “I could not bear seeing it fall out”.
 In an emotional moment caught on camera, her son, Liam Diamond, helped shave off his mum’s hair and then began to shave off his own.
 “I didn’t want my mum to have to do this alone,” he said. “We’re very close – we’re like magnets. We take care of each other and support each other. We’re very connected. Soul-bound.”
  The footage shows Liam shaving the last part of his mother’s hair while she is lost deep in thought. When he suddenly starts shaving his own head, his mother jumps up in shock and surprise before kissing and hugging him. She then continues to shave his head.
 “It was this huge shock,” she said. “When you see your son doing a journey with you, it’s heart-breaking. It’s not a mother-son relationship. We’re like best friends.”
 Sam spoke to Times of Malta from the UK, where she is preparing to start six months of chemotherapy on Monday before six months of radiotherapy and an operation.
 She was diagnosed with cervical cancer after a smear test returned with an abnormal result and she is now being treated for stage 3 cancer, meaning it is more advanced. 
 Sam is speaking out to raise awareness about the importance of regular smear tests after missing her test for several years due to the business of life. She mistook erratic periods for the early signs of menopause and wants women to be vigilant. “Women are working, raising children and running the house. But it is so important to find time for that smear test,” says Sam who has two sons and a daughter.
 Born to a Maltese mother and British father, she lived in Malta for about 23 years.
  Liam was five years old when he moved to Malta and lived here ever since – except for two years during his teens when he returned to the UK. He played 16 seasons of football and is now a player with Pembroke. He had to take a break after a “rough year” in which he suffered a knee injury last August but plans to return in a few months. Sam describes her son as “the sort of child who was so lovable and would do random things”.
 Shaving off his hair for his mum was one of them – although he admits he had preplanned it. “I never shaved my head. The last time I was about eight years old. What you don’t see in the video is how much my mum cried when they cut her hair.
 “I had planned to shave it and my girlfriend would film it. But then my mum started recording with her phone. She kept pressing ‘record’ and ‘stop’. Then there was a point – after it was shaved – that she pressed ‘record’ and she sort of zoned out. Then I shaved mine,” he says.
 And when he shared the post on social media he wrote: “Dear mum… I know this journey is gonna be crazier than any other year you have lived but, deep inside, I know God is with you, and you will prevail as the winner of this quest. But I’d like you to imbed these words into your everyday going through chemo: ‘I will never know how strong I am, until being strong is the only option I have’.
 “You’ve got this. I love you millions. Now we’re both bald.”

https://timesofmalta.com/article/over-5000-students-attend-mental-health-first-aid-course.1093247,"More than 5,000 Year 9 pupils have completed a first aid course for mental health offered to 13-year-olds in all secondary schools.
 The course was designed by the Richmond Foundation and the Commissioner for Mental Health to help pupils identify signs of mental health challenges and the type of help they need to give.
 The prime minister's wife, Lydia Abela was also involved in the organisation of the courses, which were spread over 25 hours.
 Abela had a discussion with ninth-year students at Żejtun St Tumas More College where she said that the community must be sufficiently informed and trained to help people with mental health challenges.
 She said this initiative was a tangible example of how mental health was no longer a taboo but was on the agenda of public discussion.  
 Present at the school were Education Minister Clifton Grima and Health Minister Jo Etienne Abela.
 The courses benefited from donations in the 'Smiles with Miles' initiative led by Abela and funding by the Bank of Valletta.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/i-told-i-dead-three-months-patients-fear-identity-theft.1096873,"A man who went for a check-up at a public healthcare clinic two months ago was told his medical records listed him as having died in March.
 The man is among at least a dozen other people who claim to have discovered that their medical files contained upcoming appointments for serious tests and surgeries they did not need, data about hospital admissions they never underwent, medication they were never prescribed, by doctors they never visited, for illnesses they never had.
 Some of the mysterious anomalies are now the subject of an investigation by the Data Protection Commissioner.
 Times of Malta spoke to many of those affected on condition of anonymity. All said that they worried their data would be meddled with further if they revealed their identity.
 The man who was told he had ‘died’ is only in his early thirties and discovered the issue by chance, when he visited a clinic in June for a check-up.
 “The receptionist asked me for my ID card number and I saw her input it in her computer. She looked at the screen, looked back at me and asked me to repeat the number,” the man told Times of Malta.
 “I did, she inputted it again, looked at the screen again, looked back at me and said: ‘It says here you’ve been deceased since the end of March’.”
  Staff at the clinic were very helpful and saw to his needs that day, he said, but he later had to go to Mater Dei’s medical records office to rectify the error.
 “It could have been a genuine mistake, but it was very strange to me, because during the period I was marked as ‘deceased’ I travelled abroad, I worked and paid tax and even received the voting documents for the EU parliament and local council elections and voted normally without any hiccups,” he said.
 “I only discovered the issue when I needed to visit the clinic.”
 The man noticed another error on his medical record, however. It said that two days before he ‘died’, he was admitted to the hospital outpatients department, when in fact, he was not.
 Even more mysteriously, his name and identity card number were correct on the records – only the data seemed to belong to someone else’s medical history.
 Several people’s accounts of similar experiences have been surfacing online since lawyer Jason Azzopardi claimed a couple of weeks ago that Maltese ID card holders were “robbed” of their identities and that several ID numbers were allegedly assigned to other people through corrupt practices at  Identità.
 This week a magistrate upheld Azzopardi’s request for a magisterial inquiry into the alleged scam. So far, it remains unclear whether reports of hospital appointment errors are connected to these allegations.
 People who spoke to Times of Malta claim to have been contacted from hospital and clinics over the past months to confirm an upcoming appointment for a test, operation or treatment scheduled for the following weeks.
 The appointments listed their correct name and ID card number, but the medical details were not theirs.
 Appointments even included the name of the doctors who had presumably made the referral – only these people had no such conditions and never visited those doctors.
 One mother said she received an appointment for her teenage child to undergo a medical test. A quick Google search revealed that this was for a very serious illness related to a major organ.
 When she inquired about it with customer care, the representative was surprised the mother was not aware of the appointment as the system was showing there were three doctor referrals for it.
 The mother said the appointment was cancelled but when she asked whether it was an error, the customer care representative was not able to confirm that.
 Another man was called twice from hospital – last week and this week – to be reminded that he had a surgery coming up. Only it was not his surgery.
 Others discovered their medical records showed they were admitted to hospital, underwent tests and were prescribed medication by several doctors. None of that ever happened to them.
  One man, who owns a business and employs over hundred people, turned livid when he discovered, by chance, that he was also affected.
 He said he was reading social media comments about the issue this week, when he turned to his wife and told her that if it happened to him, he would be so mad he would probably sue the government.
 “That’s when my wife said: ‘Why don’t you check your MyHealth account?’ We checked and sure enough, there it was – it said I went to a clinic for blood tests last September. That’s impossible, as I was living abroad back then,” he said.
 “I’m now extremely concerned about my employees, because if my bank suspects I have committed some identity theft, they could close all my accounts. This is very serious.”
 Another man – a professional who holds a PhD – said he received a letter about four months ago confirming a hospital appointment he had never scheduled.
 “It was strange because the letter went to my parents’ house, and I have not lived there for more than two decades. And the name of the street wasn’t even the name the street has now, but a name it previously had back then.”
 While some of those impacted worry about the repercussions of what could be identity theft, others appear unperturbed.
 “I know I haven’t visited doctors for the condition they told me I had. I know I wasn’t admitted to hospital and that no doctor referred me to any surgery, so I knew I had nothing to worry about and dismissed it as an administrative error,” one man said.
 The Information and Data Protection Commissioner confirmed that he is investigating the issue but said it would be “presumptuous” to speculate on what the issue might be at this early stage.
 “Investigations on complaint-based and ex-officio cases have been initiated or are in the final internal process of being launched,” Commissioner Ian Deguara said.
 “The scope and purpose of our investigations are primarily to establish facts while ensuring that the parties’ right to be heard is guaranteed throughout the process. On the basis of those findings, legal deliberations will be made and a legally-binding decision issued.”
 Corrective actions would then depend on a number of factors, including the nature and gravity of infringements and the degree of responsibility of the “controller”, he added.
  Health Minister JoEtienne Abela told Times of Malta he was concerned by the “extremely serious allegations”.
 He said he was “not personally aware of any such complaints” but offered to look into the cases individually.
 “We shall inform the people concerned that we will scrutinise their records for any inaccuracies,” he said.
 Identità said it has no control or responsibility for the data validation techniques employed by the Mater Dei appointment system or any other third-party system, including that of private companies.
 “It is essential that third-party IT systems implement strong and robust data validation methods to ensure their data is always up-to-date and compliant with GDPR regulations,” it said.
 It also said it has not received such complaints and explained each ID card holder is assigned a unique number, “generated from the birth act number recorded when a child’s birth is registered, with the last two digits reflecting the year of birth” and that death certificates are recorded in the public registry system only when a death certificate has been issued by a doctor and when a family member registers the death.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/a-fifth-70s-die-year-hip-fracture.1093769,"A fifth of people aged over 70 die within a year of a hip fracture, a new study has shown as it calls for better fall-prevention strategies and education.
 And of the patients who suffered a hip fracture through a fall in their own home, almost a fifth ended up in a care home within six months of the accident
 “This result highlights how a proximal femoral (hip) fracture is often a major life event, having both a medical and social impact,” according to the study ‘Hip fractures in older persons in Malta’, published in the recent edition of the Malta Medical Journal.
 Researchers collected data of 195 people over 70 who had fractured their hip in Malta between May and October 2019 and followed them up a year later.
 There were a total of 11 deaths (5.8%) in the first 30 days from the fracture. This increased to 33 deaths (17%) at six months and 41 (22%) deaths at one year from the hip fracture.
  During the six-month period, 34% of the patients were men and 66% women.
 The majority ‒ 147 hip fractures (75%) ‒ occurred in patients who were living at their own home. The remaining 25% occurred in patients who were living in care institutions. 
 Of the 147 patients who were living at home before the fracture, six were lost to follow-up as they left the island. Of the remaining 141 cases, 26 (18%) were living in a care home within six months.
 A study called ‘Post-operative mortality related to waiting time for hip fracture surgery’, published in the National Library of Medicine in 2004, looked at the difference in one-year mortality between two groups of patients who were operated for hip fracture in Malta. Results showed that survival at one year was
 better when patients, who are medically fit for surgery, were operated on the same day of admission.
 Speaking in the context of a nurses’ industrial action in August last year, the Association of Orthopaedic and Trauma Surgeons had said: “Delaying surgery in any bed-bound, immobile trauma patient risks an increase in morbidity and even mortality. This is especially true with elderly patients who have sustained a hip fracture.”
 Until a few months ago, patients were made to wait up to five days. But, over the past year, the situation improved, sources said.
  “Waiting time to surgery has improved at Mater Dei as we now have dedicated hip fracture lists so that these frail patients get priority for their surgery,” said a surgeon, adding that the waiting time was currently between 24 hours and two days.
 An orthopedic surgeon noted that the issue with these patients was that most  were very frail and with multiple other health problems.
 “They present a challenge to the anesthetist as they have poor heart, lung and kidney function. They can have several complications, such as chest infections, deep vein thrombosis and pressure sores before or after surgery. They usually have a few years to live in any case and the hip fracture is sometimes the last straw in a failing body,” the surgeon said.
 The surgeon added that a lot needed to be done about fall prevention.
 “Pavements are a disaster,” he said.
 The dire need to repair Malta’s pavements was flagged recently in a report, compiled by the Faculty for Social Well-being, that laid out recommendations to address loneliness – that is impacting more than half the population.
 In January, 82-year-old Carmelina Borg recounted how she lived in fear and ended up confined to her Sliema home after tripping over an uneven cobbled pavement and fracturing her hip.
  While Borg had no control over the state of the pavement, some accidents are preventable.
 “There needs to be more education to these elderly people. Like not to have loose carpets and not walking in darkness when they wake up at night. They could have physical therapy to remain fit and able bodied. All to reduce risk of fall,” he added.
 His words were reinforced by the recent study that showed that over a quarter of the cases – 52 (27%) – had contact with the hospital emergency department or were discharged after a hospital admission, within the 90 days before the fracture. Most pre-fracture visits (48%) were due to medical problems and 21% due to falls.
 “As a result, we would suggest that elderly patients admitted with acute medical problems, have sensory impairment or undergo elective surgeries should be screened for falls and fracture risk and be referred to falls prevention clinics,” the report said.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/portelli-bid-sanction-illegal-pools-mockery-justice-graffitti.1096407,"Activists have slammed a bid by developer Joseph Portelli to sanction his illegal Qala pools as a “mockery of justice” facilitated by authorities who bend over backwards to please “greedy developers”. 
 A fresh sanctioning application has been filed for the controversial swimming pools, which were built outside the development zone in Qala, after a court  revoked its planning permission in March. 
 But Moviment Graffitti said on Wednesday that this fresh attempt to legitimise the pools is a sign of Malta’s planning system sinking to “new lows of indecency” and said that the courts were “unequivocal” in saying that the pools were not compatible with the rural area. 
 “Given that illegal structures can only be sanctioned if they conform to current planning policies, Portelli’s second application to sanction these pools, after such a categorical Court ruling, is a blatant mockery of our justice system,” they said. 
 “This affront to justice is facilitated by the Government and its authorities, who have consistently bent over backwards to satisfy the greed of developers.”
 In June, Graffiti hosted a flash protest at the site of the pools and spraypainted the word “illegal” in big red letters all over the bottom of one of them. 
 The point of this protest, they said, was to highlight how the government has failed to curb what they called Portelli’s “bullying tactics” and failed to reform the flawed planning appeals system, which allows developers to start working on a project despite having an appeal pending. 
 This has led to a situation like the one in Qala where projects end up being completed after the courts revoke their permits. 
 “As we stated during our direct action, and reiterate now, this planning system is intentionally rigged in favour of developers,” they said. 
 “The Government is effectively enforcing impunity for developers by allowing them to construct structures that are illegal or potentially illegal, and then failing to take meaningful action against these violations. In the case of Qala, the Planning Authority has not even restricted access to the pools, which remain fully operational despite their clear illegality.”
 They expressed disappointment that there is still no sign of reform in planning appeals as promised by Robert Abela. 
 They once again called for Portelli’s illegal pools in Qala to be demolished and reform enacted without delay. 
 “Moviment Graffitti is prepared to take further direct action if the people's call for basic decency in planning continues to fall on deaf ears.”

https://timesofmalta.com/article/pa-suspends-decision-sevenfloor-sa-maison-block-protests-mount.1097278,"The planning authority has suspended a decision over an application to transform a former retirement home in Sa Maison into a seven-storey block of 48 seafront apartments.
 The application – PA 04281/23 – requested the demolition of the ex-Sa Maison residential home and a neighbouring dilapidated warehouse. Instead, two levels will be excavated underground for parking, one floor will be dedicated to retail establishments and another seven (that include the receded top floor) to residential apartments.
 The building will rise 26 metres above street level, replacing the abandoned retirement home for the elderly that is six storeys high. Dimitri Sturdza from Heritage Holdings Ltd applied for the proposed development that lies on Triq ix-Xatt, Pietà, corner with Sqaq Borton. The project architect is Michael Anastasi.
  Although the project was recommended for approval, the planning board suspended the decision after hearing several objections from residents. Board members also raised their concerns that centred around the scheduled buildings in the area as well as height limitations.
 One objector was Pieta resident Joseph Magro Conte who said that residents were not objecting to the redevelopment of the site. However, this proposed development was excessive. The dense proposal would impact the quality of life of residents as, apart from exceeding building heights, it would lead to overdevelopment, congestion and parking issues.
 He said it also ignored the cultural heritage element in the area. He noted that, according to the NSO, Pieta was the third area with the highest population density despite its small size. He said that planning ought to improve community and quality of life and this proposal would do nothing of the sort.
 Malcolm Mifsud, also a resident, agreed that the new project would pose as overdevelopment. The former retirement home was already a dominant development approved in 1988 - the new development proposed would make it even more dominant.
 This is “pure speculation”, he said.
  Fr David Cortis, from St Augustine College, said that the main objection was to the height – almost four or five storeys above the normal height in that area. There were two scheduled properties adjacent to the site so one had to keep the skyline in mind.
 The extra floors would tower over the playgrounds and classrooms used by classrooms.
 “The open areas of our college would be engulfed,” he said, adding “we should be working towards improving quality of life. There should be development but within certain parameters.”
 Project architect Michael Anastasi said there was a misconception about the volume of development. Most of the objectors, he said, spoke about the massive size, but the proposal was lower and less impactful than the existing building.
 He stressed that the parking provided was at a surplus to that required. The client would be excavating – beneath sea level which was very expensive – to provide parking.
 The project would be regenerating what is now a dilapidated area, he said. He added that project would not be overlooking the school as the volume was almost identical as the current building.
 The case was suspended to allow the architect to further consult with the Superintendence for Cultural Heritage and Enemalta and tweak designs accordingly.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/blank-walls-temporary-architect-seeking-swieqi-pencil-development.1098058,"An architect seeking to build a pencil development among a row of Swieqi townhouses replied to residents' concerns about raising blank party walls by saying that they were ""only temporary"". 
 Architect Christian Spiteri said that just because a few houses along the street did not want to develop their property, it did not give them the right the prevent his client from doing so. 
 Spiteri, on behalf of applicant Christopher Stanley, was arguing in favour of a planning application that wants to demolish a terraced house in Triq il-Ħemel in Swieqi and build a block of five flats instead. 
 A group of residents as well as the local council have been vocal in their opposition to the project. 
 But during a sitting discussing the case on Friday, Spiteri said that their plans for the site must be evaluated in the correct context. 
 He said the application was to develop in the context of that scheme and would maintain consistency in the area - that was no longer a two-storey terraced house area.
 He insisted that the application observed the height limitations in the local plan.
 “Just because there are 10 owners that do not want to develop their house, it does not mean they have a supreme right to change the applications of others like my client,” he said adding that the houses were not of some architectural heritage that deserved some form of special protection.
 He also said that the blank party walls were temporary and would not remain there forever as adjacent buildings could be developed.
 This earned him a swift rebuke from Swieqi mayor Noel Muscat. 
 “The way you’re talking is the proper destruction of Malta: 'Let’s go ahead and keep destroying'. On the contrary, we are saying: 'Let’s save what we can',"" he said. 
 During the sitting, Timothy Bartolo and Tara Cassar, who represented residents, said this project exceeded the height limitation for the area by two storeys and would create blank party walls on both sides. This would ruin the streetscape. 
  They also argued that the project would be in breach of an agreement made with the Archbishop’s Curia.
 The terraced house in question was built on a plot of land known as Art Tal-Kbira originally granted by the Archbishop’s Curia to engaged couples to construct terraced houses.
 This was a contractual obligation which remained when Church properties were transferred to the Joint Office, they argued.
 The objectors also cited a landmark court decision in which, last year, the Court of Appeal overturned a decision to allow a terraced house, in a row of 20 terraced houses in Triq il-Ġibjun, Santa Luċija, to be demolished and turned into four apartments and a penthouse.
 The court ruled that just because the local plan’s height limitation permitted buildings of the height applied for, it did not mean that the permit ought to be granted. Any new building had to respect the context of the buildings it was located in.
 Mayor Noel Muscat said Swieqi had a big problem with overpopulation and new blocks were being rented out as short lets.
 “The planning authority does not get into it, but it should because short lets are of a commercial nature and they are disturbing the locality tremendously - there is vandalism, disturbance at night and problems with waste management,” he said adding: “We are not against all development, but there must be a balance between the locality and the short let population.”
 The case was deferred to October 25.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/tm-investigating-alleged-illegal-activities-watersport.1096796,"Transport Malta is investigating reports of alleged illegal activities by watersport facility operators at Għadira Bay. 
 Private boat owners who wish to anchor at the popular bay during the summer season have complained of harassment from these operators.
 Speaking anonymously to Times of Malta, one boat owner described how a company has “practically taken over the entire bay illegally by placing several unregistered and illegal moorings, charging boaters a daily fee for using them”. 
  He and others who refused to pay were allegedly driven out of the bay, with one operator “hurling expletives” and displaying “very aggressive behaviour for simply anchoring in a spot where he was planning to cram in more boats”.
 A spokesperson for Transport Malta said the Maritime Enforcement Unit is actively investigating several reports of irregularities at Għadira Bay. 
 “The investigation is still ongoing as more details and information are being gathered,” the spokesperson stated.
 One reader recounted how, on Sunday morning, he was told off by an operator because “we had not booked a mooring in advance”. 
 The boater said that later in the day, after finding an empty spot, the same operator returned, hurling abuse and obscenities. 
 “What irritated me most was the way he thinks he owns the sea,” he said.
 Concerns have also been raised about the safety of bathers and boaters due to the illegal moorings, which have been deployed so close to each other that they leave little space for other boaters to anchor freely. 
 Some moorings have even been installed within the ferry way in the swimmers’ zone, an area meant to remain unobstructed for safe passage.
 Transport Malta confirmed that watersport companies are not permitted to rent moorings in public bays, although they can apply for mooring permits for their commercial vessels. 
 While no standard distance between moorings is established, a safe operational space should be maintained between vessels, according to the agency. 
 The Moorings and Berthings Unit monitors the situation and reports illegal activities to the Maritime Enforcement Unit and the police, who then take enforcement action as necessary.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/demonstrators-abela-stop-pa-backdoor-sanctioning-illegal-developments.1097457,"A coalition of NGOs and resident groups want Robert Abela to stop the Planning Authority from sanctioning illegal developments.
 In a press conference outside Castille on Saturday morning the groups said that the prime minister’s lack of action in this matter is overseeing a “power seizure” by developers over the country’s planning and justice system.
 The issue came to prominence recently after the PA sanctioned a development which had been declared illegal and stripped of its permit by a Court of Appeals just months prior.
 That decision sparked outrage and triggered an Ombudsman investigation, as well as a formal appeal into the sanctioning application.
 Moviment Graffitti activist Andre Callus said that Malta's already rotten planning system was being plunged to new depths by the Planning Authority. 
 He said that the developer behind the sanctioned development that made headlines, Gozo magnate Joseph Portelli, has three other illegal construction projects which currently have sanctioning applications before the PA. 
 “Sanctioning procedures are meant for cases where structures conform to existing policies. Yet, in these four instances, Court rulings have clearly stated that they do not,” Callus said.
 “The PA’s processing and approval of these applications undermines the entire planning and judicial process, turning it into a sham procedure where laws, regulations, and even Court rulings are disregarded to appease powerful developers.”
 This status quo, he added, gravely undermines the rule of law and threatens people’s ability to meaningfully challenge the PA’s decisions. 
 Callus said that this scandal is tied to the fact that this far the government has failed to meaningfully reform the planning appeals process, despite Abela promising several times that he would do so. 
  The law allows developers to begin construction on buildings which are still under appeal, thus creating a situation in which illegal structures are built and remain in place even after the court rules against them. 
 Din l-Art Ħelwa president Patrick Calleja explained that in the past four months, four sanctioning applications located in Gozo had been filed by entities connected to Joseph Portelli, and in every instance, they had already been built when the courts revoked their planning permits. 
 He said the court had primarily revoked these permits because they did not conform to planning policy. 
 However, in the case of the Sannat permit, this was granted through a summary procedure. 
 This means that rather than basing the sanctioning application on an assessment by the planning commission, the decision is based on the recommendation of the PA’s executive chairman, who must declare that the building does in fact confirm to existing planning policies. 
  When PA boss Oliver Magro made the recommendation for the Sannat application, it did not conform to planning policy as clearly stated by the court, Calleja said. 
 “The planning minister must explain why the PA accepted this summary application when it knew the penthouses didn’t conform to policy,” Calleja said. 
 Luke Said from the NGO Għawdix said it was beyond belief that normal citizens must fight tooth and nail for rights that should be obvious and simple, such as not allowing construction to go ahead while a building is under appeal and following the directions of a court judgement. 
 “This situation is incredulous and denies us the right to shape our own environment as we see fit. It is a shame that this has happened in a democratic country,” he said. 
 Astrid Vella of Flimkien Għal Ambjent Aħjar said that the PA’s decision to sanction the Sannat penthouses not only goes against its own mission statement and is in violation of a number of international treaties Malta is signatory to, but has far-reaching implications for the state of the rule of law in the country. 
 “Almost every day the Maltese people are forced to endure another insult to the planning system that further plunges it into crises,” she said. 
 “Not only is this eroding our legal rights as citizens, but its implications go beyond the environment. If an entity can simply ignore a decision handed down by the Chief Justice, then it sets a precedence that he can be ignored in other areas as well.""
 She added that the ongoing construction frenzy is having an impact on the public's physical and mental health. 
  “[PA Boss] Oliver Magro should open his eyes,” Callus said. 
 “We know that these people take their directions from others, but as we’ve seen in court proceedings related to the hospitals deal, people who put into motion the criminal actions of others are having to answer for their deeds as well.” 
 Prior to being appointed PA chair, Magro served as part of Prime Minister Robert Abela's legal team.
 Abela's government this week announced that it would be presenting a law that would prohibit construction projects from going ahead until the appeals process has been exhausted.
 The prime minister had made a similar pledge back in September 2023, saying at the time that his cabinet ""has approved"" such a law. Nothing more was heard about it until this week's statement.  
 Speaking on Saturday, Callus said he would reserve judgment until details concerning the law were divulged. 
 “We’re ready to participate in consultation, but we’ll believe it when we see it,” he said. 
 Callus said the NGOs are calling for the government to take the following steps immediately: 
 The groups who participated in the press conference are BirdLife Malta, Din l-Art Ħelwa, Flimkien għal Ambjent Aħjar, Friends of the Earth Malta, Għawdix, Moviment Graffitti, Nature Trust Malta, Ramblers Association Malta, The Archaeological Society Malta, Wirt Għawdex, Azzjoni Tuna Artna Lura, Għaqda Residenti tal-Qrendi, Għaqda Storja u Kultura Birżebbuġa, Marsaskala Residents Network, Marsaxlokk Heritage, Nadur Nadif, Residenti Beltin, Sliema Residents Association and Wirt iż-Żejtun.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/selfemployed-cab-drivers-protest-injustice-saturated-market.1093278,"Updated 6.25pm
 Self-employed cab drivers will again protest this Monday over what they say is ""injustice"" perpetuated against them by government authorities. 
 They will meet in front of Paul Boffa Hospital at 4 pm and march to the office of the Prime Minister at Castille. 
 Aron Gatt, who heads a lobby representing drivers, said the self-employed feel shortchanged as the ""y-plate"" market has become oversaturated.
 ""Competition did not grow organically but illegitimately. Transport Malta and other authorities flooded the market by allowing companies to expand their fleet to hundreds of cars even though they are not in line with regulations,"" Gatt, president of the Light Passenger Operators Association (LPOA), said.
 He said that some of Malta's largest fleets do not have off-street parking for their cabs but are still allowed to operate. 
 Fleets have not only abused the system but pushed up insurance premiums due to accidents caused by drivers not used to local roads, Gatt said. 
 ""In 2020, we were paying around 700 a year in insurance; now, people are paying around 2,000. One person I know pays almost 4,000 yearly,"" he said. 
 As a result, self-employed cab drivers are only scraping by and earning just over the minimum wage when accounting for costs, Gatt said. 
 In February, the Light Passenger Operators Association (LPOA) also organised a protest over low prices on cab platforms like Bolt, Uber and e-Cabs. 
 They drove in a slow car cade from Ta Qali to Marsa as a show of force. 
 They are organising another protest because the association feels it has been unheard by authorities. 
 ""We've had meetings with the government but nothing has changed,"" he said. 
 Companies with large fleets make up the vast majority of the Maltese cab market. 
 A Parliamentary Question from last November shows that over 60 employers have a fleet of over 10 cars. Three of those have more than a hundred Y-plated cars. 
 The largest fleet in Malta is WT Global with 269 cars. 
 In comments to Times of Malta late on Friday, a spokesperson for the Transport Ministry said it had met representatives of the Light Passenger Operators Association on various instances and communication with stakeholders remained ongoing.
 ""The minister reiterates that his doors remain open to operators and to entertain discussions in good faith to discuss solutions. 
 ""While drivers have every right to protest, the government urges operators to continue to assist the authority in bettering the situation.""

https://timesofmalta.com/article/i-cannot-recall-day-like-yesterday-emergency-doc-triple.1097341,"Updated 5.30pm
 An emergency doctor who on Tuesday assisted in three fatal accidents said he could not recall the last time his team dealt with three fatalities from three separate accidents in one day.
 “There have been motor accidents with three fatalities, but we cannot recall a day like yesterday. It took a toll on us all,"" emergency doctor Michael Spiteri told Times of Malta. 
 On Tuesday, three people died on Maltese roads. Balu Ganesh Balakrisha, 40, died in a head-on collision in Żebbuġ in the morning. Hours later,  77-year-old Carmen Buttigieg was hit by a van in Qormi and in the evening  Cristi Robles died at around 11pm following a motorcycle crash in Rabat. 
 Her death was the eighth traffic fatality this year. The death toll is similar to last year's.
 Spiteri said that while what happened on Tuesday was not a trend, the three fatalities should be an important lesson for the public to prioritise their safety. 
 “We don’t have a safety culture in Malta. Safety is given the lowest ranking in priority in different sectors, not just driving,” Spiteri said. 
 “Wearing a seatbelt, reducing speed, wearing helmets, not consuming substances when driving and not driving when tired are all safety measures we should keep in mind,” he said. 
 When asked if emergency doctors have seen an increase in more fatal accidents caused by drunk driving or overspeeding, Spiteri said different factors play into what leads to a tragedy. 
 He said there are now more cars on the road, and he has noticed people are less mindful.
 ""We do see people driving under the influence, however, we also see people who are over-worked, over-tired and less patient. We are seeing a nation losing its mindfulness and peace and this impacts how we are on the road.""
 Speaking on behalf of his colleagues, Spiteri said a day like Tuesday impacts the emergency team psychologically and physically. 
 ""It's the middle of summer, and we are working against the clock to get to the victims. That can be very draining on a person,"" he said. 
 He explained that in between accidents, the team races back to the hospital to restock and be prepared for the next critical call.
 ""Our job is to save people, and on days like Tuesday, we start to ask what we did wrong. But we must understand that there are injuries which will be very bad and little can be done about them.""
 Spiteri added that the public should remember that behind every death, there is a family.
 ""We all have a social responsibility to be kinder with our words,"" he said, referring to the harsh comments posted online following a road fatality.
 In a statement on Wednesday afternoon, Doctors for Road Safety said the loss of life of three people within 24 hours was tragic but also ""potentially preventable"".
 ""The dynamics of these fatal crashes seem to be different and should ideally be investigated by the planned Transport Safety Investigative Commission, which to date has not yet been set up.
 ""Only then can we plan on the best interventions to optimise road safety and achieve our vision of zero deaths on our roads.""

https://timesofmalta.com/article/local-plan-change-expected-multiply-villa-rosa-project-size.1099190,"The floor ratio of plans to redevelop the Villa Rosa site in St Julian’s could multiply in size after the cabinet on Tuesday formally approved a partial review of the St George’s Bay local plans.
 Sources said the amendment would mean that the project submitted by Anthony Camilleri, known as Tal-Franċiż, will grow exponentially from the original 57,000 square metres proposed.
 It is now up to the Planning Authority to formally start the process to amend the local plans, which should include a public consultation process. The current local plans only allow smaller and lower developments.
  Camilleri originally obtained a planning permit back in 2018 to develop the prime St George's Bay site into a combination of low-rise offices, residences and shops.
 Before that development got under way, he submitted proposals to dramatically upsize the project, introducing a hotel and high-rise buildings. 
 An Environmental Impact Assessment last year had already concluded that the planned mega-development of a 34-storey tower and two 27-storey ones overlooking St George’s Bay in St Julian’s would have major impacts on the environment and air quality, both during construction and operation. It found that the likely impacts of the development were “high”.
 That proposal is still pending, with the Planning Authority yet to decide whether or not to issue a permit for it. 
  Details of the partial review of local plans approved by cabinet this week remain scarce. It is not known whether the review will allow the developer to introduce taller buildings into the area, or expand its built footprint. 
 One source said allowing the developer to increase the project's floor ratio could also mean more public squares being incorporated into the project.
 A government source said the issue was first raised in cabinet two months ago. Various MPs immediately raised concerns.
 “The proposal was dismissed at first, but it’s been presented again. This time it’s been decided that local plans will be tweaked to facilitate the project. Clearly, greed has no limits,” said the source.
 
 Another cabinet member said the review of the local plans would ""multiply"" the permitted size of the project and reduce, if not eradicate any legal challenges the project may face, should there be any.
 Yet another cabinet member said there was general discomfort among MPs about the proposed changes but “many of us were resigned it was a foregone conclusion”.
 Questioned about the proposed plans on Monday night, Prime Minister Robert Abela kept his cards to his chest.
 He said cabinet discussions are privileged and confidential.
 “Even if what you asked me is correct, we’d need another round of discussions before it is confirmed. I believe that the discussion would be wider than that,” Abela said when asked to confirm a change in local plans.
 Instead, the prime minister spoke about the need to diversify and elevate Malta's offering to tourists. 
  “We have reached the critical tourism mass the country needs. And I do not think we can continue with increasing the numbers… The discussions should be how to attract tourists of quality and we can do this by giving them a product that they can only get here and not in another country.
 “We need to invest in infrastructure in hotels, restaurants, and shops that sell brands, and we know how much competition we have with our neighbouring countries. The debate needs to be there.”
 The larger of the sites is currently occupied by Palazzo Villa Rosa together with a small hotel, a mix of retail and food & beverage outlets as well as Dolphin House, which used to be a language school and Moynihan House, which is currently unused.
 The other site is currently occupied by a beach club, Cresta Quay, and rocky terrain.
  The proposed development is being promoted by Anton Camilleri on behalf of Garnet Investments Limited which forms part of the AC Group of companies which is involved in property development, quarrying, and chainsaw cutting.
 Villa Rosa and its grounds were designed by one of Malta’s more prominent early 20th-century architects, Andrea Vassallo, who made a name for himself as the designer of the domes of the Saint Cajetan and Saint Nicholas parish churches in Ħamrun and Siġġiewi respectively, the Ta’ Pinu Sanctuary in Għarb.
 The site is located close to the massive db Group development, which will incorporate a five-star Hard Rock Hotel. The foundation stone of the project was laid last week.
 In a reaction to the Times of Malta revelations, independent election candidate Arnold Cassola said on Wednesday that this was a case where the private interests of developers were put before that of residents. 
 ""The lives of tens of thousands of residents in Pembroke, Swieqi, St.Julian's and Sliema are going to be negatively impacted forever,"" he said, calling for public protest.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/airport-boss-warns-queues-amid-staggering-passenger-numbers.1094014,"The Malta International Airport CEO has warned people to expect queues this summer as the “staggering numbers” of passengers has pushed it to its “extreme limits”. 
 Alan Borg told Times of Malta that passenger projections had been “completely off”, with the airport seeing record passenger numbers every month this year.
 And staff have been working hard to ensure the busiest season of the year goes smoothly, with work to upgrade the airport racing to catch up with the numbers of holidaymakers. 
 “Admittedly, we were probably too cautious with our numbers. So, what is happening now is our development is not in line with our passenger numbers,” he said. 
 Last year, the airport handled 7.8 million passengers - a national record - and in January it said it expected to welcome 8 million in 2024. But it is set to smash past that target after several months of higher-than-expected passenger numbers. 
 Results from last month show passenger numbers at 800,000 – beating the same month last year by over 70,000 people.
 The airport is installing signage and assigning staff to help passengers have a reasonable experience. 
 “Queues are to be anticipated,” he said. “Passengers are therefore advised to check in online if possible and not to arrive more than two hours before departure.”
 Borg said the airport is at “full throttle” on planned upgrades, which will “effectively double the footprint” of the airport. 
 The work includes separating and expanding the area dedicated to arrivals from outside the Schengen Area – a borderless region covering 29 European countries – and expanding MIA’s standing aircraft capacity by a third by next year. 
 Borg stressed that while they were busily under way, most passengers would “hardly realise there is any development going on at all”, stressing the airport was “putting in a lot of effort” to ensure passengers were not impacted by noise or construction dust.     
 Asked about overcrowding in the departures area following the interview, the airport said it “acknowledges the challenges posed by overcrowding” during peak times which it admitted had led to a shortage of seating at times. 
 It said it was “devising a plan to reconfigure the seating layout” to increase capacity by next year.
 The MIA CEO said the higher passenger numbers reflected a strong post-COVID recovery. New airlines have started flying from Malta and existing operators are beefing up their presence, with flight numbers increasing dramatically. 
 “We have at least 14 new connections coming online, including to existing destinations,” he said, noting that flights to Poland and the UK, for example, were set to increase by 40% and 20% respectively.
  Stressing that while the airport used to see around 11 departures in the morning with another peak in the afternoon, he said it was now seeing up to 24 departures per hour on some days. With so many passengers passing through MIA and flights increasing, does Borg expect any issues with baggage handling? 
 “Honestly, we did have issues in the past. [But] I think overall, we’re seeing that our handlers are gearing up for the summer,” he said.
 “Although it’s hard for me to promise there will be no issues – because we are operating at our extreme limits – I feel we are well-equipped to face the summer operation.” 
 But with MIA already seeing rafts of new tourists while working to upgrade its capacity, how does Borg respond to concerns of over-tourism placing a strain on the country’s infrastructure? 
 “I don’t think that the sky’s the limit; Malta has to have sustainable growth. The last thing we want to do as an island is infringe on the quality of the guests that come here with the volumes coming here,” he said. 
 Emphasising the importance of attracting “higher value” tourism and increasing footfall in winter months, Borg said he thought it was wrong to measure the success of the sector by tourist numbers alone. 
 “It shouldn’t be double-digit growth year-on-year… we would rather grow organically than simply looking at this financial year and seeing record number of tourists without taking any notice of what’s going on around us,” he said, calling the approach “a mistake”.
 On airline expansion at MIA, Borg said Easyjet had almost doubled its routes this summer with aviation newcomer Universal Air flying to nine destinations and other airlines including Air Baltic, Ryanair, ITA and Jet2 also operating new routes. 
 Asked if he agreed with Ryanair boss Michael O’Leary’s assertion last year that his airline was “probably the unofficial airline of Malta”, Borg disagreed, saying while Ryanair was a “fundamental player”, accounting for almost half of the airport’s activity, he placed more importance on ownership than market share.
 “KM Malta Airlines has the government as the main shareholder. So, I still veer to the shareholding side rather than on who has the largest [market] share,” he said. 
 Asked about the transition from Air Malta to KM Malta Airlines, Borg said it had been “seamless”.
 The expansion works at MIA will also see it prepare to accommodate new EU border controls requiring airports to record biometric data, including fingerprints, of all arrivals from non-EU countries. 
 Earlier this week, fears were raised that Malta could be suspended from the Schengen Area if it fails to have the Entry/Exit System (EES) in place by the November deadline to implement it, after lawyer Jason Azzopardi warned the project had been “completely ignored” by the police. 
 Quizzed about the fears, the airport said the police were responsible for the new border system, but that it was “working closely” with the police to make sure the system was ready in time. 
 Responding to questions on Monday morning, a spokesperson for the Home Affairs Ministry said a tender for the system was pending and ""scheduled to be fully adjudicated in the coming days.""
 He said the project had encountered ""challenges"" after the provider for the current border controls told police ""at the eleventh hour"" that the system was not compatible with EES, leading the police to issue a call for a new system. 
 ""Following a first call in which no bids were received, a second procurement process is currently in its final stages,"" the spokesperson said, adding technical experts were ""all hands-on-deck"" to ensure the system was in place by the November deadline.
 With EU countries under pressure to reduce their emissions, Borg stresses that there are bigger pollutants than the airline industry, which he says accounts to 8% of total greenhouse pollution in the travel industry.
 “Having said that, it doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t do our best and we’re making sure that our pledge to be net zero by 2050 will be honoured,” he said, pointing to initiatives such as installing fields of solar panels at the airport.  
 
 But with occasional fears raised over possible risks to pilots encountering glare from solar panels, is it wise to install them so close to an area where planes are taking off and landing?
 “It’s more an air traffic control issue, that we need to make sure that there is no refraction with their equipment... [But] we do thorough studies on where these panels are installed to make sure that it has no impact whatsoever.”

https://timesofmalta.com/article/three-years-counting-manikata-residents-roadworks-hell.1092846,"Roadworks in and around Manikata will be completed by the end of June, Infrastructure Malta has pledged, ending a three-year saga for residents of the hamlet.
 The €9 million project to upgrade the roads and the water network in the area has left residents “imprisoned” in their hamlet with the road from the St Paul’s Bay bypass leading to Għajn Tuffieħa “inaccessible 90% of the time”, residents said.
 An owner of a shop in the area, who preferred to be unnamed, claimed to have lost an average of €50,000 a month since January from passing trade. He said he simply could not afford more road closures.
 Residents criticised the lack of communication from authorities and described how roads would be closed off without any prior notification or warning.
 “We have had to make do with our own internal communication, advising each other on the updated road opening and closures,” one resident said.
 A residents’ association was formed in November to try to tackle the road closures linked to the project around Manikata, Għajn Tuffieħa, Mġarr and the Xemxija area.
 Families with young children often had to go through either Mġarr or Mellieħa to get to St Paul’s Bay, and the state of the roads damaged cars and tyres.
 The imminent completion time announced by IM will not mean all will be over for residents as a final phase at the junction of Triq Għajn Tuffieħa, part of the road heading towards Mġarr, is scheduled to follow in October.
  Residents have criticised an “insensitive” government, Infrastructure Malta, Transport Malta, the Water Services Corporation, ministers and MPs and the “incompetent” Mellieħa local council, which Manikata residents claim has ignored their continuous cries.
 The residents want a bypass created outside the hamlet to avoid all traffic going through its narrow roads and their dangerous blind spots.
 Mellieħa councillor Gabriel Micallef has, however, written to the ombudsman to investigate the unfinished works in the Miżieb, Imbordin, San Martin and Għajn Tuffieħa.
 The works were started and never completed, and time frames missed, Micallef said, insisting someone had to be held responsible for the delays. “We are not second-class citizens,” he said.
 Manikata was “no longer the quiet village I invested to live in”, said a person who has been residing there since 1998.
 Apart from the “uncontrollable” granting of building permits, the once peaceful hamlet has been turned into a “highway” linking Gozo and Mellieħa to the rest of Malta, with over 50,000 vehicles driving in and out daily, including polluting heavy vehicles that were prohibited by a legal notice but were not stopped due to a lack of enforcement.
  There is zero traffic management, with buses and heavy vehicles getting stuck in the narrow roads with oncoming traffic, the residents said.
 The roadworks have also led to problems for ambulances to reach homes due to the lack of signage and notifications of road closures. The ongoing infrastructure project involved the installation of new services by a number of service providers, prior to IM’s intervention.
 This consisted of road build-up and reconstruction of stretches of retaining structures along the route from Għajn Tuffieħa through the area known as Ħal Ferħ to Xemxija, covering a distance of five kilometres, the agency explained.
 Phase 2, on Triq Għajn Tuffieħa from Xemxija roundabout to tal-Palma and beyond, includes works managed by a service provider on the new potable main and second-class water for irrigation and farming – part of upgrades to the water network in the northwest region.
 IM is responsible for the rebuilding of the new retaining and boundary walls and road reconstruction, which it said were almost done.
 Phase 3, which is ongoing, includes work on the construction of a new roundabout, the reconstruction of boundary walls, and civil works for the reinforcement of electrical infrastructure.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/pa-approves-rezoning-massive-nigret-arable-site-residential-complex.1097895,"The Planning Authority approved an application to transform a large stretch of arable land in Żurrieq into a residential complex on Tuesday. 
 The planning control application in the Nigret area would see the construction of five blocks across the 18,302-square-metre plot, equivalent to the size of 70 tennis courts. The development also includes the proposal of two new public schemed roads.
 Four of these three-and-a-half-storey blocks are earmarked for apartments, while one is designated for “social and community facilities”. The apartment blocks will cover 70 per cent of the site. 
 A tenth of the area will be taken up by a road, and a quarter will be allocated to open spaces, according to the zoning plans. The zoning parameters were established in the 2006 South Malta Local Plan.
 The site area is located at Triq Fra Gammari Zammit, Triq Zaccaria Roncali and Triq Fra Luca Zurki.
 The zoning application was proposed by Tum Invest, the same company that has another zoning application in the area. 
 The large development had been slated for approval by a Planning Authority case officer because the site is within the development zone and adheres to local plans. 
 In a hearing on Tuesday afternoon, the application was unanimously approved by members of the PA’s Executive Council, despite the ongoing archaeological investigations being carried out by the Superintendent of Cultural Heritage having not yet been concluded. 
 As detailed in the case officer's report, the Superintendent of Cultural Heritage had recommended the evaluation take place before the zoning decision, so that if any archaeological discoveries are made, the layout of the development is amended accordingly.
 Yet, the heritage watchdog also gave developers the option of conducting archaeological studies after the zoning permit was issued.
 During the meeting, the project's architect, Joseph Bondin said archaeological studies are currently ongoing. 
 One member of the Executive Board asked Bondin how the large development would be achieved, adding that ""to develop a site like this, you need millions of euros"".
 Bondin said there will be a phasing plan for the development, to ensure the project is achievable. 
 When asked what plans he has for the open space of the area, he said the open space will include trees and greenery which will be enjoyed by locals and residents. 
 He said the local council will be provided with 350 square metres of a building to be used for ""community space"".
 A building earmarked for a 'social and community facility' will be developed into an elderly home- satisfying the suggestion made by the council, Bondin added.
 Żurrieq, especially the Nigret area, has made headlines for several zoning changes. 
 This application’s site is across from another site undergoing a zoning change, which could lead to the development of an additional 12,000 square metres of arable land.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/centenary-malta-pavilion-1924-british-empire-exhibition.1091245,"In 1923, when plans were drawn up for the Malta pavilion at the 1924 British Empire Exhibition, Edward Tancred Agius (1849-1924) was a significant figure representing Maltese interests in London and the UK.
 Edward had set up business in the City of London in 1869, aged 19. With the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, he saw an opportunity to ship coal out of England to fuel the Royal Navy based in Malta and other bases around the world.
  Edward married Maria Concetta Muscat at St Catherine’s church, Valletta in 1873. He returned to London to live in Hampstead for the rest of his life but spent several months each year in Malta, especially when his four daughters married Maltese men and raised their families in Malta.
 Edward developed other businesses along the way, including the import of the first buses to Malta in 1905 and operated the first bus service with his brother-in-law, Joseph Muscat.
 In 1904, Edward’s brother was consecrated Archbishop Ambrose Agius and appointed as Pius X’s Apostolic Delegate to the Philippines. At the same time, Edward was appointed a Lay Chamberlain of the Sword and Cape. 
 Edward became the Maltese government’s spokesman in London and represented Malta at such events as the coronation of George V in 1911. He was instrumental in ensuring that the Malta pavilion was built and ready for the exhibition’s opening day. 
 In 1923, there was a preliminary exhibition to encourage the industry to participate and, besides medals, monetary prizes were also given. Dr Ugo Mifsud (later prime minister of Malta) was the local chairman of the special exhibition committee, while Edward Tancred Agius, president of the Malta Association in London, was appointed Commissioner for Malta at the exhibition. Ugo Mifsud was Edward’s nephew by his sister-in-law Philomena Muscat.
   The pavilion was modelled on a Maltese fort with the front entrance as the gateway to Mdina and the side doors as one of the gateways to Vittoriosa. We can ascertain from photos that the structure was about 60 feet square and 20 feet high. It had three rooms to show ‘Industrial Malta’, ‘Malta under the Knights’ and ‘Prehistoric Malta’.
 The ‘Malta Under the Knights’ hall had suits of armour borrowed from the Palace Armoury, in Valletta. ‘Prehistoric Malta’ had two paintings by Maltese artist Robert Caruana Dingli (younger brother of Edward Caruana Dingli). These are now displayed in the museum at Għar Dalam, in Birżebbuġa.
 Major Albert E. Abela, in his book A Nation’s Praise: Malta – People, Places and Events, Historical Sketches, writes: “The Malta pavilion covered an area of 370 square metres. The first prize for the best design of a pavilion went to architect G. Caruana and the second prize to architect Albert Laferla. The main entrance to the pavilion was a perfect replica of the main gate of Mdina, while the two side entrances were reproductions of the entrance to Vittoriosa.”
  The Malta pavilion was the most popular of the smaller nations’ pavilions. The Sphere of July 19, 1924 described it as “one of the wonder shows of the exhibition”. Elsewhere, the Malta pavilion was described as “the most scientifically arranged of the exhibits of Greater Britain”.
 The Times (of London) wrote on May 27, 1924: “Malta is able to convey a lasting impression of the island through the delightful and artistic pavilion in which 50 centuries of its history are faithfully represented. The lace section of the pavilion was the wonder and admiration of every visitor.
 “The Malta pavilion had its own garden with neat paths and flowerbeds and benches, interspersed with kiosks selling lace and other Maltese products – quite apart from traditional Maltese refreshments. The overall effect of the magnificent pavilion and its well laid out garden was to turn that cherished spot at Wembley into a little Malta.”
 Before the opening, a set of postcards was produced and these can be seen on sale in the photo of Edward Agius in the Hall of Knights.
 The 1924 diary of Edward’s son, Arthur tells us that the family (living in Hampstead and Kensington) were present on opening day and made frequent visits during the six months that the exhibition was open. On May 28, the King and Queen of Italy, accompanied by King George and Queen Mary, visited the Malta pavilion where Queen Elena and Queen Mary were presented with bouquets by Edward’s granddaughters, Marie Agius, aged 7, and Suzanne Agius, aged 6. This occasion is recorded in a framed set of photos that hangs at the Casino Maltese, in Valletta.
  On May 24, correspondence in The Tablet indicated that there was no Catholic presence at the exhibition. Funds were soon raised and, by the end of June, a small oratory was built on a spare plot of land across from the Malta pavilion. This was formally opened and blessed by Cardinal Francis Bourne on June 30.
 Sadly, Edward Agius became terminally ill in the following weeks and died at the family home of 3, Belsize Grove, on September 21. His funeral was held at St Dominic’s church, Hampstead and then, on October 10, a memorial mass was held in the oratory at the Wembley exhibition with all members of the family then in London in attendance.
  
 The exhibition was reopened for six months in 1925 but, this time, with no Malta pavilion, perhaps because there was no longer Edward’s driving force behind the enterprise. He was ever the promoter of all things Maltese from the moment he arrived in London in 1868 to his passing in 1924 and leaves behind a diverse legacy of over 420 descendants spread all around the world, mainly in England and Malta.
 Peter Agius is the great-grandson of Edward Tancred Agius. Born in Hampstead and living in Hampshire, UK he is co-administrator on the 35,000-member Malta Vintage History Facebook Group. For more information, visit www.agiusww1/empire.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/pn-reveals-gozo-flats-dozens-registered-residents.1097742,"Dozens of people are registered as living in two apartments next to an office block being used as an address by 50 more, the Nationalist Party said on Friday. 
 ""It is impossible for all these people to be registered as residents at a single property,"" home affairs shadow minister Darren Carabott said in a statement. 
 Carabott released the information after Times of Malta reported that around  50 individuals were falsely declared on government databases as residing in a building owned by Gozitan developer Mark Agius on Triq Qasam San Ġorġ, Victoria. 
 That building turned out to be used as an office, a site visit showed. 
 On Friday, Carabott said that 49 other people are registered as residents at the building next door to Agius’ office block.   
 He said that 33 third-country nationals are registered to live in Flat 1, Agius Court, Triq Qasam San Ġorġ, Victoria, while 16 were listed in Flat 3 of the block. 
 Times of Malta confirmed Carabott’s claims through sources with access to a government database. 
 The revelations continue to add pressure on authorities to clamp down on housing and identity abuse, following allegations of a massive ID card racket.
 On Wednesday, Times of Malta visited four Gozitan addresses where dozens of third-country nationals are registered as residents. These included Agius Buildings in Victoria and two locations in Xagħra.   
 Three of the locations turned out to be offices. The other was a block of flats, but a resident of the block said that only locals and Maltese lived there. 
 Carabott also said that the two Xagħra locations - an apartment on Triq il-Gajdoru and a holiday home known as Janique House were supposedly housing 20 and 25 residents each respectively. 
 In his statement, Carabott directly linked the findings to a wider scandal involving Identita’. 
 Over the past few weeks, Malta’s identity agency has been engulfed in allegations of fraud, with lawyer Jason Azzopardi claiming that thousands of people have been granted ID cards on the basis of false documents. 
  Carabott noted that the PN has asked the auditor general to investigate Identita’ and that the courts are also probing the agency.
  The PN is gathering information and evidence from the public regarding the alleged scandal, which will be passed on to the inquiry, Carabott added.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/motorcyclists-join-santa-maria-pilgrimage-raise-1000-puttinu-cares.1096780,"Some 100 motorcyclists on Thursday raised €1,000 in aid of Puttinu Cares during the yearly Santa Maria pilgrimage from Mġarr to Dingli.
 Now, in its seventh edition, the event is organised by the parishes of Mġarr and Dingli, both dedicated to Santa Maria.
 According to Mario Micallef, an organising committee volunteer, the pilgrimage is firstly an act of devotion to the Madonna, a gesture of solidarity between parishes, and also an ""enjoyable activity"".
 Just before the pilgrimage began, Angele Cuschieri and Rennie Zerafa from Puttinu Cares - a charity that supports Maltese patients receiving treatment abroad - thanked the participants and spoke of the ongoing need for funds to assist patients and their families.
 The pilgrimage started in Mġarr, where Fr Noel Vassallo addressed participants. The group then passed through several localities, including Mosta, Attard, Mrieħel and Qormi. The journey continued through Żebbuġ and Rabat, concluding at the village square in Dingli.
 Upon arrival in Dingli, the motorcyclists were greeted by Archpriest David Farrugia, who led them in prayer and blessed the participants.
 “It was beautiful to see everyone come together,” Micallef reflected afterwards. “It gives us an opportunity to celebrate Santa Maria in a unique way”.
 Santa Maria, a feast deeply rooted in Maltese culture, is celebrated with particular reverence in Mġarr, Dingli and Żebbuġ in Gozo on the Sunday following August 15. On the 15th, the feast is celebrated in Attard, Mqabba, Qrendi, Mosta, Gudja and Għaxaq.
 The feast holds historical significance due to its association with World War II. In August 1942, the arrival of Operation Pedestal, a British convoy, was seen as miraculous. Facing intense Axis attacks, only five out of 14 merchant ships, including the vital tanker Ohio, reached Malta.
 The arrival of the barely standing Ohio brought crucial supplies to the island, coinciding with the feast of Santa Maria, and has since been celebrated annually with religious significance.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/government-stop-giving-away-beach-space-deckchairs-sandra-gauci.1098134,"The government must stop giving away precious space on beaches for operators to fill up with deck chairs, ADPD leader Sandra Gauci said on Sunday.
 Gauci was speaking at a protest at Buġibba's Perched Beach, where St Paul's Bay residents and NGOs Flimkien għa lAmbjent Aħjar and Moviment Graffitti occupied the small free patch of sand typically taken up by the tables and chairs of a nearby beach club.
 Struggling to be heard against music blaring from the club, the leader of Malta's green party said the situation on the beach was emblematic of a problem affecting most beaches across Malta and Gozo.
 She said that with the blessing of a permit, beach club operators had been given free reign to occupy every inch of the beach and pollute the area with unending noise and loud music.
 “Why should we have to pay to come down to swim and enjoy our beaches,“ she said.
 “I am not ready to put up with this noise when I want to enjoy the beach in peace just because someone has a permit. We resident came to live here to enjoy the sea not to be plagued by rats and mountains of garbage.”
 Gauci said that by continuing to approve permits for deck chairs and tables and chairs, the government was harming people’s quality of life.
 She encouraged the public to speak up and fight back against the encroachment of businesses onto beaches, warning if they did not, the situation would only get worse.
 “We have to fight for every centimeter, and the centimeters you don’t fight for today you will lose next summer,” she said.
  “In the meantime look around you and you can see that work is ongoing,” she continued, pointing to a nearby beachside construction site.
 ”Before you know it they’ll have taken everything and we will be left with nowhere but our baths at home to swim in.”
 Gauci said citizens must demand enforcement and not simply accept the presence of deck chairs, saying they should only be put out if someone asks for them.
 She also called for more enforcement to curb the public drunkenness and lawless behavior that springs up in the areas surrounding these establishments.
 Perched Beach, initially approved in 2006 as a sandy retreat for tourists, has seen increasing encroachment by private enterprises.
 And recently, the Planning Authority approved temporary beach furniture and a mobile bar at the popular bathing location. 
 Meanwhile, proposals to build kiosks, restaurants, and pool decks along the Bugibba promenade have been criticised heavily by residents who fear even further loss of access to the beach.
 Complaints about the way St Paul's Bay has been treated by businesses have been ongoing, with protesting residents last year saying their hometown had been turned into a “pigsty”.  
 Speaking at that event, Gauci said residents were ""tired of being victims of those who only see St Paul’s Bay as a place to make money and completely forgetting residents"".

 The new PPE, which cost a total of €1 million, is lighter and more adept to the Maltese climate, Home Affairs Minister Byron Camilleri told the media on Wednesday.
 He said the new protective clothing was another example of the government's commitment to improve the working conditions of CPD officers. 
 A recent sectoral agreement for the CPD has also seen officer salaries increase significantly, he added.
 CPD director Peter Paul Coleiro said the uniforms' lighter colour meant it will be easier to spot dirt: ""Soot is carcinogenic so it's very important that the PPEs are clean"".

https://timesofmalta.com/article/dont-give-space-populist-instigators-rebecca-buttigieg-ba-ruling.1097091,"Democracy should not be minimised by giving space to “populist instigators”, Equality Junior Minister Rebecca Buttigieg said after the Broadcasting Authority fined a radio station for failing to give a platform to far-right Imperium Europa.
 “The right to free expression must always be respected. But when this right is used to undermine the fundamental rights of others and spread hate speech, it is everyone's responsibility to ensure this dangerous narrative does not continue to spread,” she said.
 “Let us not undermine democracy by giving space to those who represent populist instigation, which, apart from being dangerous, lacks basic facts,” the junior minister said on the BA's decision.
 Buttigieg pointed out that she did not want to go into the legal merits of the case, but wanted to express her opinion nonetheless.
 Imperium Europa's Norman Lowell, a Nazi sympathiser who was convicted of inciting racial hatred, filed a complaint with the BA over RTK's decision not to invite him on its radio programme during this European Parliament election campaign.
 On Wednesday, the BA fined the radio station €4,660 for failing to invite Imperium candidates.
 The decision has sparked a wave of protests, with RTK, PEN Malta and the Institute of Journalists among those describing it as dangerous. 
 When contacted, Broadcasting Minister Owen Bonnici was cautious in his reply:
 “It has to be made clear that the Broadcasting Authority is an independent entity established by the constitution and acts autonomously from the government of the day,” a spokesperson for the minister said.
 “Issues of legal interpretation of provisions which, directly or indirectly, impinge on editorial discretion always need to be tackled very delicately and in the light of the principles relative to freedom of expression - particularly when the medium is privately owned,” the ministry said.
 The spokesperson said the case is still under judicial procedures, and the ministry will be in a better position to give its views when the case is closed.
 'I fully support RTK's position' - shadow broadcasting minister
 Shadow broadcasting minister Claudette Buttigieg said the BA’s decision completely breaches the principle of editorial freedom and she fully supported RTK's position.
 “The BA should stop policing private stations and focus more on the public broadcaster,” the PN MP said.
 The laws governing the BA should be revisited to reflect contemporary reality, she said, adding: “The concept of bias and balance should not outweigh the fundamental concept of liberty.”

https://timesofmalta.com/article/caritas-welcomes-budget-measures-warns-lowincome-families.1100344,"Caritas on Thursday welcomed budget measures which it said strengthened social well-being and inclusion, however, it warned that families on low income will still struggle to keep up with basic expenses.
 Earlier this year, a study commissioned by the charity showed that the cost of food for low-income families has risen by up to 50% over the past four years with families with children barely earning enough money to cover basic life expenses.
 This meant that the cost of feeding a family of four shot up by €3,543 in four years.
 On Thursday Caritas Malta said the budget aimed for an economy based on quality of life and skills and the charity welcomed initiatives such as social security credit for those who completed a drug rehabilitation programme. 
 However, it said it hoped that, in the future, the government would consider temporary housing for rehabilitated people or those who completed a jail sentence and have nowhere to live.
 It also acknowledged an increase in minimum wage and adjustment of tax bands, however, it said families depending on a minimum salary will still struggle to cover basic expenses.
 Caritas added that the eligibility criteria - including maximum net income of €25,149 - for rent subsidy needed to be revised. It also noted that families with low income could not access so-called 'green investment'.
 And while an increase in pensions was welcome, there were still elderly couples who were struggling to make ends meet since they depended on one pension.
 Caritas also urged the government to invest in trade schools and ensure craftsmanship did not die with the older generations.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/pay-150-taxes-even-earn-10000.1096397,"An official at a major cab driver recruitment company has been filmed telling a worker that if he accepts a job with them, he will only have to pay €150 monthly in taxes at most, even if he makes €10,000 worth of trips.
 Video footage sent to Times of Malta shows an official at WT Global and an owner of Ferruggia Fleet – two of Malta’s largest cab driver employers – telling workers they will engage them on minimum wage contracts regardless of their earnings.
 It means they would still only pay tax on a declared minimum wage.
 Non-EU cab drivers in Malta, legally referred to as ‘third country nationals’, must be employed by companies, known as ‘fleets’,  which provide drivers for platforms like Bolt, Uber and E-cabs. Despite picking up riders through the Bolt application, these drivers are not employed or paid directly by Bolt but by fleets that are their legal employers.
  The video footage was taken at the offices of the two companies and shows officials speaking to drivers who went to inquire about salaries and working conditions on different occasions over the past months.
 Sources in the ride-hailing industry believe the practice of offering such contracts is widespread throughout the sector, not just within these two companies. Sources close to the government confirmed these two companies are among those subject to investigations by the authorities into their operations and finances, as well as worker exploitation.
 Times of Malta is informed that applicants are often unaware that the contracts being offered are unlawful.
 The two companies deny any wrongdoing.
 The footage shows the officials describing the details of the contract system.
 It is common for a driver to make €8,000 worth of trips in a month, one official at WT Global is heard telling a worker.
 Those earnings are then split equally between the company and the driver in what is known in the industry as the 50:50 model, he explains.
 After the driver deducts taxes and fuel and garage rental costs – which he must pay himself – he could be left with some €2,000 or more in hand.
 If a driver were to agree to this arrangement, the official explains, it would mean they could be pocketing that much money while both driver and company will together pay less than €300 in taxes and social security.
 Times of Malta is blurring the entire footage to protect the identity of the people who recorded the videos.
 The WT Global official told one driver: “On contract we just mention the minimum salary, which is €12,000 something per year, as per Maltese law, and according to that salary, your tax and social security will be… approximately €130, €150 maximum.”
 He elaborated to another: “Even if you make €10,000, because it’s a commission-based job and on your contract you have minimum salary.”
 “And this is normal, eh, they reach €8,000 [monthly] easily,” he tells a third driver.
 The law allows employers to pay performance-based commission to their employees but both must declare it and pay taxes on it.
 In another video recorded at the same office, the same official tells a driver some drivers work 30 days a month and make €400 per day, which they then equally split with the company.
 At Ferruggia Fleet, a company owner also explained to the driver, by way of example, that if he makes €10,000 gross in a month, that will be split 50:50 between him and the fleet.
 Later, he tells him: “In the contract you’re going to have the minimum wage but you can also ask to have a slightly higher salary, to pay more tax, so you can call your family to come.”
 Drivers who have previously worked for the two companies confirmed to Times of Malta they were engaged with minimum wage contracts and, at the end of some peak summer months, would pocket as much as €4,000 a month, after splitting the earnings with the company and after paying fuel costs and taxes.
 “Whenever a customer pays cash, my employer tells me to keep it. The rest of the money is paid to me via Revolut,” one driver stated.
 Another driver in the job for several years confirmed he worked with a similar system and his employment contract said he earned just over €900 gross monthly. Drivers, however, do not make as much money during the off-peak winter months. “In summer, I earn between €2,500 and €3,000 a month in my pocket. In winter it’s around €1,000 or a bit less” one driver said.
 In summer, he works up to a staggering 16 hours daily to make up for the slower months, he added, and in winter he drives for around 12 hours daily to make enough money to get by.
 The contracts also mention paid sick leave, vacation leave and other statutory benefits but none of that was given, the drivers who spoke to Times of Malta said.
 In the footage, the WT Global official confirms this, telling one driver he will be allowed to go on vacation and take sick leave but he will not be paid for them.
 Times of Malta sent clips of the recordings to both companies and both denied any wrongdoing.
 WT Global said: “Any information regarding conditions of work is communicated solely through our Human Resources Department.  The audio seems to depict two non-Maltese nationals whose first language is not English speaking on this subject.  We have no such person working in our HR.  Thus, this person cannot be described as a company official.
 “Thus, while the audio is not clear, at best it represents a wrong assumption of our conditions of work by someone engaging in a conversation with a third party. Furthermore, throughout the audio, the person is not giving clear answers and, at a point, refers the person to HR.”
 Times of Malta was able to confirm – through publicly available information online – that the official seen in all videos taken at WT Global states he works in human resources for the company.
 Online, he describes himself as “Operations Assistant Manager, United Human Resource – WT Global”’.
 The company went on to say: “To be even more specific, the audio claims that costs related to tyres, repairs, maintenance and garaging are accounted as business expenses and not employee costs. WT Global does not attribute these business expenses and garage costs to our employees. Also, we cover vehicle insurance related costs ourselves.
 “Additionally, our employees are not compensated on a commission basis. Couriers are paid using a percentage model ensuring the minimum wage and other entitlements at all times irrespective of business cycles, while rewarding efficient individuals.”
 It said the company is continuously checked by the Department of Industrial and Employment Relations (DIER).
 “We reserve the right to take any further legitimate action to protect our company,” it said.
 Ferruggia Fleet replied through its lawyer, saying: “The client is of the understanding that all its employment and accounting books are in order, and is fully prepared to cooperate with the relevant authorities should they have any further questions or concerns about our operations.
 “The client would also like to disclose that it has consistently worked towards achieving new levels of fairness and employee welfare.”
 Last month, Times of Malta reported how the premises of both companies, along with that of another recruitment agency – Mela Cleaning – were raided by Jobsplus officials as part of an investigation into employee abuse.
 The investigations are mostly focused on drivers’ working conditions and alleged worker exploitation in an industry that has been the hotbed of controversy since it mushroomed during the last few years.
 The companies also employ food couriers, who have often protested on the streets and complained to the media that they are forced to work inhumane hours just to earn a living income.
 Meanwhile, earlier this year, MaltaToday had already reported how WT Global’s “murky” accounts paint a picture of what seems to be “a small empire built on the cheap labour of its workers”.
 Times of Malta sent questions to Bolt, which, though not the drivers’ direct employer, is Malta’s largest cab platform, which both companies’ drivers use to operate. Bolt said it was unaware “of these allegations or arrangements and take(s) such reports extremely seriously”.
 A company spokesperson said: “Bolt does not employ drivers itself and does not have visibility nor authority over the content of the contractual relationship between the fleet operators and their drivers.”
 “All drivers are either providing transportation services independently or engaged by independent, third-party entities (fleet operators) to provide transportation services on their behalf, while Bolt provides the platform and technology to connect the drivers with their prospective passengers,” they said, adding this is a common model in the sector globally and in Malta.
 “Our goal is to provide a reliable and affordable electronic platform where transportation services are made available to passengers through the fleets and their registered drivers while ensuring fairness for all those forming part of this marketplace.
 “Bolt relies on the relevant authorities to issue approvals, licences and documentation, which are required for fleets and drivers to operate lawfully, and such authorisations are an essential prerequisite for any registration on the Bolt platform.”
 Bolt said it will terminate its agreements with any fleet operators if they are found to be in breach of law or involved in any kind of malpractice in breach of their contract.
 E-cabs would not confirm or deny whether they work with either company, saying only: ""The eCabs ride-hailing platform is open to all drivers and fleets that are licensed to work in this industry"".
 It said that following the ""serious allegations"" it is awaiting guidance from the regulators and national authorities on whether the two operators are deemed compliant by law. 
 Questions have been sent to Uber.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/syrians-malta-celebrate-assad-fall-13-years-war.1102166,"Updated 5.50pm with comments
 Syrians in Malta took to the streets on Sunday morning to celebrate the fall of the Baath rule after 50 years in power.
 Some joined carcades, waving Syrian flags and cheering. Others joined the peaceful celebrations on foot, including in the Ħamrun Fra Diegu Square.
  Like fellow countrymen across the globe, Syrians in Malta woke up to news that President Bashar al-Assad had fled their home country's capital.
 Early on Sunday, Islamist-led rebels declared they had taken Damascus in a lightning offensive. Residents in the capital were seen cheering in the streets, as the capital was declared ""free"".
  Ahmad Kasem, who hails from a village near Palmyra, told Times of Malta: “I can’t even express how happy I am. I have been waiting for this moment for 14 years.”
 Kasem, who has lived in Malta since 2009, chose not to join the public celebrations, instead marking the occasion at home with his family
 “It was like Eid for us today,” he said.
 Sounding emotional, Kasem said the fall of the Assad regime made returning to his home country a possibility.
  “I love Malta. I mean, I have a business here, and my children grew up here and are Maltese, but you always feel something is missing, and that has been home,” he said.
 While Kasem expressed optimism about the future, Mazen Dadouch, originally from Damascus and a resident of Malta since the 1990s, struck a more cautious tone.
 “Let us not forget what happened in Libya,” he warned.
 Dadouch said he was very happy Assad had fallen and was celebrating that with his family, but expressed concern about the geopolitical complexities that could shape the country’s future.
 “I read a lot, and I am aware of all the powers in play, like Turkey, Russia, and the US, that might impact the future, so I remain cautious,” he explained.
 In Ta' Qali, dozens of Syrians gathered to celebrate news of the regime's fall. 
 But in Ħamrun, some people were reportedly warned not to wave the Syrian flag.
 Human rights activist Omar Rababah, who was born in Malta to a Syrian father, said police officers in Ħamrun were stopping people with flags in their hands and giving them a warning.
  ""The right for freedom of peaceful assembly, according to the Constitution of Malta, applies to every person, not just every citizen.
 ""Just like no one is stopped when we celebrate the results of general elections in Malta, we should not stop four cars and pedestrians with flags. Do not discriminate,"" he said in a Facebook post.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/in-pictures-evolution-bathing-costume-fashion.1097198,"Surviving evidence indicates that, in classical times, men and women swam together in the nude, whether in open waters or in communal baths.
 When the influence of Christianity became more pronounced, swimming as a pastime was actively discouraged. For centuries, public bathing rated as a lustful derangement and disappeared almost entirely from Europe. 
  Times closer to the French Revolution saw some slow revival in the enjoyment of sea leisure. For long, swimmers just stripped to their underwear; dedicated bathing costumes had to wait more than a century to gain acceptance. European legislation lagged behind, first stigmatising public male nude bathing as a criminal offence as late as the 1850s.
  Men and women started enjoying the sea wearing simplified versions of their everyday clothes – in Victorian times, long sleeves, high necklines, trousers and maxi skirts. All in heavy fabrics, like canvas or knitted wool, which, when water-sogged, conspired with natural gravity to weight the swimmer down.
  It was only in the 20th century that fashion started rationalising the bathing costume – almost full circle back to original nudity, covering just the barest essentials, progressively more minimal as time went by.
  It may sound curious that the two-piece costume for women did not result from vanity, exhibitionism or women’s lib but from the worldwide scarcity of fabrics in World War II. Allied governments rationed strictly the quantities of cloth allotted to costume manufactures, ordering them to economise to the max on what was available.
  On the scarce surviving photographic evidence, this two-part feature puts on record the evolution of the bathing costume in Malta up to Independence. I included a few quirks, like the short-lived one-shoulder vest for male swimmers and the harlequin top for pre-war water polo players.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/mgarr-family-secure-right-carry-santa-maria-statue-40200-bid.1096885,"A family in Mġarr on Sunday pledged €40,200 in aid of the parish church, outbidding another family for the first time in 30 years to secure the right to carry the Santa Marija statue along the village streets.
 ""This is an old tradition. I think only people from Mġarr can understand the happiness we felt when we learnt we would carry the statue tonight,"" said Mario Muscat, who led his family's bidding efforts on Sunday.
 In Mġarr, the right to carry the Santa Marija statue during the village's annual feast is determined through an ""auction"".
 That tradition dates to 1923 - a year after the statue of Santa Marija was brought to the village.
 The 34-year-old Muscat was up against Wistin Vella, who outbid the competition every year for the past 30 years.
 At noon on Sunday, hundreds of Mġarr residents looked on as Muscat and Vella faced off in the shadow of the parish church.
 
 Parish administrator Fr Noel Vassallo, acting as auctioneer, held a microphone to the two competitors' mouths as the sum they bid became higher and higher.
 The crowd gasped when Vella bid €40,000, but Muscat quickly countered with €40,200.
 That was too high for Vella, who conceded.
 As the crowd clapped, Vella shook Muscat's hand.
 Muscat said his family was determined to win the auction this year because several family members had travelled from Australia for the feast.
 Of the 12 individuals who won the right to carry the Santa Marija statue, three are based in Australia, Muscat said.
 Simon Camilleri, Jamie Grech, and John Grima, all born Down Under, have a special relationship with the statue.
 ""Their fathers had once carried the statue, and so they wanted to carry on the tradition,"" he said.
 ""For them, it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, so they are very pleased,"" Muscat said. Eight of the 12 will carry the statue, while the other four will serve as pole bearers.
 Muscat's father had also won the honour of carrying the Santa Marija statue over three decades ago, he said.
 Muscat said the tradition helps raise funds for the parish.
 ""There are villages that spend a lot of money on other things, like fireworks. Here, our money goes to helping the church.""
 Fr Vassallo said most of the money collected in the auction will go towards works in the church's sacristy.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/in-pictures-sailing-vessels-early-malta.1096808,"It was probably by coincidence but the progression of photography after the 1840s coincided with the slow defeat of sail in ships, brought about by the new steam propulsion.
 Up to the Napoleonic era, cargo and warships relied exclusively on brawn and wind power to move across waters – oars and sails. Until steam engines changed all that.
   Slowly but inexorably, the Victorian age witnessed the triumph of steam power and sailing survived mostly as a leisure and sporting pastime rather than as essential to commerce and war, as it had for centuries.
  This feature records sailing vessels in or around Malta through a sequence of antique images. Boats were mostly photographed in the harbours, at their least photogenic, with their sails stowed.
  My selection includes the last remnants of powerful British hybrid warships, on which steam engines coexisted with majestic sail rigging, marine training ships for young seamen and the native luzzu and  dgħajjes tal-latini (with lateen sails) for transport of passengers and light cargoes between the islands and fishing.
  Sadly, almost none of the latter have survived.
   Maltese commercial photographers found these native boats fascinating and marketed many images as postcards, particularly Salvatore Lorenzo Cassar, but even more intensely Edward Alfred Gouder (1870-1942), whose inexhaustible 1920s series of Gozo boats must rank as one of the aesthetic tours de force in the history of Maltese photography. I included many of them in my book Nostalgias of Gozo.
  I have deliberately omitted the work of the German Geo Fürst, the lyrical poet of Maltese imagery in the inter-war years. He made sea craft with sails unfurled central to his paintings and camera artistry.
  I may, in the future, dedicate a spread exclusively to his unbearably beautiful photos.

 The man, identified later as Louis Gauci, 60, was found lying on a pavement on Triq il-Karmnu.
 Medics who reached the scene at around 12pm pronounced him dead at the scene.
  Initial indications are that the man died of natural causes, as no signs of injury were spotted on his body. However, a police spokesperson did not rule out the possibility of an autopsy being carried out.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/lgbtiq-migrants-nonmaltese-still-face-discrimination-law.1092695,"Jules only felt safe to come out as a transgender woman when she settled down in Malta in her 20s. But despite being finally able to start her transition process without fear of reprisal, Malta will forever misgender her and consider her a man because she is from the Philippines.
 Likewise, at 35, Nasier can finally be his true self after making it to the island on the fourth attempt. However, any long-term partner he could have had in Egypt, where same-sex relationships are criminalised, will never be recognised by Malta for family reunification.
 Jules and Nasier are among dozens of non-Maltese who, after a childhood of torment in their home country, can freely express themselves since they are living in a country that continues to rank first on global indices measuring LGBTIQ+ legal and policy frameworks.
 However, they do not enjoy the same rights as Maltese members of the LGBTIQ community.
 That is why five organisations and several individuals came together on the occasion of International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia, Interphobia and Biphobia to call on the government to make four changes to Maltese legislation.
 Aditus, Drachma, Malta LGBTIQ Rights Movement, Rainbow Families Network and The Malta Foundation for the Wellbeing of Society recognise the “remarkable strides” in the LGBTIQ area in Malta, but the country’s asylum system and legislation “fails to fully embrace and protect those escaping oppression for their sexual identity”, they are telling the government.
 Under current legislation, Malta can describe a country as ‘safe’ for the return of asylum seekers even where LGBTIQ identities or behaviour are criminalised.
 The human rights advocates are therefore urging Malta to remove countries that criminalise LGBTIQ people or behaviour from the list of “safe countries of origin”.
  Separately, all people arriving in Malta by sea in search of protection are immediately detained in centres described as “institutional neglect” by the Council of Europe. LGBTIQ asylum seekers have often reported lack of privacy, fear of coming out, harassment, bullying and violence in detention.
 On Friday, Nasier told a meeting of people willing to support the NGOs’ call for legal amendments that when he landed in Malta he initially thought he was in an Arab country and was therefore fearful of alerting officials about his sexuality.
 It was only when he recognised the Red Cross logo, which he had seen in his home country, and met an official who was aware of his sexual identity, that he was directed through the right process that eventually landed him refugee status.
 Persecuted for his sexuality from a very young age despite trying to keep it under wraps from the age of 10, Nasier was so desperate to “choose life over death” that he sold his belongings, including his house, within a month to attempt to flee north Africa through Libya.
 He boarded a boat “headed to Europe” four times. The first time the boat “broke” an hour after departure, while the second and third time he was returned and imprisoned.
 “I knew nothing about Malta when I landed, and when I heard local people I thought I was in another Arab country so I was sure I won’t divulge my sexuality.
 “Nowadays, as a refugee in Malta I finally have a place to call home. A place that whenever I’m abroad I look forward to returning to, rather than feeling desperate to flee.”
 Aditus’ Neil Falzon said that if Malta brought its practices in line with international and European law, Nasier’s success story would not be a one-off.
 “Nasier met the right person at the right time. If Malta implemented quick assessment to determine a person’s individual needs, several others like Nasier would not be returned to a country where their true identity is criminalised.”
 Falzon added that a third loophole in Maltese law was that the island’s definition of family members stopped at “spouses and children”. LGBTIQ refugees from countries where same-sex relationships are criminalised can therefore never be reunited with their long-term partners whom they could not marry in their home country.
 Lastly, Malta’s Gender Identity, Gender Expression and Sex Characteristics Act allows only Maltese citizens to benefit from the right to gender identity. This means that non-nationals are unable to have their personal and official documents reflect their true gender.
 Marie-Louise Coleiro Preca, a former president and head of the Foundation for the Wellbeing of Society, told the meeting that such “double discrimination” resulted in the further marginalisation and vulnerability of LGBTIQ migrants.
 “Many LGBTIQ migrants still meet the same prejudices and injustices from which they sought to escape. The horrendous stories from within refugee camps and detention centres where lack of access to basic services and a heightened risk of exploitation and violence, is often the order of the day. 
 “We know that transgender migrant women are especially vulnerable to abuse, especially if detained in cisgender spaces,” she said, warning it was not enough to “simply acknowledge struggles”.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/academic-literary-critic-charles-briffa-dies-aged-73.1098382,"Academic and Maltese literary critic Charles Briffa has died aged 73, the Akkademja tal-Malti said on Saturday.
 Briffa, a professor at the University of Malta, was widely respected for his contributions to the Maltese language and national literature.
 He was a Member of the National Order of Merit, having been bestowed that honour in 2020.   
 His publications touched on a range of topics, from dictionaries to studies on cultural linguistics.
 Culture Minister Owen Bonnici called Briffa ""one of our best"". 
 ""Prof. Charles Briffa's legacy will last forever in his seminal works of literature,  language, and linguistics. He was also a pillar of the educational sector,"" Bonnici said as he offered Briffa's relatives his condolences.
 “He played a great role in honing the art of literary criticism among us,” academic and former minister Evarist Bartolo said as he paid his respects.
 Muża Karkariza, a Birkirkara-focused literary group that Briffa played an active role in, was also among the first to pay tribute. 
 The University of Malta's Department of Maltese also offered its condolences.  
 Born in 1951, Briffa attended the Liceo and went on to study at the Royal University of Malta (today the University of Malta) and Oklahoma State University in the USA, obtaining degrees in English and a postgraduate diploma in Arabic.
 He began teaching at Stella Maris College, kickstarting a teaching career that would take him into classrooms of all levels, teaching English, Maltese, Arabic and Systems of Knowledge.
 In 1996, he completed his PhD in Maltese, focusing on the rhythmic patterns of Maltese literature.
 Briffa lectured at the university at both undergraduate and postgraduate level and also contributed to the university’s radio station, co-hosting several shows focused on the Maltese language and its history.
 He was a member of the Akkademja tal-Malti and served on its editorial board. In 2000, he was appointed the academy’s president, a role he filled for four years.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/in-pictures-runners-raise-1000-19km-run-memory-becs.1096276,"A group of athletes raised close to €1000 on Saturday after running 19 kilometres in memory of Rebecca Zammit Lupi, who would have turned 19 on Saturday.
 Young athlete Tommy Wallbank led the early morning run in memory of his friend, which saw around 30 athletes gather at the Surfside bar and restaurant at 6am.
 The group ran to Qui-Si-Sana before looping back to the Love Sign in St Julian’s and heading back to Surfside. 
 “Although there’s nothing I can do to change that she is no longer with us; at least I can help to keep her memory alive,” Wallbank told Times of Malta after the morning run.
 Wallbank was also collecting donations for Nature Trust Malta and RMJ Horse Rescue Malta in honour of Zammit Lupi's love of animals. 
 So far, he has collected close to €1,000 in donations. 
  Wallbank’s family and Rebecca's parents, Darrin Zammit Lupi and Marisa Ford, were part of the support team cheering on runners and providing them with water. 
 His coach Fabio Spiteri, and former drug addict Miguel Mifsud - dubbed  “the sober runner” - also joined the 19km run, which was the second organised to celebrate what would have been the late teenager's nineteenth birthday.
 Rebecca, known to many as Becs, was only 15 years old when she died on January 3, 2021, after months of battling cancer. 
 Wallbank dedicates his passion for running to his friend Becs and said he owes it to her every time he is successful.
 His athletic career began in 2021 at the age of 15, when he pledged to run 1km for every €5 donated to Puttinu Cares, in honour of Zammit Lupi.
 The runner's initial goal was to raise €500 and run 100km but, in the end, he completed a 1,000km run challenge and raised €10,000 for Puttinu Cares.
 Since then, Wallbank has made a name in the local running world, surpassing his personal best time one race after another.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/the-people-pay-thousands-carry-santa-marija-statue.1096758,"For over 30 years, Wistin Vella has outbid the competition for an unusual auction prize – the right to carry the Santa Marija statue during Mġarr’s annual feast.
 Last year his family paid €15,000 for the privilege and as the bidding war returns this Sunday, he is aiming to offer even more.
 Driven by an “act of charity” as the money is used to help the community, the traditional ‘bidding war’ dates to 1923, a year after the statue of Santa Marija was brought to the village – and carrying it has become somewhat of a family tradition for Vella and his relatives.
 It is said the ‘auction’ was first held after the parish was overwhelmed with requests to carry the statue during the procession. It was decided that the team with the highest donation would earn this right and privilege, reserved only to today’s approximately 5,000 Mġarr residents.
 But this has remained firmly the domain of one family that manages to outbid the others, setting an unbeatable target offer every year.
 Vella said his grandfather started the offering over 100 years ago, when he helped pay for the statue of the Assumption of Mary, ordered from Marseilles in France through an agent in Valletta.
 The tradition passed to his uncle before it became Vella’s turn to place the family’s bid.
 Although he has consistently headed the winning team for three decades, Vella said he takes nothing for granted.
 Despite the family track record, he insists it is not a given that they will secure the highest bid again.
 “We do not know who and how much others are bidding,” he said, adding that the ‘battle’ is usually between around two to three groups.
 While his group of cousins has already established a limit for the ‘auction’ on Sunday, and it should surpass last year’s donation, he is, understandably, cagey about the amount.
  In 2022, on the 100th anniversary of the statue, this broke the record, when their bid reached a whopping €46,000 – such was their drive to carry it on that special occasion.
 Prior to that, the record bid stood at €17,000 in 2019, almost doubling the amount offered some 20 years before.
 Vella intends to uphold the long-standing tradition, but “we will only know in those 15 minutes at noon on Sunday”, he said.
 Hundreds of Mġarr parishioners turn up on the church parvis after the Angelus to watch the groups announce their bids in turn, in a nail-biting auction-like fashion, hoping to edge the others out of the running.
  If the 12 family members win, they will meet at the church at 5.30pm and proceed to carry the 800kg statue along the three-mile procession later that evening.
 The group consists of eight bearers and four others holding the forċini – wooden poles with a metal fork at one end – used to support the statue when the bearers stop for a breather.
 Although they do their utmost to be the bearers on the occasion, Vella said members willingly give up their place if they see that someone else really wants to do this.
 Besides the religious aspect of the event, he stresses on the charitable reason behind the initiative, explaining that the parish priest donates some of the money raised to a cause, while a portion of the funds will be allocated to works on the sacristy.
 Asked whether being a statue bearer was a form of sacrifice and a way of saying thank you, or of asking for some grace, Vella said that “when we carry it, we feel very grateful”.
 The feast of Santa Marija is celebrated in Mġarr on the first Sunday after August 15.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/cost-feeding-family-four-shot-3500-4-years-caritas.1097325,"The cost of feeding a family of four shot up by €3,543 in four years, according to a new study commissioned by Caritas.
 The cost of food for low-income families has risen by up to 50% over the past four years with families with children barely earning enough money to cover basic life expenses, the study found. 
 Whereas in 2020, food cost a low-income family with two children €7,132, this shot up to €10,675 in 2024.
 In the case of an elderly low-income couple, they spent €3,375 on food in 2020 which increased by 33% - to €4,488 this year.
 This emerged in the study titled The Minimum Essential Budget for a Decent Living 2024 published by Caritas Malta on Wednesday.
 The study, the fourth in its series, builds on three previous full studies carried out in 2012, 2016 and 2020. Two mini studies, that focused on food and health, were conducted in 2022 and 2023.
 As with previous studies, the 2024 study looked at three categories of low-income households: two children and two adults, a single parent with two children, and an elderly couple. 
 The study looked at their income – based on minimum wage, social benefits, bonuses and allowances. These were layered over  basic life expenses. It did this by creating a basic basket of goods that included: food, clothing, health items, housing and household maintenance-related items, transport, education and culture, and personal care.
  Certain items were added to the 2024 basic basket to reflect people’s needs. These included: pricing of a capsule wardrobe, one visit to a private doctor, capped heating and air conditioning use (gas cylinder use was decreased), and mobile phone monthly top-ups.  
 Assumptions were made that included: that these families had no major health expenses, were eligible for food aid packages and energy benefits, resided in subsidised housing, mainly used public transport and benefited from free education.
 Apart from the basic basket, the study looked at an augmented basket that, while still simple in terms of living, included certain choice-based expenses:  owning a car, commercial rent, occasionally eating out or ordering take-out, and pet care. 
 The findings showed that low-income households made of two adults and two children need €19,153 for the basic basket. This increases to €33,177 for the augmented basket.
 They spent €10,675 (56% of the basic basket) on food – the biggest expense across all categories. The second highest expense was on clothing (€2,148) followed by household goods and maintenance (€1,793).
  In the best-case scenario, these families received a maximum €21,132 annual income which showed that they scraped through to afford the basic basket expenses.
 The study showed that families with infants and toddlers were at a financial disadvantage as they faced one-off and recurrent expenses that amounted to over €1,800 a year. Expenses included baby clothes, food and milk, nappies and mothers’ supplements during and after pregnancy.  
 A single parent with two children needs €17, 013 a year to afford the basic basket and this shoots to €30,724 for the augmented basket. These families received a maximum income of €20,463 a year with one minimum wage, tapering benefits and other benefits bonuses and allowances. 
 This showed that single parents could not afford little luxuries such as ordering food and owning a car. Single-parent families spent €7,948 on food (47%). This expense was followed by household maintenance and expenses (17%) and personal care (9%).
  Elderly low-income couples need €14,732 for the basic basket or €26,556 for the augmented basket. They spend the bulk of their money on food (€4,488) and household goods and maintenance (€4,516). The latter could be due to the fact that their homes need more maintenance.  
 In the best scenarios, these couples receive €15,974 annual income to include one pension and other bonuses and allowances. This rose to  €21,116 if both received a pension.
 The report highlighted that low-income families could make choices that slashed their budgets when it came to the two major expenses – food and clothing.
  The cost of a seven-day menu varied for people residing in different localities. For example, a four-person family spent €171.81 a week in the southern eastern harbour. The cost of the same items was  €243 in the southern harbour.
  Similarly, picking charity shops for clothes shopping made a huge difference in the final annual cost of clothing. In the case of a family with two children, the cost dropped from €1,916 a year from regular shops to €433 from second-hand shops.
 The study went on to make various recommendations that could support these struggling families. These included:

https://timesofmalta.com/article/in-pictures-early-postcards-unusual-sports-malta.1092606,"Postcards featuring sport events were common in pre-war Malta. The lion’s share obviously went to football. But other popular sports, like water polo, rowing and aquatic competitions, some cricket, horse racing, polo, athletics, tennis, gymnastics, boxing, though hardly as frequently, assert their presence too.
  By far the greatest market for ‘sports’ postcards must have been the British armed services stationed in or passing through Malta. Most of the sportsmen belonged to the army and navy – rarely the air force – and the publishers would principally target buyers keen to keep those images as souvenirs or to send messages through the mail. Noticeable is the almost total absence of women, except for a few brave exceptions wielding tennis rackets.
  A smaller section of these postcards records other sports, some so weird I could not trace their name, let alone their rules. Maybe some reader will kindly fill in the blanks of my ignorance. I have selected these freakish sports for this spread. Yes, tug of war and a rudimentary high jump, long before the Fosbury flop. Massive hurdles look more like shin ruinators than athlete-friendly props, and boring, ordinary shoes then stood in for sophisticated sport footwear. 
  These ‘unusuals’ only seem to have been practised in the periodic ‘sports day’, de rigueur for every military regiment or ship’s company, often in dire competition against each other, all sporting the loudest rivalry, later quenched in communal gallons of McEwans, Simonds or Guinness. 
  An annual sports day also became a feature in schools and colleges, though few postcards survive of non-military events.
  Many of these cards, all real photos, circulated anonymously; the ubiquitous Richard Ellis and Salvatore Lorenzo Cassar signed some of them.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/vitals-auditor-acted-professional-money-launderer-hospitals.1093060,"An auditor who gave a clean bill of health to Vitals Global Healthcare is suspected to have acted as a “professional money launderer”.
 Accountant and auditor Chris Spiteri is at the centre of a web of companies set up by “secret” Vitals owner Shaukat Ali and his family members.
 An investigation into the hospitals deal established that Spiteri facilitated the Alis in setting up several companies directly involved in the healthcare concession.
 
 Many of these companies are suspected to have subsequently been used to siphon off public money into private hands.
 Investigators concluded Spiteri was privy to the “relatively enormous value of funds and additional benefits extracted by the Ali family” from the deal. These included lucrative consultancy contracts, employment contracts, luxury cars, travel and IT supply deals.
 They further allege that Spiteri was complicit in helping key players like Ali conceal the extent of their interests in the hospitals deal.
 
 He also used his client account to be used as a funnel for suspicious transactions, including for a medical cannabis firm suspected to be linked to former OPM chief of staff Keith Schembri.
 Spiteri was also aware that Ali had been actively involved in business in Libya, and Ali’s second wife had acted as personal secretary to Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi, investigators said.
 Ali denies wrongdoing and has downplayed his Libya links to Times of Malta.
 Investigators further allege that Spiteri accepted a €50,000 bonus from Steward to audit Vitals’ accounts and give the company a clean bill of health.
 This was done to ensure a smooth takeover of Vitals by Steward. Investigators said the bonus was offered to him via Ali’s son Asad.
 The bonus was “secretly built-in” to Spiteri’s audit fee and spread across the audit engagement fees for five companies.
 
 In accepting the bonus, Spiteri “set aside his professional ethics” and undermined the validity of the audit.
 Spiteri is facing a raft of charges, including forming part of a criminal association with Schembri, ex-prime minister Joseph Muscat and ex-health minister Konrad Mizzi. 
 In May, Spiteri took to Facebook to protest his innocence.
 Spiteri said he has never even met the ex-prime minister “in person”, let alone facilitated trading in influence.
 Spiteri said during the course of his audits of Steward, “I have never known that any criminal association exists”.
 “No bribery or money laundering have also ever come to my knowledge during all this time. I have been accused of facilitating trading in influence for Joseph Muscat, Konrad Mizzi and Keith Schembri – the truth is that I have never even met these individuals in person, let alone facilitating anything,” Spiteri said.

https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/129681/man_remanded_in_custody_after_setting_fire_to_his_former_partners_car_in_dispute_over_access_to_their_child,"The police have charged a man from Naxxar with arson, after he allegedly set fire to his ex-partner’s car in connection with a dispute over access to their child.
 Police inspectors Jeffrey Scicluna and Mario Xiberras, assisted by Prosecutor Joseph Camilleri Azarov from the Office of the Attorney General, charged 35-year-old John Joseph Debono with arson, criminal damage, offences against public order and littering in connection with the 3am fire that engulfed the vehicle in Sqaq il-Kubrit, Hamrun on June 6.
  Debono was also accused of driving without a licence and six other traffic offences, as well as aggravated harassment of the woman, causing her to fear he would be violent towards her, misuse of electronic telecommunications equipment and misuse of telecommunications equipment. He was also charged with breaching bail and recidivism.
 Inspector Xiberras testified that a warrant for Debono’s arrest had been issued following a joint investigation involving the district police and the Arson department. Debono, who was already known to the police, had been recognised from CCTV footage from the time and place where the car was set alight.
 The defendant, who said he works as an upholsterer, pleaded not guilty to the charges.
 Defence lawyer Roberto Spiteri requested bail, asking the inspector whether the injured party was in any way related to the man in the dock.
 There was, replied the inspector. The injured party had previously been in a relationship with Debono and was the mother of his child. The defendant had sent the woman an email in May, accusing her of withholding access to the child, ominously ending it “now we’ll see.”
 He had also sent multiple TikTok messages to the woman, continuing even after the arson attack.
 The defence lawyer suggested that the case against his client was based on documentary evidence, which had already been collected, but Xiberras pointed out that the victim and her father, the owner of the car, were yet to testify. He confirmed that there were no eyewitnesses.
 Camilleri Azarov pointed out that if the man were to be released from arrest, there was a risk of tampering with evidence and other offences being committed. He requested the court issue a protection order for the woman.
 The police had arrived at the defendant on the basis of footage and messages on social media which are already preserved. The risk that normally leads to bail being withheld - tampering with or destroying evidence - doesn’t apply in this case.
 The lawyer conceded that the man had a criminal record but said that it could not be used to prove intent, especially when his last conviction dated back years.
 He added that the defendant also had other children, a 13-year-old boy from another mother who had “completely abandoned her son.” “If bail is denied, the only parent taking care of him is going to be behind bars,” submitted the lawyer.
 Bail was, however, denied at this stage. The court upheld a request for a protection order in favour of the woman and her family.  "
https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/129680/man_breached_protection_order_by_anonymously_calling_his_former_partners_phone_to_speak_to_son_,"A man was remanded in custody on Tuesday, accused of breaching a protection order by calling his estranged partner’s phone to speak to his infant son, only to be reported to the police after he used a mild derogative to refer to her.
 Inspector Christian Cauchi charged the 39-year-old builder from Birkirkara with misuse of electronic telecommunications equipment, exceeding the limits of provocation in insulting the woman, breaching a protection order imposed in April and recidivism.
  He told magistrate Yana Micallef Stafrace that the police Domestic Violence Unit received a report at 9:15pm on June 9, from the man’s ex-partner, who is also the mother of his child.
 The couple are in the midst of ongoing family court proceedings, in connection with which a protection order had been issued. 
 Inspector Cauchi explained that the defendant had tried to call the woman a number of times on Facebook messenger, writing that he wanted to speak to her about their son.
 When she failed to answer the calls and messages, the man had phoned her up, using an unknown phone number.
 When the woman answered the call and realised it was the defendant, she had handed the phone to her 3-year-old son, who put the call on loudspeaker. The man told the boy “Aw qalbi, ħsibta mhux ha twiegeb dik il-minfuħa ommok (Hi my love, I thought your pompous mother wasn’t going to pick up the phone),” the court was told.
 Lawyer Lennox Vella, assisting the man as defence counsel, pointed out to the court that his client had been speaking to his son, but the issue most troubling to the magistrate was that the phone belonged to the mother and that the call appeared to be a breach of the protection order.
  
 A not guilty plea was entered, and bail was requested. “There are ongoing proceedings before the Family Court,” explained the lawyer. “A father must be able to speak to his son and the existence of a protection order does not impede this. Family proceedings should not be used as a weapon.”
 The lawyer argued that when the woman had wanted to travel abroad, she had found no problem in leaving the boy with his father.
 But the court said the protection order was “very clear,” in that he cannot initiate communication with her.“Whatever the situation, it’s her discretion. No communication. Nothing, zero, zilch.”
 “How else can he speak to his three-year-old son?” asked the lawyer. The magistrate said that it was not clear at this stage who was baiting whom, but the law was clear on the matter on communication.
 Vella submitted that the defendant is a gainfully employed builder, with no substance or alcohol abuse problems and satisfied all the legal requirements for bail. “He has clients waiting for his work. We know what she is going to testify, that she heard him say “dik il-minfuha ommok.”
 “She reported him to the police for saying half a word, can you imagine what she’d do if he approached her? She’d go straight to the Domestic Violence Unit,” argued the lawyer.
 The prosecution pointed out that the man had a criminal record that was five pages long.
 The court denied bail at this stage.  "

https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/131602/bodycam_footage_of_amrun_assault_on_police_officers_played_in_court,"Five individuals, including two restaurant owners, returned to court on Monday, as their compilation of evidence over an assault on police officers during a brawl in Ħamrun continued before Magistrate Monica Vella.
 The accused, four men and one woman, all Maltese nationals, are all pleading not guilty to charges, which included assaulting the officers and causing bodily harm. They had been denied bail upon arraignment after concerns about evidence tampering were raised.
  The defendants accused were identified as 46-year-old restaurant owner Elton Anthony Borg, 44-year-old Kurt Borg, also a restaurant owner, both from Ħamrun; 42-year-old Erica Borg, a housewife from Msida; 23-year-old Redeimen Aquilina from Ħamrun; and 33-year-old Christian Mansueto from Siġġiewi. During their arraignment two weeks ago before Magistrate Joseph Gatt, all five defendants pleaded not guilty and requested bail, which was refused at that stagecontested by the prosecution.
 Inspector Elisia Scicluna testified during Monday’s hearing and recalled the entire ordeal as it unfolded. The defence lawyers kept challenging her, resulting in her testimony lasting more than three hours.
 The altercation began when two officers approached a group that included the accused while issuing parking fines on Triq il-Kbira, San Ġużepp, in Ħamrun. According to Inspector Scicluna, the defendants were ""agitated and arrogant"" when confronted by the police. 
 She testified that Elton Borg grabbed one of the officers by the hand, and when ordered to stop, he stepped on the officer’s foot. When police attempted to separate the individuals, both Kurt and Elton Borg resisted violently, prompting the officers to try to arrest them to control the situation.
 The situation escalated quickly as more individuals arrived at the scene, with the crowd becoming increasingly hostile towards the officers. Police used a taser and pepper spray to regain control while ordering the crowd to disperse.
 Defence lawyer Franco Debono questioned the validity of the arrest and the way the defendants were treated by the police. He argued that the accused had not been properly informed of their rights at the time of their arrest, suggesting a potential procedural irregularity. The defence also requested that the court declare the arrest illegal due to this alleged failure to respect the defendants' rights.
 Footage from a police bodycam was played presented in court, showing the initial altercation and the events that followed. During the cross-examination, Debono questioned the timing of the activation of the police bodycam and the language used by officers during the confrontation. At one point, the footage captured a police officer making a derogatory comment (“Kemm int avukat tajjeb ostja”) towards Elton Borg, with Debono arguing that such language could have escalated tensions unnecessarily.
 Despite defence objections, the court proceeded with the case, noting that evidence had been presented in accordance with legal procedures. The defence requested the court to investigate the officers' conduct further, especially regarding whether appropriate arrest procedures and behaviour standards were maintained.
 The prosecution stood by the validity of the arrests, arguing that, quoting Blackstone, all appropriate procedures had been followed. They stated that while the behaviour of certain individuals involved in law enforcement could be scrutinised, this did not justify the defendants’ violent response against the officers, as they stated that words or phrases can never justify violence as a response.
 The case is ongoing.
 Elton and Kurt Borg were assisted by lawyers Matthew Xuereb and Alex Scerri Herrera; Erica Borg, 42, was assisted by Arthur Azzopardi and Jacob Magri; Redeimen Aquilina was assisted by lawyer Mario Mifsud and Nicholas Mifsud; Christian Mansueto was assisted by lawyers Franco Debono and Charles Mercieca.

https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/130738/social_media_video_of_thief_breaking_into_car_leads_to_mans_arrest_,"A video circulated on social media, showing a man breaking into a parked car, has led to the arrest of a man suspected of multiple thefts.
 Police inspectors Antonello Magri, Kurt Farrugia, and Keith Rizzo, assisted by prosecutor Brendan Hewer, arraigned 46-year-old Stephen Urry before magistrate Marseanne Farrugia on Wednesday.
  Inspector Farrugia told the court that while investigating a theft from a car in Paola, the police had obtained footage which showed the car being broken into.
 That footage had also been circulated by third parties on social media, he said. When a third party informed the police that a man wearing the same outfit as the person on the video was currently in Triq il-Gdida, Paola, officers had immediately gone to speak to him.
 The officers confirmed that the man, Urry, was indeed wearing the same clothes as the person in the footage and took him in for questioning. It emerged from the investigation that the same suspect had likely been involved in other aggravated thefts of wallets, keys, sunglasses, electronics, and cash over the past three months, in Paola, Fgura, and Tarxien.
 Urry, who told the court he was homeless, claimed to have been boarded out on mental health grounds when asked what he did for a living.
 He pleaded not guilty to four counts of aggravated theft and criminal damage, as well as a charge of recidivism and breaching bail.
 Legal aid defence lawyer Maria Karlsson, who was appointed to assist the defendant, did not request bail.  "

 Swiss companies Accutor AG, Spring Healthcare Services AG and their legal representatives, Wasay Attaoul Bhatti, 39, Kamal Sharma, 38, Lujo Mikulicic, 39, Tyrone Robert Kirkwood Greenshields, Hamid Chaudry, Ahmed Ibtesam, were meant to be charged with aiding and abetting the bribery of former Prime Minister Joseph Muscat while he was in Office, as well as his Chief of Staff Keith Schembri and Minister Konrad Mizzi. 
  A number of other charges relating to money laundering, criminal conspiracy, and aiding and abetting Muscat, Mizzi, Schembri, Shaukat Ali, Asad Shaukat Ali, Wajid Shaukat Ali and Ram Tumuluri to commit the crime of trading in influence were also filed.
 Only Bhatti and the companies he represents: Accutor and Spring Healthcare Services appeared in court before magistrate Leonard Caurana today; however. 
 The prosecution explained that they had been unable to serve the summons on the other defendants. 
 Sri Ram Tumuluri was supposed to be amongst the defendants being charged today, but had also proved difficult to serve with a summons, the court was told. Similar explanations were given with regards to the absence of Tamal Sharma and Tyrone Greenshields 
 Sharma had been mentioned in the magisterial inquiry as having heard a third party say that Muscat was being paid millions every year for the concession of the three public hospitals to Vitals Global Healthcare.
 Bhatti, Accutor and Spring Healthcare entered not guilty pleas to the charges against them.
 The prosecutors alleged that Bhatti had helped facilitate the payments of bribes to Muscat, Mizzi and Schembri, and that he had assisted Shaukat Ali and Sri Ram Tumuluri in their negotiations.
 Prosecutors requested a €9 million freezing order over Bhatti’s assets.
 Italian businessman Giusepe Domizio Musarella, 59, was also arraigned in court today, accused of money laundering, fraud and making false declarations to a public authority. Prosecutors say he purchased a Cyclotron through Mtrace, a company that had just been set up, and which was subsequently sold to Vitals.
 Musarella pleaded not guilty, his lawyers arguing that he was a legitimate businessman who had been dragged into the sordid deal. Lawyers Shazoo Ghaznavi and Jessica Formosa assisted Wasay Attaoul Bhatti. Lawyer Veronique Dalli appeared for Musarella.

https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/130999/massage_therapist_gives_court_harrowing_account_of_her_rape_at_the_hands_of_a_client,"A Thai massage therapist gave a court a harrowing account of her brutal sexual assault and rape at the hands of a male client, who hit her in the head and knocked her to the floor, before tying her up and raping her.
 Magistrate Kevan Azzopardi heard the testimony of one of three alleged victims of Harona Conateh, who was arraigned last month. 
  The 32-year-old Gambian man stands charged with three counts of rape, targeting employees at three different massage parlours in Sliema and Birkirkara in June and July. 
 The names of the alleged victims are being withheld from publication, in line with a court order to that effect.
 First to testify was a court expert who was appointed by the inquiring magistrate to download and analyse CCTV footage from several places.
 CCTV footage from some cameras in the area had already been overwritten, he said, but one of the cameras from which footage was successfully extracted, clearly shows a person entering the premises at 2:30pm June 22, wearing a bright coloured hat “that was probably yellow”, bermuda jeans and striped shirt. A person with the exact same outfit is then captured on camera leaving the premises at 2:40pm.
 Victim testifies
 One of the man’s three alleged victims, a Thai woman, testified on Monday, telling the court that a tall, black man had gone to the massage parlour where she had been working on 3 July and rang the doorbell.
 He was wearing a dark-coloured polo shirt with a print, a yellow beanie hat and bermuda shorts, she said, confirming that it had been the first time that she had seen the man.
 When she answered the door, he had asked whether he could have a massage. The witness had replied that she had another client appointment at 5:00pm and which only left had a 30 minute slot for him. “He spoke English with a strong accent and was using gestures to communicate,” said the witness. 
 Prosecutor Angele Vella asked the witness what services she had offered the man. “Massage,” replied the woman, adding that after she had handed him a brochure listing the various types of massage on offer after telling him the price. The man had pointed to a 90-minute massage, and it had to be explained to him that this was not possible as the masseuse only had half an hour. She said she could offer a 30-minute Thai back and shoulders massage with oil. “He said Ok. 30 minutes ok,”  and then handed over the amount in cash. 
 But things started to go south then, inside the massage room, the man had asked her to “massage his nipples”, she recalled. When she declined, he reacted violently, knocking her glasses off her head, grabbing her by the wrist and throwing her to the floor, where he then proceeded to sexually assault her with his hand, ignoring her screams, kicks and pleas for mercy.
 She said that the man had then tied her hands together with a rope. Realising that the man was too strong for her to resist, she said she had attempted to buy some time by telling him that if he untied her, she would give him what he wanted.
 The woman was untied and allowed to stand up for some air, before the man once again told her to touch his chest. She tried to change the subject, asking him about his family in the hope of eliciting a sympathetic response. 
 But the ruse didn’t work. The man suddenly pushed her face down on the ground and raped her, she said. When he was finished, he walked to the door, telling her, “next time don’t do this to me.”
 The court was told that the woman had suffered bruises and injuries to her ribs. A gynaecological examination confirmed that the woman had also suffered internal vaginal injuries.
 She said that she was suffering from depression as a result of the incident.
 The witness described her aggressor as wearing a dark t-shirt and a yellow hat, a description that matched the CCTV expert’s observations.
 The sitting was adjourned to 17 September at 2:00pm.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/association-explains-wheelchairbound-teen-now-allowed-handball-team.1101648,"The Malta Handball Association insisted Wednesday that a wheelchair-bound teenager has been barred from playing for a local team because participation in such a full contact sport would put him in clear danger.
 The Association was replying to a judicial letter where the parents of 16-year old Thomas Mifsud last week claimed discrimination.
 Mifsud, an athlete with spina bifida, had started training at a handball club alongside his friends and sought a spot as reserve goalkeeper on the team. But he was subsequently informed that he could not be registered as a player in the league since he used a wheelchair.
 
 After bringing the matter to public attention, Thomas’s parents filed a judicial protest against the MHA and its committee members arguing that their son was being discriminated against and that his wheelchair did not pose any health or safety risks.
 His condition was well-accepted by his teammates, they said.
 The MHA rebutted the claims by the teen’s parents and insisted that handball was a “full contact sport” which exposed players to risk of injury.
 The rules of the game precluded and prohibited the use of any “hard objects,” during play precisely to reduce such risk of grievous injuries.
 Wheelchair use could trigger serious injuries not only for the wheelchair user but also for fellow players.
 The International Handball Federation, which laid down the rules of the sport on a global level, shared the same view, argued the MHA.
 A wheelchair was considered to be “a dangerous object” by the international regulatory body which had in fact observed that “using a wheelchair in indoor handball violates the IHF Regulations on Protective Equipment and Accessories and by association the IHF rules for indoor handball.”
 That meant that the parents’ claim that wheelchair use was permissible during the competitive sport was “totally incorrect,” said the MHA.
 Also contrary to what Mifsud’s parents claimed, there was close contact between outfield players and the goalkeeper during a match. That meant that a wheelchair-bound goalkeeper placed all other players at risk of injury.
 The association also noted that it recently got to know through media reports that the teen also had a medical condition known as “brittle bone disease.”
 Players with such a condition would be putting themselves in 'clear and manifest danger' were they to engage in full contact sport as they could be easily injured through a fall, contact with another player or even if hit by a ball.
 The association said such personal danger was “not acceptable” to it since it was responsible for athletes’ safety.
 The fact that this health issue had not been disclosed to the association further aggravated the problem, said the MHA.
 The association called upon the parents to desist from any further frivolous action, warning that they would be held responsible for damages if they persisted.
 Lawyers Stefano Filletti and Maurice Meli signed the judicial letter.

 Paul Borg, of Ħaż-Żebbuġ, was convicted by a jury of attempting to kill Mario Grech in 2020, and of causing him grievous bodily harm in an earlier incident which took place a year before.

 The jury reached an 8-1 vote on the charge of attempted murder and returned a guilty verdict on every charge other than that of causing wilful damage to third-party property.

 Sentencing will take place on Thursday following submissions by lawyers on the appropriate punishment to be handed down.

 During proceedings, the Court heard how, four years ago, the accused spotted Grech working on a property belonging to Grech’s son, and subsequently threw two brick tiles towards his direction.

 It was confirmed by expert testimony that the force of the impact would have killed Mario Grech had he not swiftly avoided the bricks.

 In the year preceding the incident, the accused had also assaulted Grech with a broomstick.

 The trial is presided over by MadamJustice Consuelo Scerri Herrera.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/courts-order-suspension-industrial-action-law-courts.1101671,"Industrial action at the law courts was stopped - at least temporarily - on the strength of a warrant of prohibitory injunction that forced trade unions to cease directives. 
 The suspension was announced in a Facebook post issued by the Court Services Agency that runs the law courts.
 On Tuesday, several magistrates and judges had to postpone court sittings as court registrars, messengers and other staff did not carry out key tasks as part of industrial action.
 The industrial action left some judges and magistrates without a court registrar - the person who assists with several tasks, including the registration of sitting minutes. Court staff was also instructed not to record sittings.
  The industrial action was ordered by two trade unions that are fighting for recognition of staff at the law courts ahead of the lapse of the current collective agreement at the end of the year.
 The dispute revolves around a decision taken by the Department for Industrial and Employment Relations that informed the GWU that its request for representation cannot be upheld, as the deadline for such requests had lapsed.
 According to trade union law, recognition cannot be sought within three months before the elapse of a collective agreement.
 But Kevin Camilleri, GWU deputy general secretary, said that the union had first filed for recognition in October 2023.
 The directives the GWU ordered include not replacing employees on vacation or sick leave and prohibiting assistant registrars from sending replacements.
 The UĦM has issued similar instructions to its members.
 The Court Services Agency filed a request asking the court to issue a warrant or prohibitory injunction to stop the industrial action. The request was temporarily upheld.
 The unions have 10 days to reply and a final decision will be taken within 30 days.
 Meanwhile, Camilleri said the GWU reserved the right to take further legal action to ensure its rights – and those of the workers – were safeguarded.

 Prosecuting inspector Karl Roberts explained how letterboxes were fixed to residences so that collection letters linked to those permits could be posted at those addresses.
 Information gathered in the course of the investigation led police to Attard who was targeted by an arrest warrant.
 On Thursday, he was charged with making false declarations in a public document for personal gains, document fraud, assisting third-country nationals to enter Malta in breach of immigration laws as well as false statements in breach of immigration laws.
 The accused pleaded guilty.
 He confirmed his admission after being warned by the court that he faced a possible jail term or fine.
 The hearing was temporarily suspended to allow the accused time to consult his lawyer.
 When making submissions on punishment the prosecution pointed out that the accused had cooperated. He acted as an accomplice when fixing letterboxes in Msida and Santa Venera.
 The prosecution agreed with the defence’s suggestion of a suspended sentence as an adequate punishment.
 After hearing submissions Magistrate Nadine Sant Lia declared the accused guilty and condemned him to a two-year jail term suspended for four years.
 Inspector Karl Roberts prosecuted.
 Lawyer Martin Farrugia was legal aid counsel.

https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/130626/nepalese_man_reveals_4000_payment_for_fake_maltese_work_permit,"A man from Nepal has testified to having paid €4,000 in order to apply for a work permit in Malta on the basis of a fake employment contract that was allegedly forged by a former government IT agency employee.
 The compilation of evidence against Andre D’Amato from Mosta, an ICT professional and company director who was formerly employed by government IT agency MITA, continued before magistrate Leonard Caruana on Wednesday.  D’Amato is accused of human trafficking, money laundering, computer misuse, forgery of official documents, using forged documents, fraud, and making false declarations to public authorities.
  Between 2018 and May this year, when the crimes are alleged to have taken place, D’Amato had been employed by MITA.  He was appointed as Malta’s non-resident ambassador to Cuba last year.
 Testifying today was Magar Dil Bahadur from Nepal. He told the court that before travelling to Malta he had sent €4,000 to a Malta-resident Nepalese friend of his in order to obtain a Maltese work permit.
 The prosecution is claiming that the friend then passed the money on to D’Amato in order for him to apply for the work permit, apparently on behalf of his clients, amongst them a San Gwann-based company named KSL.
 But the director of the company cited as Bahadur’s employer on a contract that was submitted with the work permit application had testified in an earlier sitting, telling the court that he had never heard of Bahadur and that the contract  had been forged, together with his signature, on a letterhead featuring the company’s logo, which had apparently been downloaded from its official website.
 KSL’s director had smelled a rat when Bahadur, whom he had never seen before, appeared one day at the company offices asking him to sign a form to confirm a change in Bahadur’s employer.
 Bahadur told the court that when he had gone to the company’s offices, he was informed that KSL had not filed the original application for Bahadur’s work permit, and that the documents and signatures had been faked.
 KSL’s director had then filed a police report, informing the authorities that the application had been filed without the company’s knowledge, using forged documents.
 Police investigators found that the fake contracts had been submitted to the government agency Identita’ as part of Bahadur’s residence application. It had emerged during the investigation that the application had been filed online using D’Amato’s e-ID, the user’s identity having also been confirmed through 2-factor authentication.
 Bahadur confirmed in court that he had not worked for KSL, adding that when he had gone to the company’s office in San Gwann, he was told that the documents he was asking them to sign were not genuine.
 Cross-examined by Franco Debono, who is assisting D’Amato together with lawyer Alfred Abela, the witness said he had never met the accused and didn’t know him. “I just spoke over the phone once. When I went to KSL once, the police arrested me.”
 Abela made submissions on the prosecution’s request for a full download of the data on D’Amato’s electronic devices, arguing that he had objected to a full download at the first sitting. “If the charges relate to these particular people it is purely a fishing expedition to download everything,” said the lawyer.
 “In order to investigate or carry out a search on a person, I need to have reasonable suspicion. More so before downloading all this man’s data in the hope of maybe finding something. It is not in keeping with the spirit of the law.”
 Debono argued that there was “a lack of control over the environment in which the extractions are performed, how and where the extracted data is stored and so on.”
 Private conversations with third parties unrelated to this issue should not end up in evidence, argued the lawyer.
 The prosecution rebutted the argument, as the defence would have the opportunity to put these questions to the expert who performs the extractions on witness stand, but could not do so pre-emptively.
 Debono suggested that the IT experts involved “were not accredited” to do so and cited a case where the court had ordered that the entire extraction process be documented on video, but Inspector Roberts was having none of it.
 “In the past, it used to be the police’s Cybercrime Unit that would carry out extractions. After this practice was challenged, today that duty is carried out by court-appointed experts. Are we now saying that this is also wrong? We might as well stop carrying out extractions then.”
 Magistrate Leonard Caruana announced that he will issue a decree on the matter from chambers, before adjourning the case to September.

 The Sunday Times of Malta publishes an exposé of the inquiry into the deal to privatise the three state hospitals. When investigators combed through the details of the deal, they found signs of crime wherever they looked.
 The newspaper also reports that two fugitives found in Libya this week were hiding out in a large villa in a mountainous town, after narrowly evading capture in Italy.
 The Malta Independent on Sunday meanwhile leads with comments by PN MP and former party leader Adrian Delia's comments that Robert Abela's statements about the Vitals' inquiry verged on the despotic.
 The newspaper also reports that the government is offering a one-time €3,000 payment to AFM personnel over past injustices.
 Malta Today and  Illum lead with news about the inquiry findings, which the former published online on Sunday.
 They separately report that the PL has widened its lead among voters ahead of the election on June 8.
 It-Torċa reports on a separate survey whose results show a 10.7% gap between the two parties.
 The newspaper also reports on the positive impact of the Stabbilta' scheme.
 Kullħadd meanwhile refers to Moody’s latest report, which on Saturday noted that Malta’s trend of strong economic growth, coupled with a strong domestic funding base and “moderate” debt burden were fuelling a reasonably diversified economy with a “sound” institutional framework.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/birkirkara-council-fresh-legal-action-eyesore-telecom-cables.1097275,"The Birkirkara local council has again sounded the alarm on the dangers posed by overhanging telecom cables despite its legal warnings last year. 
 In fresh filings, the council has said it is ""disillusioned"" by a lack of action from the authorities, despite it filing two judicial letters against Enemalta and Epic. 
 The issue revolves around the installation of overhead fibre optic cables in the locality by communications company Epic which are not only an eyesore but are also posing a danger to the public.
 Rather than invest in underground installation, as other service providers have done, Epic has been attaching these cables to electricity poles belonging to Enemalta, some of which are old and rusty.
  Cabinets housing cable-splitting devices are also affixed to the facades of private residences, triggering constant reports by residents about the inconvenience as well as damage caused to their property.
 The issue prompted the local council to take legal action.
 Last August, the council filed two judicial letters in court against Epic and Enemalta, calling for immediate remedial action to eliminate the danger by shifting its installation underground.
 
 The council reserved its right to seek further legal action whilst holding the service provider and Enemalta responsible for damages. All relative authorities, including the Energy Minister, were served notice of those judicial acts.  
 But one year down the line, the problem persists.
 This week, the local council filed a judicial protest in the First Hall, Civil Court against Epic and Enemalta, this time also roping in Malta Communications Authority.
 While overhead installation continues, concerned residents continue to lodge complaints at the council offices saying that contractors carrying out the works refuse to install the infrastructure underground.
 These contractors insist that they are bound by “strict and short timelines” and must carry out the works “as quickly as possible.”
  In May 2017, then-Prime Minister Joseph Muscat had announced a pilot project in Birkirkara aimed at removing the unsightly cables and investing instead in underground installation.
 That project never materialized.
 And the matter is not only one of aesthetics. Since cables are being attached to electricity poles which are old and rusty, the situation poses serious risks.
 The council listed various streets, including several located in the Old Church, Infetti and Fleur de Lys areas, where cables were attached to poles of dubious load-bearing capacity.
 The council did not know whether Enemalta and the relative ministry were carrying out inspections to determine whether such poles were sufficiently sound and secure to bear all that infrastructure.
 
 The competent and regulatory authorities have taken “no corrective and investigative action” in spite of the its legal warnings last year, said the “disillusioned” council.
 Its calls for necessary remedial works to avert any lurking danger and to invest in underground infrastructure appear to have gone unheeded.
 “Nothing has been done,” said the council repeating its warnings whilst holding Epic, Enemalta and MCA responsible for damages suffered by residents.
 The council also issued notification of the judicial protest to Energy Minister Miriam Dalli.
 Lawyer Richard Sladden signed the act.

 Ivorian national Mouhamadou Dosso, 32, who holds an Italian identity card, was escorted to court on Friday to face multiple terrorism-related charges.
 The man was arrested in the very early hours of Thursday morning following weeks of surveillance and analysis of intelligence surrounding the property on Triq Giovanni Barbara.
 The raid stemmed from information received by the police anti-terrorism unit. 
 Officers surrounded two adjacent properties where in the subsequent search they seized electronic devices. 
 Examination of those devices allegedly yielded data linked to the dissemination of extremist material. 
 Facebook Messenger chats involving the suspect appeared to indicate that Dosso was encouraging third parties to travel to France to carry out suicide bomb attacks. 
 Upon arraignment, he pleaded not guilty to various terrorist offences, including knowingly instigating terrorist acts and participating in an organisation to promote some political object by the use or display of physical force. 
 His legal aid lawyer, Victor Bugeja, did not request bail at the arraignment stage and the court, presided over by Magistrate Noel Bartolo, remanded the defendant in custody.

https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/132363/maltese_hackers_extradition_case_reheard_after_legal_amendment,"Daniel Meli, 27, has been remanded in custody after being charged with selling hacking tools and training criminals in their use, with US authorities seeking his extradition.

 After initially consenting to extradition, he had appealed, claiming he was not of sound mind. A newly amended law prompted a rehearing, which resulted in Meli being remanded in custody.

                     He was arrested in Malta on 7 February 2024 for allegedly selling and training criminals in the use of Warzone, a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) software that bypasses security systems and remotely accesses computers without the victims’ knowledge.

 In February 2022, Meli had sold a RAT for $180 in Bitcoin to an FBI online covert employee from Georgia. From then onwards, the FBI tracked his operations, one of several in a global anti-cybercrime investigation that spread as far as Australia.

 The charges Meli would face in the US are conspiracy, obtaining unauthorised access to protected computers to obtain information, illegally selling an interception device, and illegally advertising an interception device, each provide for a sentence of up to five years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of $250,000, or twice the gross gain or loss, whichever is greater. 

 The charge of causing unauthorised damage to protected computers provides for a sentence of up to 10 years in prison, three years of supervised release, and a fine of $250,000, or twice the gross gain or loss, whichever is greater.

 After a legal amendment approved unanimously by parliament allowing lawyers for Meli to appeal proceedings despite him first consenting to the extradition. Meli’s case  was to be reheard in the lower courts.

 On 19 November 2024, Lawyer Franco Debono, part of the defence counsel, stated that the accused has ties within the community, and referenced to accused’s mother and father who were present in Court. Debono dismissed fears over the tampering of evidence.

 The prosecution mentioned how the acts that the accused committed carry hefty penalties. At this state, the prosecution objected to the accused’s bail.

 Lawyer Arthur Azzopardi counter-argued disagreed with the prosecution, asking, “Where are the fears of the tampering of evidence?” He further mentioned the ties Meli has with the community.

 The Court, presided by Magistrate Leonard Caruana, declined the defence’s request for the release of Meli from his arrest, and thus Meli was remanded in custody.

 This is an ongoing case.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/degiorgio-brothers-refuse-answer-questions-case-yorgen-fenech.1092961,"George and Alfred Degiorgio on Friday refused to answer questions about Daphne Caruana Galizia’s murder, saying the questions came years too late.
 The self-admitted hitmen are serving 40-year jail sentences for having placed and detonated the bomb that killed the journalist in 2017. A third hitman,  Vince Muscat, is serving a 15-year sentence after turning state witness.
 Since they pleaded guilty in 2022, the Degiorgio brothers have unsuccessfully sought to  reverse that decision, saying they were forced to admit to the crime after  their lawyer quit the case weeks before it went to trial.
 When they appeared in court on Friday, they made it clear they would only answer questions about Fenech. 
 The Degiorgios were testifying in the compilation of evidence against Yorgen Fenech, who is alleged to have masterminded the assassination. He is pleading not guilty.
 George and then Alfred told the court they would only answer questions about Fenech, despite the court’s instructions for them to testify about Caruana Galizia’s murder more broadly.  
 At the end of an otherwise non-eventful court session, George Degiorgio angrily told the court that if the prosecution had been interested in the answers seven years ago, “that man [Yorgen Fenech] would likely not be here today!”
 His brother Alfred told the court that he could still incriminate himself if he answered questions about the murder, “because there are things which did not emerge in the investigation. And they can charge me with those matters related to this murder,” he said.
 Both men insisted they had never heard of Fenech before he was arraigned and charged with complicity in Caruana Galizia’s murder in late 2019.
 A pardon given to Melvin Theuma was “based on lies”, he said. But when asked to explain why, the witness would give no further information.
 Theuma has admitted to serving as the middleman between Fenech and the Degiorgio brothers.
 Alfred Degiorgio refused to answer prosecutors’ questions and the magistrate ended his testimony by decreeing that he was to be re-arrested and charged with disobeying a court order.
 His brother’s testimony went a similar way.
 George Degiorgio reacted angrily to questions by lead prosecutor Keith Arnaud, saying Arnaud – who served as the case’s lead investigator – should have asked him those questions years ago, under interrogation.
 “The inspector [Arnaud] was duty bound to put all these questions to me during my interrogation. But no! That interrogation lasted only a quarter of an hour,” Degiorgio ranted.
 “They [investigators] had no interest in knowing where the bomb came from. Nothing! Had they been interested, I think that that man would not be here today,” George said heatedly, gesturing towards Fenech in the dock.
 Magistrate Montebello warned the witness that he was to answer questions. He did not, and the magistrate subsequently ordered his re-arrest and arraignment within 48 hours.
 Meanwhile, Fenech’s case continues in June.
 AG lawyers Anthony Vella, Godwin Cini and Danika Vella prosecuted together with Assistant Commissioner Keith Arnaud and Inspector Kurt Zahra.
 Lawyers Charles Mercieca and Marion Camilleri were defence counsel.
 Lawyer Jason Azzopardi appeared parte civile.
 Within hours of the court's order, the two brothers were charged before the duty magistrate with refusing to testify. 
 Prosecuting inspector Wayne Camilleri gave a brief overview of the events leading up to the brothers' arraignment. 
 This was the second time they were facing identical charges over the murder case. 
 ""Only the date is different,"" said the prosecutor. 
 But the defence immediately pointed out that this time they were contesting the validity of the arrest. 
 The Degiorgios began to testify but the way the prosecution was putting questions could lead to self-incrimination. 
 ""The court itself pointed out that questions were leading or suggestive,"" said defence lawyer Noel Bianco. 
 Quoting the article of law allegedly breached, defence lawyer Leslie Cuschieri argued that the witnesses did begin to testify, unlike the previous occasion. 
 Moreover, how could they be re-arrested over the same charge when they were already previously charged, argued the lawyer. 
 However, after hearing submissions Magistrate Abigail Critien declared that the arrest was valid. 
 The accused pleaded not guilty and were remanded in custody.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/almost-10300-domestic-violence-charges-issued-31-months.1097024,"The Police Gender-Based and Domestic Violence Unit issued close to 10,300 charges over the past 31 months, police commissioner Angelo Gafà told a joint session of the social affairs and family affairs parliamentary committees.
 The committees discussed domestic violence and the improvements that can be made to prevent femicides and crimes against women.
 Gafa’ said that reports filed by victims have been increasing year on year since 2020.  (2020: +24 per cent;  2021: +6 per cent;  2022: +5 per cent; 2023: +13 per cent)
 By the end of July 2024, reports had increased by another 12 per cent.
 Commissioner Gafà said that over the past seven months, 63 per cent of the domestic violence reports involved partners residing in the south of Malta.
 While in 2019, a quarter of the lodged reports involved psychological harm, over the past 18 months these had increased to three-fourths.
 Since changes to laws concerning domestic violence were enacted in 2023, 10 persons in intimate relationship have checked whether their partners have a history of domestic abuse.
 The right to check upon the history of partners, meant to safeguard potential victims, was introduced last year as parliament approved the Domestic Violence Prevention Bill.
 Gafà said that since its inception in October 2022, the GBDVU’s complement had increased by 200 per cent, from 20 to 60 police officers, all working on parallel shifts from the Santa Luċija hub and the Police Headquarters in Floriana.   
 Gafà said that these developments, including the application of a preliminary triage system to assess the risk for the victims, had reduced waiting time by half.
 He said that a domestic violence hub that was supposed to open in Mtarfa by the end of this year, is now set to open by June 2025.
 The joint-committee session was held eleven days after Nicolette Ghirxi became the latest femicide victim in Malta.
 While MPs were precluded from referring to specific high-profile domestic violence cases, police commissioner Gafà addressed criticism levelled at the force following Nicolette Ghirxi’s femicide.
 Ghirxi was stabbed to death by her former partner Edward Johnston.  The murder took place in the victim’s apartment in Swatar on Sunday 18th August.
 Later that night Johnston was shot by police following a three-hour standoff in St Julians after he pointed a weapon that later turned out to be a replica gun.
 Ghirxi had filed harassment reports in April 2024 after receiving messages from her former partner while he was abroad.  
 Johnston returned to Malta a few days before murdering his former partner.
 Gafà said that the Schengen system presents a number of challenges to law enforcement agencies because travellers can go in and out of member states at will with little chance of detection.
 The police commissioner called upon the judiciary to adopt a uniform approach and insist upon the victims to testify against their perpetrators.
 Gafà also confirmed that recordings of domestic violence incidents are admissable in court.During the joint-committee session, MPs raised issues mentioned by retired judge Geoffrey Valenzia into the femicide of Bernice Cassar.
 The inquiry had concluded that the state system failed Cassar because of a lack of resources and a heavy caseload.
 Police Commissioner Gafà said that the police corps had implemented 100 per cent of the recommendations in the Valenzia report bar the opening of the Mtarfa hub.
 On her part, Samantha Pace Gasan, Commissioner for Gender-Based Violence and Domestic Violence, said that 70 per cent of the recommendations have been implemented.
 Pace Gasan described risk assessments as a tool to prioritise victims that are considered high-risk.  
 While encouraging victims of domestic violence to take risk assessments, Pace Gasan said that women have a right to refuse it.
 This was mirrored in statements by FSWS CEO Alfred Grixti and his team who gave an overview of their work.  
 At the start of the session members of parliament observed a minute’s silence in honour of all femicide victims.

https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/131466/jason_azzopardi_guilty_of_libel_over_hsbc_heist_claims_about_carmelo_abela,"Updated at 11:47am with judgment details
 A court ordered Lawyer Jason Azzopardi to pay €7,000 in libel damages over his Facebook statement about former minister Carmelo Abela, in which Azzopardi had accused Abela of providing assistance to the robbers who had carried out the 2010 HSBC heist.
  The court condemned the irresponsible way in which the defendant proceeded, stating that instead of reporting to the competent authorities and exercising the expected diligence before publishing a specific imputation of fact regarding the complicity of the plaintiff in a major crime, he published his opinion regarding why he believed he was right to come to that conclusion.
 Although the statements were made with a rhetorical tone, and the defendant did not use the express words that Carmelo Abela was guilty of complicity in the crime of the HSBC bank hold-up, the inference generated in a manifest way from the publication, when read in its entirety, and which was easily understood by the ordinary reader without any stretch of the imagination, was that the accomplice to whom the imputed statements referred was none other than Carmelo Abela.
 The euphemistic and suggestive tone used by Azzopardi in his statements did not reduce anything from the defamatory imputation that arose from the defendant's statements regarding the plaintiff's complicity in the hold-up crime.
 Contrary to what was submitted by the defendant in the submissions note, the fact that the plaintiff did not take legal steps of any kind against George Degiorgio and/or Alfred Degiorgio in connection with the public statements they made regarding the involvement of persons, including the plaintiff himself, in the crime of the hold-up, and the fact that he did not deny their statements, did not mean that the impugned publication was not defamatory and did not reduce in any way the inference of serious damage to his reputation, caused by the publication.
 This was also stated because, from the evidence before the court, it appeared that the statements made by the Degiorgio brothers, where the plaintiff was expressly mentioned by name, were made after the defendant's publication on 9 April 2021, which was the subject of this action.
 Above all, Azzopardi did not dispute that the impugned statements referred to the plaintiff and did not deny that the plaintiff was identified as the person who in the same publication was said to have been an accomplice in the hold-up crime by, among other things, providing the agent with means to be used in the commission of the crime. His defense was based almost exclusively on justifying his view that the plaintiff was involved in the said crime.
 It was the view of the court that the defendant failed to satisfy the requirement indicated in the Media and Defamation Act by failing to indicate, even in general, the basis of his statement that the plaintiff was the accomplice who helped the thieves in the commission of the crime by providing means, including fake keys, and was going to be compensated for this complicity. Consequently, the defense could not succeed.
 The court reaffirmed that the right to freedom of expression could never be interpreted as giving protection to those who publish imputations capable of, or effectively destroying, an individual's reputation without making sure that there was a concrete and objectively recoverable factual basis for those imputations. In conclusion, the court was of the opinion that it should liquidate the sum of seven thousand euros (€7,000) as moral damages.
 Azzopardi made the allegation in a Facebook status he posted, which was a reaction to disparaging comments made by Abela on Azzopardi over an ethics investigation concerning the minister.
 “I am no saint... but better not to have been an accomplice in the HSBC hold-up,” Azzopardi said.
 Azzopardi claimed that Abela was promised €300,000 from the loot, accusing Abela of having been an accomplice of the HSBC heist’s mastermind by passing on internal footage of the HSBC headquarters and assisting them in accessing the building. Abela denied the claims.
 Abela had repeatedly denied the allegations which were first mooted by Vincent Muscat “Il-Koħħu”, who had claimed that a sitting minister had been an accomplice in the hold up. He also claimed that Carmelo Abela and Chris Cardona had “given instructions in order for the heist at HSBC’s Head Office to go ahead.”
 Shortly after, Abela had filed the defamation lawsuit, demanding that Nationalist MP Jason Azzopardi answer for his claims.
 In reaction to the court verdict, Abela uploaded a snippet of the court judgement to Facebook, and said “justice was served today”.
  Prime Minister Robert Abela also reacted to the verdict, saying there is no room for mudslinging in Maltese society.  
  Meanwhile, Jason Azzopardi said that he will appeal the court verdict and is ready to take the case to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.
  “The truth is immutable and immanent. The whole truth must come out,” he wrote.
 Lawyer Pawlu Lia assisted Abela, while Azzopardi was represented by Lawyer Zammit Maempel. The case was presided over by Magistrate Rachel Montebello.  "

https://timesofmalta.com/article/man-accused-stealing-30000-parents-home.1100312,"A man was remanded in custody on Wednesday after pleading not guilty to stealing €30,000 from a safe at his parents’ home.   Steve Frendo, 36, was charged with aggravated theft and wilful damage to his parents’ property.   The prosecution explained that on Sunday, St Julian’s police received a report about a suspected robbery. They were told that someone had entered a Pembroke residence between 1pm and 7pm and €30,000 in cash went missing from a safe.   There appeared to be no signs of break in. Only the safe was broken into.   The alleged victims, the defendant’s parents, suspected their son, claiming that he had robbed them before.  They also told police that he was currently jobless.   It resulted to the police that, Frendo had earlier called relatives to check if his parents were at home.  Mobile location data and CCTV footage showed that Frendo was at Pembroke around the time of the robbery and he was seen leaving his parents’ residence on the footage.  He was arrested at his partner’s residence in Gzira. A vest and shoes matching those on the CCTV were found during in the search. No cash was found, however, other than some €1000, possibly part of the stolen amount.   Frendo pleaded not guilty to aggravated theft and wilful damage to third party property.   His lawyers, Matthew Xuereb and Alex Scerri Herrera, requested bail and expressed doubts on the parents’ version of events.   Police Inspector Joseph Mercieca said that the money had apparently been handed to the defendant’s parents by his ex for safekeeping.  They were helping to raise his son and that money was meant for that purpose.  The defence doubted the existence of those funds, arguing that the third party who stepped in between the defendant and his parents, may have “inflated the amount.”   Magistrate Leonard Caruana, turned down the request for bail since the main civilian witnesses are still to testify.  The court deemed that the defendant could not offer the necessary guarantees in terms of law.  AG lawyer Miryea Mifsud prosecuted together with Inspectors Joseph Mercieca and Daryl Farr.

  Azzopardi also strongly rejected the allegation that he had tipped off Muscat about the plans to raid his house and offices, at the order of the inquiring magistrate.
 Press tipped off on Muscat raid by OPM – Jason Azzopardi
 The witness went on to say that it was the press who had been unofficially tipped off by the Office of the Prime Minister.
 He backed up the first claim by pointing to the fact that Abela had, in fact, returned to Malta from Strasbourg immediately that day, instead of travelling onwards to an event in Dubai as planned, he said. “This is all in the public domain,” Azzopardi added.
 “It was an outrageous lie for them to say that I had leaked the information about the searches in advance, because you’d have to be a simpleton to believe that… Robert Abela, the Prime Minister, lied to the public to incite anger against me,” said the witness. “I know that Robert Abela was aware and was made aware in advance of the date that Muscat’s house would be searched. A person had come to speak to me at my office, very worried, because the Commissioner of Police had told him so.”
 “I did not tell anyone about this, not even Repubblika or [Robert] Aquilina. I contacted [the court expert] because I did not have any means through which to contact the magistrate. I never spoke to her, for obvious reasons. But such a leak could not be allowed,” he said.
 Vince Galea interrupted, telling the court that the witness was supposed to answer questions. “What is he doing then?” replied the judge, initially overruling Galea’s objection.
 But when Azzopardi asked the court for permission to exhibit a news story published in January 2022, the lawyer interrupted again, arguing that a witness could not exhibit documents at the stage when the plaintiff was still asking him questions.
 The judge upheld that objection and told Azzopardi not to exhibit them for now.
 Asked by Galea as to how he knew the identity of the expert involved, the witness replied that after 30 years working in court it was reasonable to know who formed part of the small pool of court experts.
 “We were in the middle of a sitting of the compilation of evidence against the Degiorgio brothers for the murder of Daphne Caurana Galzia. They had called the expert to testify but he was not available and the court was told that he was unable to attend because he was engaged in another inquiry, that relating to the hospitals deal,” Azzopardi replied.
 When probed about the possibility of him having communicated with the expert before then, Azzopardi replied that “as far as this inquiry is concerned, it was the first time,” that he had spoken to him.
 Gouder asked the lawyer whether he had seen the inquiry before it was published by MaltaToday. “Absolutely not,” was Azzopardi’s categorical reply. “I never had visibility of it until the inquiry was made public by the press.”
 “But I am led to believe that the OPM had been given access to the inquiry which had been passed on to it by the Attorney General... I was not privy to it,” he added.
 He said a person employed at the OPM told him the Prime Minister had received a copy of the inquiry and this fact had also been made public by the Opposition.
 “My point is that the OPM should never have had a copy of this inquiry. Never.”
 Azzopardi rubbished the suggestion of impropriety on the part of magistrate Gabriella Vella. “Every lawyer who works here who knows the integrity and professionalism of the magistrate in question, I was confident that [the inquiry] would be carried out correctly.”
 Lawyer Vince Galea, who is assisting Muscat together with lawyer Charlon Gouder, pointed out that the individuals which Repubblika had indicated in their application were Chris Cardona, Edward Scicluna and Konrad Mizzi. “Joseph Muscat was not indicated,” said the lawyer.
 Once started, magisterial inquiries take on a life of their own, casting a wide net, replied the witness. “When filing an application for an inquiry you must have information that satisfies the requirements emerging from the law. At the time, there was information which had been published by Daphne Caruana Galizia, as well as The Shift News and the Times of Malta, which could reassure the court that there were sufficient grounds to justify an inquiry.”
 Azzopardi said that he had based the court application on news articles and investigative pieces which had been published in the months leading up to the application being filed. “Everything that, in my opinion, any magistrate worth his or her salt would want to know, I included,” he said.
 Azzopardi did not know identities of Vitals inquiry experts
 In reply to a question from Muscat’s lawyers, the witness said that he had not known the names or identities of the experts who had assisted in the inquiry and neither had he spoken to the inquiring magistrate’s staff. When he needed to correspond with the inquiry, he would do so in writing through the deputy he said.
 “Did you speak to the police?” asked Galea. “I would not speak to the police and I didn’t need to because the inquiry belongs to the magistrate, not the police,” shot back Azzopardi.
 Gouder asked Azzopardi about several cryptic Facebook posts which the Repubblika lawyer had published in April 2022, March, May, October 2023 and January and May 2024.
 “Thanks to investigative journalists at the Times, The Shift News and MaltaToday, and also foreign newspapers, new details were emerging… I used my right to freedom of expression and drew my conclusions from them,” Jason Azzopardi replied. “I am not infallible, but to say that I knowingly or through malice, published something which I knew not to be false, is not true “
 Gouder asked the lawyer about one particular post of his, published on 16 March 2023, which he said, appeared to indicate that Azzopardi was privy to certain aspects of the inquiry.
 “It would be reckless of me to say that I remember what was in my mind at the time [but]… I was morally convinced that the inquiry had sufficient reasons… to find wrongdoing.
 Gouder repeated his question about why four years after filing the application, Azzopardi had also started to mention Joseph Muscat in connection with the inquiry.
 “You are correct to point this out,” Azzopardi replied. “The reason is very simple: The post is from May 2023. In early November 2021… Robert Aquilina had held a press conference outside the Police HQ to announce that, on behalf of Repubblika, I had filed a report to the inquiring magistrate following a story carried by the Times of Malta about the consultancy fees - around €60,000 - which Joseph Muscat had received from Spring X Media and Accutor.
 When asked by Muscat’s lawyers as to why he had not gone to the inquiring magistrate on that occasion, Azzopardi explained that he had filed notes in the inquiry in his personal capacity, as well as filing the report on behalf of his client and repeated that he had not been exempted from professional secrecy.
 When probed about his apparent knowledge of an NAO report about the hospitals concession, prior to its publication, Azzopardi pointed to his 25 year career in Parliament, explaining that he still had long-standing relationships with people there.
 “You don’t need to be Sherlock Holmes to understand that the biggest fraud in this country’s history could not be carried out by just four people,” Azzopardi said in reply to a question from Gouder about his mention of ‘others’ as also potentially facing charges before the inquiry was concluded. “It was such a massive fraud that even people outside the country were involved.”
 Gouder also showed Azzopardi a press release by the NAO about part 3 of the report on the VGH concession, published in April 2023.
 “The probability is that when I said talk to me next month is that although I was no longer an MP… after just under 25 years in parliament, I would have known there are a number of reports in the pipeline. This information would have been provided to me by trusted individuals working in parliament. What is important
 Azzopardi refuses to reveal sources
 Azzopardi refused to comply with Gouder’s request to identify the individuals who had spoken to him. He explained that sometimes he would receive information volunteered by persons occupying State and official positions in his capacity as a lawyer, and was bound by professional secrecy towards them.
 The judge decreed that professional secrecy should be given a wide interpretation and was not necessarily limited to the case which it had been disclosed for. “Besides, the emphasis of the law is on the client’s consent. A lawyer bound by professional secrecy cannot even reveal whether or not a person is his client,” said the judge. “For this reason, it remains in the witness’ discretion to decide whether he is bound by professional secrecy and not reply to the questions.”
 The court asked Azzopardi whether he wished to reply. He declined.
 Cross-examined briefly by State Advocate lawyer James D’Agostino, Azzopardi denied having any direct communication with magistrate Gabriella Vella, or the Prime MInister for that matter, and confirmed that he had based his assertions on information that had been provided to him by others.
 The case continues.  "
https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/132711/murderer_has_sentence_reduced_from_42_years_to_35_years,"Elliot Paul Busuttil, who had been sentenced to a 42-year prison term and fined €70,000 after pleading guilty to the murder of Mario Farrugia and the attempted murder of Emil Vassilev Marinov, has had his prison time reduced by 7 years.

 Busuttil had initially been sentenced to a prison term of 42 years, notwithstanding an agreement between the prosecution and defence to recommend a 35-year term. Indeed, Madame Justice Consuelo Scerri Herrera noted that she was not bound by such a plea deal and could impose a lengthier sentence.

                     However, following an appeal, the Court of Appeal ordered the revision of the sentence.

 The prosecution and defence reaffirmed that Busuttil would plead guilty once more, as envisaged by the original agreement. Busuttil was subsequently sentenced to a 35-year imprisonment term.

 Additionally, Busuttil was found guilty of breaching conditions handed down on two separate occasions. This led to the confiscation of €5,000 and the forfeiture of two personal guarantees, each worth €10,000.

 Busuttil was also prohibited from approaching Marinov for a year.

 The case was presided over by Judge Neville Camilleri.

 Busuttil was represented by lawyers Edward Gatt and Shaun Zammit.

 Lawyers Arthur Azzopardi and Jacob Magri represented the Farrugia family, while lawyers Jason Azzopardi and Kris Busietta represented Marinov.     "

https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/129236/sicilian_man_arrested_in_malta_after_italian_authorities_issue_arrest_warrant,"A Sicilian man, wanted by the Italian authorities in connection with an investigation into organised crime and cocaine trafficking has appeared in court following his arrest in Malta.
 Gianluca Caruso, 32, had been living in Malta for seven years before his arrest and arraignment in court, Magistrate Joseph Gatt was told on Friday.
 The slightly-built defendant was accompanied in court by his partner, with whom, the court was told, he is expecting a child.
 Inspector Roderick Spiteri explained that the police had arrested Caruso at his workplace yesterday afternoon, on the strength of a European Arrest Warrant issued in his name by a court in Catania, Sicily.
  Exhibiting copies of the relevant documentation to the court, the inspector said that the Maltese Police Force’s forensics department had confirmed that the man’s fingerprints matched those of the requested person, which had been sent with the EAW.
 In 2020, Caruso had been convicted in absentia of offences relating to trafficking cocaine and marijuana, as well as forming part of a criminal organisation, for which he was sentenced to imprisonment for seven years and two months by the Catania Court of Appeal.
 After deducting the time spent in pre-trial custody, Caruso would be required to serve the remaining 6 years and 9 months in prison if returned to Sicily.
 According to Italian media reports, Caruso had turned himself in five years ago at the Vincenzo Bellini airport in Catania, during a law enforcement operation dubbed “Tricolore”  which had dismantled two drug dealing centres in the San Berillo Nuovo district of Catania  and led to some 40 arrests on suspicion of drug trafficking and dealing, charges which were deemed aggravated because they had been aimed at facilitating the Cappello-Bonaccorsi mafia family.
 He is understood to have subsequently travelled to Malta while on bail and is now requested by the Italian authorities in order to serve his sentence.
 Inspector Spiteri told the court that he had arrested Caruso after the police received an alert through the pan-European Schengen Information System (SIS) alert, a system which informs national police forces across the EU when a wanted person is believed to be in their country.
 The SIS alert had been sent after an European Arrest Warrant was issued requesting the man’s return to Sicily to serve a prison sentence.
 Defence lawyer Charles Mercieca argued that at the time of Caruso’s arrest, the police did not have a copy of the sentence upon which the EAW had been based which, he said, rendered the arrest illegal.
 The EAW stated that Caruso was wanted to serve a prison sentence, replied the inspector, adding that the police had been in constant communication with their overseas counterparts before arresting the man.
 Mercieca argued that Caruso’s sentence was not final, as the police did not have copies of a judgement conclusively confirming it, that would have been issued by the Italian court of third instance - the Court of Cassation.
 Lawyer Jacob Magri, added that without seeing the Cassation judgement, the defence could now know what Caruso was being requested for.
 Mercieca cited European case law, which established that a national arrest warrant or evidence of the sentence had to be exhibited in EAW cases.
 The applicable Framework Decision laid down criteria for enforceability of EAWs: evidence of a judgement or enforceable judicial decision, said the lawyer. “Decisions about the execution of the European arrest warrant must be subject to sufficient controls, which means that a judicial authority of the Member State where the requested person has been arrested will have to take the decision on his or her surrender.”
 Mercieca argued that from the inspector’s testimony, it emerged that the EAW and the arrest of Caruso were carried out on the basis of a judgement from the italian courts and a certificate issued by the Attorney General.
 “Nowhere does any enforceable sentence emerge from the documentation exhibited by the police and therefore one of the elements upon which the arrest was based is absent,” argued the lawyer.
 Evidence of an enforceable judgement, an arrest warrant in the requesting country or any other enforceable judicial decision having the same effect is a requisite for an arrest, said the lawyers.  In order to be executable an EAW requires an enforceable judgement imposing the punishment of imprisonment.
 Inspector Spiteri argued that the arrest had been made on the strength of a Schengen Information System alert, together with the EAW and a certificate issued by the Attorney General. The judgement that Caruso was being requested to return and serve could be requested by the magistrate as supplementary information, he said.
 After retiring to chambers to deliberate, the magistrate abstained from deciding about the validity of the arrest, as this would entail an examination of the merits of the case, which was not the function of his court today, adding that the defence could still raise its arguments before the court that would be deciding the case on the merits, by asking it to request any supplementary information necessary.
 The court then proceeded to ask Caruso whether he confirmed the details stated in the EAW were correct, which the man in the dock confirmed. He did not consent to his return to Sicily.
 The court expressed its concern at the absence of a representative from the AG in these proceedings, while stressing that this in no way was to be interpreted as a criticism of inspector Spiteri.
 Caruso was remanded in custody until the case continued before another magistrate in the coming days.  "
https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/131000/man_accused_of_stealing_motorcycle_intended_to_return_it_after_his_car_was_repaired,"A man accused of stealing a motorcycle had intended to return it after his own car was repaired, a court was told on Monday.
 This emerged as handyman Leon Lee Zammit, 24, from Mosta was arraigned under arrest before magistrate Nadia Helena Vella. Police inspector Jeffrey Scicluna and prosecutor Brendan Hewer charged Zammit with the aggravated theft of a motorcycle from Tarxien on 28 August, as well as breaching bail conditions he had been handed last December,  a probation order from 2022 and a suspended sentence from February last year. Zammit was also accused of recidivism.
  Inspector Scicluna explained that the Major Crimes Unit had been tasked with investigating the theft of a Kymco motorcycle that had been reported stolen from Tarxien. A tall, thin man was identified as the thief from CCTV footage.
 Zammit had spoken to officers who were conducting a routine patrol about an unrelated issue. During that conversation, the officers noticed that the registration plate on his motorcycle appeared to have been tampered with. After radioing the number plate to their command station, the officers received confirmation that the vehicle was stolen.
 During his subsequent arrest, Zammit was also noticed to be wearing the same outfit that he had worn while stealing the motorcycle.
 Zammit explained to the police that he had stolen the bike because his car was damaged and he still had to go out to work to feed his family. Inspector Scicluna added that Zammit told the police that he had intended to return the bike once he no longer needed it. 
 Lawyer Rachel Tua, defence counsel to Zammit, told the court that the defendant wished to plead not guilty. Bail was also requested.
 Prosecutor Brendan Hewer objected to bail, pointing out that the defendant was being charged with breaching bail, probation as well as a suspended sentence. “He has shown the value he gives to the chances that our courts have given him,” said the prosecutor, adding that the defendant knew at least one of the prosecution’s witnesses.
 “I’m sorry, but the facts are what they are. We can never be assured [that he will comply with his bail conditions] in this situation,” Hewer told the court.
 In her counter-arguments, Tua pointed out that the stolen item was already in the police’s possession, “so witnesses or no witnesses this cannot change, and neither can the CCTV footage.” 
  The court, however, in view of the charges and circumstances surrounding the case, ruled that the defendant was not sufficiently trustworthy to merit being granted bail and ordered that he be remanded in custody.  "

 Initial investigations by the police showed the two hunters ended up hitting each other after aiming for the same bird.
 A 36-year-old from Żabbar was rushed to Mater Dei Hospital, and his condition is not yet known to the police.
 The other hunter, who resides in Għargħur was taken to a nearby health centre for treatment.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/two-teenagers-charged-sex-underage-person.1094118,"Jake* had just turned 16 when he received a phone call informing him he was wanted at the police headquarters to be questioned about a crime he committed. When he eventually got there, clueless and accompanied by his suspicious father, he was told he was in trouble – for having sex when he was 15, with a girl who was one year younger than him.
 “I did not know I did something wrong. In fact, I could not think of a reason why the police would want to speak to me,” says Jake, now 17, sitting at the office of his lawyer accompanied by his father.
 A few days earlier, Jake and his ex-girlfriend, Jenny* were cleared of having sex with an underage person: each other. They were cleared after they chose not to testify against each other.
 Magistrate Abigail Critien, who presided over their case in the Juvenile Court, suggested considering lowering the age of consent from 16 to 14.
 If not, she said, the legislator should, at least, consider decriminalisation in cases where both underage minors of approximately the same age and same degree of maturity engage in consensual sex.
 Her calls were echoed by child ambassadors who agreed that Malta needs ‘Romeo and Juliet’ laws that decriminalise underage, consensual sex between close-in-age teens.
 Children’s Commissioner Antoinette Vassallo, the National Youth Council and the president of the Eurochild network, Marie-Louise Coleiro Preca agreed that dropping the age of consent from 16 to 14 is not the solution. They also agreed on the need to improve sex education in schools.
 Jake was 15 when he started dating Jenny who was a year younger than him at school. They went out for a few weeks during which time the couple had consensual sex. They eventually broke up. Jake turned 16 and, about two months later, he received the call from the police.
 “I was at work when they called. They told me I had to go to the police headquarters whenever I could. They did not tell me why. I imagined I was in a lot of trouble but could not think why. I knew I had done nothing wrong. So I called my father and told him what happened. He picked me up from work and we went to the headquarters,” Jake recounts.
 His dad explains that he was very worried at the time: “I got a big fright. I told him that if he did anything wrong he could tell me. He insisted he did not. He knew he did nothing wrong but I did not.”
 The father took his son to the headquarters in Floriana and braced himself.
 When they got there, police officers were “very nice”.
 “Then they asked me if I knew the girl,” Jake recalled. They told him that he had committed a crime by having sex with someone under 16.
 Jake adds that he did not know, till today, how the police got involved and believes something must have forced Jenny to speak out about having sex.
 He said that Jenny did not have a baby from their relationship, as was previously reported.
 When the father realised what this was all about, he could not believe it.
 “I told the police officer they should arrest all young people from the dawn of time. Once there was no rape and there was no age difference, they did nothing wrong in my eyes. These were two kids,” he said.
 Meanwhile, Jake could not believe this was happening. “Many of my friends my age have children and never ended up in court. It was also embarrassing that I had to talk about the subject with my parents,” he said.
 Jake and Jenny ended up in the Juvenile Court charged with having sex with an underage person.
 “In court, I was terrified. I was scared I’d be found guilty,” he said. The two appeared in court on two occasions. The second time was when the magistrate handed down judgment.
 “There were other young people present in the court room when she read out the judgment. I was worried as there were two of my friends there and I felt embarrassed,” he said, adding that he had no idea what was happening and only realised he was acquitted when the lawyer, David Gatt, explained it after the sitting was over.
 “It was a huge relief… It’s not fair that someone like me ends up in court,” he said agreeing that the law should be amended.
 His father agreed: “The law is there but it certainly is not enforced and people are certainly not aware of this.”
 The National Youth Council has spoken about the need for a comprehensive and intersectional sexual education programme to replace the current outdated one – the guidelines for which have not been updated since 2013.
 It has also spoken about the urgent need to update Malta’s sexual health policy.
 The outdated 2010 policy was originally meant to be released in 2021 but was sent back to the drawing board because the research it was based on was found to be years out of date. Its revision was further delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The health ministry said it will be launched for consultation by the end of 2024.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/driver-conditionally-discharged-unfortunate-incident-killed-wife.1097294,"An elderly driver accused of accidentally killing his wife while reversing his van in Buskett seven years ago was conditionally discharged on appeal since the victim had evidently contributed to the “truly unfortunate incident”.
 The now-78-year-old widower, whose name was subject to a publication ban, was spared the €2,000 fine inflicted as punishment by the first court, which had concluded that when reversing his Toyota van he had done so at excessive speed.
 That risky manoeuvre cost the life of his elderly wife who was meant to be assisting him by looking out for oncoming traffic while he reversed the vehicle out of a parking space under some trees onto Triq l-Imnarja in the limits of Dingli.
 That August 4 afternoon at around 4.45 pm, husband and wife were heading to their fields when the fatal accident occurred.
 The road outside the couple’s home was busier than usual because traffic was being diverted through it on account of road closures in the vicinity.
 So, while manoeuvring his van with its high tailgate onto the road, the defendant asked his wife to keep a lookout for oncoming traffic.
 That was when calamity struck.
 The defendant later told a court expert that he suddenly heard a noise and, when he stepped out of the van, saw his wife lying on the ground.
 She was rushed to hospital by ambulance where she succumbed to her injuries two hours later.
 A forensic pathologist confirmed that she suffered “multiple injuries following blunt trauma” and “contusion of the lungs”.
 The driver was found guilty of involuntary homicide and was fined €2,000 by the magistrates’ court which took note of his age and frail health as well as the unfortunate circumstances of the accident.
 Upon appeal, the defendant’s lawyers argued that the first court had wrongly assessed the evidence and also requested a reconsideration of the punishment.
 When delivering judgment, the court of criminal appeal, presided over by Madam Justice Natasha Galea Sciberras, confirmed that the position of the victim at the time of impact was never proved.
 She was rushed to hospital before court experts got to the scene of the accident.
 However, the defendant’s own statement showed that he knew that his wife was “somewhere” behind the van, even though the high tailgate blocked his rearview and he could not see her through the side mirrors.
 That was why he should have kept a proper lookout.
 He obeyed the Highway Code by seeking someone’s assistance while reversing his van but failed to pay attention to make sure that there were no obstacles or persons behind the vehicle, in this case, his own wife.
 This was not a “sudden emergency”, such as when a pedestrian suddenly steps onto the path of traffic.
 In this case, the appellant knew that his wife was keeping a lookout for oncoming traffic because he had asked her to.
 While confirming the driver’s negligence, the court, however, did not agree with the magistrate’s decision that the defendant had been driving “at a certain velocity” when attempting the risky manoeuvre.
 Nowhere did the case records prove that he had been driving at excessive speed.
 On the contrary, the court-appointed traffic expert had confirmed the total absence of tyre marks or other scratches on the road surface.
 Moreover, the expert had explained that the distance covered when reversing was short and the surface was rough.
 When all was considered, the court concluded that the appellant was not careful and did not check his surroundings, thus knocking down his wife who suffered fractured ribs and injuries to her right shoulder.
 “This was truly an unfortunate incident which was foreseeable and could have been avoided although it was not foreseen by the appellant,” observed the judge.
 However, although the first court could legally and reasonably find the defendant guilty, the court of appeal observed that there was a “strong [degree] of contributory negligence by the victim”.
 She stood right behind the van although she knew that her husband was about to reverse. She could easily have looked out for traffic by standing to the side, observed Madam Justice Galea Sciberras.
 Contrary to the first court’s conclusion, “it was clearly evident” that the victim contributed to the accident that cost her life.
 Such contributory negligence was to be reflected in the punishment which, though within legal parameters, left room for variation.
 Whilst declaring the appellant guilty of involuntary homicide, the court cancelled the €2,000 fine and conditionally discharged him for one year.
 The court confirmed the three-month driving ban and payment of court expenses amounting to €1,183.70.
 His remorse over the death of his wife was “sufficient punishment which [the appellant] would bear for life and which was doubtlessly greater than any punishment that could be inflicted by a court,” said the judge.
 Lawyers Franco Debono, Silvio Brincat and Marion Camilleri were defence counsel.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/two-arrested-msida-drug-bust.1097401,"Two men have been arrested after a sting operation on an Msida home, police said on Friday. 
 Police said they had been observing the residence for weeks on suspicion that it was being used as a base for drug trafficking activities.
 Officers eventually managed to gain access to the property despite the front door being barred by an iron structure from the inside. 
 They found two men and three women inside the apartment, where a search also yielded several sachets of substances suspected to be cocaine and heroin ready to be sold, as well as other items related to drug trafficking. 
 Police also found another bag containing around 50 grams of suspected cocaine as well as a substantial amount in cash.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/teens-granted-bail-admitting-stealing-jewellery-naxxar-property.1092861,"Two teenagers found in possession of stolen jewellery minutes after a break-in at a Naxxar residence on Monday night were granted bail pending sentencing upon arraignment on Wednesday.
 18-year-old Iain Alekxander Turnball, a bartender from Qawra, and Jamie Nicholas Jameson Magro, also 18 and a bartender from Mosta, were arrested shortly after the owner of the Naxxar property reported the burglary at 3:00 am on Tuesday morning.
 He told police that two suspects, captured on CCTV footage, had entered his home.
 Some vehicles parked in the area were also vandalized.
 Minutes after that report, police received a tip-off about two suspicious-looking persons wielding a sharp instrument in Triq il-Port Ruman, St Paul’s Bay.
 The suspects were arrested.
 Police found a machete, an axe and jewellery in their possession. The valuables were stolen from the Naxxar house minutes before.
 A car driven by the suspects had also been stolen from the property some days earlier.
 On Wednesday afternoon the teens were jointly charged with driving the car without the owner’s consent, as well as without a licence and insurance cover.
 They were also charged with aggravated theft and wilful damage to third party property, as well as carrying a sharp or pointed instrument without a police licence.
 They both registered an admission which they confirmed after being given sufficient time to reconsider.
 The court, presided over by magistrate Elaine Rizzo, upheld the defence’s request for a pre-sentencing report.
 Pending sentencing, the defence requested bail.
 That request was upheld on condition of not approaching the prosecution witnesses, signing the bail book daily, under a curfew between 10:00 pm and 7:00 am, against a deposit of €300 and a personal guarantee of €1000 each.
 Lawyer Arthur Azzopardi, assisting Jameson Magro, pointed out that the stolen items had been retrieved by the police before the arraignment.
 The court also issued a protection order in favour of the victims.
 AG lawyer Brandon Bonnici and Inspector Francesca Maria Calleja prosecuted.
 Lawyers Arthur Azzopardi and Frank Anthony Tabone were counsel to Jameson Magro.
 Lawyer Julia Micallef Stafrace was counsel to Turnball.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/nine-months-jail-party-organiser-damaged-cars-assaulted-policeman.1098540,"A drunken young man who went on a wrecking spree on a Paceville street, jumping on cars and injuring a policeman, was jailed for nine months on Wednesday.
 The case happened in the early hours of August 16 when Spaniard Jon Vila Jauregui, 21, damaged five cars that were parked on Triq is-Sur Fons. He also slightly injured a police officer as he violently resisted arrest.
 Jauregui was accused of causing wilful damage to third-party property, insulting, threatening and slightly injuring a police sergeant, violently resisting arrest and being drunk in public.
 He pleaded guilty.
 When delivering judgment, Magistrate Donatella Frendo Dimech said that the facts of the case fell squarely within the relative provisions of the Criminal Code.
 When meting out punishment, she noted the accused’s early guilty plea, his cooperation with investigators and his criminal record.
 Jauregui had come to Malta to work as an events promoter but chose to damage third-party property simply for the fun of it and because he wanted to, the magistrate said.
 He had admitted that on the day of the incident, he had been drinking heavily, but this was no excuse to exonerate an adult from the consequences of his own actions.
 The court, she said, wanted to send out a clear message that it would not tolerate violence against police officers or members of the forces of order.
 Although the punishment was to take into account the defendant’s early admission, it also had to reflect the gravity of his actions.
 He had attacked those “who risk their life to safeguard society by enforcing laws which society itself created to protect itself against criminals like the accused.”
 “There is no place for the law of the jungle in Malta,” said the court.
 Those who were not willing to behave properly, in a civilized manner, must face justice. Anti-social persons had no place in society and whoever thought himself above the law would be put in place by the law itself.
 The court condemned the youth to a nine-month effective jail term and a fine of €5,000 which, if not paid, would be converted to imprisonment.
 He was also ordered to reimburse the victims for the damages caused which totalled over €3,000 and to pay €484.80 in court expert expenses.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/man-set-fire-ex-car-threatened-jailed-ordered-pay-127k.1098269,"A man who set fire to his former partner’s car and threatened the woman and her mother with ""greater disaster” has been jailed for seven years.
 Omar Djelassi, a 27-year-old Cospicua resident, was the prime suspect in an arson attack on a Fiat Punto in the early hours of December 16, 2020. on Victory Street, Senglea.
 
 The flames also damaged a Kia Picanto parked in front of the Fiat and extended to the façade of a nearby residence. 
 A man who lived in that residence later described the “ball of fire” outside his residence and the dark plume of smoke that swept through his home, forcing him to seek refuge on the roof. 
 He was rescued by firefighters. 
 Djelassi - who had been in a relationship with the daughter of the woman who drove the Fiat and was the father of her minor child - was charged with having wilfully set fire to the car and caused damage to the second car and the house.
 He was also charged with committing the alleged crimes during a suspended sentence and while on bail over separate proceedings. 
 He pleaded not guilty. 
 Court hears how investigators tracked down a series of Facebook messages sent to the defendant’s ex and her mother a few days after the arson.
 Those messages - sent over two days in January 2021 from different Facebook profiles, made reference to the fire.
 The sender of the messages, hiding behind profiles named Haha Huhu and  Jane Cassar, knew the mother and daughter very well, having intimate knowledge of their movements and also the fact that the mother had acquired a new car after her previous one was reduced to a total loss in the December fire. 
 That Fiat Punto was registered in the name of the Djelassi’s ex but was used by her mother. 
 “Tonight you’re going to get a bigger fright than your mother because you’re going to end up homeless,” read one message, adding: “I feel better now that your mum’s car caught fire haha"".
 “And by the way, your mum’s new car is nice. If you think I’m bluffing go on and do so. But just as we burnt the other one we’ll burn this one,"" he added. 
 They included threats like ""today we're creating a bigger disaster than the one with the car"",  ""tonight start looking for another home for your daughter because she's going to end up without a facade"", ""take heed and get out of there because I'm going to make a big scene once the girl is not there""  and ""even if it's parked in front of cameras no problem"".
 Those messages were linked to an IP address registered at Djelassi’s family home. 
 When delivering judgment, the court, presided over by Magistrate Rachel Montebello, deemed those messages “a very strong” piece of evidence that the accused was materially involved in the crime. 
 The sender stated “repeatedly” and with no hesitation that he was the one who started the fire and threatened to repeat his act, targeting the new car and his ex’s house. 
 CCTV footage from the crime scene further corroborated that evidence. 
 Geolocation data also showed that Djelassi’s mobile phone was very active on the night of the arson and was in the area of the fire. 
 When all was considered, the court was “abundantly satisfied” that Djelassi was actively involved.
 An arson expert confirmed that the fire had not been an accidental one. 
 The second car was also damaged and the nearby façade and house were all blackened. The timber balcony was destroyed. 
 The court declared the accused guilty and condemned him to a five-year effective jail term.
 
 A previous two-year suspended sentence was also to be brought into effect. 
 He was ordered to reimburse €8,300 in total to all the victims and to cover expert expenses amounting to €4,474.
 The court also issued a restraining order and treatment order for three years.
 Inspectors Mario Xiberras, Jeffrey Scicluna Briffa and Darren Buhagiar prosecuted.

https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/132382/man_sentenced_to_19_months_imprisonment_for_stealing_ladder_and_breaching_bail_conditions,"A man was sentenced to 19 months’ imprisonment for stealing a ladder and simultaneously breaching bail conditions.

 The accused, 38-year-old Michael Spiteri from Zabbar, admitted that he committed the theft in order to obtain money to fuel his drug addiction.

 The man was accused of stealing a ladder that was tied on top of a van on 30 October 2024 between 3am and 6am. He was also accused of breaching bail conditions imposed on him in a previous case, and recidivism.

 He immediately admitted to the charges brought against him in court and admitted to the fact that he had committed the theft in order to get money for drugs.

 The Court, presided by Magistrate Leonard Caruana, noted whilst this was not the accused’s first brush with the law and that an effective sentence of imprisonment would be ideal in such circumstances, it simultaneously stated that said the sentence should remain close to the minimum, and this even in view of the fact that the theft was committed owing to the accused’s drug problem.

 The Court thus sentenced Spiteri to a 19-month effective prison sentence and ordered him to follow a drug rehabilitation program whilst imprisoned. Spiteri was also ordered to pay €185 to the owner of the ladder, with a further €50 to be confiscated from a personal guarantee he had been bound to in a separate case.     "

 Sources who spoke with MaltaToday have confirmed that the victim is a man with distinctive tattoos.

 On Monday, police found a dismembered body in a suitcase floating near Gżira’s promenade. The suitcase was taken by the Police’s Forensic Unit for examination, as the autopsy on the body was conducted on Tuesday. 

 Media reports suggest that the victim’s stomach contained a substantial amount of drugs, and that the victim is a foreign man and was between 30 and 40 years old. 

 It is also believed that an axe was used to dismember the body.

 A police spokesperson told MaltaToday that investigations are reaching an advanced stage, and the priority at this stage is identifying the victim and finding the killer.     "
https://timesofmalta.com/article/man-faces-drug-trafficking-charges-beach-club-arrest.1094508,"A 20-year-old man was accused of drug trafficking on Wednesday after police apprehended him for allegedly trying to sell drugs at a popular beach club. 
 Ryan Debono, an office worker from Qawra, was arraigned before Magistrate Ann Marie Thake.
 Police Inspector Warren Galea told the court that on April 20 the police got a call from a woman who said that Debono had tried to sell her drugs while she was at a beach club in St Paul’s Bay.
 Police quickly went to the club. The woman met them at the door and pointed out the accused to them.
 The police conducted a search on his person and found a stash of green pills which were later confirmed as being ecstasy. A sachet of cocaine had also been found.
 Debono pleaded not guilty to charges of trafficking and aggravated possession of ecstasy and cocaine less than 100m away from a place frequented by young people.
 The prosecution objected to a request for bail.
 Defence lawyer Amadeus Cachia pointed out that the accused had proven himself trustworthy enough to abide by police bail and was even allowed to travel overseas during this period.
 The court upheld the request for bail against a deposit of €1,000 and a personal guarantee of €9,000. The accused was also ordered to sign the bail book twice a week, observe a curfew and be supervised by a probation officer.

https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/128917/alberto_chang_attempted_to_pay_8560_bill_with_noncashable_cheque_hotel_manager_tells_court,"Alberto Chang Rajii attempted to settle his €8,560 hotel bill with a non-cashable cheque, a court heard as the compilation of evidence against the Chilean continued before magistrate Gabriella Vella earlier today.
 At the start of today’s sitting, 50-year-old Chang Rajii was asked to enter a fresh plea in view of an amendment to the charges against him. He reiterated his plea of not guilty and his defence lawyer, Ilona Schembri, exempted the court from having to hear the witnesses who had testified so far, all over again.
 First to testify on Monday was a police sergeant from the Community Policing Department, who told the court that on August 3, he had been informed about a fraud report filed against Chang Rajii by a representative of B Hotel for failing to pay for his seven-month stay there.
 When asked to settle the €8,560 bill, Chang Rajii had presented a non-cashable cheque for around €1,000 less than the amount due, the sergeant said.
  The court also heard the testimony of Jesmond Debono, B-Hotel’s General Manager today.
 The witness explained that the defendant had been a guest there, beginning in December 2021 and had extended his stay several times, offering different methods of payment. “Eventually he left the hotel with a pending balance of over eight thousand euros,” Debono told the court.
 The initial Booking had been made through online platform Expedia and had been paid for, but Chang Rajii had subsequently extended his stay, and had failed to pay his hotel bill from February to August.

 Debono described how the defendant had claimed to be making arrangements for the payment of €957 through a foreign bank account in March, explaining his first non-payment to the witness and his assistant as being the result of delays due to bank formalities.
 The hotel had initially given the Chilean the benefit of the doubt, but the doubt kept on mounting, together with his unpaid hotel bills, while Chang Rajii came up with a string of excuses for his card payments being refused, at one point allegedly claiming to have encountered problems with his HSBC account. 
 In June 2022, he told Debono that Barclays Bank had authorised a transfer that day. No bank transfer materialised, however. “He left us there till midnight waiting for the transfer,” Debono said.
 The hotel management were chasing the defendant for the money, sending reminders on a daily basis, with Chang Rajii staying at the hotel all the while.
 Eventually he had handed over a cheque for €7,000 from a JP Morgan account as security for his debt. The hotel didn’t try to cash that cheque, Debono said.
 The following month, in July 2022, Chang Rajii gave them details of a BOV account from which he would settle the outstanding amount which by then was over €7,000. When contacted by the hotel, BOV denied such a transaction had been made.
 The following day Chang Rajii had claimed that his funds had been transferred from a JP Morgan account in the US to a JP Morgan account in the UK.
 Then he proposed that the hotel try to obtain payment through Expedia, but that also turned out to be a dead end. “On 20 July 2022, at almost midnight, he confirmed to us that his card had been upgraded with a €25,000 limit. At that point his bill was €8,200,” the witness said.
 The case was adjourned to June, with the magistrate informing the prosecution that the 30-day period for it rule on whether there was a prima facie case for trial on indictment starts today.
 Prosecutor Claire Sammut from the Office of the Attorney General is assisting police inspectors Daryl Farr and Nico Zammit.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/two-companies-awarded-427000-damage-caused-2003-storm.1101219,"Two companies whose Qormi properties were severely damaged by flooding during a storm that caused havoc across the Maltese islands 21 years ago were awarded €427,303.61 in damages by the Court of Appeal.
 P.O.G. Limited and Petralux Limited had filed for damages against several government departments and entities including the Qormi local council after a storm struck Malta between 15 and 17 September 2003.
 Their properties included the Drugshop Dispensary and adjacent clinics at Triq Spiteri Fremond on De La Cruz Avenue in Qormi.
 The storm had caused severe flooding in several locations resulting in an overflow of sewage and significant damage to the claimants' property. 
 The court held that the government and its public entities had failed in their duty of care, particularly in the upkeep of the Qormi stormwater channel.
 It also said that those in positions of authority must be held accountable for their actions or inactions. 
 Both companies accused the defendants of failing in their duty to ensure that such incidents would not occur and sought a declaration of liability for the damages suffered.
 During oral pleadings, the plaintiffs' lawyers stressed the need for accountability and highlighted that the term itself lacks a direct Maltese translation.
 The defendants argued that the flooding was caused by unprecedented natural forces, constituting a force majeure. 
 
 The courts found that the flooding, exacerbated by outdated infrastructure and poor water management, caused significant damage to the plaintiffs' properties.
 They also established that negligence and infrastructure mismanagement were key contributors. 
 The companies were initially assigned 25% of the responsibility for failing to mitigate risks associated with operating in a flood-prone area. 
 On appeal, the courts acknowledged that the businesses had operated within their legal rights and that the damages were solely the result of systemic failures.
 The courts said that civil administration was to be held accountable for its responsibilities towards the upkeep of the Qormi stormwater channel and other similar areas throughout Malta and Gozo.
 The ruling apportioned the damages among several defendants. 
 The Directorate of Public Works and the Directorate of Construction and Maintenance were held 60% responsible.
 The Malta Resources Authority was assigned 25% liability, while Transport Malta was held accountable for 15%.
 The Qormi local council, initially found partly responsible, was absolved on appeal.
 The court was presided over by judges Giannino Caruana Demajo, Anthony Ellul and Robert G. Mangion.
 Lawyers Hugh Peralta and Robert Vella Baldacchino appeared for P.O.G. Ltd and Petralux Ltd.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/angelo-gafa-term-police-commissioner-renewed-four-years.1094679,"Updated 8.00 pm
 Angelo Gafa's term as police commissioner has been renewed for another four years, the home affairs ministry said on Saturday. 
 Gafa was the first police chief not to be directly appointed by the prime minister when he assumed the role in 2020. He was made commissioner following an open call from the Public Service Commission. 
 This time around, Gafa only needed the approval of the Public Service Commission for his contract to be renewed. 
 In a statement, the home affairs ministry praised Gafa's first four years.
 ""In the last years and months, the police corps revamped its systems to become closer to citizens,"" the ministry said.
 The ministry cited the introduction of community police, the victim support unit and the gender-based and domestic violence unit as examples of Gafa's work. 
 The ministry added that people trust the police: ""Every public opinion survey in the last years, on a local and European level, always showed that the Maltese people trust the (police) corps and its officials.""
 
 The police has also improved its governance and managed to agree on a new collective agreement for its officers, the ministry said. 
 Gafa's renewal comes despite the Nationalist Party's opposition. 
 Opposition leader Bernard Grech said on Saturday that the country deserves a commissioner who does not favour anyone and not an official who believes he should defend the interests of the Labour Party. 
  In a Facebook post, Grech said the PN would keep insisting it needs a police commissioner who has support from two-thirds of parliament.
 Robert Aquilina, of Repubblika, said a number of police officerstold him that Angelo Gafa does not represent the values of the police. 
 The officers who spoke to the rule of law NGO's honorary president consider the renewal of Gafa's contract as an insult to the police corps and the Maltese people, Aqulina said.
 ""Because of Angelo Gafa's leadership style, the police are demoralised and demotivated,"" Aquilina said. 
 Repubblika has been a constant critic of Gafa, even accusing the police chief of becoming the ""biggest obstacle to justice"".

 Magistrate Leonard Caruana will hear a number of witnesses testify today, as the compilation of evidence against former deputy prime minister Chris Fearne, Central Bank governor Edward Scicluna and 13 other defendants who are facing charges over the fraudulent private hospitals’ concession to Vitals Global Healthcare.  
 In a decree issued after the previous sitting, on July 24, the court ruled that there was a prima facie case to be heard against the accused, paving the way for them to be indicted and tried before the Criminal Court. 
 Among the witnesses requested for today’s sitting is former economy minister Chris Cardona, who testified yesterday in the parallel criminal proceedings against former Prime Minister Joseph Muscat. 
 On the witness stand yesterday, Cardona appeared to distance himself from the Memorandum of Understanding which he had signed with Vitals in his ministerial capacity.  
 He told the court that he had not read the document before signing it and had only done so in preparation for his testimony before the National Audit Office. When pressed by the court, Cardona said: “I was the minister responsible for Malta Enterprise. They asked me to sign it and I signed it.” 
 But later that same afternoon, Cardona took to Facebook to accuse the press of maliciously distorting his testimony, despite it being reported in real time.  
 Also expected to testify are several forensic accounting experts, who had been appointed to assist the magisterial inquiry into the hospitals deal.  "

 Hussein Aldghim, a Syrian national living in Hamrun was arraigned before magistrate Giannella Camilleri Busittil on Tuesday, accused of four counts of aggravated theft and two further counts of attempted aggravated theft.
 Police Inspectors Eman Hayman and Stephen Gulia explained that the police had been investigating a series of break-ins and burglaries from apartments in Msida and had discovered that the burglar would gain entry to the block of flats through small hatches on the roof. The breakthrough came on Sunday, when the police were informed that a suspicious person had been sighted in the block. Officers went to the scene, where they arrested Aldghim, whom they recognised from CCTV footage collected following previous burglaries.
 Aldghim pleaded guilty to the charges, confirming his admission after being given time to reconsider.
 The court then asked the prosecution to provide a value of what had been stolen, with a view to ordering the man to repay it, but was told that this information was not immediately available. 
 The magistrate adjourned the case to May 17 in order for the prosecution to establish the amount, after which it is expected to sentence the burglar.  "
https://timesofmalta.com/article/are-ready-because-i-am.1096706,"The final words of the man who confessed to murder before he was shot dead by police on Monday have been revealed from bodycam footage.
 Edward William Johnston held a replica gun to his head, then turned it to point at police before uttering his last words: “Are you ready? Because I am.”
 Officers shot the 50-year-old Irish man three times, believing his gesture and words were a clear warning that he was about to open fire on them, according to sources close to the investigation.
 
 The 3am shooting ended a three-hour stand-off during which police engaged in futile negotiations with Johnston.
 The body of his ex-partner, Nicolette Ghirxi, whom he had harassed for months, had been found an hour earlier in her Birkirkara apartment. She had been stabbed to death and two knives were found nearby. 
 Times of Malta was able to confirm, through sources close to the investigation, that the entire interaction between Johnston and the police was caught on body camera footage, which is now part of the investigation into the case that rocked the country this week.
 It later turned out Johnston had been carrying a replica Beretta pistol. 
 “In that moment, in pitch black darkness, police couldn’t have possibly known that his gun couldn’t shoot and considering that they had just been informed he had really killed a woman that night, they had every reason to interpret those words as a direct threat on their life,” one source said.
 Other details of Johnston’s movements on the night of the murder are slowly becoming clear. 
 While it has not been revealed how he got access to Ghirxi’s apartment on Triq Maestro Giuseppe Busuttil or how long he was there before the stabbing took place, he left late on Sunday night for the Hilton Hotel in St Julian’s.
  Sources close to the investigation say that he entered the resort at around 11.30pm and asked for a drink at the hotel’s Vista Lobby Lounge, which overlooks the sea. 
 The bartender told Johnston the bar was closed but that they would check with colleagues, before briefly leaving the bar to speak with staff.
 When the bartender returned, Johnston pulled out the gun which later turned out to be a replica, telling the bartender: “Get me a beer or I’ll shoot you.”
 Johnston left the hotel shortly afterwards – possibly by jumping down to the ground from a nearby roof – and police were called.
 The details of Johnston’s exact movements and interactions with hotel employees are still being investigated by police, and hotel staff declined to comment when Times of Malta visited the premises on Tuesday.
 On Monday police commissioner Angelo Gafa said officers first found Johnston on the rocks behind the hotel and when they approached him he jumped into the sea and at one point, directed the gun at his head.
 At that point the police did not know the gun was a replica, and three hours of negotiations during which a medical team and a professional police negotiator were roped in on site were not enough to persuade him to put down his gun and surrender to the police.
 Johnston died at Mater Dei Hospital, shortly after the shooting.
 
 One source speculated that in that moment, Johnston may have wanted to die in the hands of the police in what is known in the forensic world as ‘suicide by cop’.
 “When he said those words and pointed the gun at the police he knew he was provoking them to shoot him, because that is what police do when faced with a threat like that, all the while knowing he had nothing to fire back with,” the source said. The law says a police officer can fire their gun only as a last resort and in “exceptional circumstances”, and when it is “inevitable to preserve the life of a police officer or others, or to avert an imminent danger of widespread violence.”
  Internal police guidelines also say officers can only fire their gun when they have a “reasonable belief” that their target “poses an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury to the officer or to another person.” 
 It is believed this was not Johnston’s first stand-off with police.
 The victim’s family told Times of Malta that he had boasted to her about being involved in a previous bomb threat in Glasgow.
 The man in the Glasgow incident, also called Edward Johnston and of the same age, was jailed over a restaurant bomb threat in 2012 and was almost shot by police in Liverpool a week earlier after pointing a replica gun at them. In both cases he challenged police to shoot him.
 Times of Malta understands the Maltese authorities are still trying to confirm at this stage if the man they shot while he pointed a fake weapon at them is the same person.
 
 Johnston had been harassing his ex-partner for months after their almost two-year relationship broke down.
 She first reported him to police in April but told officers she did not believe her life was at risk.
 Over the next months she made further reports, including of fake profiles he was suspected of setting up to make slanderous allegations about her sex life.

https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/130543/cocaine_sex_parties_with_prostitutes_kept_identita_officials_quiet_over_fraudulently_issued_id_cards_lawyer_,"A police inspector was transferred to another department while planning to arraign top political officials on charges of masterminding a racket at Identità, lawyer Jason Azzopardi has claimed in a sworn application on Friday.  
 The racket allegedly saw the issuing of an estimated 18,000 Maltese ID cards to third country nationals on the basis of fake documentation and false declarations.
  It is just one of several explosive claims laid out in the urgent 59-page sworn application requesting a magisterial inquiry, that was filed earlier this week by lawyer Jason Azzopardi in his personal capacity.
 Former Identità official Maria Spiteri and her boyfriend, car dealer and alleged fraudster, Bernard Attard, were named and identified to the police by several Egyptian men who were arrested and questioned by the police after they were caught using the IDs to apply for residence permits.
 In a July sitting in the case against Moustafa Ata Moussa Darwish, one of the Egyptian men accused of falsely claiming to be married to a British woman so as to obtain a residency permit in Malta, two Identità officials had given conflicting testimony when asked about whether the man’s file was available, leading Magistrate Kevan Azzopardi to order a police investigation.
 An English woman who was supposedly married to the accused had also testified in those proceedings. She described how an official from Identity Malta, as the agency was known then, had called her in 2022 to inquire whether she had sponsored a family member to obtain a residence permit. The woman told the court that she had nothing to do with any Egyptian men and denied ever being married to the accused.
 The application states that Spiteri had conspired with Attard to let the third country nationals in to Identity Malta office through a side door after closing time, in order to photograph them for their new ID cards, which were issued in under 30 days - a far cry from the standard three to four month wait.
 The couple are already the subjects of ongoing criminal proceedings for fraud, in which they are accused of tricking a Latvian man into paying Attard to purchase a property, with Spiteri impersonating a Lands Department official. A civil court had condemned Attard to pay €696,210 to the victim in that case in 2020.
 Last March Attard was also charged with using a metal bar to beat up a man who had gone to Attard’s residence, allegedly carrying pepper spray, to confront Attard for deceiving him in an agreement to buy a car.
 The application states that thousands of fake certificates, mostly marriage certificates documenting fictitious marriages abroad between third-country nationals, the majority of them hailing from Egypt or Libya, and UK nationals at a time when the UK was still an EU member state, were used to apply for ID cards.
 Azzopardi goes on to allege that these documents, which had been falsified for the purpose of applying for Maltese ID “appear to have already been destroyed by the Identity Malta employees involved in this racket.”
 It was for this reason that the Immigration Section of the Malta Police Force had to request confirmation of the purported marriages, Azzopardi said, adding that as far as he was aware, the requested information had not been received to date.
  
 Bernard Attard “mentioned by Colombian organiser of cocaine and prostitute parties”
 Azzopardi goes on to declare under oath that he had been entrusted with information by an individual, on condition of anonymity, describing several debauched parties allegedly “organised by a Colombian woman named Rosario” at a villa in Wardija, an apartment in Mellieha and another apartment in St. Julians.
 “Members of Parliament from both sides of the House, Government Ministers, doctors, lawyers, employees and Government officials would attend these parties,” declared the lawyer, adding that ‘Rosario’ would boast of the ease with which she would obtain work permits for the prostitutes she employed “thanks to her corrupt contacts at Identity Malta together with officials from the Government of Malta who would be paid large sums of money to help her in return for being allowed to attend these parties for free.”
 “Bernard Attard’s is one of the names that Rosario had mentioned to him several times,” alleged the lawyer, requesting an urgent magisterial inquiry aimed at preserving the relevant evidence.
  
 Identità responds to allegations
 In response to the allegations, Identità stated that it takes all allegations and reports seriously, noting that it had strengthened its internal compliance structures and is fully cooperating with the police.
 The agency stressed its committment to launch the necessary internal investigations. Identità reminded that it had previously launched an internal investigation which has since been passed onto the police.
 Identità stated that it does not tolerate any form of abuse, and that it will continue to cooperate with the police.  "

 The man had been accused of defiling minors who had entrusted to his care, from 2009 to 2012 and participating in sexual activity with the children, who at the time were just four and five-years-old respectively.
  The two girls had been 17 and 16 years of age when they testified before Magistrate Claire Stafrace Zammit, telling the court that the alleged abuse by the defendant - who had been their aunt’s boyfriend at the time - would take place at their grandmother’s house in Marsa, where they would be dropped off after school before being collected by their father.
 At the Marsa house, they said, the defendant would show the girls pornographic movies and encourage them to perform sex acts for his gratification, which they had detailed in court.
 Afterwards, he would buy their silence with chocolates and read them stories, claimed the girls.
 The elder child told the court that she had developed an anxiety disorder as a result.
 But the girls’ accounts raised questions for magistrate Claire Stafrace Zammit. “Although the defendant is accused of ugly and serious crimes, this court is not morally and legally convinced of the truthfulness of their story.”
 The defendant had chosen to exercise his right not to testify in court, but the magistrate also had the opportunity to examine the statement he gave to the police in which he had said he was fed up living in the house due to the noisy children and the lack of privacy. The magistrate had also visited the house in person in order to verify claims about the property that had been raised by the defence.
 The room in which the girls claimed that the abusive acts had taken place offered no privacy, lacking even a door, and was in the middle of a corridor often used by the house’s occupants. “These alleged acts would also take place, according to the children, while their grandfather, grandmother, mother and sometimes also an aunt would be present in the single-floor house.”
 Court-appointed experts had also expressed doubts about the children’s claims and which they suspected to be false.
 The court said that although no suspicion arose from the testimonies of the girls themselves, when their accounts were analysed together with the place and context in which the alleged acts took place, the claims took on a different dynamic.
 Magistrate Stafrace Zammit said it was unlikely that the acts would have gone unnoticed in a living space that was occupied by several people.
 Another aspect which worried the court was that none of the evidence showed that there had been any emotional impact on the children. “No sign of distress was detected by the designated experts nor any symptom of psychosis with delusions. From the testimony of the minor's mother, it emerged that she was never startled by anything that the minors could have been experiencing and even at school they continued to go on normally. That all the witnesses from the side of the Victims Support did not encounter any problem in their emotions either except for the one who had problems related to anxiety and panic attacks [which had emerged] after she had spoken out, but not before.”
 The double entendre alleged to have been used by the man to describe his desired sex act was more likely to be a term used by the, now older, girls in their present peer group.
 All these factors led the Court to state that it was not morally convinced that the events described by the girls had actually taken place in the manner they described.
 “The Court must clarify that once it is not aware of where this story had originated from, it cannot incriminate any of the protagonists, however if it is the case that this was a story invented by the minors, it cannot condemn them, but can only hope that their parents and the people who are looking after their mental health, [also] take care of their well-being.”

https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/128934/individuals_companies_identified_as_money_laundering_suspects_in_vitals_inquiry,"Several people and companies have been identified as money laundering suspects in connection to the Vitals inquiry.
 MaltaToday understands that action can be expected to be taken against several individuals and companies, which probably includes former prime minister Joseph Muscat, his former chief of staff Keith Schembri, and former health minister Konrad Mizzi.
 A money laundering investigation may lead to the freezing of assets.
  Magistrate Gabriella Vella, who was investigating the sale of three public hospitals to Vitals Global Healthcare, concluded her report and passed it on to the Attorney General last week.
 The inquiry was initiated in 2019 on Repubblika’s initiative.
 Joseph Muscat had tried to remove the magistrate from the inquiry, insisting she had a conflict because her relatives were publicly critical of him. He also complained of constant leaks from the inquiry and decried the magistrate’s refusal to let him testify before her.
 In January 2022, as part of the inquiry, police officers searched Muscat’s Burmarrad home and ceased several electronic devices.
 Muscat told reporters today that he had no doubt he will be charged as he adopted a defiant tone. He insisted he did nothing wrong and would fight the charges tooth and nail.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/fearne-scicluna-others-back-court-vitals-charges.1094050,"Updated 4pm
 A magistrate on Monday turned down a request to recuse himself from hearing the case against Chris Fearne, Edward Scicluna and 12 others and ordered that the case proceed immediately. 
 Magistrate Leonard Caruana rebuffed the request, filed collectively by lawyers representing the defendants, saying it had no basis in law. 
 The decision came midway through a court session characterised by rumblings of discontent from the defence benches - and revelations that the evidence to be presented against defendants totals a staggering 250,000 pages.
 Defence lawyers made it a point to note that they have not yet received copies of that evidence, even though they have been given less than two weeks to present their objections to the prima facie evidence presented against their clients.   
 It was that court-mandated timeline which prompted defence lawyers to make the recusal request. 
 The magistrate decreed that the defendants' 30-day time limit to contest prima facie evidence began when they were first arraigned on May 29.
 Defence lawyers said that decision caught them by surprise and meant they only had 11 days to comb through voluminous evidence against their clients. So far, defendants have only received a copy of conclusions of the magisterial inquiry into the Vitals case. Work to provide them with copies of appendices attached to that inquiry remains ongoing. 
 Lawyers argued that the 30-day limit should begin on Monday, as the magistrate had originally annulled that May 29 court hearing. 
 The magistrate cancelled that arraignment after lawyers for one of the defendants, legal firm DF Advocates, argued that no individual had been notified of charges as its representative.
 But the magistrate subsequently changed course and on Friday upheld a request by prosecutors to revoke that initial decree.
 That decision prompted a storm of criticism from defence lawyers, who also took issue with the magistrate limiting submissions to one lawyer per defendant to ""avoid repetition"". 
 Each accused had a right to make submissions, they argued. 
 As complaints mounted, the defence collectively demanded that the magistrate recuse himself, arguing that their clients’ right to a fair trial was being denied.
 Prosecutors immediately objected to the recusal request, saying the request had no legal basis and that the outcome of a decree was no reason to demand a recusal. 
 Following a 90-minute deliberation, the magistrate turned down the recusal request, saying it was not well-founded. His decree was met with total silence by the defence. 
 The court heard that work was underway to make evidence presented in 78 boxes of documentation available to defendants.
 As of Monday morning, documents in all but three of the 78 boxes had been scanned, court registrar Franklin Calleja testified.
 In all, there are 250,000 pages to be scanned.
 Police superintendent Rennie Stivala testified that he was present for various searches and testimonies given as part of the Vitals magisterial inquiry led by magistrate Gabriella Vella.
 Stivala served that function until April 2021. Up to that date, none of those questioned were being treated as suspects in the case, he said.
 All throughout, Stivala emphasised that the process was led by the magistrate and that he was simply tasked with assisting the process.
 Tax commissioner Joseph Caruana also testified in Monday’s session. He told the court that he granted authorisation for criminal action against one of the accused, Deborah Ann Chappell, and did so on the same day that the request from the police commissioner reached him, May 2.
 The case will resume on Friday, June 21, when the court will hear submissions regarding freezing orders against the accused and also decide on a request filed by the prosecution to forbid defendants from speaking publicly about the case.
 Fearne, a Labour MP and former deputy prime minister and Scicluna, who is Central Bank Governor and a former finance minister, stand accused of fraud and other crimes related to that hospitals privatisation deal.
 That deal, signed during Fearne and Scicluna's time in office as part of a Joseph Muscat-led government, was annulled by a civil court last year after it found evidence of fraud within it. 
 Their initial arraignment, held late last month, turned into an 11-hour court sitting punctuated with multiple procedural objections by defence lawyers. At the end of it all, Magistrate Leonard Caruana  annulled the entire thing.
 The case was due to resume last week but was deferred after prosecutors filed a legal request to revoke that decision to annul the initial sitting.
 Apart from Fearne and Scicluna, other defendants include former permanent secretaries Alfred Camilleri and Joseph Rapa, current permanent secretary Ronald Mizzi, members of the adjudication committee that assigned the contract to Vitals - James Camenzuli, Manuel Castagna, and Robert Borg -  financial controller Kenneth Deguara, and five lawyers: Deborah Anne Chappell, Kevin Deguara, Jean Carl Farrugia, Bradley Gatt and Aron Mifsud Bonnici. 
 Another group of defendants that includes former prime minister Joseph Muscat, Keith Schembri and Konrad Mizzi are being charged separately. They face more serious allegations of bribery and corruption, among other crimes. 
 A third case sees consultant Assad Ali facing criminal charges. Ali is the son of Shaukat Ali, the man suspected of being  the secret shareholder who made the most money out of the hospitals deal.
 Correction June 18, 2024: A previous version misstated the number of pages to be scanned as 51,000.

https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/130048/shaukat_ali_charged_with_corruption_money_laundering_over_vitals_fraud_involvement,"Shaukat Ali Chaudry, his wife Asia Parveen Shaukat, and several companies have pleaded not guilty to criminal charges recommended by the Vitals inquiry.
 The 73-year-old Pakistani businessman, who told the court that he worked as a freelance consultant, appeared voluntarily in court on Wednesday, where he was arraigned by summons. He pleaded not guilty to charges of money laundering, trading in influence, misappropriation, promotion and active participation in a criminal organisation and corruption.
  He was charged together with Mount Everest General Trading LLC, Mount Everest FZ LLC, STE Health Co, Mount Everest Investments Limited, VGH Europe AG - today Accutor Consulting AG, Mount Everest General Trading FZ LLC, Global Assets Holdings Limited  At the start of today's arraignment before magistrate Rachel Montebello, prosecutor Rebekah Spiteri requested an amendment to the charges, together with a separation of proceedings.
 The first set of defendants would be today’s case against Ali, Mount Everest FZ LLC, and Global Assets Holdings Ltd.. Ali also represented those companies, she explained.
 The second set of charges would be against Mount Everest General Trading LLC, STE Health and VGH Europe AG. No individuals were being charged in the second batch, noted the court.“We are not yet sure who represents those companies,” explained the prosecutor. 
 The defence did not object to the request, which was upheld by the court, which noted that the changes did not affect the merits of the charges and were not being opposed by the defence.
 The prosecution also requested a number of seizures and freezing orders, the first of which against Shaukat Ali Chaudry was for the sum of €30 million. 
 €9 million were requested to be frozen from the assets of VGH Europe AG, €100 million from Mount Everest Investments Limited, €100,000 from STE Health Co, €340,000 from D Global Assets Holdings Limited, €5 million each from Mount Everest FZ LLC and Mount Everest General Trading LLC.
 Asked how he wished to plead, the defendant made an open palm gesture and said “I’m not guilty, so I’m pleading not guilty.” Ghaznavi entered not guilty pleas on behalf of the companies.
 FCID Inspector Wayne Rodney Borg took the witness stand.
 He was assigned to assist Mag Gabriella Vella in the Vitals Steward inquiry. “My role was always to assist her by summoning all the necessary persons who needed to testify in such inquiry.”
 MaltaToday had reported that Ali, along with former OPM chief of staff Keith Schembri, were central to the multi-million fraudulent hospitals concession. Investigators believed that Shaukat Ali’s family was rewarded with huge consultancy fees when Steward was to take over Vitals as concessionaires of the hospital – as much as €480,000.
 The payments to Shaukat Ali were made two weeks before Steward Healthcare International – the international arm that took over the concession – signed a memorandum of understanding with the government to take over the hospitals concession.
 Just yesterday, a magistrate ruled that Shaukat Ali’s son, Shaukat Asad Ali can stand trial, after ruling that there is sufficient evidence to commit him to trial on indictment.
 When the case resumed after noon, the court issued a decree upholding the request for a seizing and freezing order on Shaukat Ali Chaudry, Global Assets and Mount Everest and his Parveen.
 The court instructed that the orders be communicated to all financial institutions as well as be published in the government gazette. Wasay Bhatti pleads not guilty
 Wasay Attaoul Bhatti, an Indian-born lawyer based in Switzerland, faced arraignment in a separate courtroom.
 Representing both himself and two Swiss companies, Accutor AG and Spring Healthcare Services AG, Bhatti is accused of being instrumental in the alleged misuse of these entities as conduits for a political slush fund by the hospital concessionaires.
 In court, Bhatti denied all allegations, pleading ""not guilty"" before Magistrate Leonard Caruana. Prosecutors said Bhatti played a key role in facilitating bribery payments to prominent political figures, including former Prime Minister Joseph Muscat, former Minister Konrad Mizzi, and former OPM Chief of Staff Keith Schembri.
 Additionally, Bhatti is alleged to have supported Shaukat Ali and his suspected Vitals frontman, Sri Ram Tumuluri, in trading influence.
 Tumuluri remains at large, with prosecutors revealing that attempts to serve him with a court summons have been unsuccessful. In light of the charges, prosecutors have sought a substantial €9 million freezing order on Bhatti's assets, a move contested by his defense team, comprising Shazoo Ghaznavi, Jessica Formosa, Alex Scerri Herrera, and Jeanine Depasquale.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/man-charged-repeatedly-raping-nineyearold-daughter.1093035,"A man was remanded in custody on Saturday afternoon after facing charges for having allegedly raped his nine-year-old daughter three times over.
 Suspicions about the man, a 49-year-old German father of two, were first triggered by a remark made by his seven-year-old daughter during a lesson at school.
 The girl’s comment appeared to indicate that she could be experiencing suicidal thoughts.
 The teacher promptly referred the matter to a school counsellor who spoke to the child.
 That was when the girl opened up about how she allegedly had witnessed her nine-year-old sister being sexually abused by their father.
 When spoken to, the elder girl confirmed her sister’s allegations, describing three separate instances when the alleged abuse took place.
 The matter was reported to Child Protection Services who, in turn, alerted the police vice squad.

https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/131197/court_stops_defence_lawyer_from_probing_vitals_inquiry_experts_qualifications,"The court hearing challenges to the freezing orders issued on the back of the Vitals Global Healthcare fraud case today stopped defence lawyer Franco Debono from probing one of the court-appointed experts about her qualifications for the role.
 Debono challenged the witness, forensic accountant Miroslava Milenović, while she was being cross-examined as to how she had quantified the alleged amounts of money that had been laundered in the VGH and Steward deal.
  Milenović told the court that she had a first degree in an unrelated field: geophysics, and subsequently a Masters degree in political science, financing of terrorism and money laundering. That was in 1984, she said.
 Milenović then spent 20 years working with PwC as an accountant and as a certified fraud specialist, as well as director of that firm. She had also worked with the United States’ Department of Justice as a fraud investigator for many years.
 The judge stopped the lawyer’s pointed line of questioned towards the witness. “This is not the place where you can contest the expert’s  qualifications. I don’t want to hear anymore.”
 The judge proceeded to dictate a note in the acts of the proceedings herself, recording that the court felt that for the purposes of this application – which was to challenge the freezing orders – the expert had already explained her qualifications and was therefore rejecting the defence’s request to continue with this line of questioning.
 Debono shifted his questions to asking Milenović about her work with PwC, in Serbia, but was shut down by the court. “PwC assisted with the [Vitals Global Healthcare] investigation. She used to be a consultant there,” the lawyer said.
 Madame Justice Grima asked Milenović whether she had been aware of the firm’s involvement in the inquiry. “I had searched at the very beginning but saw nothing significant,” replied the expert witness.
 “So you’re telling us that your involvement with the firm is not significant?” asked the lawyer. Milenović pointed to two specific paragraphs in her report which dealt with PwC and explained that she had not found the firm’s involvement significant at that stage.
 The court stopped Debono from probing the witness further, remarking that “the law doesn’t even contemplate you cross-examining the witness, which the court is allowing in the circumstances, but attacking the qualifications of the expert is a stretch too far. Even if I were to conclude that she is not qualified, I would still proceed on the basis of what I have before me,” remarked the judge.
 “How she was appointed in the inquiry was irrelevant,” said the judge. “Admissibility of expert evidence is a subject that must be tackled at a later stage, before the court that will be deciding that issue.”
 Franco Debono grills witness
 Debono asked Milenović to identify other instances in her report which mention the defendant Kevin Deguara
 The court pointed out that Deguara did not feature in the application before it, except as a representative of DF Advocates. The witness confirmed there was no direct mention of Deguara in her report.
 Deguara was indirectly mentioned due to his connection with DF Advocates, acting as TCSP and professional intermediary. 
 At that point Debono’s agitation increased, accusing the witness of trying to obscure the truth and insult the defence’s intelligence.
 Milenović said a lot of different entities had been involved, with several related emails and communications in which Kevin Deguara had received or sent.
 The judge asked Milenović whether she was aware of the distinction between DF Advocates and DF Consulting. That was not the expert’s focus, she replied. “My focus was more on the role of the different advocates, consultants – legal and financial – who gave assistance to this scheme being structured.”
 “I didn’t indicate amounts in my reports related to either Deguara or Farrugia. With regards to DF Advocates, the only involvement [I saw] was in structuring and participation, helping..in that respect.”
 When asked whether Kenneth Deguara had been mentioned in her report, she replied that he hadn’t mentioned him.
 Asked whether the law firm had received funds from the government or whether they were just an instrument used to move money between the key players, Milenović replied: “In my report more the role of the helpers. I didn’t establish the links of the payments to DF Advocates… I didn’t mention any money flows to DF Advocates. It was involved in structuring.”
 After the cross-examination ended and the video link to Milenović was disconnected, Debono complained that she had been evasive in her testimony. “She named Kevin Deguara as one of the key players and not one word on his involvement. This is unacceptable.”
 Lawyer Stefano Filletti suggested that even if Milenović’s report was expunged from the proceedings challenging the freezing order, this would not affect the case deciding the defendants’ guilt or otherwise. “We have a person without a warrant, wIth a degree in geophysics and a certificate from somewhere in America, telling us about a professional issue. The FATF is relevant, but only to Malta as a State, which must then translate its directives into law,” submitted the lawyer.
 The court repeated that issues of admissibility of evidence and the competence or otherwise of experts could not be raised at this stage of the proceedings. 
 Judge Grima explained to the defence that if she decided to expunge the report because she wasn’t convinced of the expertise of the person who drew it up, the defence would “surely then raise the matter in the case [deciding guilt or innocence] and call it ‘a fact that had been declared by the court in other proceedings’”, said the judge. “When a court discards evidence it must give a reason for doing so.”
 Expert witness unavailable
 Earlier, at the start of the hearing, forensic accountant Jeremy Harbinson, expected to testify in the Vitals Global Healthcare fraud case, could not be reached when the court attempted to establish a video call in today’s sitting. It is understood that Harbinson had not replied to the court’s request to testify. 
 Harbinson had previously sent a representative of his firm to testify in his stead, when he was called to testify in a related case that is challenging the €20 million freezing orders issued against the Pakistani businessman  Shaukat Ali Chaudry and his wife Aasia Parveen Shaukat.
 Instead, forensic accountant Miroslava Milenović, appointed to assist the inquiry, was cross-examined by defendant Deborah Chappell’s lawyer Joseph Mizzi about a €40 million freezing order against his client. 
 The defendants in the VGH case are all challenging the scale of the freezing orders imposed against them, calling the court-appointed experts to testify as to how they quantified the alleged theft  in the VGH procurement.
 Milenović is a forensic accountant certified by regulatory bodies in both the US and UK bodies for the past 20 years.
 Replying to Mizzi as to how she had quantified the €5 million allegedly paid to defendant company Technoline as laundered monies, Milenović – testifying by video call – ran a search in her report for the words ‘5 million’, ‘Technoline’ and ‘Deborah Chappell’, yet yielded no results.
 Madame Justice Edwina Grima, presiding over the proceedings, explained that this was one of the amounts specified in the inquiry as being linked to Chappell. “I think it was not one of the conclusions of my report,” replied the witness.
 Milenović said her conclusion mentioned the key players in the VGH scheme, and that this scheme was not possible to be carried out without the help of others, “whom I mentioned.” Chappell’s name was one of them, Milenović said. “In this respect… I mentioned these people as professional helpers, corporate service providers, and in that respect I mentioned Deborah Chappell.”
 When suggested that Chappell was actually VGH’s in-house counsel, and therefore falling outside the remit of the Prevention of Money Laundering Regulations, Milenović said she was a TCSP (Trust or Company Service Provider), as described by the FATF.
 Mizzi pointed out the obligations of a TCSP were different to those of an in-house counsel.
 The court was told Milenović’s report stated that money had flowed from Steward Healthcare LLC and later that it originated from the government of Malta. “The money transferred by Steward or Accutor came from only one source, and that was the government of Malta,” replied the witness.
 Mizzi suggested that €2.5 million had originated from the US company, pointing to a letter in the inquiry which stated that Accutor AG had received €4 million from Steward between 2018 and 2019. “Could the money have not actually come from Malta but from the United States?” asked the lawyer.
 “I don’t think so,” Milenović replied. “The money came from the government of Malta… maybe some other money came from Accutor. Looking at the money flows, I said that it was likely that Accutor had paid the money which it had received from the government to Deborah Chappell.” This emerged from bank records, she added.
 She added that the government had paid VGH and then Steward, who paid Steward LLC’s parent company, who then sent the money to Accutor AG in Switzerland. “There were also transfers from Steward Malta to Steward LLC, as well as between Steward and the government.”
 Milenović explained that these payments emerged from bank statements from Switzerland.
 Who are the defendants and what are they accused of?
 The former Minister for Health Chris Fearne and the former Minister for the Economy Edward Scicluna are charged alongside Ronald Mizzi, Alfred Camilleri, and Joseph Rapa, and lawyers Kenneth Degurara, Kevin Deguara, Jean Carl Farrugia, Deborah Anne Chappell, Bradley Gatt, Aron Mifsud Bonnici, James Camenzuli, Emmanuel Castagna and Robert Borg, as well as DF Advocates, accused of defrauding the Government of Malta. 
 Fearne, Scicluna, Mizzi, Camilleri, Rapa and Chappell are additionally accused of misappropriation to the detriment of the Government of Malta. Mizzi, Camilleri and Rapa alone are accused of committing a crime which they had been duty bound to prevent.
 Chappell is also being charged with money laundering, in her personal capacity, together with Kenneth Deguara personally and in his role as Chief Financial Officer of DF Advocates, Kevin Deguara and Jean Carl Farrugia in their personal capacities and as representatives of DF Advocates.
 Mifsud Bonnici, Castagna, Chappell, Kevin Deguara and Farrugia are further accused of, in their personal capacity and as representatives of DF Advocates, having actively participated in a criminal organisation of over 10 people between 2013 and 2023.
 More charges, relating to conspiracy to commit a crime punishable by imprisonment are being faced by Chappell, Mifsud Bonnici, Deguara, Farrugia and DF Advocates. Chappell and Deguara also being accused of falsifying financial documents to cover up for a crime, as well as falsifying VAT records.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/attorney-general-sabotaging-joseph-muscat-prosecution-ngo-alleges.1092273,"Attorney General Victoria Buttigieg is ""sabotaging"" the prosecution against Joseph Muscat, Repubblika said on Friday.
 In a judicial protest, the rule of law NGO claimed Buttigieg was not even trying to hide her efforts to help the ex-prime minister, by offering him ""privileged"" access to the findings of the hospitals inquiry. 
 Repubblika, in a judicial protested authored by lawyer Jason Azzopardi, lamented that its own efforts to gain access to the inquiry, which it instigated in 2019, have been twice rejected. 
 Muscat is among a raft of people set to face money-laundering and corruption charges linked to the hospitals deal. 
 Repubblika accused the Attorney General of ""ordering"" the State Advocate not to appeal a recent court decision granting Muscat access to the parts of the inquiry where he is mentioned. 
 On Thursday, Judge Giovanni Grixti ordered the Attorney General to present every document in the inquiry’s records about the former prime minister. 
 Repubblika said the Attorney General had agreed to hand over the documents to Muscat before the four-day window to appeal Grixti's decision had even elapsed. 
 The NGO said the Attorney General deposited ""every single page and document"" in which Muscat is mentioned, including ""documented proof about his money-laundering"". 
 Muscat vehemently denies any wrongdoing. 
 Repubblika said that while the Attorney General wanted Muscat to have the advantage of ""privileged"" access, its own demands for the inquiry findings had been refused. 
 The NGO said the inquiry's findings are of national interest, and should be published immediately. 
 Repubblika warned it would be holding Buttigieg personally responsible for going out of her way to ""help criminals"", instead of upholding her oath of office. 
 The fallout from the inquiry continued on Friday, with deputy prime minister Chris Fearne announcing his resignation. 
 Fearne, a former health minister, is set to face fraud charges in connection with the deal.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/joseph-muscat-charged-bribery-criminal-association.1092078,"Updated 6pm
 Malta's former prime minister Joseph Muscat, his chief-of-staff Keith Schembri, ex-minister Konrad Mizzi, and 19 other individuals and companies will be charged with money laundering, corruption, bribery and a host of other serious crimes, Times of Malta can confirm.
 It is the first time in Maltese political history that a former prime minister will be made to answer for criminal charges in court. 
 The charges revolve around a deal to privatise three state hospitals that was negotiated and managed by Muscat's government. That deal was annulled by a court last year. 
 Muscat, Mizzi and Schembri stand accused of money laundering, bribery, trading in influence and a long list of other charges, including setting up a criminal association.
 If found guilty, the trio face jail sentences of up to 18 years and fines of up to €2.5 million. 
 
 Prosecutors allege that they received bribes from David Meli, a lawyer who represented hospitals concessionaires Steward Health Care and who is also among those charged. 
 Brian Tonna and  Karl Cini of Nexia BT are alleged to have helped Muscat, Mizzi and Schembri commit those crimes. 
 Schembri is separately charged with having sought personal advantages that he was not entitled to, and of having made unlawful or excessive claims. 
 Emails produced by Steward in their appeal last year revealed how the former OPM chief of staff played a key, albeit hidden, role in the negotiation process.
 That role is further confirmed by criminal charges filed against him, which allege Schembri took a private interest in an adjudication or contract, resulting in fraud to the detriment of government. 
 Prosecutors from the Attorney General's office have filed criminal charges against him in both in his personal capacity as well as a representative of three companies: Kasco Engineering, FSV Ltd and Sciacca Grill.   
 Sciacca Grill owner Noel Zammit told Times of Malta that Schembri has nothing to do with his business.  
 Other figures facing charges for major crimes include Steward's auditor Christopher Spiteri, its IT manager  Clarence John Conger-Thompson, lawyer  Jonathan Vella,  medical equipment supplier  Ivan Vassallo and his business partner  Mario Victor Gatt, businessman  Pierre Sladden, former Progress Press director  Adrian Hillman and Mtrace Ltd CEO  Brian Bondin.
 Spiteri served as auditor for Vitals Global Healthcare, the company which was originally awarded the lucrative hospitals deal. Prosecutors allege that he filed false declarations and took false oaths, divulged confidential material and under-declared income made by Vitals investors such as Shaukat Ali Chaudary and others.  
 Vella represented Vitals' parent company Bluestone Investments and is also accused of having formed part of a criminal association, making false declarations and use of false documents, among other things. 
 Vassallo faces multiple, similar charges in both a personal capacity and as a representative of Technoline, Eurabytes Ltd and Gateway Solutions Ltd. The same goes for his business partner Gatt. 
 Sladden and Hillman face charges in their personal capacities, while Bondin faces charges in both his personal capacity and as Mtrace director. 
 Muscat quickly reacted to details of the criminal charges. 
 ""If they weren't so serious, they'd be funny,"" he said of the charges. ""I am going to relish destroying each and every one of these charges and proving how they are built on fantasy and lies.""
  Muscat said the criminal charges alleged that he ""took €30 million.""
 That is a reference to a section of the legal document, related to prosecutors' asset freezing requests, which lists a monetary sum alongside the name of each accused person. 
 Prosecutors requested a freezing order of €30 million against Muscat, Schembri, Mizzi and four others - Spiteri, Vella, Hillman and Sladden. That is the maximum amount that will be frozen for each of those cited, and does not necessarily reflect the amount of assets identified for each of them. 
 On Monday, Prime Minister Robert Abela shot down suggestions that Muscat or any other individual had pocketed €30 million through the fraud.
 The single-largest freezing order targets Steward lawyer Meli and is of €32 million. 
 Other freezing orders have been filed against Tonna and Cini (€20 million),  Bondin, (€12 million), Vassallo (€11 million), Gatt (€7 million) and Conger-Thompson (€1 million). 
 Prosecutors have also filed charges against a number of companies owned by individuals cited for criminal prosecution.
 They include Kasco Engineering, FSV Ltd, Sciacca Grill Ltd, Mtrace Ltd, Technoline Ltd, Eurybates Ltd, Nexia BT, Gateway Solutions and Taomac Ltd. 
 
 While the group of 23 stand accused of major crimes, they are not the only ones to stand accused of criminal acts in relation to the hospitals deal. 
 A second group of indictees will see deputy prime minister Chris Fearne, Central Bank governor (and former minister) Edward Scicluna and a host of former government permanent secretaries and lawyers face  charges of fraud. 
  That group includes top civil servants Alfred Camilleri, Joseph Rapa and Ronald Mizzi, as well as lawyers who represented the government, Steward and Vitals. 
 Camilleri was the finance ministry's permanent secretary for over a decade. Rapa fulfilled that role within the health ministry while Mizzi was the top civil servant under Konrad Mizzi. 
 Times of Malta can also confirm that Magistrate Rachel Montebello has been assigned to preside over their cases.
 Montebello, who specialises in money laundering cases, was assigned the high-profile cases on Tuesday morning and is expected to set arraignment dates and notify the people facing charges later this week.
 Criminal charges were filed in court on Monday afternoon and leaked on Tuesday. 
 Muscat, who will be defended in the case by a legal team made up of Vincent Galea, Charlon Gouder, Ishmael Psaila and Etienne Borg Ferranti, has described the charges as a ""personal vendetta"" and an ""abomination"". 
 Mizzi and Schembri have not commented on the case. They are both expected to be represented by lawyers Edward Gatt and Mark Vassallo. 
 The criminal charges are based on the findings of a magisterial inquiry that was concluded late last month. 
 That inquiry remains secret and it is therefore still unclear on what basis each of the respective charges has been filed.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/we-accept-this-law-students-slam-pm-criticising-judiciary.1092086,"The Prime Minister has a responsibility not to pit the judiciary against the public with his statements, law students said in a demonstration outside the law courts on Tuesday. 
 Robert Abela’s statements clearly indicate that the government believes the judiciary institution is against the people, Għaqda Studenti tal-Liġi (GħSL) president Andrew Drago said. 
  He was addressing a crowd of students, politicians, and activists who protested outside the law courts in Valletta over attacks on the judiciary in the wake of the publication of the Vitals magisterial inquiry report.
 Several students, mainly hailing from the law course, and others turned up on Tuesday evening to express their anger at Abela’s statements and to show their solidarity with the judiciary.
 Many held placards reading “No one is above the law” and “Students for justice”.
  Several politicians also showed up in support, including PN leader Bernard Grech, PN MEP David Casa, and PN MP Eve Borg Bonello, who is also a law student.
 Independent MEP candidate Arnold Cassola and Robert Aquilina, a member of rule of law group Repubblika, were all in attendance.
 On Monday Abela held a press conference to confirm that prosecutors have filed  criminal charges against his predecessor Joseph Muscat and others.
 His comments earned him rebuke from NGOs, who said that his comments were 'authoritarian' and a 'threat to democracy', particularly those directed at  Magistrate Gabriella Vella, who oversaw the magisterial inquiry into the sale of the hospitals to Vitals.
 Earlier on Tuesday, Times of Malta confirmed Muscat, his chief-of-staff Keith Schembri, ex-minister Konrad Mizzi, and 19 other individuals and companies will be  charged with money laundering, corruption and bribery and other serious crimes. 
  Speaking outside the law courts, beside a large picture of Daphne Caruana Galizia, Drago said when Abela is speaking during a press conference, he is not speaking as a lawyer or for himself, but as a representative of the government. 
 “The position the Prime Minister adopted yesterday was clear, that these institutions (law courts) are working against the public,” he said. 
 “We, as GħSL, will not accept this. If Abela does not trust the magistrate, why does he not go to the Commission for the Administration of Justice? We know why because his reasons for undermining the inquiring magistrate are unreasonable and not based on anything apart from political gain.”
 He called on the students to not allow the government to touch the courts. 
 “We believe too much in the rule of law and we students will not allow you to touch this institution,” Drago ended his speech.
 “My appeal to the government is that you need to realise you are the state and you need to defend us, not political partisan.”
  Student and GħSL vice president Laura Chetcuti Dimech slammed Abela’s comments and attacks on the judiciary, especially after his thesis reflects on judicial interference. 
 “A judge must be free from political or other pressures,” Chetcuti Dimech read, quoting Abela’s 2002 Maltese LL.D thesis titled ‘Judicial Accountability and Impeachment”.
  “If you want to read it, this thesis was written by Robert Abela,” she said, as the crowd erupted in claps and cheers. 
 Abela has repeatedly argued that, by law, Vella should have concluded her inquiry within 60 days and that the four-year period it took her to complete work on the Vitals one was “exaggerated”. 
 But Chetcuti Dimech said that inquiries take longer to conclude due to the other works a magistrate must follow, and due to the limited pool of court experts available, meaning the compilation of reports is delayed. 
 The protest was also addressed by KSU president Luke Bonanno, GħSL policy officer Michael Spiteri and Kunsill Nazzjonali taż-Żghażagħ national officer Sarah Xuereb.

https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/132408/department_of_contracts_was_not_involved_in_the_vitals_concession_former_director_general_confirms,"Former Director General of the Department of Contracts, Anthony Cachia, confirmed that the department was not involved in the Vitals concession since, at the time, the department would not involve itself in public service concession.

 Criminal proceedings against former deputy prime minister Chris Fearne, former minister Edward Scicluna and others resumed on Friday morning before the Court presided over by Magistrate Leonard Caruana.

                     The sitting began with lead prosecutor Francesco Refalo informing the Court that Samuel Sittlington, a forensic expert involved in the inquiry, was not able to testify under cross-examination in person, but was ready to do so via video-conferencing. Magistrate Caruana offered the defence lawyers the choice of making oral submissions on the matter during the same sitting or written submissions within one week.

 Following a short suspension of the sitting, defence lawyer Stephen Tonna Lowell informed the Court that a written response, in due time, would be preferable. This was the collective sentiment of the defence lawyers.

 The first witness to take the stand was financial controller Bernice Bugeja, who informed the Court that she was asked to present invoices of payments to experts. She informed the Court that whilst certain invoices related to the case at hand, several others, around 40% off-hand, pertained to unrelated magisterial inquiries. These could not be divulged.

 The Court ruled that only those relevant, ‘easily presentable’ invoices be presented.

 Deputy Registrar Marbeck Spiteri also took the stand, presenting the proceedings of the civil case filed by Adrian Delia against the government, leading to the recission of the contract by the Civil Court.

 At this juncture, defence lawyer Tonna Lowell argued that the prosecution should explain the probatory relevance of these proceedings. Whilst prosecution lawyer Refalo said that the evidence was being presented for the sake of completeness, the defence lawyers collectively objected, arguing that said evidence lacks probatory value and that the defendants were not involved in the civil proceedings.

 Defence lawyer Franco Galea pointed out that should the prosecution decide to rest on such proof, it must indicate against which defendants such proof is to be used.

 The Court accepted the admissibility of the proceedings.

 Former DoC director testifies

 During his testimony, former director general of the Department of Contracts Anthony Cachia told the Court that in 2016, relevant laws were introduced regarding the regulation of public service concessions.

 Prior to this date, the department of contracts did not involve itself in such concessions.

 The Court heard that during a meeting in 2015 attended by Cachia and others, the hospital concession was deemed to qualify as a public service concession, with the result that Projects Malta, rather than the department, involved itself in the management of the tender process.

 Roderick Livori, a Planning Authority unit manager, presented information on the invoices and payments associated with the Vitals applications. Of these, the majority involved payments made by, or on behalf of, Ram Tumuluri.

 Following his testimony, several witnesses on behalf of a number of banks including Bank of Valletta, APS, HSBC, BNF, Sparkasse Bank, and Lidion Bank, took the stand and submitted documents relating to the accused and their respective bank account statements.

 The case was adjourned to 17 January 2025, at 9.30am, making this the last sitting for the year.     "

 The police said the four-year-old was hit by a Toyota HiAce on Triq Annetto Caruana.
 The accident happened at about 8pm.
 The van was being driven by a 28-year-old man from Birkirkara.
 The boy is being treated in hospital. The police are investigating.  "
https://timesofmalta.com/article/hands-off-courts-bankers-union-financial-services-bodies.1092283,"Four financial services bodies expressed “deep concern about the current situation in the country"", condemning “unacceptable” attacks on members of the judiciary and their work.
 The warning by the Institute of Financial Services Practitioners, Malta Institute of Accountants, Malta Institute of Taxation and the Society of Trusts and Estate Practitioners follows scorn heaped by Robert Abela and Joseph Muscat on a magistrate and her inquiry into the Vitals' hospitals deal.
 That magisterial inquiry triggered criminal charges against top political figures including Muscat, his chief of staff Keith Schembri, former health minister Konrad Mizzi, deputy prime minister Chris Fearne and central bank governor Edward Scicluna.
 Abela repeatedly claimed the magistrate purposely delayed the conclusions, that the inquiry was biased and that sections of the judiciary were part of an ""establishment"" that was out to destroy the Labour Party.
 His comments earned him rebuke from NGOs,  law students,  employers and  President Myriam Spiteri Debono among others.
 On Friday the financial services bodies said such statements and actions undermined the independence and proper functioning of the country’s democratic institutions and also the public’s confidence in the judiciary.
 “Attacks on the rule of law, members of the judiciary, or the judicial process itself are unacceptable in a democratic society,"" they said, warning of ""untold repercussions that could have a severe, detrimental and lasting effect on the social well-being and stability of Malta"".
 Like the Chamber of SMEs, they also sounded the alarm about irreparable damage to the island's reputation in the eyes of current and future investors, economic operators, practitioners in the financial services industry and assessors.
 The financial services bodies said the judiciary deserved the highest respect and should be allowed to function with “complete serenity”.  
 “Any doubts should be addressed through the proper institutional channels that exist in a democratic country like Malta, such as the Commission for the Administration of Justice and certainly not via the media or political platforms,” they said.
 The four financial services professional associations said their sector had been painstakingly built over 35 years, was a major contributor to Malta’s economy and a large employer.
 “Any damage to our reputation as a stable, robust, and serious financial centre will negatively affect the country as a whole,” they said as they called on the authorities to act responsibly while upholding the principles of the rule of law, good governance and full respect for the country’s judiciary and the constitution.
 The Malta Union of Bank Employees separately denounced the attacks, calling for “a strict hands-off the law courts and the judiciary” and urging for “unconditional prudence and caution”.
 The union also condemned anyone instigating people to take to the streets at such sensitive times as it can only cause harm. 
 The PN has called a public protest linked to the Vitals hospitals scandal on Monday.
 The union of bank employees said that “anything short of good governance will seriously jeopardize our nation’s credibility and stability, posing serious potential risk to the country’s current and future wellbeing"".
 When asked about its position on Central Bank governor Edward Scicluna, the union told Times of Malta he should either suspend himself or resign.
 This also applies to anyone mentioned in the charges who holds public office, it said.

https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/132065/court_throws_out_second_request_to_declare_lilu_king_arrest_invalid,"A court has rejected a second request by Lilu King’s defence lawyers to declare his arrest invalid.

 In a decree issued on Thursday, Magistrate Gabriella Vella declared that the arrest of Mohamed Ali Ahmed Elmushraty, also known as Lilu King, was valid. This was the second attempt by his defence team to have his arrest declared invalid.

                     Lilu King is being charged with causing light injuries and breaching court-imposed conditions. The court heard last week that the incident arose from a misunderstanding in Arabic between Elmushraty and the victim. 

 Following the submission of medical certificates by the prosecution, the charge sheet was amended to reflect the injuries as grievous rather than light, with authorisation from Magistrate Kevan Azzopardi.

 Lawyer José Herrera argued that Elmushraty’s arrest was “totally illegal,” stating that a person may only be detained either by court order or due to an illegal arrest, not as part of judicial processes. 

 Lawyer Franco Debono added that Elmushraty was arrested based on bail conditions, though proceedings are yet to begin. Lawyer Jose Herrera reiterated that Elmushraty is neither accused nor charged, further emphasising the invalidity of Elmushraty’s arrest

 Inspector Eman Hayman stated that an expert had confirmed the injuries as “grievous”. He explained that the case proceeded under an arrest warrant, issued through a court application. He added that the Court, on 19 October 2024, was informed that the reason for Elmushraty’s arrest was not only due to the injuries but also for allegedly breaching bail conditions.

 Franco Debono concluded the defence’s statements saying that while the proceedings on the ‘light injury’ charge have ended, the proceedings on ‘grevious injury’ still need to begin.

 Debono informed the magistrate that he would be filing an application of habeas corpus, an action to examine the legality of a person’s detention under arrest. “Do what you have to do,” replied the magistrate.

 Lawyer Jose Herrera, Franco Debono, Martina Herrera, and Adriana Zammit were defence counsel.

 Inspector Eman Hayman, Superintendent Mario Haber, and lawyer Valentina Cassar led the prosecution.     "
https://timesofmalta.com/article/six-years-jail-dj-raped-19year-old-language-student.1093929,"A DJ who persuaded a 19-year-old English language student to go to his apartment where he raped her, ignoring her lack of consent, was condemned to a six-year effective jail term. 
 The rape took place on a Saturday night in October 2021 when Henry Alonso Cano Rojas, a then-32-year-old Columbian national working as a DJ at a Paceville club, asked the victim to go with him at around 3am. He did not say where he was going.
 The teen had spent the evening dancing and drinking with her friends at the club where they went every day during their stay in Malta. 
 She had approached the DJ, asking him to play some songs and danced with her friend close to the DJ stand. 
 At closing time, the teens lingered inside for a while, waiting for the crowd of clubbers to exit the premises. 
 Then, as the young woman and her friends stepped outside, the DJ grabbed her hand and told her to go with him. 
 “I don’t want to go with you. I have to stay with my friends. I cannot come,” the victim complained. 
 But the accused insisted.
 He momentarily let her go when she signalled to a female friend in Dutch that she needed help. 
 Her friend intervened and manoeuvred the victim away from the man whose attitude “annoyed” the subject of his attention. However, since her friends were around, she felt safe.
 As soon as her friend left her side to buy a pizza, the man grabbed her hand and pulled her to an apartment block nearby. 
 He asked her to help carry his bag of musical equipment upstairs and she accepted, never suspecting what she had let herself in for. She later rued that ""decision”.
 He told her to place his bag inside the bedroom and though reluctant, she stepped inside.
 That was when he shut the door and told her to have a look at the view from his bedroom balcony. 
 “Ok, nice, but I really need to leave right now,” the victim said. 
 As she turned to leave, he began to kiss her and pushed her onto the bed. 
 All her efforts to stop his unwelcome advances were futile. 
 Gripped by panic, she “just froze”.
 When recounting her ordeal she explained that “the only thing [she] could do was looking up to the ceiling like a lifeless body”.
 She just did not know “what to do anymore”. She managed to break free and stop the sexual act abruptly when the phone in her bag, lying on her chest, rang. 
 It was one of her friends calling to check on her. 
 The only thing she could say when she caught up with her friends outside the accused’s apartment block was “rape” in Dutch. 
 The next day the accused texted her, saying he was “sorry about last night”.
 He said he was “really drunk” and did not “remember anything”.
 She eventually filed a police report after confiding in her parents. Her father immediately caught a flight to Malta and went with her to the police. 
 The DJ was charged with rape and holding the alleged victim against her will. 
 He pleaded not guilty and opted to testify in the proceedings.
 The man said he had met the victim six or seven times over a span of three weeks.
 He had played her songs and they had danced together. 
 Her attitude made him feel that there was “something special between them” and he insisted that the sex was consensual. 
 When delivering judgment, the court, presided over by magistrate Rachel Montebello, observed that two conflicting versions of events did not necessarily mean that the accused was to be acquitted.
 In this case, after delving into the testimonies and all other evidence put forward, the court concluded that the victim’s version was more credible. 
 There were certain inconsistencies in the accused’s version.
 DNA evidence supported the victim’s version when saying that the sudden ringing of her phone had forced the accused to stop abruptly and get off her. 
 CCTV footage also showed him holding her hand as he led her to his apartment and friends’ testimonies corroborated the victim’s version. 
 There was nothing strange about the fact that the victim went back to the club after the incident, the court said. 
 She had frequented the place with her circle of friends while visiting the island as a language student.
 When all was considered, there was no room for equivocation that the victim was not consenting to any intimacy, let alone to sex, and the accused could not have failed to understand that. 
 The court also observed that if a party withdrew consent at any stage, even midway through the sexual act, making this clear to the other party and the latter persisted, then he was still guilty of rape.
 When all was considered, the court pronounced a conviction, condemning the accused to a six-year effective jail term and ordering his name to be included in the sex offenders’ register once judgment was final.

https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/128926/hospitals_inquiry_concluded_370_boxes_of_evidence_passed_on_to_attorney_general,"The magisterial inquiry into the sale of three public hospitals to Vitals Global Healthcare is complete and has been delivered to the Attorney General.
 This emerged in court on Tuesday from the testimony of the Registrar of the Criminal Courts Franklin Calleja.
 “The inquiry was concluded and closed last Thursday; it went to the AG on 25 April,” Calleja told Mr Justice Giovanni Grixti.
 The day coincided with the day when the nominations for European and local elections opened. Nominations closed on Monday at 7pm.
 Calleja was testifying in the case instituted by former prime minister Joseph Muscat to remove the inquiring magistrate.
 Asked by Muscat’s lawyer Vince Galea to explain the mechanics of the process, the registrar said the procès-verbal, after being exhibited in the registry, is sent together with all exhibits to the AG. Calleja said 78 boxes of evidence had been sent together with the inquiry.
 So far, no information about the outcome of the inquiry has emerged, but the hostile stance adopted by Prime Minister Robert Abela last Sunday suggests an unfavourable outcome for his party.
 Abela accused the judiciary of “political terrorism”, a statement repeated by Muscat to reporters as he entered the law courts on Tuesday morning.
 READ ALSO:  Abela doubles down on ‘political terrorism’ remarks - Magistrate purposely chose start of election campaign to conclude inquiry
 In court on Tuesday, Galea asked Mr. Justice Grixti to order the exhibition of the inquiry file in these proceedings, asking the judge to bear in mind “that the AG was also a party in this case.” The law gives the AG discretion to refuse him access to the inquiry, he added. “She hasn’t said that so far,” the judge shot back.
 Muscat had not received the initial report of a crime and had not been indicated in it, Galea said . This, together with the fact that the Magistrate had refused to Muscat's request that she recuse herself, all imbued Muscat with juridical interest in the inquiry, argued Galea, telling the court that unless the request was upheld, there would be a likelihood of a breach of fundamental rights.
 The Constitution and ECHR both empowered the court to take action when a breach of fundamental rights is likely, he said. “So we cannot just wait for the court to decide and then order him to be returned to the position he was before the breach of rights took place.”
 The lawyer also claimed inequality of arms. “I am currently in a position where I will have to make suppositions before the court while another party to the case, the AG, has a document in her possession which allows her to counter us without showing her hand…How can I prove details in the inquiry record without having seen it, but the other side has?”
 Lawyer James D’Agostino, representing the State Advocate, replied that the law establishes a procedure in the law which gives the AG discretion to decide whether or not to grant a party’s request for access to the inquiry. It also set up a procedure for redress if the party felt aggrieved by that decision. Although the court had wide ranging powers, it still had to stay within the parameters established by the law, he said. 
 But Muscat’s lawyer asked that the disgraced former Prime Minister be returned to the position he had been in before the inquiry’s conclusion - which would necessitate the replacement of the inquiring magistrate and the inquiry starting afresh.
 “If the court is convinced that there was a breach of rights, it must put the complainant in the position he had been in before the breach took place. You have to change the inquiring magistrate. You might say ‘what’s done is done,’ but…the court can take you back to any stage of the proceedings.”
 He repeated that Muscat had not been mentioned in the initial report about the crime, but the Judge deftly replied that Muscat had simply become a person of interest in the inquiry at a late stage. 
 “The AG has powers and duties established by law, which is equal for all,” submitted the State Advocate, accusing Muscat’s lawyers of trying to “pull the rug” from beneath the court..“We cannot deviate from the law. From his arguments I understand that the applicant is expecting us to ignore the law, and is also questioning the authority of the court in Strasbourg.”
 “If we were to act differently to the norms established by the European Court of Human Rights, then some local lawyer will pipe up and say we are breaching his fundamental rights. So it is wise that our courts follow legal doctrines established by Strasbourg.” 
 The conditions specified in the interim measure were clear and specific, D’Agostino said. “We cannot go beyond them, or we are risking affecting the case on the merits.”
 The court, having heard the lengthy technical submissions on the requests for both requests, adjourned the proceedings to May 9, when it will issue its decree on the requests.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/court-expert-sam-sittlington-testify-remotely-vitals-case.1101385,"Court expert Sam Sittlington is asking to testify remotely in the Vitals case, as a court heard on Friday that he cannot appear in person.
 The case against former Deputy Prime Minister Chris Fearne, former Finance Minister Edward Scicluna, and others charged with ""lesser crimes"" connected to the hospital deal scandal continued with Magistrate Leonard Caruana presiding. During the hearing, experts presented invoices, bank statements, and court judgments.
 Lead prosecutor Francesco Refalo informed the court that Sittlington, a forensic expert who worked on the Vitals inquiry, would not be available for in-person cross-examination. Instead, he requested to testify via video conferencing. The court acknowledged the request, and submissions on the matter will be made in writing.
 Sittlington is among 26 forensic analysts and experts whose involvement is being contested by the defendants. He has faced pressure from the defence team, which accused him of  leveraging his role as a court expert to secure a lucrative position as a police consultant.
 The accused include former Health Minister Chris Fearne, Central Bank Governor Edward Scicluna, and several others, including: Ronald Mizzi, 41, permanent secretary; Alfred Camilleri, 64, former permanent secretary; Joseph Rapa, 57, public official; Kenneth Deguara, 44, employee; Kevin Deguara, 47, lawyer; Jean Carl Farrugia, 48, lawyer; Deborah Anne Chappell, 37, lawyer; Bradley Gatt, 43, lawyer; Aron Mifsud Bonnici, 50, lawyer; James Camenzuli, 53, engineer; Manuel Castagna, 50, accountant; and Robert Borg, 50, auditor.
 This group includes lawyers, civil servants, and members of the adjudication committee that awarded the lucrative contract to run three state hospitals—St Luke’s Hospital, Karin Grech Hospital, and Gozo General Hospital—to Vitals Global Healthcare in 2015. Steward Healthcare assumed control of the concession in 2018.
 All defendants have pleaded not guilty to charges including fraud, misappropriation, and fraudulent gain related to the hospital deal. Unlike the first group of individuals charged in connection with the scandal, this group does not face accusations of bribery or trading in influence.
 Malta’s political sphere has been shaken since the conclusion of the Vitals inquiry in May, which led to charges against former Prime Minister Joseph Muscat and his associates for more serious crimes.
 During the session, financial controller Bernice Bugeja testified that she was tasked with examining box files of invoices. Her role involved identifying who was paid, how much, and for what, and whether payment criteria had been met. She noted that some invoices related to this case, while others pertained to unrelated magisterial inquiries. The court ruled that only relevant invoices be presented, while the others would undergo further analysis.
 Deputy registrar Marbeck Spiteri submitted court judgments from a case filed by Adrian Delia against the government of Malta. These judgments led to the annulment of the hospital privatisation deal. An appeals court confirmed the annulment, citing ""collusion between Steward and senior government officials or its agencies,"" in contrast to the initial judgment, which had attributed the fraud solely to Steward. Defence lawyers argued that these judgments were not admissible as evidence in this case.
 Anthony Cachia, former director general of the Contracts Department, testified about a meeting on March 25, 2015, with permanent secretary Ronald Mizzi and representatives from Projects Malta to discuss the hospital concession's technicalities. He explained that Malta’s accession to the EU highlighted a lack of regulation for public service concessions, leading the country to introduce relevant laws in 2016.
 During the 2015 meeting, Cachia and others determined that the hospital concession met the definition of a public service concession. Consequently, Projects Malta, rather than the Contracts Department, was tasked with managing the tender process.
 The case will continue on January 17 and 21.

Before magistrate Caroline Farrugia Frendo on Tuesday, inspector Antonello Magri charged 58-year-old Fabian Mifsud with criminal damage, carrying a knife in public without a police permit and breaching the peace.  Inspector Magri told the court that officers from the Zabbar police station were dispatched to deal with a report of an argument, in which a knife and metal bar had been used.  They found Mifsud, in a highly agitated state, at the scene. The victim had told the police that he had argued with Mifsud, who then pulled a knife on him. After the victim fled, Mifsud had then proceeded to smash the windows of the victim’s car with a metal rod.  A video of the incident is doing the rounds on social media.  Mifsud pleaded guilty to the charges.  His defence lawyer, Franco Debono, explained that the man had been “friendly” with the victim’s daughter - some 20 years his junior, and that the victim would “go and bother him about it.”  “He keeps sending the police to my house,” piped up the defendant.  The incident “was provoked by the victim’s attitude,” said the lawyer, stressing the early guilty plea in his submissions on punishment, adding that the defendant was prepared to pay for the damages.  “The issue is that when the relationship with the daughter is not in a happy place, the man starts calling her up,” said inspector Magri.  He echoed Debono’s suggestion of a suspended sentence, and requested a suspended sentence, as well as a restraining order in favour of the parte civile’s family.  Finding him guilty as charged, the court sentenced Mifsud to imprisonment for six months, which were suspended for one year and ordered the man to pay €980 for the damage he had caused, within six months.  A restraining order in favour of the victim and his wife was also issued.  Lawyer Charles Mercieca is also representing the defendant.  """

https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/130791/man_admits_to_violent_grocery_store_robbery,"A man has been jailed and sent to rehab after he admitted to carrying out a violent robbery at a Gzira grocery store on Saturday, allegedly to finance his €7,000 monthly cocaine habit.
 Police inspector Darryl Farr, assisted by prosecutor Clive Aquilina arraigned Wyatt Zammit before magistrate Yana Micallef Stafrace on Monday.
  Zammit, 37, from Santa Lucija was charged with theft aggravated by violence, value and time, Zammit was also accused of illegally detaining the shop’s female cashier and causing her to fear that she would be subjected to violence. 
 He was further accused of breaching bail conditions that were imposed in July this year when he had been arraigned on unrelated charges.
 It is understood that the police had received a phone call from the shop in Gzira at around 9pm on 17 August, reporting that a hold-up had just taken place at the shop in question.
 The police, together with inspector Farr had gone to the scene and collected CCTV footage, from which it emerged that the suspect, who did not attempt to conceal his identity, might be Zammit. He was then arrested on Sunday.
 Sources said that after allowing a previous shopper to leave, Zammit had walked around the counter and pushed the cashier against a wall, before proceeding to help himself to the contents of the till. No weapons are believed to have been used during the robbery. Zammit was arrested on Sunday and, during a search carried out at his girlfriend’s house, the police found the clothes similar to those worn by the suspect during the robbery.
 The motive behind the robbery is believed to be the financing of Zammit’s consumption of cocaine, on which the MaltaToday is told, but is not in a position to confirm, he is spending around €7,000 every month.
 Before the sitting began, the parties were allowed to approach the bench, where they discussed the case with the magistrate for several minutes.
 After the representatives of the parties returned to their places in the courtroom, Zammit, who told the court that he was unemployed, pleaded guilty to the charges.
 In view of his admission of guilt, the court proceeded to impose a sentence of imprisonment for two years, and ordered to pay a €500 fine. The court confiscated €2,500 that he had provided as bail security in addition to the fine. Zammit was placed under a three-year treatment order and ordered to return the €436 he had stolen within six months. A three-year protection order was issued in favour of the cashier or her boss.
 “You cannot approach or talk to these people,” warned the court. “If you need to do so, speak to your lawyer or to the police inspector.”
 Prosecutor Clive Aquilina prosecuted together with police inspector Darryl Farr, while lawyer Ilona Schembri assisted Zammit as legal aid counsel.  "
https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/132407/family_gets_21600_compensation_following_bus_crash_which_left_house_in_danger_of_collapsing,"The Court on Thursday ordered Malta Public Transport and one of its drivers to pay a family €21,600 in compensation after a bus crash damaging their house forced them to rent out an alternative residence.

 The crash, which took place on 23 January 2019 in Zabbar Road, Paola, caused significant damage to the family’s house, so much so that it was left in ‘danger of collapsing’. This forced the plaintiff and his family to leave the premises so that the necessary repairs could be made.

                     The Court, presided over by Justice Toni Abela recognised that there had been an admission of responsibility on the part of the defendants, noting that the case was limited merely to the amount of compensation to be granted, upon which the parties were in disagreement.

 During the proceedings it was revealed that the house in question was subsequently sold, with the new owners continuing the necessary repairs.

 The Court noted that the amount of compensation to be determined had to refer solely to the period leading up until the transfer of the property, and considered the rent payments made by the plaintiff and his family.

 The company and driver were ultimately ordered to pay €21,600 in compensation.     "
https://timesofmalta.com/article/complaints-payment-disruptions-following-probe-card-issuer.1094364,"Customers of a payment card issued by a financial entity in Gżira that was searched by police in connection with alleged money laundering say they have been unable to access their funds for several months.
 A number of Blackcatcard customers told Times of Malta they have been unable to make bank transfers using the SEPA network – a system for transferring funds between European bank accounts – since at least February.
 The card is issued by Papaya Ltd, a company that hit the headlines, also in February, after it emerged the firm was the focal point of a large-scale investigation into an alleged “Russian-Eurasian criminal network”.
 Papaya Ltd insists SEPA services are available, with a “significant fraction” of Blackcatcard customers able to make such transfers.
  In February, Times of Malta revealed police had carried out searches of the financial entity as part of an international investigation into alleged money laundering.
  In a statement at the time, the company said the investigation reported in the media – which it said focused on some of its clients and not the company – did “not affect Papaya’s business”, stressing its operations were continuing as normal.
 But, according to its customers, this is not the case; Blackcatcard account holders say they have been unable to make Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) for months.
 They also say they have been left without an International Bank Account Number (IBAN), leaving them unable to transfer money to other bank accounts using alternative methods.
 Blackcatcard customers who spoke to Times of Malta on condition of anonymity said they have been unable to withdraw funds since around the time of the investigation, with one saying he had “no way to get it [the funds] back; SEPA is impossible now.”
 Another customer said he is a business customer of Blackcatcard, and the lack of bank transfer functionality had left his company “unable to transfer money, pay online with card or withdraw from an ATM [cash machine],” adding he had been waiting almost 40 days for the delivery of a new card from the company.
 “Our company has a pretty big sum on the account, I am very nervous already. Nothing is working properly in this institution over the last months.”
 
 He and others said they had been told by Papaya it had recently partnered with UK-based company Tompay to restore SEPA payments and was rolling out IBANs to customers “in batches”.
 But despite the promise, they have still not received an IBAN.
 “We were assured more than a month ago by phone from Papaya we will be in the first batch in connecting to new IBANs, but still nothing. Hours spent on [customer support] chat, but in vain,” the customer said.
 One corporate service provider said his client had been attempting “incessantly” to retrieve his funds and had also been left without an IBAN number after being promised one “weeks ago”.
 Blasting Papaya and Blackcatcard for “tarnishing Malta’s reputation,” he said the shareholders of his client’s company were becoming concerned over the lack of clarity.
  Meanwhile, a look at the company’s support channel on Telegram – which one customer said had recently been closed to new comments – reveals a host of ongoing complaints about the issue stretching back to February.
 Responding to questions, Papaya said it had onboarded a SEPA provider in January to provide customers with SEPA Instant transfers, with the new provider’s “embedment into the Blackcatcard ecosystem up and running as planned”.
 SEPA Instant is a quicker way of making SEPA payments introduced across the bloc in March following the adoption of a European Council regulation in February.
 It said that while a “significant fraction” of its customers were able to “enjoy their SEPA services as usual”, the company was rolling out the feature “in batches” due to the number of customers needing to be reconnected to the system.
 “The exact timeline for the complete restoration of SEPA functionality for every single client is hard to pin down... But rest assured, we are tirelessly working to speed up the process and to ensure that every client is reconnected to SEPA as swiftly as possible,” it said.
 The company said it was “not aware of the clients’ personas you are mentioning in your inquiry”, stressing its clients had “unrestricted access to their funds all the time”.
 It added that Papaya “has not ever had any accusations against its operations, ownership, management, or employees” and that it maintained a “strong working relationship” with Maltese and European authorities.
 The company reiterated that the investigation reported in the media did “not impact the functionality of the organisation or its services in any way” and said it had “no intentions of withdrawing from the Blackcatcard ecosystem”.
 When contacted, Tompay told Times of Malta it did “not comment on our relationships with clients, partners, service provi­ders, and financial institutions”.

https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/131356/judge_calls_on_authorities_to_reconsider_withdrawal_of_human_protection_from_ukrainian_mother_daughter_,"A judge has called upon the authorities to reconsider the decision to withdraw humanitarian protection from a Ukrainian mother and daughter that was originally granted in 2016, in a decision which however, rejected their claim that their fundamental rights had been breached by it.
 Oksana Volodymyrivna Solopko and Aryna Tsovma had filed constitutional proceedings against the International Protection Agency (IPA), the Minister responsible, as well as the State Advocate in December 2021, arguing that the agency’s decision to revoke their Temporary Humanitarian Protection (THP) was null because they were not given an opportunity to make submissions before it was taken.
  The plaintiffs argued that Malta’s Procedural Standards for Granting and Withdrawing International Protection Regulations, which was meant to implement the corresponding EU directive, did not implement the right to an effective remedy before a court or tribunal as is specified in the directive.
 They argued that in terms of the directive, any decision to withdraw a person’s international protection must be preceded by a written notice, informing that person that their protection was being reconsidered.
 It also obliged the Member State to ensure that the person under protection be given an opportunity to explain why they believe their protection should continue, either in writing or through an individual interview.
 In addition, any decision by the competent authority to revoke THP must be made in written form and include a declaration of the factual and legal reasons behind it, as well as information on how to contest it.
 They pointed out that Malta’s International Protection Act specifically precludes the possibility of doing so, stating that “no appeal shall lie from a decision by the International Protection Agency to revoke, end or not renew temporary humanitarian protection.”
 This, the plaintiffs argued, ran contrary to the fundamental legal principles of hearing both parties and of not having an arbiter decide a case in which he is also a party. They asked the court to declare that this provision of the law breached their human rights, order the reinstatement of their THP status, as well as to provide a means for them to appeal the IPA decision.
 The defendants: the IPA, the Minister responsible and the State Advocate, rebutted the claims, pointing out that the Ukrainian plaintiffs had applied for international protection in March 2016. Temporary protection had been granted the following month in order for them to be able to safely return to Ukraine or be accepted by another safe country.
 This temporary protection had been granted on the basis of internal policy, argued the defendants. In 2017, the IPA had concluded that there was no basis for their claim for international protection, because the persecution they were alleging did not correspond with the accepted definition of persecution under the Geneva Convention. Neither was there a reason to believe that their return to Ukraine would result in a serious risk of serious harm under Maltese law, they said.
 However, in view of documented improvement in the child’s asthma due to Malta’s climate, the agency had granted THP to the mother and daughter with the intention that their documentation be updated on an annual basis.
 This was the state of play until August 2021, when the agency, after consulting with the applicants’ Medical Country of Origin Information, discovered that the medicine that was being used to treat the child’s asthma was available in Ukraine’s capital city, Kyiv.  The reply adds that many places in Ukraine had good air quality, “in particular Kharkiv and Donetsk,” where the mother and daughter had previously resided.
 These factors had led the agency to conclude that the applicants could safely return to Ukraine, and on September 3, 2021 it revoked their THP on the basis that they no longer qualified it.
 The defendants argued that the right to a fair hearing did not apply because neither the agency, nor the tribunal were there to determine rights, civil obligations or criminal charges.
 In his judgement in this case, Mr. Justice Toni Abela made reference to a number of previous court decisions, both at the local and at European level, concluding amongst other things, that the right to appeal in civil matters was not the same right to appeal in the criminal law sphere. “That which is guaranteed outside the area of criminal law is the respect for the procedural safeguards to a fair hearing (the objective test) and of the integrity of the judge himself, [who should be] ideal and free of every partiality and prejudice (the subjective test).”
 “...Even the Convention allows the right to appeal as a right protected by article 6 which deals only with appeals from criminal cases and not civil ones,” said the judge.
 Quoting from a Constitutional Court decision in a similar case, he wrote:
 “In essence, the Constitutional Court observed that ‘ the entire process - both before the Agency as well as before the Tribunal - is handled as a process that it not about the determination of civil rights or obligations or criminal charges, and therefore is not subject to article 39 of the Constitution or article 6 of the Convention [which enshrine the right to a fair hearing]. 
 “Essentially, the plaintiff’s argument is based on the assertion that ‘applications for asylum status are dealt with as a civil right.’ and that the proceedings before the Tribunal are ‘procedures against her,’ which is not the case.”
 But while dismissing the woman’s case and claims on these grounds, the judge said he was “rather concerned about the fact that if the applicants are to be sent back, they would have to return to Ukraine.” Judge Abela also noted that the two places specified by the Medical Country of Origin Information as having ideal air quality were Kharkiv and Donestsk, which are currently war zones.
 “For this reason, this Court appeals to the defendants to reconsider their decision in the light of these wartime circumstances.”  "
https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/132641/_gozitanaustralian_billionaire_adrian_portelli_faces_nine_charges_over_alleged_unlawful_lottery,"Gozitan-Australian ‘Lambo Guy’ Adrian Portelli is facing nine charges in South Australia of assisting in the conduct of an unlawful lottery.

 His company, Xclusive Tech Pty Ltd, which operates under the name LMCT+, is facing 10 charges for conducting or assisting in the conduct of an unlawful lottery.

                     Portelli is an Australian entrepreneur of Gozitan heritage, and recently made headlines after visiting the Maltese islands with his supercar McLaren P1. Back in April 2023, he also made headlines for buying Melbourne’s most expensive apartment – a double-storey penthouse worth €23.2 million.

 In 2018, Portelli founded LMCT+, a promotions and giveaway. The company conducts regular giveaways, with members getting entry into the draw for a monthly subscription fee.

 Last year, reports emerged that he was being investigated by Australian gambling regulators over allegations it breached gambling laws.

 His company offers members subscriptions to a “rewards club”. They also then get entries to win cars and properties.

 The model is known as a trade promotion lottery. Under South Australian law, any trade promotion lotteries with prizes exceeding $5,000 need a licence to operate and entries must be free of charge.

 Participants may have to purchase goods or services to enter, but they cannot charge more than the normal price for those goods or services.

 South Australia’s Consumer and Business Services (CBS) had investigated, and was now taking Portelli and his company to court. According to court documents, the incidents occurred between 29 January 2023 and 16 May 2024.

 The charges against Xclusive Tech (trading as LMCT+) included conducting/assisting in the conduct of an unlawful lottery through a subscription that gave entries to a lottery.

 “The major prize for the lottery was a property situated in Gisborne in the state of Victoria as seen on the Australian television show The Block, or a cash prize of $3,000,000,” court documents said. Giving away the prize “involved an element of chance” but the defendant “did not hold a licence to conduct the lottery in South Australia”.

 Two other Block properties, one valued at about $2.9m and the other not given a value were offered as prizes, with cash prizes of $2.5m and $2m respectively offered as alternatives. Another property on the Gold Coast valued at $1.3m was also a major prize.

 Other prizes mentioned included a “Devil Yellow HSV VZ” car, a “Toyota LandCruiser 79 series” car with a “barcrusher 670c” valued at $228,000, other cars, and cash prizes of $250,000 and $500,000.

 The charges against Portelli were for assisting in the conduct of a unlawful lotteries.

 Each charge for conducting, or assisting in conducting an unlawful lottery carries a maximum penalty of $10,000.

 The hearing is listed for the Adelaide magistrates court on 15 January 2025.     "
https://timesofmalta.com/article/teen-barred-handball-wheelchair-takes-association-court.1101378,"The parents of a 16-year-old boy with spina bifida have filed a judicial protest on his behalf against the Malta Handball Association (MHA), accusing it of discrimination after their son was barred from serving as a reserve player on a local handball team.
 Last month, Times of Malta reported that  Thomas Mifsud, a teenage athlete and wheelchair user, had started training at a handball club alongside his friends.
 Thomas, who described himself as an avid swimmer and a dedicated gym-goer, said he performed well during handball tryouts. His efforts earned him a spot as a reserve goalkeeper on the team.
 However, this progress was halted when it became clear that Thomas used a wheelchair. He was subsequently informed that he could not be registered as a player in the league.
 Thomas’s parents, Nicolette and Samuel Mifsud, have filed a judicial protest against the entire committee of the MHA, including Daniel Tabone, Joseph Aquilina, Adam Sule Soares, Vanessa Cutajar Mifsud, David Ruch, Guy Bischoff, and Warren Farrugia.
 The protest states that Thomas’s participation in handball training allowed him to play a sport with peers who do not have disabilities. His parents argued that his wheelchair did not pose any health or safety risks during training and was well-accepted by his teammates.
 “When the other children adjusted and began playing with Thomas just as they would with any other teammate, the training sessions went smoothly, and Thomas was enjoying the sport he loves,” the protest stated.
 Thomas’s coach selected him to serve as a substitute goalkeeper for the first under-19 league game on October 20. The team began the registration process with the MHA in line with the sport's rules.
 Less than 24 hours after submitting Thomas’s registration form, the team was informed that he could not be registered as a player because he used a wheelchair.
 According to the Mifsuds, this was the first time they heard of the MHA raising safety concerns about Thomas’s wheelchair. They claim the association only cited these concerns in media responses after the issue became public.
 The protest insists that no recognised handball rules explicitly prohibit wheelchair users from playing the sport.
 “The MHA is using these rules to justify the discrimination it is fostering by refusing to register Thomas Mifsud as a substitute goalkeeper,” the Mifsuds said in their protest.
 They also argued that Thomas’s wheelchair is specifically designed for sports and does not pose a safety risk to him or other players.
 As a goalkeeper, Thomas only occupies an 18-square-metre area, which is restricted to other players under the sport’s rules.
 The protest further noted that no complaints or concerns were raised by other parents or players.
 As a result of the decision, Thomas could not play on October 20, nor could he sit with his teammates or wear the team jersey. Instead, he was told to sit in the wheelchair-accessible spectator area, separated from his friends. Thomas chose not to attend the game.
 The Mifsuds claim the MHA’s decision violates the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the association's own safeguarding policy.
 “This decision creates a barrier for Thomas to continue practising the only sport he can play with his friends,” the parents stated.
 The Mifsuds revealed they had previously sent a legal letter to the MHA, but the issue remains unresolved.
 They have vowed to hold the MHA legally accountable unless the decision is reversed and Thomas is allowed to register as a player.
 The judicial protest was signed by lawyers Eve Borg Costanzi, Stephen Thake, and Robert Dingli.
 In previous comments to Times of Malta, the MHA maintained that it has done its utmost to include Thomas but that it must abide by the rules put in place to maintain the safety of other players. 
 At the time, they said that the Mifsuds had misinterpreted the rules of the game and while they don't specifically preclude wheelchairs, they do ban the presence of hard objects that could endanger players.

https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/130950/jason_azzopardi_accuses_top_lesa_officials_of_transferring_traffic_fines_onto_unsuspecting_tourists,"An urgent magisterial inquiry has been requested into an alleged multimillion euro racket involving top LESA officials, which fraudulently transferred penalty points incurred by Maltese drivers onto tourist rental cars.
 This involved diverting “millions of euros” in fines extracted from rental customers' deposits, into the pockets of private car rental companies, instead of the public purse.
 This and other explosive allegations emerge from a court application filed this morning by lawyer Jason Azzopardi.
 The application states that drivers who received speeding or other driving fines would approach LESA CEO Svetlick Flores and senior LESA customer care official Neville Camilleri - also a Rahal Gdid local councillor elected on a Labour Party ticket - who would use a software “backdoor” to access the LESA computer database undetected.
  From here, they would remove the contravention records and associated licence points from the “client” drivers and transfer them on to tourist rental vehicles, whose drivers would be none the wiser. 
 As the tourists’ driving licences are not Maltese, none of the licence penalty points would have any effect on them after they leave the islands.
 The racket has ingeniously created a win-win situation for all involved, bar LESA, reads the application. “The Maltese person’s licence penalty points and fine are forgiven, and his driving licence is saved. The car hire company pockets the fine deducted from the tourist’s credit card and the tourist…leaves [with no penalty points].”
 Azzopardi’s application outlines how the alleged scheme works:
 “1. The tourist goes to the car hire office, decides what car he wants and signs a contract for a period of time at an agreed price.
 2. The tourist also signs a document, declaring in advance, that if he receives a ticket for an offence which puts points on his licence, he accepts that those points would be transferred to him. “But In truth nothing will be transferred and the points will be deleted because a tourist has a foreign licence that isn’t in the Maltese driving licence database.”
 3. The tourist then pays for the rental in advance upon taking delivery of the car
 4. When taking payment for the rental, the car hire company also makes a €350 pre-authorisation on the credit card to cover future traffic fines or insurance excesses that may arise. The pre authorization is money blocked on the tourist's credit card.
 5. If a tourist commits a ticketable offence, regardless of whether they are still in Malta or not, the tourist will receive a copy of the ticket and can pay it directly on the LESA website. But the majority of tourists simply leave the matter in the hands of the car hire company, who should pay the fine on their behalf.
 6. Before the fine is paid, a declaration is sent to LESA, asking to transfer the penalty points on to the tourist.
 When dropping off a rental car, in a hurry not to miss their flights home, tourists would not question a €60 charge to their credit card for a traffic violation, much less return to Malta to contest it. 
 “In an ingenious and perfidious manner, but with almost pathological malice, this racket used common sense and organised evil, aided by an intentional lack of audit and forensic verification, in order for the public treasury to lose millions, while the corrupt line their pockets.”
 Although the scheme described was the most frequently used, Azzopardi said that there was also a second method, in which the tourist’s signature is copied from the rental contract, which LESA has a right to request, and forged on the Licence Penalty Points declaration.
 In the application, Azzopardi said that he has a number of witnesses willing to testify in the inquiry about the fact that many car rental companies are well aware of this racket which, he says, is widely used by Labour Party delegates.
 “The person making this denunciation knows that Prime Minister Robert Abela and Minister Byron Camilleri also have visibility over this racket and granted it tacit impunity to continue and entrench itself.”
 He alleged that while campaigning for last May’s local council elections, Neville Camilleri would tell people in the Rahal Gdid square to speak to anyone they know who had pending fines or licence points and recommend that they speak to him “so I can get them forgiven”.
 When such individuals would go to his LESA office, Camilleri “with the blessing, complicity and help of Svetlick Flores,” would use the backdoor access to the LESA computer system and transfer the licence points away from the Maltese person who had reached out to him, and on to a tourist “who had the misfortune of renting a car in their name, in Malta”.
 The lawyer estimated that hundreds of people had been directed by Labour Party customer care to Neville Camilleri over the last three years, for this purpose.
 Azzopardi also declared under oath that his sources include LESA insiders, who are also Labour supporters “who could not bear the filth that is emerging anymore,” as well as private car rental companies and others who bound him under professional secrecy not to reveal their identities. Some had insisted on meeting Azzopardi “at a remote and abandoned place”, so great was their fear of being identified, he said.
 In 2022 and 2023, Walid Ouhida, the owner of WT Global, whose fleet of around 360 vehicles makes it Malta’s largest cab supplier, was identified as one of the largest beneficiaries of the racket. The court application states that hundreds of penalty points were transferred away from the cab drivers he employed, on to unsuspecting tourists.
 The application calls for a magisterial inquiry to establish whether the crimes of criminal conspiracy, participation in a criminal organisation, making false declarations to a public authority, trading in influence by public officials, and money laundering specifically by Flores and Camilleri.
 Azzopardi said that although he had been collecting the information provided by several individuals since November 2023, an inquiry had to be urgently appointed to preserve the evidence. The lawyer claimed that three different sources inside LESA had informed him that a process of deleting the false database entries made by Camilleri was already underway, after Flores got wind of the leak about the racket. 
 “Just yesterday, an order was issued to the effect that every LESA employee had to sign a declaration that they had no ‘conflicts of interest’, which effectively intends to stop any employee at LESA from speaking about or revealing the web of corruption inside LESA.”
 That order emerges from an email sent yesterday by Marita Bianco, a Senior Officer and Administrator at LESA to all heads of departments at the agency. The email states that the Home Affairs Ministry was ordering them to sign the declaration. “Of all the years since LESA was set up, these declarations were ordered to be signed urgently yesterday.”
 The 61-page application requests several avenues of inquiry, in addition to the traffic fine scam. Among the suspected offences that the inquiring magistrate is asked to collect evidence about are bribery and trading in influence by Flores and Camilleri, who Azzopardi claims, had received a cut of the fraudulent fines as well as gifts and other benefits from the car rental companies involved. 
  Another offence alleged in the application is abuse of office. Azzopardi names two individuals as being employed as full time LESA officials: Mauro Bianco, whose LinkedIn profile lists as a secretariat officer at the Home Affairs Ministry, and Community Officer Anthony Tabone, together with Home Affairs Minister Byron Camilleri’s niece, Gail Mizzi - “who is supposedly employed at LESA as a summer worker but is spending [the summer] working at the Ministry for Home Affairs,” had not turned up for work at the LESA offices for months - twelve months, in Tabone and Bianco’s case -  Azzopardi said, “appearing there only once a month to hand over their timesheet in order to be paid.”
 The application requests an urgent magisterial inquiry be held in order to preserve the evidence. It cites previous court rulings which had upheld requests for what is becoming an increasingly long list of corruption-related inquiries in Malta; amongst them inquiries into the fraudulent sale of three public hospitals to Vitals Global Healthcare, Identity Malta selling Maltese ID cards to foreign nationals on the basis of forged certificates, alleged payments of kickbacks for selling Maltese citizenship to Russian nationals and the 17 Black inquiry into secret offshore companies allegedly set up to launder kickbacks.

https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/132283/two_remanded_in_custody_for_146kg_cocaine_bust_at_freeport_,"Two men have been remanded in custody after they were arraigned and charged in connection to a significant cocaine seizure earlier this week.

 Darren Dimech, 46, and Roderick Camilleri, 44, both denied charges of drug trafficking and criminal association.

 The pair were among four arrested in a police operation in the Freeport which resulted in a 146kg drug bust.

 The accused did not request bail at this stage.

 In the short arraignment, no details emerged about what led to the arrests.

                         In a statement on Wednesday, the police said that on Tuesday afternoon led to them stopping a trailer that was just about to leave the port. After searching the vehicle, 105kg of cocaine were found hidden behind the driver’s and passenger’s seat.

 The container itself contained another 41kg of cocaine.

 The police said that the shipment came from Guayaquil in Equador, and unlike other shipments of this scale, the cocaine was meant to supply the local market.

 Representing Camilleri were lawyers Jason Azzopardi, Kris Busietta and Alessandro Farrugia while Dimech was represented by lawyer George Anton Buttiġieġ.

 Lawyer Maria Francesca Spiteri represented the Attorney General's Office, while inspectors Mark Mercieca, John Leigh Howard, and Francesco Mizzi represented the Police.     "

https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/129787/mile_end_bomb_suspect_to_be_examined_by_psychiatrists_ahead_of_possible_insanity_plea,"The man accused of planting a homemade explosive device outside the Labour Party Headquarters last month is to be assessed by psychiatrists ahead of a possible insanity plea.
 18-year-old David Brincat from Santa Venera wore a blank facial expression as he sat in the dock as the compilation of evidence against him began earlier today. 
  He had been charged with a list of offences relating to terrorism and the illicit manufacture of explosives last month, following a police investigation into the discovery of an explosive device placed in a dustbin outside the Labour Party building, which traced it back to Brincat. 
 Police reportedly found TATP - a volatile homemade explosive that has been used in terrorist attacks overseas- inside the garage where Brincat was residing.
 It is understood that the police investigation also revealed that Brincat had plans to produce and plant more explosive devices with specific targets in mind.
 When the compilation of evidence against Brincat continued on Tuesday, before Magistrate Kevan Azzopardi, lawyer Nicholas Mifsud, joint defence counsel with lawyers Mario Mifsud and Lara Attard, asked the court to order a psychiatric evaluation of the defendant before the compilation of evidence proceeded any further. 
 The lawyer pointed out that since his arraignment, Brincat had been held in preventive custody at the Forensic Unit of Mount Carmel Hospital.
 Prosecuting police inspector Wayne Camilleri told the court that he had exhibited certificates indicating that Brincat had been fit for interrogation and fit for trial, but the defence said it was arguing that Brincat was insane at the time that he allegedly committed the offence.
 Magistrate Azzopardi silently read the certificate declaring Brincat fit for trial.
 Prosecutor Kaylie Bonnett asked the court, in view of the fact that the defence of insanity was being raised, to appoint a panel of three experts to examine Brincat. 
 The court was initially reluctant to do so before hearing inspector Camilleri testify about the investigation, because the relevant period of time in which the defendant was claiming to be insane had to first be established.
 Police Inspector Lydon Zammit explained that the period the police were looking at was in the 12 months preceding the incident, although “ideological discussions” go back further. 
 The court upheld the request and tasked three psychiatrists to establish whether Brincat was legally insane when he allegedly committed the crimes he is charged with.
 The panel of experts were ordered to assess the defendant and draw up a report on their findings as soon as possible.
 The case was adjourned to July for this purpose.  "
https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/128834/police_arrest_three_in_swatar_in_heroin_trafficking_deal,"Three men were arrested on alleged drug trafficking charges on Wednesday afternoon in Swatar, where police received information on a group of individuals in the midst of a drug deal.
 Several officers went to the location where they spotted two men, matching the description given to them, inside a Ford Focus vehicle, with another man seated in the passenger seat.
 Upon spotting the police, the three individuals were said to have started behaving suspiciously, with one of them who was outside the vehicle appearing to walk away and attempting to get into another car nearby.
 The police surrounded the car with their vehicloe so that the drive inside could not flee, while two other officers gave chase and arrested the other two men.
 The three arrested men are aged 41, residing in Birkirkara, 48, residing in Msida, and 49, residing in Birkirkara. Upon arrest, one of the accused resisted being searched, which yielded a number of suspected heroin sachets. Around 30 sachets were also retrieved from inside the car.
 Magistrate Anthony Agius Bonnici is heading the inquiry.  "

https://timesofmalta.com/article/chris-fearne-edward-scicluna-sitting-annulled-defective-notification.1093202,"A marathon sitting during which former deputy prime minister Chris Fearne and Central Bank Governor Edward Scicluna pleaded not guilty to fraud has been annulled after one of those charged was not properly notified of the charges.
 The 11-hour session on Wednesday kick-started court proceedings against the two former ministers, three permanent secretaries and nine officials charged with fraud and other crimes allegedly linking them to the now-annulled hospitals privatisation deal. 
 As the hearing entered its tenth hour at the stage when all those charged finally registered their personal details and not guilty plea, lawyers defending DF Advocates - the last 'non-natural person' on the list - pointed out that that name was actually “just a trade name”.
 Additionally, the company number attributed to it on the charge sheet belonged to another juridical entity - DF Corporate Advisory Limited - in respect of which charges had been withdrawn earlier this month because that company did not exist at the time of the alleged crimes. 
 Faced with the defence’s arguments, prosecuting lawyers from the Attorney General’s office first insisted that DF Advocates was a body corporate duly represented at the sitting by three officials, namely Kenneth Deguara, chief financial officer, and lawyers Kevin Deguara and Jean Carl Farrugia, each of whom had been duly notified. 
 The prosecution insisted that charges against the entity would not be withdrawn as funds from criminal activity had allegedly flowed through that entity.
 “Whether a trade name or anything else, someone must answer,” argued AG lawyer Francesco Refalo.
 The defence then asked who from DF Advocates was to represent the entity in court and whether that person had been duly served notice.
 But the prosecution could produce no notice of service of summons in respect of DF Advocates.
 The defence pounced on that information, asking the court to “minute that”.
 “A juridical person is facing criminal charges and a freezing order but is not present in court. If it were a natural person not present, the proceedings could not continue,” insisted lawyer Charles Mercieca. 
 As the legal wrangling continued, the defence urged the prosecution to be “practical” and withdraw charges against DF Advocates as an entity. 
 After the umpteenth suspension of the sitting to allow the prosecution time to get its act in order, the session resumed. 
 But lawyer Giannella de Marco had an unexpected piece of news. 
 The Chamber of Advocates had issued a directive specifically in relation to the ongoing case, whereby it directed the lawyers not to continue assisting their respective clients beyond 10pm. 
 The directive was issued in light of the fact that the session had been ongoing since 11am and with no end in sight, the lawyers could not perform their duties to the best of their abilities. 
 With seconds to go to the 10pm deadline, presiding Magistrate Leonard Caruana asked the lawyers to bear with the court “for just 30 minutes so as to close the chapter about the notices of summons”. 
 Then the court delivered its final decree for the day. 
 Having seen the relative documents and after hearing the parties’ submissions, the court held that DF Advocates had not been duly notified.
 Its officials were notified in their personal capacity. 
 Consequently, the case was deferred to June “with all the legal consequences”, said the magistrate. 
 “The legal consequences are what they are,” remarked lawyer Franco Debono. 
 “The legal consequences are a nullity,” added de Marco. “Let’s state facts as they are.” 
 That meant that Wednesday's sitting was annulled, putting all those charged back to the starting point when the case resumes next month, with the prosecution having to effect the necessary changes to the charge sheet.
 “I would expect the prosecution to have told the court that DF Advocates was not notified at 11am. You chose to press charges.
 ""Now it’s for you to decide what to do. Had you told the court first thing this morning, all would have been home with their families by now,"" Magistrate Caruana said, addressing the prosecution as the eventful session ended.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/no-government-opposition-ngo-ask-resign-edward-scicluna.1093158,"Edward Scicluna on Wednesday said neither the government, nor the Opposition, or an NGO, could ask for his resignation. 
 The Central Bank Governor was speaking to journalists outside court before facing criminal charges over the Vitals hospitals deal.
 His position at the Central Bank has been questioned ever since a magisterial inquiry into the hospitals deal was concluded and it emerged he was among those facing charges in connection with the scandal.
 Robert Abela has since insisted he will not sack Scicluna, who is also a board member of the Malta Financial Services Authority.     
 Together with former health minister Chris Fearne, Sciclina is among 14 officials facing charges in court on Wednesday. On Tuesday, another 14 individuals and nine companies - including former PM Joseph Muscat - were charged during a historic court hearing.
  In his first comments since the conclusion of the inquiry, he pinned responsibility for his future as Central Bank Governor on the European Central Bank and its statutes.
 ""There is a big difference between a governor and a minister. A minister's position is the prerogative of the prime minister, while the role of governor is governed by the EU treaty and European Central Bank statutes,"" Scicluna said. 
 ""There are strict conditions so that there is no interference from the government, the Opposition or NGOs about the resignation.""
 His tenure was at the discretion of the council of governors of the European Central Bank and could be challenged in front of the European Court of Justice, he added, skirting questions on whether he personally thought he should resign.
 As Malta's Central Bank governor, Scicluna sits on the ECB Board of Governors. He is not the only member of that prestigious body to be in legal trouble: his Slovakian counterpart, Peter Kazimir, is currently fighting corruption charges.
 His ECB boss, Christine Lagarde, is similarly compromised. Lagarde was convicted of negligence in the misuse of public funds during her time as minister in her native France. 
 Scicluna served as Malta’s Finance Minister between 2013 and 2020, when he resigned as a minister and MP to assume the role of Central Bank governor.
 The €4 billion, 30-year deal to privatise three state hospitals that has landed his former boss Joseph Muscat and colleagues Konrad Mizzi and Keith Schembri in court was signed during his time in government.
 A magisterial inquiry into the deal noted that he was generally kept in the dark about the concession and had little communication with Mizzi, the minister primarily responsible for the deal.
 It appears Scicluna was also not informed that his top civil servant, Alfred Camilleri, sat on the board of the entity tasked with awarding the “fraudulent” deal to Vitals, Projects Malta.
 The atmosphere outside the Valletta law courts on Wednesday morning was a far cry from the previous day’s mayhem.
 While hundreds of people showed up to voice their support for Muscat [who faces the graver charges of bribery and corruption], few, if any Labour supporters could be seen in the square on Wednesday.
 Instead, Great Siege Square appeared to be back to its daily routine, with henna tattoo and costume jewellery vendors at their stalls and a tourist train that tours Valletta making its way past the law courts.

https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/129599/bail_denied_for_man_25_who_raped_colombian_victim_and_kidnapping_her_,"A police investigator has told a court how a Maltese man allegedly lured his ex-girlfriend to his house with the promise of a job, only for her to be raped instead.
 25-year-old Stefmar Hatherly from Floriana, appeared under arrest before magistrate Giannella Camilleri Busuttil on Thursday, to face related charges.
  Police Inspector Omar Zammit explained to the court how, at around 3pm on June 4, a Colombian woman reported to the police that she had gone to her ex-boyfriend’s house, “because he was going to find her a job.”
 But the man drove her to a deserted area instead. When the woman escaped, the defendant managed to apprehend and then rape her.
 He then drove her to his home in Floriana, where the woman was locked up. She managed to escape later in the afternoon and went to the police station to file a report.
 Hatherly later went, of his own volition, to the police jeadquarters in Floriana, allegedly to ask where the woman was, and was taken into custody.
 Hatherly stands charged with ten offences in all, including rape, committing a non-consensual act of a sexual nature, offending public morals in a public place and recidivism. He was also accused of having detained the alleged victim against her will at a flat in Floriana on June 4 and illegally arresting her.
 Four additional charges dealing with a separate assault, which allegedly occurred at a flat in Sliema on May 20, where Hatherly is accused of causing the woman to fear he would use violence against her, attacking her, threatening both her and another man, as well as breaching the peace, were also pressed.
 Together with the charges, prosecuting lawyers Jurgen Dalli and Cynthia Tomasuolo from the Office of the Attorney General, assisting Police Inspectors Wayne Buhagiar and Omar Zammit, also requested the court to issue the orders it saw fit in order to ensure the safety of the alleged victims.
 Defence lawyer Matthew Xuereb, appearing for Hatherly together with lawyers Jose Herrera and Sandro Camilleri, said the defence had only recently been made aware that the victim had released a statement to the police and to the inquiring magistrate in the course of the inquiry.
 The lawyers requested the immediate disclosure of these statements in order to prepare its questions for the woman. Xuereb told the court he “intended to confront her with several truths, such as the fact that she had sent very erotic messages to the defendant asking to meet him.”
 Inspector Zammit did not object, saying it was only possible because the woman had given her sworn testimony on video, as otherwise the parties would have had to wait for the inquiry to be concluded.
 No ban on publishing defendant’s name
 Xuereb asked the court to impose a ban on the publication of the names of the defendant and alleged victim, “in order not to get relatives, especially his daughter who is a minor and completely extraneous to this case, involved.”
 The lawyer suggested that the victim had been in a months-long relationship with the defendant.
 The AG’s lawyer Jurgen Dalli said the prosecution agreed with respect to the victim, but reminded the court that the law spoke of publication bans “in order to protect the victim from secondary victimisation, and not the defendant.” He argued that there were no reasons to hide the name of the defendant.
 Xuereb argued that a balance must be struck between open access justice which is an important aspect of democracy and the rights of the defendant.
 The court denied the request, imposing a media ban only on publishing the victim’s name.
 Lawyer Jose Herrera then requested the defendant be released on bail, arguiing that the court could prohibit the defendant from contacting the alleged victim, as well as issue a temporary protection order. Additionally, the man was raising a six-year-old daughter, who would end up suffering the most, he said.
 Dalli countered that there were other eyewitnesses – two victims were named in the charge sheet, he pointed out, arguing that this risk had not been eliminated.
 The accused’s criminal record already featured three previous convictions, Dalli pointed out, saying this led the prosecution to doubt the extent to which the man would adhere to any potential bail conditions.
 Furthermore, the prosecutor said, the daughter resided with her mother. “This ‘excuse’ about the daughter is not appreciated when dealing with such a delicate issue,” he said. “The defendant knows the victim and the witnesses live with her so he knows them too. This is why the prosecution is insisting that the risk of tampering with evidence is real,” Dalli concluded.
 The court denied bail in view of the early stage of proceedings, as well as Hatherly’s previous convictions for crimes against another ex-girlfriend of his.
 A protection order was issued in favour of the victims, prohibiting Hatherly from approaching, contacting or following them, or loitering around their homes or workplaces.  "
https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/132807/disability_benefits_fraud_roger_agius_no_longer_represented_by_jason_azzopardi,"Roger Agius, who is accused of fraud in connection with a disability benefits racket, will no longer be represented by lawyer Jason Azzopardi, it was revealed on Monday.

 At the start of today’s hearing, Magistrate Rachel Montebello said that lawyer Jason Azzopardi had filed a note to inform the court that he was renouncing his client, Roger Agius’s, brief. Agius, a former driver of parliamentary secretary Andy Ellul, is subject to a freezing order and thus cannot withdraw money with the corollary that another lawyer cannot be engaged at this stage.

                     Agius is facing criminal proceedings along with former Labour MP and medical doctor Silvio Grixti, Dustin Caruana, Manuel Spagnol and Luke Saliba. All stand accused of fraud, forming part of a criminal organisation and money laundering, in connection with the racket.

 Agius had previously applied for whistleblower status and expressed willingness to testify in ongoing police investigations.

 Agius, who is also a former canvasser to Grixti, had previously called for a magisterial inquiry to investigate the social benefits fraud racket. He further offered, if granted whistleblower status, to reveal information regarding criminal activity he claims to have participated in.

 He had filed a judicial protest, signed by his now former lawyer Jason Azzopardi, against the Prime Minister, the Whistleblower Officer at the Office of the Prime Minister, the State Advocate, the Attorney General and the Commissioner of Police, which protest stated that the OPM’s Whistleblower Office had twice ignored offers of information to expose details regarding  the scheme, including its mode of operation and persons behind it.

 Proceedings today further continued with witness testimony.     "
https://timesofmalta.com/article/daniel-meli-parents-fear-case-decided-law-changes.1097260,"The parents of a Maltese man wanted in the US over suspected dark web dealings fear they might lose their last-ditch court attempt to stop extradition before parliament changes the law allowing him to be tried in Malta.
 That would mean the law, which the government and the opposition agreed to change in the wake of this case, would not help the one man who triggered it in the first place – Daniel Meli, his parents said.
 Chris and Lucienne Meli urged MPs to reconvene parliament earlier in case court proceedings are scheduled to conclude before October, when the House meets again after the summer recess.
  They said they are overwhelmed by the two parties’ quick response to their plea and are extremely grateful for their unanimous support to amend the law.
 But they argued the law, which, as it stands, does not allow extradition decisions to be appealed, could force the court to refuse their plea to reverse extradition, essentially forcing their son to leave Malta for the US.
 The parents said, that by parliament meeting sooner, MPs could amend the law before the court delivers its verdict, preventing the extradition.
 The 28-year-old Maltese man is wanted in the US to face charges of selling hacking equipment on the dark web. He was arraigned in February and initially consented to the extradition but later retracted his consent after hiring new lawyers who argued that the magistrates’ court had not verified whether he was medically fit and capable of understanding his decision.
  The law, however, does not allow for such decisions to be reversed, which is why Meli’s parents took to the media to urge the government to intervene to allow their son to stand trial in Malta.
 Within days, the government and the opposition agreed they should change the law and the government is drafting a bill that would allow Meli – and other people in his situation in the future – to contest extradition.
 The proposed law, according to sources, would allow a wanted person “adequate time” to reflect before deciding whether to accept being extradited to face trial in a foreign country, thus ensuring they make a well-informed decision not made under duress or when they are mentally unfit.
 For Meli to avail of such changes, however, parliament would have to pass the new legislation before the constitutional court makes a final decision in his case.
 “We’re concerned over his well-being in the US,” his mother said.
 “He would be alone, away from his family and we wouldn’t be able to visit him. And we’re also concerned about medication. It’s given to him free here but not there.”
  The parents recalled the day – this February 7 – when they went home to find the police searching every room in the house.
 The couple stared in shock and bewilderment as the police took every laptop, tablet and gadget they found in every room and arrested their son, who has not returned home from prison since.
 “At first, it seemed our son would be prosecuted by Malta’s police but, the next day, they told us charges had changed and he was now wanted by the US and that we must appear urgently before a magistrate to confirm whether he will accept extradition,” the mother said.
 They said they had to take that life-changing decision in 15 minutes, before appearing before the magistrate. And they accepted, only to later realise it was a huge mistake.
  The couple explained they were initially told that if their son cooperated with the FBI, he would be looking at a maximum of five years in prison if found guilty, which could even go down to three years with good conduct.
 That would not be so bad, they thought, until later they discovered that he was actually facing five years for every charge and there was more than one charge, meaning that, if found guilty of all charges, he could be spending some 40 years in prison.
 But that was not the only reason the Meli family are fighting to reverse the extradition decision. They say they could not have possibly made a well-informed decision in 15 minutes and under such immense pressure.
 “We were shocked as much as our son,” the mother said.
 “At that moment, when we were expected to make the decision, he turned to me like a lamb and said: ‘What should I do, pà?’ We didn’t know what to do and we needed more information,” his father added.
 “There was another thing. He takes medication to treat anxiety and arthritis and he wasn’t yet given the medication that day before court, so not only was he under immense pressure but he had also not taken his medication.”
 The parents said they have been inundated with overwhelming support since they took their case to the media, mostly from people who believe Maltese citizens should be tried in Malta, especially if the alleged crime was committed in Malta.
 “We received messages from people who don’t even know us but offered a helping hand,” the father said.
 “We miss Daniel a lot. We speak to him and he’s always thinking about the dog. He fears she might forget about him,” his mother said.
 “There are a lot of question marks on his future.”

https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/130851/man_denied_bail_pleads_not_guilty_to_rape_of_expartners_daughter,"A 39-year-old man from Swieqi was remanded in custody after pleading not guilty to charges of rape and sexual corruption allegedly committed on his ex-partner’s teenage daughter.
 The man was arraigned before Magistrate Victor Axiak on Friday morning by Inspector Wayne Buhagiar, who together with prosecutors Cynthia Tomasuolo and Jennifer Polidano, charged the man with the repeated rape of a minor, participating in sexual activity with a minor, detaining her against her will, subjecting her to sexual acts of a non-consensual nature, corrupting a minor, harassing her and causing her to fear that he would be violent towards her.
  Inspector Buhagiar told the court that the girl, today aged 15, had reported the defendant, who is her mother’s ex-partner, to the Vice Squad, alleging that he had been molesting her since 2016, with the abuse progressing to rape. 
 Gynaecologists, appointed to assist the magisterial inquiry that had subsequently been appointed, had confirmed that the girl’s hymen was not intact, added the inspector. The girl had given a detailed account of the alleged abuse to the inquiring magistrate, before whom both her parents had also testified.
 The defendant had been arrested some time ago but was later released on police bail.
 Asked how he pleaded, the accused man replied “I did nothing. I’m not guilty, me.”
 Defence lawyers Michaela and Mattea Giglio requested bail, to which the defence objected due to the nature of the charges and the fact that the alleged victim and her family had not yet given evidence in these proceedings.
 Giglio pointed out that they had already testified before the inquiry, which had started in January, and insisted that her client had been on police bail since then and had not breached the conditions of his release. 
 “Had he truly spoken to the victim or her family, the inspector would have arrested him,” argued the lawyer.
 Lawyer Jacob Magri, appearing as parte civile, told the court that his client had informed him today that the man had been repeatedly attempting to communicate with the mother, through “incessant WhatsApp messages.”
 The court, after hearing the parties submissions on the bail request, moved to reject it, citing “what appears to be a real risk of tampering with the evidence,” ordering that the man be remanded in custody.
 It also issued a protection order in favour of the parents. Court warned him not to approach or contact both the parents and their daughter. 
 Names are being withheld in view of a court-imposed publication ban.  "
https://timesofmalta.com/article/joseph-scicluna-found-notguilty-attempted-murder-dingli-field.1095983,"A man has been cleared in a trial by jury of attempted murder following a violent scuffle with a fellow hunter whom he blamed for the final shooting.
 After five hours of deliberation, the jurors returned a 'not guilty' verdict of eight votes against one on the ground of attempted murder. 
 The accused, Joseph Scicluna, and members of his family were in tears when the jurors returned their verdict. 
 He was found guilty of having acted in excess of legitimate self defence through fear or fright.
 After the verdict was delivered a technical issue arose about the sentence. The matter is to be tackled on Sunday. 
 As for the other two grounds concerning the possession of a weapon during the alleged crime and possessing a firearm without the police permit, the jury pronounced him not guilty. 
 Scicluna insisted, when testifying at the trial on Thursday, that he managed to grab Mark Farrugia’s hunting shotgun just as the other man made a beeline for it after the weapon fell from the victim’s grip during the scuffle. 
 Farrugia, who testified on Wednesday, insisted the accused had suddenly hit him with a thick wooden rod as the pair chatted about birds and the weather in the very early hours of that October 31 morning in 2018. 
 A scuffle ensued on the sloping surface of the field in the area of ‘Ta’ Dnat’ at San Gakbu, Dingli shortly after 5.30am. 
 When testifying for the first time at the trial by jury, Scicluna gave a very different version of the incident. 
 He claimed that Farrugia had burst into a verbal attack, swearing and insulting him when he calmly told him not to shoot low when hunting to avoid damaging Scicluna’s drip irrigation pipes. 
 Scicluna also claimed that he had reserved a quiet word of warning for Farrugia, telling him “leave my son in peace. He has enough problems.” 
 That quiet warning had triggered Farrugia’s violent outburst and the physical clash that followed, insisted the accused. 
 He said he hit Farrugia with the thick rod because the younger man grabbed him first. 
 He pushed Farrugia away after allegedly being punched three times on the eyes and while still dazed by the blows, he saw the alleged victim sprint “with all his might” towards the firearm on the ground. 
 “I’m done. He’s going to shoot me,” Scicluna said he thought in that brief moment before he managed to grab the shotgun first and fired a shot. 
 However, his alleged victim denied that version, insisting under cross examination that the two hunters had “never, never” spoken about Scicluna’s son.
  While chatting about the weather and the gallina, Scicluna had pointed out something in a nearby almond tree.
 When Farrugia turned to look in that direction, Scicluna had dealt him a blow on the head with the marlogg, the thick handle of the accused’s hoe. 
 The victim suffered grievous injuries after being shot with his own hunting weapon and was subsequently admitted to Mater Dei Hospital in critical condition. His aggressor was accused of attempted murder, grievous bodily harm, possession of a firearm during the commission of the crime and possessing a weapon without the relative police permit. 
 He protested his innocence throughout the proceedings. 
 The prosecution pointed out that the accused had originally denied being at the crime scene that day. He had even blamed his cat and an accidental brush with a lemon tree for his visible injuries. 
 However, when testifying at the trial, Scicluna explained that since he had never been through a similar experience, he was “scared” and “traumatized” when summoned by the Rabat police. 
 Scicluna claimed that he only gave the true version when he engaged his present lawyer and insisted that what he told the jurors was “the truth.” 
 Madam Justice Consuelo Scerri Herrera presided over the trial. AG lawyers Kevin Valletta and Kaylie Bonnet prosecuted.
 Lawyers Arthur Azzopardi and Jacob Magri were defence counsel. Lawyers Edward Gatt and Shaun Zammit appeared parte civile.

https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/132411/fouryear_prison_sentence_for_pair_who_stole_handbag_containing_a_hearing_aid_processor,"Depty Naval and Davinder Singh were both found guilty of stealing a handbag from a 72-year-old woman containing a cochlear implant processor worth nearly €10,000 and were subsequently sentenced to four years imprisonment. 

 The pair faced various accusations including aggravated theft, use of false identities to deceive the victim as well as fraudulent gain, with Naval separately being accused of breaching bail conditions. 

                     The Court, presided over by Magistrate Gabriella Vella, noted that the prosecution successfully proved that, on 2 January 2023, shortly after midnight, the defendants had stolen the woman’s handbag at Triq it-Turisti in St. Paul’s Bay, and shortly after attempted to use credit cards which were also held in that bag. It was further recalled that the theft of the processor caused great difficulty to the victim who faced difficulties with hearing. 

 The men were consequently found guilty of aggravated theft, but not of the other charges. Naval was also found guilty of breaching court orders. 

 The Court considered the nature of the crime of which the defendants were convicted as well as the age of the victim. It was also noted that the defendants never, even when asked about what had been done with the handbag in an attempt to retrieve the processor, showed remorse for their actions. 

 The Court consequently sentenced both defendants to a four-year effective prison sentence. The pair were furthermore ordered to pay the sum of €4,145 in court expenses.     "
https://timesofmalta.com/article/penalty-cash-control-law-breaches-declared-unconstitutional.1094391,"A regulation imposing a 55% penalty whenever a traveller is caught carrying over €10,000 in cash has been declared unconstitutional since it “reduces the judicial process to a mechanical exercise.”
 The declaration was made by the Constitutional Court when handing down judgment in a breach of rights case instituted by Igaale Ali Muuse, who was arrested at Malta Airport three years ago after being found in possession of €165,548 in cash.
 That August day Muuse was about to board a flight to Istanbul when a customs sniffer dog alerted officials to the cash inside his suitcase already stored in the aircraft’s hold.
 Muuse had declared that he had no cash over the €10,000 allowed in terms of law.
 The day after that discovery, Muuse was arraigned and charged with breaching Cash Control Regulations by failing to declare the substantial amount of excess cash.
 He pleaded not guilty.
 Proceedings continued and when the prosecution wrapped up evidence, the accused changed his plea. In August 2022, he registered an admission, confirming his position after being given time to reconsider.
 The Magistrates’ Court sentenced him to a fine totalling €85,601.
 That sum represented a 55% penalty on the amount in excess of €10,000, plus an additional €50 fine.
 Muuse appealed that judgment and requested a constitutional reference, challenging the current regulations which resulted in disproportionate punishment, legal arbitrariness and a lack of judicial discretion.
 The First Hall, Civil Court in its constitutional jurisdiction threw out the applicant’s claim, stating that Muuse had suffered no breach of rights.
 Muuse appealed and the matter landed before the Constitutional Court.
 On Monday, Chief Justice Mark Chetcuti together with Justices Giannino Caruana Demajo and Anthony Ellul, upheld Muuse’s claims, declaring that Regulation 3(5)(b) of the subsidiary legislation on cash control presented a “disproportionate interference” in the applicant’s right to peaceful enjoyment of his private property.
 Citing EU caselaw, the court observed that these cash control measures stemmed from EU directives aimed at setting up a system of controls to prevent money laundering and financing of terrorism throughout the EU.
 However the EU left it to each member state to introduce a penalty that was “effective, proportionate and dissuasive.”
 Malta had originally introduced a 25% penalty on the full amount of cash plus confiscation of any amount exceeding the €10,000 statutory limit.
 The law was amended in 2020 so that nowadays there is a mandatory 55% penalty on the excess plus a €50 fine.
 But when the accused is carrying more than €30,000, the excess sum is deposited by police with the Tax Commissioner for a maximum term of 90 days.
 Meanwhile police investigate the source of funds and if any criminal activity is suspected, further criminal action is taken against the accused.
 In Muuse’s case, the competent authorities had enough time to investigate but no further action was taken, observed the judges.
 The State Advocate argued that cash control regulations were purposely formulated to avoid arbitrariness. Anyone caught with excess cash would know exactly what punishment he faced.
 However the court did not agree with that argument.
 Such a penalty was undoubtedly harsh when considering that this applied independently whenever a passenger travelling through the airport failed to declare extra cash.
 It was meant to serve as a deterrent and punishment.
 The accused could still face further criminal action if the cash was linked to some criminal activity.
 Whilst voicing doubt about the source of Muuse’s money, the court said that the regulation “reduced the judicial process to a mechanical exercise” and totally did away with the court’s role of applying its discretion to the facts of the case.
 Each case presented different circumstances and punishment should be meted out accordingly.
 The court thus declared that the regulation interfered in a disproportionate manner with the applicant’s fundamental property rights.
 A copy of the judgment is to be sent to the Court of Criminal Appeal and also to the Speaker in Parliament.
 Lawyers Arthur Azzopardi, Franco Debono and Jacob Magri assisted Muuse.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/finance-minister-defends-decision-keep-tax-cola.1100319,"Removing tax from the Cost of Living Adjustment would lead to having ""two classes of workers"", Finance Minister Clyde Caruana said on Wednesday. 
 Caruana argued that the anomaly would arise because thousands of workers covered by collective bargaining deals do not receive COLA. 
 Instead, those workers tend to have an annual increase included as part of their agreements.
 “If we implement the PN’s proposal, we’ll end up with two classes of workers: those who are taxed on their annual increase, because they don’t get COLA, and those who aren’t,” Caruana said.
 The minister was speaking at the tax and customs offices in Qormi two days after he unveiled the Budget for 2025. 
 The Opposition, which has long called for the government to make COLA tax-exempt, noted after the budget that the proposal was ignored.  
 Caruana said the budget's headline measure - a widening of tax bands that will effectively reduce workers' tax burden - was only possible thanks to improved tax collection by the tax department.
 He said the tax cuts announced on Monday ""would have been impossible without the tax department's effective work.”
 In the first six months of this year alone, the government collected €300 million more than in the previous year, Caruana said.
 The tax changes Caruana announced during the Budget 2025 speech on Monday are projected to cost the government €140 million in all. 
 They will see income tax bands broadened, allowing single workers to avoid tax on their first €12,000 in 2025.
  Married people, who make up around 14% of all taxpayers, will see a similar increase in tax-free income from €12,700 to €15,000, while parents will not be taxed on the first €13,000 of their income.
 Caruana was also asked why the government decided to reduce taxes instead of collecting more revenue to spend on capital projects - a concern raised by the Malta Employers Association in its pre-budget document.
 Caruana argued that capital spending is strong despite the tax cuts, saying that this year capital expenditure will top €1 billion. Over the past two years, the government has increased its capital expenditure budget by €250 million, he said.
 The government has enough money to invest in energy infrastructure, Caruana insisted.
 Tax cuts made sense because ""it was time to give something to the middle class, which has contributed so much to the country’s economic growth,” he said.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/if-want-blockchain-island-don-t-ask-permission.1093687,"Four years ago, a tech start-up co-founded by Maltese entrepreneur Max Thake had just attracted €750,000 in investment and was looking to reach €5 million.
 At the time, Thake spoke with passion about the start-up’s blockchain-based technology called ‘peaq’ and said he and his colleagues were “looking to the future”.
 The future is now, and judging by recent developments the platform has continued to grow.
 Recently, peaq secured $35 million in two rounds of private and public funding and is now valued at a third of a billion dollars.
 Commenting on the technology’s meteoric rise, Thake, who lives as a digital nomad, said it was “crazy to see it grow so much,” but said it was “still only a fraction of what we envisage”.
 Peaq is a technology for building networks that connects users to crowd-sourced information and services by linking and monetising internet-connected devices.
 Thake and his colleagues think peaq won’t just be a successful venture; they believe it has the potential to change the world by ushering in a new era of democratised, user-owned industries.
 And judging by the latest round of funding, they’re not the only ones. So, what is the secret to their continued success?
 “Resilience; we had to go to hell and back to make this a success,” Thake said, adding he hoped peaq’s success could serve as an inspiration for young technology enthusiasts in Malta.
 Stressing the importance of “vision, passion and adaptability”, the young entrepreneur said he and his colleagues had learned how to “take the hits and make the changes that are necessary”. 
 But with blockchain technology – a decentralised sequential list of encrypted records called ‘blocks’ that can be used to store information such as financial transactions – being complex and arguably still viewed with scepticism, what has been the reaction of family and friends to his venture?
 “Sometimes I almost got that look of, ‘oh, that’s sweet’ – especially in my early 20s,” he said, but noted that as the technology became more widely known and the start-up grew, attitudes had changed.
 Asked if he had always gravitated towards technology, Thake said his co-founder Leonard Dorlöchter was “the tech guy”, with his own role “more on the creative side and setting the long-term vision for the company...”
 Describing the technology underpinning the platform as the “next evolutionary step of the internet,” Thake explained how peaq connects users and devices on vast networks that offer crowd-sourced alternatives to company-driven solutions.
 Such alternatives could offer services like ride hailing, communal 3D printing and goods deliveries, provide information on traffic and pollution and even establish crowd-sourced infrastructure such as WiFi and 5G networks, he said.
 Networks powered by peaq offer information and services to users while putting power – and money – back into the hands of those who provide the service.
 The more a user contributes to the network, the more they are rewarded in peaq tokens, which afford the user more of a say in how the network develops and which can also be exchanged for regular currency, he explained. 
 Think cooperatives, but high-tech.
 “In the past, the internet put power into the hands of a few, and there’s enormous inequality in the world today... but peaq doesn’t rely on Google or other big companies,” Thake said.
  Using ride hailing as an example, the entrepreneur said a network offering a service like Uber would be able to do so more competitively while avoiding the fees leveraged by such platforms.
 “The network will be able to undercut companies like Uber at a rate they can’t compete with, essentially using their own business model against them,” he said, stressing that unlike existing platforms, drivers would earn money while owning a part of the network.
 “The long-term vision is to power the ‘Economy of Things’,” said Thake, referencing an economic model where internet-connected devices – the so-called ‘internet of things’ including health trackers and charging stations, for example – generate cryptocurrency as they provide data to others.
 Emphasising that peaq is focused on providing “real-life solutions”, Thake pointed to an app called Silencio, which monitors background noise and combines that with readings from other users to help people make informed decisions about where they live or go on holiday.
 As the app collects data, the user is rewarded with tokens which can then be traded or sold in a similar way to shares in a traditional company.
 So, what makes peaq different to a traditional company?
 “This technology is about giving up power, giving it back to the people,” said Thake, contrasting this with established models where, as a business grows, a controlling minority continues to exert most of the influence.
 Despite the promises of blockchain technologies and in particular cryptocurrencies, a branch of the blockchain, in recent years the tech world has been rocked by a series of high-profile scandals involving the technology.
 In March, disgraced former cryptocurrency whizzkid Sam Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison and ordered to pay $11 billion in damages after being found guilty of defrauding investors.
 Do they worry Thake?
 “It’s annoying; every time this kind of thing happens, we think, ‘here we go again’, he said, but stressed he was confident that despite the short-term damage, such scandals “won’t sink the industry,” while cautioning against blindly investing in new technologies.
 And while Malta’s forays into the blockchain world haven’t always gone smoothly – its infamous ‘blockchain island’ marketing drive derided as a flop after failing to attract tech start-ups – Thake doesn’t think a government-led approach is the right one and instead argues for a crowd-driven embrace of crowd-sourced technology.
 If we want to become a blockchain island, we don’t have to ask permission.”

https://timesofmalta.com/article/malta-enterprise-signs-deal-semiconductor-research-leaders-imec.1091946,"Malta Enterprise has signed a deal with international microelectronics research centre Imec (Interuniversity Microelectronics Centre).
 The memorandum of understanding will enable University and MCAST students to get better access to Imec facilities during their postgraduate studies, facilitate Malta-based firms in the sector in obtaining Imec start-up support and provide them with opportunities to expand their business.
 Imec is a world-leading R&D and innovation hub in nanoelectronics and digital technologies that is headquartered in Belgium.
 The EU has made a concerted effort to ramp up EU-led research and production of microchips, as fears about the reliance on foreign manufacturing in places like Taiwan and the US grow.
 In 2023 it introduced the European Chips Act, intended to make it easier to tap funding related to semiconductor-related industries. The act is expected to lead to more than €15 billion in additional public and private investment in the EU’s semiconductor sector.
 As part of that EU-led initiative, Malta obtained approval to inject €20 million in state aid into Malta-based semiconductor manufacuter STMicroelectronics. The company will use that money to upgrade its production lines.
 The local semiconductor industry contributes around 15 per cent of Malta’s exported goods and generates around 8 per cent of all employment in the manufacturing sector, the government said in a statement announcing the Imec deal.
 Economy Minister  Silvio Schembri, who presided over the signing ceremony between Malta Enterprise and Imec, said the government wants to encourage start-ups n the sector and make it easier for them to access European infrastructure.
 “I am optimistic that with the right strategy, we can achieve this,” he said.
 Malta Enterprise CEO Kurt Farrugia said the MOU with Imec was “a first initiative and an important step in our strategy. It will be further enhanced with a dedicated semiconductor strategy, which we will be working on in the months to come.”
  Jo de Boeck, Executive Vice President and Corporate Strategy Officer at Imec, said Malta was doing well to make use of the EU Chips Act.
 “I believe Malta can bring a lot to the table. The investment being made by the country in the IPCEI and the setting up of a competence centre will certainly bring a new wave of innovation.,” he said.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/church-deficit-narrows-7m-325000-financial-report-2023-shows.1096380,"The Church in Malta “did better than expected” in the 2023 financial year and narrowed its deficit to just over €325,000 from €7 million in the previous year.
 Church officials said on Tuesday that the improved financial situation was due to several factors that included more income, controlled expenditure and a record €7.22 million in APS bank dividends.
 Speaking at a press conference to present the financial report of the Archdiocese of Malta for 2023, administrative secretary Michael Pace Ross said that during 2023 the archdiocese  -  which encompasses around 120 entities and employs 1,369 people -  operated on an income of €59.9 million while the expenditure stood at €60.4 million.
 Despite the shortfall of some €325,000, the Church increased subsidies to its entities by 33%, with the bulk of funds directed towards children’s homes - where subsidies increased by €180,000 to reach €406,000 last year.
 In 2023 the homes were at full capacity hosting 41 children. Investments were made in the homes to ensure that the children felt they lived in a home and not an institute, he said.
 “The children are our future and, if we don’t look after them, no one will,"" Pace Ross said.
 Another cost, he said, was the staff, with more professionals needing to be engaged as nuns retired.
 Revenue increased to €59.9m in 2023 compared to €52.6m in 2022. Income from collections received by parishes went up by 20% to reach €3m. However, revenue from donations decreased from €6.4m to €5.8m.
  There was a doubling in inheritances, mostly through Dar tal-Providenza, that spiralled from €452,821 to €909,699. Income from property rental and sale of property rose by €2.05m to reach €1.8m for rental and €3.2m for sale. Investment income increased to €10.23m and included €7.22m in APS gross dividends 
 The Mdina Cathedral Museum and Mosta Basilica registered a 55% and 21% increase respectively in visitors with generated income increasing by €730,000.
 Expenditure by the archdiocese increased by €6.04m compared to the previous year. Salary costs accounted for 61% amounting to €36.8m up from €33.6m in 2022.
 This went to pay the salaries of 1,067 full-timers and 302 part-timers at the Curia, priests, children's homes, the homes for the elderly and persons with disability; the Archbishop’s Seminary and Sacred Heart College; monasteries and sextons.
 Operational and maintenance costs, including the conservation and restoration of ecclesiastical heritage, increased by €2.52m reaching €18.8m while tax amounted to €2.5m.
 Asked why the archdiocese did not intervene to fund needed restoration works at Paola parish church, Pace Ross explained that the curia usually helped parishes with funding, loans and subsidies.
 In this case the €400,000 fee was too large to fork out at one go so the proposed café was to create a steady income stream. Once the government stepped in, it was a win-win situation.
  He added that church continued to subsidise entities with the highest increase going to children’s homes. The Church, he said, has been making every effort to help families and individuals seeking assistance, and various initiatives were underway aimed at furthering the Church’s mission.
 “Through the LOOP Parish Diaconia initiative, 870 people received food and 380 were the beneficiaries of clothing. Last year, the Church also opened Il-Kċina ta’ Marta at the Archbishop’s Seminary in Tal-Virtù - supported by a team of dedicated volunteers and the Alfred Mizzi Foundation. It provides more than 1,200 meals a week to those in need,” he said.
 In addition to this, Maltese parishes received over 1,300 requests to provide individuals and families with food hampers, medicines and other necessities. Some of these requests were one-time needs, while others are ongoing.
 The Archdiocese of Malta also assisted survivors of earthquakes in Turkey and Syria, hosted foreign priests at Casa Fratelli Tutti, and facilitated the participation of 565 youths at the World Youth Day in Lisbon.
 Last month, the archdiocese also donated Dar Saura in Rabat - a former residence for the elderly valued at €25m - to The Malta Trust Foundation, which will transform the property into a music and arts centre for children with disabilities.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/corinthia-unveils-150m-brussels-hotel-astoria.1102200,"Corinthia now has a presence in the heart of Brussels following a €150 million rebuild and restoration of the historic Grand Hotel Astoria.
 Situated on Rue Royale in the Notre Dame aux Neiges district, the Corinthia Brussels opens on Monday and is the latest jewel in the Malta-based hotel group’s crown. 
 Formerly the Grand Hotel Astoria, the iconic Belle Époque landmark has undergone a complete transformation, now featuring 126 rooms and suites, and a subterranean spa.
 It is the second new hotel that Corinthia has launched in as many months, following the opening of The Surrey, A Corinthia Hotel in New York’s Upper East Side of Manhattan.
  The Malta-founded and publicly traded Corinthia Group owns and operates high-end hotels across the globe, in major cities including London, Budapest, St Petersburg and Lisbon. Other properties in Bucharest, Doha, Riyadh and Rome are in the pipeline.  
 Last week, the company said it was exploring further investment opportunities in tandem with the Kuwait-based Action Real Estate Company. 
 Commissioned by royal decree and designed by Henri Van Dievoet, the Grand Hotel Astoria was originally conceived as a palace to host distinguished guests of the King of Belgium.
 It first opened in 1910 and was considered one of the finest hotels in the world. With its era-defining architecture and opulent interiors, it became synonymous with elegance, hosting illustrious guests like Winston Churchill and Andy Warhol. 
  The hotel shut down in 2007. In 2016, the Corinthia Group purchased the property and began preparations to bring it back to life. Works began four years ago and have now been completed. 
 The original façade and first floor of the hotel were preserved, with works undertaken in collaboration with Urban Brussels and the Royal Commission. 
 The hotel features two Michelin-starred Belgian chefs in Davide Martin and Christophe Hardiquest and a bar led by mixologist Hannah von Ongevalle. An excavated floor beneath the hotel hosts a 1,200 square metre spa with seven private treatment rooms, a steam room, sauna, experience showers, tea room and fitness centre with personal training by former British Army physical training instructor Paul Tucker. 
 QP, a Corinthia Group company, handled the design and project management of the restoration project, while the Group’s hotel operating arm, Corinthia Hotels, will operate it. 
 Corinthia Group CEO Simon Naudi said the Corinthia Brussels “has brought out the best in our Group and highlights our quite unique involvement as investors, developers and operators.” 
 Simon Casson, CEO of Corinthia Hotels, said the hotel will redefine “what luxury hospitality can be.” 
 Reuben Xuereb, CEO of QP, said the project to restore the hotel was a complex one. 
 “Under the watchful eye of the local heritage authorities, we have painstakingly worked with leading contractors, craftsmen and artisans to recreate one of Europe’s finest hotels,” he said.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/scam-facebook-page-imitates-gozo-business.1102510,"A technology company in Gozo is the latest target of a Facebook page that imitates genuine businesses to scam customers.
 The owner of Infotech Enterprises Ltd said he was “alarmed” after a customer came to his shop asking to collect a phone he claimed to have ordered online. Another called asking about delivery for a games console they had paid a deposit for.
 The shop has not sold consumer electronics for around a decade, now dealing in IT and security systems.
 Speaking to Times of Malta, the owner, who asked not to be named, said he was worried people would pay money for items they would not receive, adding: “I don’t want to be accused of anything.”
  When he investigated the incidents, he discovered a Facebook page operating under the name ‘Infotech Gozo’ sporting almost identical branding to his genuine business.
 It is the same page involved in another scam Times of Malta exposed six months ago, however the details have been changed to imitate Attard’s business.
 In June, the owner of San Ġwann-based audio shop FutureTech Pro contacted the police after receiving scores of complaints from people scammed by a Facebook page with a similar name to his business.
 The ‘Future Tech’ page responsible for the complaints was traced to a defunct technology shop in Gozo by the same name and was used to scam victims out of payments for games consoles, smart watches and other items that never turned up.
 Screenshots of recent messages between customers and the page show its operators providing prices of items and asking for deposits while supplying Revolut account details.
  Highlighting the dangers posed to customers, Infotech’s owner said: “We believe this issue deserves further attention to prevent more people from falling victim to this scam and to protect the reputation of legitimate businesses like ours.”
 The ‘Infotech Gozo’ page was briefly shut down by Meta – the parent company of Facebook – earlier this week but by the next day, the page reappeared sporting the same name and branding.
 Infotech’s owner said his business would continue to fight for the page to be removed from Facebook.
 He initially did not report it to the police, describing it as “useless” because of the previous report. However, he plans to alert the cybercrime unit if it “pops up again”.
 Last year, consumers in Malta lost some €12.5 million to scams and online fraud, an increase of 50 per cent over the €8.5 million lost in 2022, according to police figures. In February, Home Affairs Minister Byron Camilleri tabled figures in parliament showing that the number of online scams reported to the police had more than doubled over the same two years, reaching just over 2,500 reports in 2023.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/aps-exploring-growth-won-t-comment-hsbc-reports.1100358,"APS bank “owes it to its shareholders” to explore opportunities for growth, APS bank CEO Marcel Cassar said on Thursday, stopping shy of commenting on reports of the bank’s negotiations to purchase HSBC Malta.
 Cassar said that the bank is “continuously analysing opportunities that may arise in our natural market.""
 ""We believe that there is a lot of potential in the bank that is yet to be unleashed, so we owe it to our stakeholders to explore possibilities to gain scale”.
 But Cassar would not comment on reports about negotiations, saying that the “as a responsible listed bank, we will inform the market through company announcements whenever there is anything to report”.
 Cassar was speaking as the bank presented its financial results for the first nine months of the year, which saw the pre-tax profits dip to just under €15m from the €23.6m registered at this point last year.
 The overall group’s profits were slightly higher than those of the bank, at €16.5m, although these also lagged behind last year’s €23.3m.
 These numbers are “not a surprise,” Cassar said.
 “We started anticipating that the high interest rate environment, coupled with the buildup of the bank’s rights issue was piling pressure on our margins and squeezing our income.”
 The results also reflect the bank’s policy to pass down the European Central Bank’s interest rate cuts to its customers, Cassar added.
 “The impact on our finances has been significant, but we are seeing improving margins and expect them to improve further in the last quarter of the year.”
 Despite the drop in profits, the bank said several aspects of its operations performed strongly, from the growth in its business and loan books to the increase in assets under its management.
 Notably, APS CFO Ronald Mizzi said that the bank’s home loan portfolio had now grown to over €2b, just short of a quarter of the entire market. In practice, Mizzi said, this means that 45% of every new home loan throughout 2024 is being financed by APS.
 The bank’s overall loan book, including home loans, grew by €226.6m to now stand at €3.1b, with commercial and syndicated loans also showing “cautious growth”.
 Meanwhile, the bank’s customer deposits saw a 10% rise, some €305.3m, since the beginning of the year, now standing at €3.4b.
 Nevertheless, the bank is looking to raise more capital through a new rights issue. While this was initially planned to take place at the end of this year, this will now likely take place in the first half of 2025, Cassar said.

 Stockbroker Paul Bonello flagged on Facebook how there was a sudden jump in share trades hours before MIA’s board announced its half-yearly financial results and the dividend payments to shareholders.
 Bonello said the timing of the trades just before the dividend announcement was indicative of insider trading, which is prohibited.
 Insider trading occurs when a person uses or attempts to use inside information from a company for his own benefit or for the benefit of others.
 In comments to Times of Malta, an MFSA official said the regulator takes such allegations seriously.
 “As per MFSA internal procedures, the necessary reviews/evaluations will be made for the appropriate action to be taken, both from a supervisory perspective, as well as in terms of enforcement, if need be,” the official said.
 MIA poured cold water on the claim in a company announcement on Thursday.
 It said the company disclosed on July 18 that the board of directors would consider the proposal of an interim dividend at a meeting held on August 1.
 MIA said it has a significant track record of communication with the market, as it regularly issues monthly announcements on passenger numbers, quarterly financial statements and company updates ahead of board meetings scheduled to consider the approval of financial statements and the declaration of dividends.
 A company spokesperson told Times of Malta MIA has formally requested the MFSA to “inquire further into this matter”.
 According to airport financial figures released on Thursday, MIA generated €66.4 million in revenue over the first half of the year, netting €22.1 million in profits.
 MIA CEO Alan Borg said during a press conference that the company’s solid financial performance enabled it to distribute its highest interim dividend to date to shareholders and continue to invest in the development of MIA.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/construction-continued-slow-2023-central-bank.1091691,"The construction sector show­ed signs of continued slowdown last year, employing more workers but dropping in productivity, according to Central Bank of Malta figures.
 The largest drop in productivity across the economy last year was in construction, which declined by almost 13%, the bank said in its annual report for last year.
 It noted that while employment in the sector grew by 5%, its output decreased by 8%, leading to an overall slump in productivity. At the same time, its share of the total value added to the economy fell by almost a fifth.
 Meanwhile, the number of Planning Authority residential and commercial permits drop­p­ed by around 15%, while investment dwindled and confidence in the sector plummeted to its lowest levels since the pandemic, the report showed.
 The bank said residential construction was expected to “decline marginally” this year amid “weak sentiment” in the sector and “increasingly binding” labour shortages.
 However, it noted that despite the slowdown, construction was still expected to deliver “modest growth” this year with employment in the sector also forecast to improve over the next three years.
 Despite confidence in construction dropping by more than 80%, the bank noted it was still “firmly above” the historical average.
 The central bank’s annual report cements similar findings last year pointing to a slowdown within the construction industry.
 In August, auditing giant KPMG said the sector had shrunk by 14% in the first three months of 2023 when compared to the same period in 2022, a trend it said at the time had been ongoing for a year and a half.
 And data from the central bank report shows the sector’s Gross Value Added (GVA) has fallen steadily since 2021, dropping by around €40 million each year. During the same period, employment in construction rose by 20% to reach almost 19,000 last year.
 GVA measures the economic value that each individual sector contributes to a country’s economy. Last year, the construction industry’s share of the total GVA fell to 3.4% from 4% the year before.
 Last April, Finance Minister Clyde Caruana hit out at Developers Association president Michael Stivala after the construction mogul claimed the sector was vital for sustaining “health and education, infrastructure and all the other social schemes”.
 Caruana argued instead that the country’s economic growth was mainly driven by other industries, including financial services, gaming and tourism, rather than hinging on the construction industry.
 And the latest report seems to support Caruana’s assertion, with central bank figures revealing that exports ‒ which includes tourism ‒ contributed almost 90% of the country’s 5.6% Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth last year.
 GDP measures the monetary value of all goods and services produced by a country.
 “Services remained the main driver behind the rise in economic activity, adding 4.9 percentage points to real GDP growth”, the financial institution said, pointing to professional and administrative services and financial and insurance activities, among others, as the main drivers of growth.
 Construction, meanwhile, lower­ed GDP growth by 0.3 percentage points due to the value added by the sector falling “for the second consecutive year”, it said. For the second year in a row, construction was the least contributing sector to GDP growth, with Malta’s agricultural sector the only other to contribute negatively.
 Overall, economic growth and inflation both hit 5.6% last year, while the government deficit reached 3.4% of GDP in the third quarter and employment grew by 5.7%.
 The central bank report also reveals that total private and public sector investment drop­ped dramatically last year, falling by 22% after rising by a whopping 31% the year before.
 “The most significant decrease [in investment] was recorded in expenditure on transport equipment, reflecting a decrease in registrations of aircraft from the very high level recorded a year earlier,” the report said.
 “Investment in other buildings and dwellings also declined. On the other hand, investment in intellectual property increased, while investment in cultivated biological resources remained broadly stable.”
 The central bank predicts Malta’s GDP will continue to grow over the next three years, but at a slower rate than last year.
 Growth is expected to reach 4.4% this year, 3.6% next year and 3.3% in 2026, while government debt as a percentage of GDP is expected to increase to 54.3% by 2026.
 The rate of increase in employment is expected to halve to 3.2% this year while unemployment is set to rise marginally over the next three years.
 And while there is good news for consumers, with inflation expected to almost halve this year to 2.9%, exports are antici­pated to reduce drastically this year through to 2026 amid geopolitical tensions and trade disruptions.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/from-here-long-run-strategic-review-hsbc-changes-mind-malta.1097910,"For years, HSBC Malta has been reassuring its customers that it is going to stay put in the country, but a new company announcement has cast its future in serious doubt.
 That HSBC has been quietly chipping away at its European operations and pivoting towards growing its presence in Asia is no secret.
 Reports last year revealed that it would be selling or drastically streamlining its presence in 12 European countries, effectively slashing a fifth of its operations.
 Sales across several countries followed, from France to Greece to Russia.
 Malta had long been rumoured to be on the chopping block, a suggestion frequently dismissed by HSBC Malta.
 HSBC is in Malta “for the long run”, HSBC Malta CEO Geoffrey Fichte told  Times of Malta just eight months ago.
 “I could speak until I’m blue in the face but you just need to look at what we’re doing in Malta,” he said, pointing to the company’s new €30m headquarters, when asked whether the bank is looking for an escape route.
  The bank's announcement on the stock exchange that ""it will undertake a strategic review"" indicates a change of mind. 
 But the signs had been piling up for some time.
 In October 2019, the bank shut down several of its branches and ATMs across the island, from Ħamrun to  St Julian’s and Marsascala, ostensibly to “focus on digital banking services”.
 One month later, the bank announced it would shed 180 of its workers in a €16m voluntary redundancy scheme.
 A 2020 Financial Times report suggesting that the bank was looking into whether to sell or shutter its operations across several of its smaller markets, including Malta, was met with silence, with the bank simply saying that its policy was “not to comment on speculative stories”.
 Wednesday’s announcement marks a clear change of tone. Although the bank’s statement stops short of tracing the bank’s plans in Malta, it is the first admission that there could be cracks in the armour, which could widen once the bank’s “strategic review” is completed.
 It remains to be seen whether the strategic review will bring  HSBC Malta’s almost quarter-century presence in Malta to an end.
 The bank’s introduction to Malta on the eve of the millenium was no less controversial. On 2 June 1999, the Maltese government handed over its 67.1% stake in Mid-Med Bank to Midland Bank PLC, a member of the HSBC group.
  The Lm91 million (roughly €191m) deal, brokered by then-Finance minister John Dalli, was widely seen to come short of the bank’s true value, with the government’s move harshly criticised by the opposition and bankers.
 Then-opposition leader Alfred Sant called for Dalli’s resignation, arguing that Mid-Med Bank’s sale should have been opened up to offers from other potential buyers. Meanwhile, Mid-Med Bank’s former chair, Alfred Mifsud, insisted that the bank had been sold for well under its true value.
  The sale also included the only painting of Malta by one of England’s most beloved Romantic painter, J.M.W. Turner, which had been recently purchased by Mid-Med Bank.
 The painting, depicting Malta’s Grand Harbour, was eventually loaned to the Museum of Fine Arts and remains at MUŻA  on a  permanent loan from HSBC.
 But, Dalli rebutted, HSBC’s introduction to Malta would place Malta “more securely on the international financial map” and bring about “a quantum leap in the the banking sector in Malta”.
 Meanwhile, HSBC Malta’s profits soared by 30% each year, rising from €32m in 2000, its first full year in Malta, to almost €120m in the span of just a handful of years.
 The bank reported profits of €134m last year and €39.3m in the first three months of 2024.
 But these profits will mean little to the bank’s thousands of customers and roughly 9,000 investors, who will be awaiting the outcome of the bank’s strategic review with bated breath.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/farsons-reports-96-million-pretax-profit-first-half-year.1098573,"The Farsons Group has reported a profit before tax of €9.6 million for the first half of the year.
 It said the results for the first six months of 2024 showcased its ability to navigate evolving market conditions through the implementation of strategic initiatives.
 ""The Group’s diverse business portfolio and proactive management efforts were instrumental in delivering this performance, despite challenges in certain sectors.""
 Group turnover for the first six months rose by 7%, to €69.8 million, with profit before tax up 18% to €9.6 million.
 Group Chairman Louis A Farrugia attributed the growth to operational efficiencies and strategic investments.
 The Beverage and Food segments saw increases of 6.6% and 8.2% with improved profit margins of 15.8% and 10.8% driven by higher demand and cost control measures.
 Earnings per share (EPS) rose by 17%, from €0.209 to €0.245, reflecting the group’s strong performance and commitment to maximizing shareholder returns.
 Group CEO Norman Aquilina, noted broad growth across all sectors in the first six months driven by changing  demographics, increased tourism, and a growing supplier base.
 ""Despite fierce competition in the importation sector, which impacted profit margins, the group's diverse  business model helped mitigate pressures. Strong performance in the manufacturing sector and franchised restaurants offset the margin mitigation, highlighting the group’s resilience and the success of its strategic initiatives focused on innovation, efficiency and margin optimisation,"" he was quoted as saying in a statement.
 Farrugia emphasised the group’s ongoing commitment to long-term growth and sustainability with focus on reinvesting profits to modernise operations. Farsons is nearing completion of a major renewable energy project to expand its photovoltaic capacity, and is developing a CO2 recovery plant to enhance sustainability and strengthen its production supply chain.  
 A major investment in the food sector is underway with the construction of a state-of-the-art logistics center and office complex in Ħandaq, set for completion by 2026. This will expand warehousing and operational capacity to support the growth of subsidiaries Quintano Foods and Food Chain.
 The group’s strategic review of its Foods business, which is nearing completion, includes evaluating the potential benefits of structuring the expanded operations into a separate listed entity. The board is expected to present detailed proposals to shareholders in the near future.
 Looking ahead to the second half of the financial year, the group said it expects a moderation in performance due to seasonal factors that typically affect demand in the latter part of the year.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/watch-malta-economy-need-cpr-chamber-ceo-marthese-portelli.1097504,"Malta’s economy is overheating and the time for incremental changes has passed, the Malta Chamber’s CEO has warned.
 Marthese Portelli is adamant the country now requires comprehensive and immediate action to address its economic challenges.
 “The country needs CPR. We need a government that connects, plans and reforms,” Portelli insists in an interview with Times of Malta.
 In its pre-budget 2025 document published last week, the Malta Chamber of Commerce urges a shift in the country’s economic strategy towards high-value industries, improved governance, and more prudent management of public resources.
 “We need to speed up the implementation process of all the decisions that need to be taken in the interest of Malta, some of which might not be exactly popular immediately in the short term but will be of benefit to the country in the longer term.”
  “Malta is nearing breaking point, with full employment putting immense pressure on the nation’s infrastructure, particularly in areas such as traffic management and utilities.”
 She says the Malta Chamber has long championed a transition from a labour-intensive economy to one focused on high-value industries.
 While the influx of foreign workers has been necessary in certain sectors, Portelli contends it has done little to enhance the skills and expertise crucial to building a high-value-added economy.
 To tackle these challenges, she advocates a sweeping overhaul of the education system, a stronger emphasis on digitalisation and automation, and a more strategic approach to attracting highly skilled foreign workers.
 These measures are essential for Malta to reduce its reliance on population growth and move towards a more sustainable economic model.
 The Malta Chamber is critical of the government’s handling of third-country nationals (TCNs – foreign workers from outside the EU) in the labour market.
 In its pre-budget document, the Malta Chamber calls for a more selective approach, proposing caps on TCNs in certain industries, particularly those already facing oversupply, such as construction.
 While acknowledging the need for TCNs in essential services and sectors such as tourism, Portelli warns against an unchecked influx that does not significantly contribute to the country’s skill base.
 Portelli also questioned the government’s financial strategy, expressing concern over proposed tax cuts that the prime minister has described as historic.
 “I just hope it will not just be another handout sent by post, first of all, because it is totally environmentally unsustainable, and also because we believe that if we need an impetus in spending power, it needs to be given gradually through salaries paid per year.”
 She cautions against implementing these cuts without a clear plan to fund them, particularly in light of Malta’s current excessive deficit.
 “Such fiscal measures could jeopardise essential public services and infrastructure projects,” she says.
 A key recommendation from the Chamber is for the government to shift its focus from recurrent expenditure to capital investment. Malta’s infrastructure, especially in energy and transportation, is in dire need of modernisation, she says.
 The Malta Chamber is particularly concerned about the current energy distribution network’s inadequacies, which are stifling economic growth and hindering the country’s ability to meet renewable energy targets.
 Portelli supports a gradual reduction in energy subsidies, even though the Malta Chamber’s members stand to lose. She advocates for the savings to be redirected towards supporting companies and individuals investing in renewable energy solutions.
 She also raised concerns about the Planning Authority’s continued approval of permits despite evidence of oversupply, suggesting the construction industry needs to be realigned to meet the country’s needs.
 “Studies show us we have an oversupply of office space and yet the Planning Authority keeps issuing permits for office buildings. The same applies to supermarkets and shopping malls.  Do we really need more?”
 Portelli also called for the revision of the Strategic Plan for Environment and Development (SPED) which is four years late.
 “We have a version dated 2015 which states that the document should have been revisited by 2020.”
 Governance is another area where the Chamber sees significant room for improvement.
 “We have consistently called for greater transparency and accountability in public procurement, suggesting a public procurement outlook that would detail the government’s spending plans for the next six to 12 months.”
 Portelli argues that such measures would reduce reliance on direct orders and ensure a more competitive and efficient use of public funds.
 She reiterates the Malta Chamber’s call for a moratorium on new hotel developments, citing the strain on Malta’s infrastructure and the need to prioritise quality over quantity in tourism.
 “In Valletta there are boutique hotels which cannot operate properly because of the inadequate distribution network. We have had boutique hotels that had to switch off their lift if they have a kitchen operating in full flow. Is this the product we are offering,” she asks.
 Throughout the interview, Portelli emphasised Chamber’s commitment to ethical business practices.
 She advocates for the introduction of a whitelisting system to ensure that govern­ment entities engage with reputable suppliers and a blacklisting system to hold defaulting contractors accountable.
 This, she argued, would protect both businesses and consumers by promoting transparency and ethical standards.
 Last year the Malta Chamber put forward 219 proposals, but only four – or the equivalent of 1.8 per cent – were taken on in full by the government. Likewise, only 20 per cent of the Malta Chamber’s 2020 document on good governance has been implemented so far.
 And yet Portelli does not feel discouraged. Asked whether her organisation feels it has the government’s ear, she says “we feel that government hears us but does not listen to us properly. Implementation is not exactly there.”
 One of the problems recently highlighted by the Malta Chamber is the frequent turnover in CEO positions at major government entities.
 Insisting that CEOs should be appointed on merit and competitively and transparently, just like in the private sector, Portelli argues that “every time the top management of a government agency changes, we have to start from scratch. We cannot afford to continue repeating the same things year in, year out while nothing gets done.
 “The traffic congestion is one such situation,” she says. “Years ago, we presented the government with proposals, but the gridlock keeps getting worse year after year. It gives us the sense that for the government it’s just a matter of plug and play.”

https://timesofmalta.com/article/malta-see-70-rise-hotel-rooms-pipeline-projects-completed.1092855,"Malta could see an additional 483 hotels crop up on the island if all the planned tourism accommodation projects in the pipeline ever come to fruition, new data has shown. 
 The information was shared during the Malta Hotels and Restaurants Association’s hospitality forum during a presentation on hotel occupancy by Deloitte. 
 With a disclaimer stressing that not all projects in the pipeline may materialise, Financial Advisory Director Matthew Xuereb said that, if all of them do come to fruition, this would see a 70% jump in rooms available for tourists in Malta. 
 He also added that due to the nature of these projects, there is no definite timeline on which they may be completed and noted that the data did not take into account any existing property whose use may not remain for tourism purposes in the future. 
 Xuereb said the vast majority of these planned accommodations (41%) are designed to be 3-star offerings, which means such projects might not necessarily align with the national vision to accommodate ""high quality"" tourists. 
 Another 32% of the planned accommodations are labelled as ""other"", while 5-star and 4-star accommodations are set to take up 10% and 18% respectively. 
 Xuereb highlighted his concern about how the majority of the 3-star and ""other"" planned accommodations are set to have less than 100 rooms, throwing into question whether these can actually survive in the long term. 
 Some 1,664 of the planned 3-star accommodation are only planned to have 0-50 rooms, with a further 2,658 planned to have 50 to 100 rooms. 
 Of the accommodations rated as ""other"" 4,165 of these are planned to have 0-50 rooms, with only 116 projects planned for 100-200 rooms. 
 “Looking at planned 5-star and 4-star accommodations, those aren’t small numbers but they could potentially be managed,” Xuereb said. 
 “But when it comes to 3-star and others, where we are looking at an increase of some 10,000 hotel rooms, the majority of which have 50 rooms or less, how can that operate sustainably?” 
 Hoteliers and other stakeholders in the tourism industry have been sounding the alarm on the pace of supply of tourist accommodation since at least 2018, when the MHRA called for a study to determine the maximum amount of tourists Malta could possibly cope with due to its limited size and population density. 
 In 2022, an MHRA-commissioned Deloitte study found that Malta would need to see 4.7 million tourists a year to keep its occupancy rates afloat, although the study stopped short of naming what a sustainable number of tourists the country should aim for. 
 In 2021, an MHRA survey also found that an economic slowdown was on the cards for the Maltese tourism industry irrespective of the COVID-19 pandemic, as a sharp increase of available tourist beds had started to outpace demand for them in 2019. 
 During Xuereb’s presentation on Wednesday, he found that 5-star hotels had managed to stay profitable by upping room rates despite a minor slowdown in occupancy, while hotels that were performing in the median and lower percentile struggled to break even and in some cases were making a loss.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/some-businesses-experienced-decline-sales-black-friday-chamber-smes.1101802,"The Malta Chamber of SMEs said it has received “mixed outcomes” from businesses regarding their Black Friday sales, with some reporting a decline in sales compared to last year. 
 Originating in the US, Black Friday is now considered one of the shopping high points of the year. 
 On Friday, consumers were spoilt for choice as numerous retailers across Malta promoted different offers and discounts.
 Many businesses did not wait for Friday to offer their deals, and instead stretched out deals for the whole month of November. 
 
 In a statement, the Malta Chamber of SMEs said that while some businesses experienced very positive sales and some even an increase in sales, others reported a drop compared to the previous year. 
 ""With regards to average spend, some sectors reported lower average spend,"" the chamber reported. 
 It noted how the performance of Black Friday was also influenced by location and weather conditions, impacting customer turnout and sales in some areas. 
 ""In contrast, shopping malls across Malta and Gozo reported strong footfall from early morning and positive sales throughout the day,"" the chamber said.
 ""The extension of promotional offers over the month of November proved beneficial for both customers and businesses.""
 Sectors traditionally associated with Black Friday, such as shops selling electronics, appliances, and homeware achieved the best results, with many offering promotions throughout the month. 
 The results can change, as businesses look forward to the weekend, as most stores will retain their offers.
 ""The Malta Chamber of SMEs highlights that Black Friday continues to be one of the most significant periods of the year for businesses,"" the statement concluded.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/hsbc-bank-malta-reports-record-halfyear-profits.1096162,"HSBC Bank Malta has reported record half-year profits, with a record profit performance of €78.6m in the first half of the year. 
 In a statement, the bank said that this has enabled it to continue the trend of rewarding shareholders with the highest interim dividend in the past decade. 
 The bank directors have recommended a gross interim dividend of 10 cents per share. 
 HSBC said that profit before tax increased by €19.3m to €78.6m, mainly driven by an increase in revenue due to the higher interest rate environment and higher credit recovery which was partially offset by higher costs as the bank continued to invest. 
 Revenue increased by €21.5m or 20% driven by rising interest rates and a 34% increase in trading income. Progress was also reported in net fee income and income from the insurance subsidiary.
 Costs are €6.6m higher than the same period in 2023. This increase was largely driven by the investment in people, technology as well as the new headquarters in Qormi.
 During the first six months, loans to customers and deposits were slightly lower than those reported up until December 31, 2023.   
 Profit attributable to shareholders of €50.7m for the six months ended June 30 and resulted in earnings per share of 14.1 cents which compared favourably with 10.7 cents in the same period in 2023.
 Return on equity of 18.3% for the past six months compared favourably with 16.2% for the same period in 2023.
 Cost efficiency ratio (‘CER’) improved to 43.9% from 46.6% in the same period last year as the increase in revenue outweighed the increase in costs.
 The bank maintained a strong liquidity and capital position as of June 30, with a   Liquidity Coverage Ratio of 552% and Tier 1 Capital of 21.1%.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/food-beverages-retailer-dr-juice-begins-phasing-singleuse-cups.1091803,"Food and beverages retailer Dr Juice will begin phasing out single-use cups from today, replacing them with reusable plastic cups made in Malta.
 Customers will be able to buy a fresh new cup for €1 or purchase their drink in a pre-used (and pre-washed) cup for an additional 50 cents, while being able to take both home.
 The company has not provided a firm timeline for how long it will take to fully switch over to the new cups but estimates it will take around six months.
 Dr Juice says it is making the switch at no profit while going out of its way to reduce its environmental footprint.
  Speaking to Times of Malta in the run-up to the launch, the company’s founder, John Winfield said its packaging had been troubling him for years, especially when he noticed it littering the streets. 
 “Over the last three to five years, the impact of the amount of packaging that we’re putting out started to weigh on me,” he said, adding the problem had only become worse following the COVID-19 pandemic and the delivery business “exploding”.
 Winfield said that though the company’s cups were biodegradable, they were often not disposed of properly, with many ending up in landfill sites.
 And, while the company had tried introducing stainless steel reusable cups in the past, he said their take-up had been slow, speculating the price tag of around €12 could have been a factor.
 So, for this latest attempt, the company opted for plastic instead, with Winfield explaining the company “needed to create a cup cheap enough for customers to feel it’s not a huge leap to adopt this for every purchase”.
 But he stressed the choice of material wasn’t just about cost; by using plastic and making them in Malta, he says the cups will be able to be recycled while reducing shipping.
 “Imagine shipping 100 of these [cups] in a box – essentially, you’re shipping air... it’s a one-to-20 ratio if we make them in Malta; for every 20 containers we would usually have to import, we only need to bring in one of raw materials,” he said.
 Winfield said the cups were being produced in Malta by local company MCL, which would also have the facility to recycle them. He said the manufacturer was offering to produce them “at cost” with Dr Juice selling them on to customers for the same.
 MCL CEO Luke Satariano said the company had ""created something unique,"" stressing the new cups were the first recyclable offerings on the market designed for multiple use and were easier to recycle due to only being made from one type of plastic.
 Asked about the pre-washed cups available for 50 cents, the Dr Juice boss said the company would wash the cups in water above 65 degrees Celsius, “which kills any bacteria”, before screening them in a ‘UV [ultraviolet] sanitising cube’.
 Describing the re-usable cups as “like a deposit scheme”, Winfield said customers will be reimbursed 50 cents when bringing cups back to outlets to be reused.
 Greenwashing?  
 But with reusable plastic being more energy-intensive to produce than paper alternatives, how does this factor into Dr Juice trying to reduce its environmental footprint?
 “The great thing about this scheme is that because it's done locally, there's a lot less energy used in the process,” he said, pointing to reductions in fuel usage for transportation, something he said was a “huge part” of the energy associated with importing cups to Malta.
 Winfield said the cups would be “used, reused, recycled and remade into something else,” all in Malta, calling the process a “circular economy” and noting it hadn’t been applied to beverage containers in the country before. 
 And while he admitted there was an energy impact associated with the process, he stressed the material requirement of the cups was “the main thing we’re trying to push down”.
 But how would Winfield respond to those who might argue the move could be seen as an example of greenwashing, while Dr Juice continues to burn fuel importing exotic fruits such as pineapples, coconuts and mangoes?
 Winfield said the company used frozen fruit to avoid waste from spoilage but acknowledged that ""operating this business model on an island like Malta, [means] importation of multiple goods is inevitable.”
 However, he said the company aimed to increase their reliance on local suppliers, calling reducing its environmental footprint a “journey”.
 Winfield said Dr Juice also plans to phase out single-use straws in the following months, replacing them with metal alternatives.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/imf-calls-malta-phase-energy-tariffs.1101178,"The International Monetary Fund, like other international institutions, has projected strong but moderating economic growth for Malta, while repeating previous calls for Malta to phase out its energy subsidies.
 The Fund said in its annual country report that the Maltese economy is projected to grow by 5% in 2024 and 4% in 2025, largely in line with  projections made by the European Commission last week. That will be among the highest in the EU.
 But with the energy subsidies accounting for a fifth of Malta's financial deficit, the IMF says fixed energy price policies should be phased out and the funds allocated for investment (including green) and productivity-enhancing policies.
 ""In line with last year’s staff recommendations, the authorities should gradually but decisively exit the current fixed energy price policy by shifting to more targeted subsidies and strengthening market pricing mechanisms. This will reduce fiscal risks associated with energy price shocks, enhance incentives for energy conservation, and help accelerate the green transition. The resulting fiscal space should be allocated to public investment (including green), services (e.g., education), and innovation support,"" the fund said.
 That recommendation is at variance with declarations by the finance minister last month that the energy subsidies will stay, because they support investment, and their cost as a percentage of GDP and in real terms is well below what it was when they were introduced at the peak of the COVID crisis.
 The Fund also repeated a warning it has been making for years, that Malta should safeguard financial stability by maintaining close monitoring of risks that can arise from banks’ concentrated lending to the real estate sector.
 Malta was also urged to further develop and implement a productivity-driven growth strategy that emphasises innovation, digitalisation, education, training, and environmental sustainability. 
 The fund said developing a long-term fiscal framework is essential for strengthening Malta's policy decision-making and aligning fiscal planning with strategic priorities.  
 ""The authorities should develop a roadmap for corporate income tax (CIT) reform that aligns with the EU’s Minimum Tax Directive (Pillar II) to guide taxpayers and investors. While Malta’s wait-and-see approach—by deferring the implementation of Pillar II—allows for adaptation to international developments, it risks ceding revenue to other jurisdictions that adopt the directive sooner,"" it warned.
 ""The authorities should develop a roadmap that addresses CIT (for both foreign and domestic companies) and personal income tax due to their interaction. The roadmap should be developed and disseminated promptly, pending clarification of rules regarding Qualified Refundable Tax Credits (QRTCs) from the European Commission,"" it said. 
 In other parts of its report, the IMF said Malta's tourism sector ""requires more effective management.""
 With numerous hotel projects underway and a rise in other types of accommodation, tourism may continue to grow significantly, potentially exacerbating labour shortages, infrastructure bottlenecks, and social and environmental concerns. Attention should be given to steadily implementing the Malta Tourism Strategy 2021–2030, which aims to promote sustainable and high-quality tourism,"" it said.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/firm-fined-ignoring-customer-red-flags.1098613,"A corporate services provider has been fined by the Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit (FIAU) for failing to report suspicious activity by a client that handled “millions of euros”.
 The firm, which was not named by the FIAU as it fell under the public reporting threshold, was fined €8,000.
 In a report on its website, the FIAU said the firm knew one of its clients was reportedly convicted for “multiple financial crimes”, including money-laundering tied to fraudulent real estate investments.
 The client had also been “unresponsive” to requests by the firm for client due diligence documents.
 It was only shortly prior to the FIAU’s examination that the firm prepared a memo noting the “red flags” identified, including adverse media coverage and the failure to fulfil persistent requests for due diligence documents.
 Despite the memo recommending the client relationship be terminated and a suspicious transaction report filed with the FIAU, the report was only filed following the completion of the anti-money laundering body’s inspection.
 The customer had also failed to file annual audited financial statements with the business registry for close to a decade.
 It was observed how the last available accounts for the entity serviced by the corporate provider, dating back to 2014, showed “substantive” assets and liabilities reaching into the millions of euros. 
 “The magnitude of these figures indicates that the exposure of this customer to the company, in terms of overall activity is considerable,” the FIAU said.  This illustrates the importance of taking proactive and timely steps when unable to complete due diligence checks, the FIAU continued. It said if there is knowledge or suspicions of money-laundering, this must be reported to the FIAU without undue delay.
 Multiple court decisions over the past years have struck down FIAU fines for being “unconstitutional”.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/is-malta-overrun-supermarkets.1098617,"September has been particularly busy for supermarkets.
 Early in the month, ARD Discount, a popular Italian discount store, opened its first Maltese outlet in Mellieħa, just 100 metres up the road from the town’s Welbee’s supermarket.
 A day earlier, the Planning Authority had given its go-ahead for a new Lidl outlet in Qormi, on the site of former General Soft Drinks Factory, nestled between its existing Qormi outlet and the soon-to-be-opened Lidl on the former Cortis site in Żebbuġ.
 Meanwhile, Lidl’s plans to expand even further hit a stumbling block when the competition regulator blocked the Italian giant’s plans to buy Scotts supermarket in Żabbar, saying that it would become too dominant in the south.
 In the midst of this, the Malta Chamber questioned whether Malta needs more supermarkets, suggesting that we may have reached saturation point.
 With the country’s population continuing to grow, and spikes in food inflation in recent years, it is no surprise to find that people in Malta spent more on food last year than at any other point in recent history.
 Maltese households spent €1.2 billion on food shopping in 2023, rising to over €1.5b if we include cigarettes and alcohol. This means that each person in Malta spent a little over €2,000 on groceries throughout the year, together with another €600 on tobacco and alcohol. Not to mention the money spent on other products typically sold at supermarkets, from toiletries to household goods, pet food and garden equipment.
 This is set to rise even further this year, if trends during the first half of the year are anything to go by, with expenditure during the first six months of 2024 above that of the same period the previous year.
 
 People spend over a tenth of their income on grocery shopping, with only housing (including electricity bills) and restaurants and hotel stays proving more costly.
 So, in theory, the introduction of more competition across the supermarket sector is welcome, potentially driving grocery prices down and leaving people with more money in their pockets.
 It’s hard to tell for sure.
 A 2020 exercise by Malta’s competition regulator, MCCAA, found there were around 400 grocery shops across Malta and Gozo, from large chain supermarkets to small corner shops.
 This is likely to have increased slightly over the past four years, as new retailers moved into Malta and existing operators looked to expand their business, but it is unclear how much of this has been at the expense of more traditional grocery shops.
 Industry sources told Times of Malta there are roughly 50 supermarkets across Malta and Gozo, although these include a handful of smaller outlets run by the larger supermarket retailers, such as Greens and Scotts, who are dipping their toes into the corner shop market.
 Lidl and Welbee's lead the way, with their 10 supermarkets apiece, with several other household names such as Arkadia, Ta' Dirjanu and Chain Supermarket all having multiple outlets.
 
 Unsurprisingly, many of the supermarkets are located in Malta’s most densely populated urban centres, often just a stone’s throw away from one another. Relatively fewer larger supermarkets have opened in the country’s more sparsely populated western towns.
 Industry sources estimate there are roughly 192 small or medium-sized grocery shops run by chain outlets such as Maypole and Miracle Foods although some of them, such as those run by Dave’s, straddle the line between a large corner shop and a smaller supermarket.
 The difference between the two isn’t always clear. The rule of thumb used by the competition regulator is that a shop under 200 square metres in size is typically considered a grocery shop, not a supermarket, but this is not a hard and fast rule across the industry.
 Almost half of these small or medium-sized shops are run by Convenience Shop, with the brand’s 95 outlets now a ubiquitous sight across Malta’s towns and villages.
  Industry sources say that while Convenience Shop is looking to open more outlets, many of its competitors in the corner shop market have similar plans. Maypole are looking to add to their 29 outlets, as are Dave’s and Spar.
 In addition to these 192 outlets, there are dozens of other independent or family-run corner shops dotted around the island, together with butchers, vegetable hawkers and fishmongers.  
  Data compiled by the Food Systems Dashboard, which brings together indicators that track food and nutrition systems across the world, suggests that Malta had around 13 supermarkets for every 100,000 people in 2021, rising to 52 if we also include smaller grocery retailers.
 These figures place Malta it in the upper echelons of the list, certainly above countries in the developing world where supermarkets are few and far between, but also above some Nordic countries such as Finland and Denmark, not to mention Ireland, the US and France.
 But Malta actually trailed most other EU countries, including Greece (the world capital of supermarkets, with almost 47 for every 100,000 people), Spain, Germany and countless others.
 According to the database, Malta also had far fewer supermarkets per capita than fellow European minnows Luxembourg, Cyprus and Iceland (all at around 22), not to mention Liechtenstein, Monaco and Gibraltar.
 Curiously, the database suggests that although Malta’s supermarket scene may be flourishing, it was still being outpaced by the growing number of people in the country, meaning there were slightly fewer supermarkets and grocery stores per 100,000 people in 2021 than there were five years earlier.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/income-gap-shrinks-across-europe-malta.1096245,"The gap between high and low earners is dropping across Europe, but not in Malta, with only four EU countries now sharing their wealth more unequally than Malta.
 An analysis of the country’s economic prospects published on Friday by audit firm KPMG suggests Malta’s income inequality has now reached 33%, well above the EU rate of 29.6%.
 The only countries in Europe with a bigger gap between high earners and those living from paycheck to paycheck are Bulgaria, Lithuania, Latvia and Portugal.
 More damningly, while income inequality has steadily dropped across Europe over the past decade, Malta has been bucking the trend in recent years, with a sharp increase since 2019.
 
 KPMG says that Malta has its welfare state, which provides additional income to disadvantaged or low-income groups, to thank for the income inequality not being even higher.
 Without it, income inequality would jump to a staggering 44%, “which further highlights how important the welfare system is in creating a more equitable society,” the report’s authors say.
 This despite Malta keeping up its strong economic growth throughout 2023 and into the start of 2024.
 Several economic sectors have continued to grow in early 2024, the report says, with the accommodation and food services industry in particular performing strongly.
 Meanwhile, the construction industry appears to be bouncing back, now showing growth after “a prolonged period of contraction”.
 The country’s workforce also appears to be in good health, with over 306,500 people now employed, 4.6% higher than last year. KPMG predicts that Malta’s unemployment rate will remain steady at 3.1% until 2026.
 The worst of the inflation crisis appears to be behind us, the report suggests, with price inflation expected to drop to 2.4% this year and to 1.9% by 2026, less than half the 5.6% registered last year.
 Although Malta's inflation rate was higher than that of the Eurozone average for most of 2023 and early 2024, this appears to have been reversed in recent months.
 Malta's inflation rate reflects the energy subsidies that remain in place and which, the report's authors drily note, ""are forecasted not to be winding down fast enough"" according to the European Commission.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/private-schools-insist-fee-hikes-are-driven-profit.1098133,"Higher fees being charged by independent schools reflect teacher salary increases and are not profit-driven, the association representing the sector has said.
 Under a deal announced last week, the annual rise in private school fees will be capped at 12% for the next five years following a government commitment to inject €27 million into independent schools over the same period.
 Without it, fees were expected to soar by up to 24% and parents would have been forced to pay an additional one-off payment of €1,000, Education Minister Clifton Grima told a press conference last week.
 Asked about the rise, a spokesperson for the Independent Schools Association (ISA) said that to their knowledge, “most schools” would increase their fees by 12%.
 “The increases are not to increase profits, but to meet costs... our hope is to go back to normal rises from next year,” she said.
 Parents of independent school students said they usually saw yearly fee increases of around 5%. Letters sent out by schools shown to Times of Malta show parents could be expected to pay up to €8,300 in private school fees this year.
 “The truth is that school fees go up each year to reflect salary increases. School fees would have probably gone up significantly this year anyway,” the spokesperson said. She pointed to cost-of-living allowance (COLA) increases as one factor pushing up fees.
 She said the larger-than-usual fee increases this year reflect the higher salaries agreed in the recent deal agreed between the government and the teachers’ union.
 While independent school teachers are not government workers and therefore paid differently to those in state schools, private school salaries are “broadly in line” with state salaries, the association spokesperson said.
 She added that if independent schools did not pay as much as the state, they would not be able to retain staff or attract new teachers.
 While the 12% fee increase would cover the new higher salaries – which she stressed had been backdated in the MUT agreement – the spokesperson said the remaining 12% increase and one-off payment originally envisaged would be covered by the government deal to inject state funds into the private sector.
 Defending the figures, she said they were “all tested on each school, looking at teacher and student populations as well as teacher pay grades and experience levels.”
 She emphasised that both the 24% and later the 12% increases had been “cross-checked with auditors and the government and wasn’t just decided by independent schools”. The process was a “very studied approach”.
 The spokesperson added that independent schools had worked hard to keep the figures as low as possible.
 Asked about parents who might already feel squeezed by yearly school fee increases, the spokesperson said “that is why the government and ISA agreed the cap”.
 Stressing that around 90% of a school’s costs were for HR, she said that any impact on those costs has an impact on school fees.
 Asked if schools were considering alternative payment options for parents in light of the higher-than-usual increases, she said private schools had “always been open to financing options”.
 Emphasising the association’s support for the MUT sectoral agreement, the spokesperson said that while the sector had “needed” it, this had inevitably impacted fees.
 “We needed to recognise the work of teachers, or we would have had a national problem – but there is a cost impact to that,” she said.
 Parents of independent school students last saw price hikes above normal levels in 2018, when school fees jumped by up to 20%.
 Like this year, the increases six years ago were to match salaries being offered in state schools following the conclusion of a sectoral agreement between the teachers’ union and the government.
 The ISA represents Chiswick House School, St Martin’s College, San Anton School, San Andrea School, St Catherine’s High School, St Michael School, St Michael Foundation and Newark School.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/ive-offered-free-apartment-strings-attached-should-i-take-it.1096811,"Welcome to The Money Coach, a Times of Malta column where readers can ask questions about life's money issues. Send your questions about personal finances, inheritance, gifting or other personal finance topics to moneycoach@timesofmalta.com
 I am currently facing a problem that might cause significant tension in my future.
 My fiancée and I are looking for a property to buy and live in. We’ve found an ideal place in a village that holds sentimental value for us—perfect in every way and suitable for a growing family. However, the loan repayment would be nearly €2,000 per month – a commitment I would have to honour for the next 37 years.
 Here's where the problem lies: my grandmother has offered to give me one of her apartments for us to live in, as a 'donation.' This incredible opportunity means no loan repayments, ever. However, her condition is that the property remains solely in my name and that my fiancée would have no claim over it. Additionally, my grandmother is giving me this property specifically for me to live in, not to rent out or use as an income source.
 I am not sure if that can change in the future, but if I agree to the offer I intend to honour my grandmother’s wishes completely, even after she passes away.
 I have witnessed firsthand how tensions concerning property can impact a couple's life. Growing up, I remember the arguments at home, with my father frequently reminding my mother that the property was solely in his name. The threat of ""I can kick you out whenever I want"" was a regular occurrence, causing fear and insecurity. Though my father always apologised afterward, the damage was done, and it's a scenario I am desperate to avoid in my own marriage.
 So, Luca, what would you do in my situation? Should I accept my grandmother’s generous offer and avoid the lifelong burden of a property loan, or should I pass up this opportunity to prevent potential future tension in my relationship?
 Best regards,
 Conflicted Fiancé
 My first instinct would, of course, be to tell you to take up your grandmother on her generous offer. I have a home loan myself, and I can’t begin to imagine the extra things I could be doing if that monthly repayment commitment wasn’t there!
 I completely understand your concern about your fiancée not owning the property. This leads me to my first question: Is there a possibility, as remote as it may sound, that your fiancée buys a property under her name only? This could balance matters out – I know many couples who follow such arrangements and live in complete harmony.
 Your grandmother’s intention for you to live in the property and not rent it out complicates things. I understand why it’s such a hard decision to make. You might promise yourself you won’t ever mention what your dad used to say to your fiancée, but this can get hard, especially when tensions rise – it is rare that you control your words in such a scenario.
 So financially speaking, your grandmother’s offer makes complete sense; emotionally speaking, it might not. I had a similar offer in the past, which I chose not to take in order to ensure that my wife and I start our married life as 100% equals. Many might disagree with this stance, but to this day, seven years later, I never regretted it.
 Another consideration is the potential for growth in both your personal and financial lives. While the immediate relief from a home loan is appealing, owning property together can be a unifying project, a shared dream that you both work towards. It fosters a sense of joint accomplishment and deepens the partnership.
 On the other hand, if you decide to accept your grandmother’s gift, you could also explore ways to make your fiancée feel equally invested. Perhaps, if feasible, you could both contribute to renovating or furnishing the property, creating a shared space that reflects both of your tastes and efforts.
 Ultimately, it’s crucial that you both feel comfortable and at peace with whatever decision you make.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/household-savings-jump-january-february.1091715,"Households appeared to be saving more in the first two months of this year, with bank deposits growing sharply, according to data by the Central Bank of Malta.
 The bank said in its latest issue of the Economic Update that during the 12 months to February, residents’ deposits held with monetary financial institutions increased by 2.5%. This was the third consecutive month with year-on-year increases, following a period of declines in the final months of 2023. The latest increase was mostly driven by balances belonging to households, the Crentral Bank said, adding that deposits belonging to financial intermediaries and non-financial corporations decreased. 
 The bank also reported that time deposits with agreed maturity of up to two years – the second largest deposit category – continued to show very strong growth at the beginning of the year. They rose by 24.2% over the year to February, though less than the 31.7% recorded in the year to January.
 ""This marks the sixth consecutive period with double-digit growth and reflects more attractive terms on fixed deposit accounts by certain credit institutions. The latest increase was driven by higher balances belonging to households, as balances held by non-financial corporations increased to a lower extent,"" the bank said.
 Credit to Maltese residents grew by 5.9% in February, higher than the 5.6% growth recorded in January. Credit to general government fell by 0.2% over the 12 months to February, following a 2.2% decrease a month earlier.
 At the same time, annual growth in credit to residents outside general government increased by 8.1% in the year to February, below the 8.3% recorded a month earlier.
 The annual rate of change in loans to households reached 9.1% in February, up from 8.5% in the previous month. Growth in mortgage lending stood at 8.8%, compared to 8.2% recorded in the year to January. Furthermore, growth in consumer credit and other lending increased by 11.7% year-on-year

https://timesofmalta.com/article/i-dont-want-wait-decades-enjoy-life-how-i-boost-income-now.1095962,"Welcome to The Money Coach, a Times of Malta column where readers can ask questions about life's money issues. Send your questions about personal finances, inheritance, gifting or other personal finance topics to moneycoach@timesofmalta.com
 I recently attended a seminar hosted by a local investment firm in which the speaker emphasised the importance of investing and earning compound interest.
 It all made sense: invest regularly, a consistent sum of money monthly, and in return, your money will compound over the years. By year 25 or so, you’ll have a decent sum of money thanks to these regular investments.
 I am sceptical of this strategy. I don’t doubt that investing regularly and earning that 8-10% annual interest (the average rate of the S&P 500) has its benefits and will yield rewards after several decades. But that’s it, you know – decades – 20 to 30 years.
 I don’t want to wait 25 to 30 years to enjoy my hard-earned income.
 I know this goes against the principles of retirement schemes and what many are trying to instil – but for me, it just doesn’t make sense. Are there ways I can grow my money faster without taking unnecessary risks? I am a full-time worker with a family to care for, so I am also cautious about get-rich-quick schemes.
 I might be asking the impossible here, but well... it's worth a try.
 Best regards,
 Impatient Investor
 Dear Impatient Investor,
 I am a huge advocate of dollar-cost averaging – that is, investing a consistent amount per month and letting it compound. However, I understand your frustration, and it is something many of my clients have expressed as well.
 You might be surprised to learn that there are ways to increase your income without gambling it away or investing in risky ventures that could lead to losses.
 One of the most proven sources of extra income is monetising your passions, perhaps even creating a side hustle from them. Ask yourself, what do you enjoy doing? Do you like reading, perhaps? If so, have you ever considered doing book reviews and getting paid for it?
 You might think this is far-fetched but a man from Britain recently wrote a few Amazon reviews on fish tanks, then forgot about them. A few months later, he received a check in the mail for $350! He continued writing reviews and eventually earned around $700 for his small efforts.
 A side hustle is the perfect way to make extra money without giving up the security of your full-time job. It will give you:
 And it can be anything. One of my earliest clients worked as a teacher. She was sceptical about this side hustle idea, saying, ""My only talent is writing novels. Can you tell me how I am expected to earn money from that? Because unless you’re JK Rowling, you have very little chance of earning anything"".
 Being an aspiring writer myself, I know how hard it is to get your novel published and sold successfully. But then I asked her: ""Have you ever considered writing for brands?""
 Her creativity, I was sure, would be optimal for creating brand stories for businesses. She was hesitant at first, but then she created Fiverr and Upwork accounts. A few weeks later, she was consistently earning €400 to €500 a month. Nothing extraordinary, but enough to fund the vacations she enjoyed without touching her full-time income, or perhaps to save more.
 And guess what? It didn’t feel like work because she was doing something she liked.
 We live in the Knowledge Era, where people are making money from anything.
 That is my message to you: focus on what your talents are. Ask: what skills do I currently have that could earn me money?
 Can you afford half an hour every day for the next month to build your idea into a successful side hustle?
 It can be a game-changer.
 Best regards,
 Luca

https://timesofmalta.com/article/competition-watchdog-probe-lidl-zebbug-qormi-plans.1098715,"Malta’s competition regulator is not investigating Lidl’s plans to open new supermarkets in Żebbuġ and Qormi, a spokesperson for the authority has confirmed.
 In recent weeks, the authority blocked the German supermarket giant’s plans to take over a Scotts supermarket in Żabbar, warning that Lidl would become too dominant in Malta’s southern areas.
 But Lidl will not be facing any similar obstacles in the case of its upcoming Żebbuġ and Qormi outlets, since the plans do not involve taking over an existing supermarket.
 The two planned branches lie just two kilometres apart, with an already-existing Lidl branch a further two kilometres up the road in Qormi.
 If the plans come to fruition, there will be four Lidl branches within a seven kilometre stretch of road, from Żebbuġ to Luqa, bringing the total number of Lidl outlets across Malta and Gozo to 12.
 Replying to questions sent by Times of Malta, a spokesperson for the Malta Competition and Consumer Affairs Authority (MCCAA) said that the authority’s approval is only required in cases that “fall within the scope of the Control of Concentration Regulations”.
 In practice, this refers to cases in which a business is either taking over or merging with a competing business that operates in the same market, such as in the case of Lidl’s attempted purchase of Scotts in Żabbar.
 “In the case of Żebbuġ and Qormi properties, the office considers that the assets in question do not constitute a concentration,” the spokesperson said.
 Competition experts say that watchdogs such as the MCCAA have to tread the fine line between incentivising businesses to grow and safeguarding an even playing field for all operators in the market.
 So, while the competition office is not necessarily against a company gaining a dominant position in its respective market, it steps in when it suspects that the business is exploiting its dominance to undercut the market or harm competitors, such as through predatory pricing.
 The MCCAA spokesperson echoed this, saying that the office’s role is “not to prevent a business from growing, but to examine whether certain concentrations will be deemed notifiable by law (such as mergers, acquisitions, and joint ventures) will have harmful effects on competition”.
 “If a concentration is considered not to harm competition, it is approved unconditionally. Conversely, if a concentration is found to harm competition, the notifying party may propose suitable commitments to eliminate the harm.”
 Correction September 28, 2024: A previous version misstated Lidl's origin as Italian.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/we-want-three-children-how-much-going-cost-us.1098084,"Welcome to The Money Coach, a Times of Malta column where readers can ask questions about life's money issues. Send your questions about personal finances, inheritance, gifting or other personal finance topics to moneycoach@timesofmalta.com
 I’m a 32-year-old lawyer. My wife is a notary. We both earn decent salaries, and we have good reason to believe our incomes will grow over the next few years. The only loans we have are our home loan, and my wife still has three years of payments left on her car loan.
 We’re expecting our first child in a few months, and I won’t lie - we’re beyond excited! We’ve already started shopping for baby essentials, and we’re making sure our little one has everything he needs (yes, it’s a boy).
 I recently watched your video where you mentioned that it costs €10,000 from the moment you find out you’re pregnant until the child’s first birthday. I have to admit, that number caught me off guard. It’s not that we can’t afford it—thankfully, we’re doing fine financially - but I couldn’t help wondering how much it will continue to cost after that first year. And the thing is, we’ve always wished for a big family: three children have always been our dream.
 So, I’ve got two questions for you:
 Best regards,
 Expectant Father 
 Dear Expectant Father,
 You are right to be a bit concerned. I was also surprised at the costs one needs when children are involved (I have two young children myself).
 The €10,000 estimate might seem high to some, but let me give you a peek at how these expenses typically add up:
 
 These costs can vary from family to family, and while this gives a general overview, it's important to remember that unexpected expenses can arise.
 Of course, there are ways to lower this amount. You could rely solely on the public health service for your child’s doctor visits. You could go without a nursery or some of the other items on this list. If you wish to really push it a step further, buying second-hand items helps as well. Remember, the €10,000 price tag is an average. It can be lower, and higher as well.
 Now, to answer your questions:
 No, it’s not crazy to think of having three children in today’s world, especially if you love a big family! It’s key to forecast these costs and adjust your spending month by month. Remember also that having three children doesn’t mean that you have to go through the process of buying exactly what you bought for your first child, as most of the items can be re-used.
 You can also prepare by looking into childcare options. For example, while the Free Childcare Scheme in Malta covers children up to 3 years old for working parents, private childcare costs range from €300 to €700 per month, and after-school programmes for older children cost between €3 and €6 per hour. Babysitting or nannies could cost anywhere between €8 and €12 per hour.
 In terms of planning, you can start by calculating your current monthly income and allocating a portion to family-related expenses. Breaking down the costs over time can prevent surprises. I also encourage you to explore Malta's child benefits, including the €1,000 per child born, as well as children's allowances paid every three months.
 And while we're on the subject, it’s worth noting that maternity leave policies in Malta could certainly be improved. Compared to other countries, we're still behind in terms of providing sufficient support. Hopefully, this is something the government can address to ensure a more sustainable and family-friendly approach.
 I hope I have answered your concerns and given you the reassurance that, with the right planning, you can comfortably manage the financial aspects of growing your family. But beyond all the financial considerations, I can tell you from experience that being a parent is the most rewarding feeling you can ever experience.
 Wishing you the best of luck on this exciting journey!

https://timesofmalta.com/article/almost-500-families-receive-additional-cola-payment.1096270,"Just under 500 families will receive the additional COLA payment this week, the Ministry for Social Policy said in a statement on Saturday. 
 The benefit was introduced in the 2024 budget for low-income families but was  later expanded to include individuals who earn less than the median income or around €18,155 a year. 
 The amount of the grant ranges from €100 to a maximum of €1,500 over two payments, depending on the household wage and the size of the family. It is disbursed in two yearly payments. 
 The Ministry said that these payments are going to people who do not receive any other social benefits and had to apply for these payments. 
 Once an application is received a division within the ministry obtains information about the income of that family from the tax department to determine whether they are entitled to the benefit or not. 
 As a result, a total of 493 beneficiaries were identified as part of the latest exercise and they will receive a payout of €141,000 split between them.
 Some 99,055 families will have received the benefit throughout 2024, with a total investment projected at €33.1 million.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/supplier-second-interconnector-transformer-selected-following-20m-bid.1096581,"Key machinery required to run electricity through a second undersea interconnector is to be supplied and installed by a local firm, after its €20.3 million tender bid proved to be the cheapest.
 AG Installations has been recommended as the supplier to install a shunt reactor on each side of the interconnector – in Magħtab and Ragusa, Sicily – as well as a 220kV/132kV transformer in Maghtab.
 Shunt reactors will reduce the reactive power generated by the interconnector cable, improving its energy transmission efficiency. The transformer will step down the interconnector’s 220kV voltage to 132kV.
 AG Installations is part of the AG Group, a local company that provides mechanical, electrical and plumbing services and which is run by founder Andrei Grech.
 Its €20.3 million bid was one of two offers received for the tender. The other bid, made by Shining Star Infrastructure and Construction Ltd, came in at €24 million.
 Tender evaluators were instructed to assess bids on the basis of cost/price effectiveness.
 Interconnect Malta, the state-run entity that is overseeing the second interconnector project, has advised the Department of Contracts to award the contract to AG Installations. That is expected to be a formality, given that the deadline for other bidders to file objections to that recommendation ended on August 5.
 The tender is the first of four related to the interconnector project to be adjudicated. The largest – to manufacture and install the submarine cable itself – has an estimated value of €185 million and is still open for bids. Another tender, valued at €12 million, is for the supply and installation of 220kV Switchgear, Fire Suppression System and Construction of Fire Walls at Ragusa and the Upgrade of Control System.
 Further tenders related to the project will be published later this year, according to ICM’s website.
 In a statement on Saturday announcing the tender award recommendation, ICM said that the Sicilian Regional Administration for the Environment had this week positively reviewed the project’s screening submission. That review will play a part in the Italian environment ministry’s authorisation of the project.
 Plans to develop a second undersea interconnector linking Malta to the European energy grid were first unveiled in June 2021.
 At the time, Energy Minister Miriam Dalli had said the project would cost €170 million and be completed by 2025.
 That deadline now appears exceedingly unlikely to be met, given that tenders have are still being evaluated and Italian regulators have yet to greenlight the project. It is now projected to cost €300m, though €165m of that amount will be covered by EU ERDF Funding.
 Analysis Malta’s energy needs indicates authorities must hurry to complete it, as the country’s energy supply will be stretched to breaking point by 2030 and overwhelmed by demand by 2035.
 Minister Dalli said IC2 – as the project as been dubbed – “is central to the government’s energy vision”.
 “The project will not only strengthen one of the sources in its energy mix but will also enable the country to improve its indigenous renewable energy supply. The project will allow Malta to move towards larger scale offshore RES as the interconnector can provide a buffer to counterbalance the intermittency of renewables,” she aid.
 ICM divisional manager and engineer Joseph Vassallo said the company was pleased that reputable firms had bid for the tender.
 Manufacturing shunt reactors and the transformer came with “long lead times”, he warned.
 “The project is a complex one which involves a lot of planning and coordination between different providers given that at one time, there will be cable laying works ongoing both onshore in Malta and Italy, offshore works with detailed surveys and the laying of the subsea cable, works involving the overall control system and the installation of the transformer and reactors,” Vassallo said.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/hsbc-bank-malta-makes-393m-profit-three-months.1091762,"HSBC Bank Malta has reported a pre-tax profit of €39.3m in the first three months of this year, an increase of 48% over the €26.5m profit reported in the same period last year.
 ""The higher interest rate environment was the biggest contributor to the increase in profits. Good progress was reported on the non-interest income while lower Expected Credit Losses (ECL) recoveries were registered,"" the bank said. 
 Revenue was up €14.6m or 29% when compared to Q1 2023. This was mainly driven by higher net interest income earned on the placement of excess liquidity due to the higher interest rate environment. The bank additionally registered higher business volumes resulting in an increase in net fee income, foreign exchange and insurance income.
 It said it had recorded an improvement in the credit quality of its loan book, resulting in a release of ECL (expected credit loss) of €1.8m in Q1 2024 compared to a release of €3.7m in Q1 2023. The Q1 2024 release reflected a generic improvement in the credit quality of the book.
 The bank said it had managed to maintain costs at the same level as the same period last year despite the impacts of inflation and the continued investment in its people, technology, and premises.
 Net loans and advances to customers remained broadly in line with Q4 2023 levels.
 Customer deposits decreased marginally mainly driven by a decrease in operational corporate deposits.
 The bank’s liquidity position remained strong and regulatory capital ratios continued to exceed regulatory capital requirements.

 Earlier this week, Bonello questioned whether his removal from a guest slot on RTK's programme  Għal Kulħadd was due to comments he made about the potential acquisition of  HSBC Malta by APS, the latter of which is Church-owned.
 The radio station said Bonello's removal had nothing to do with his comments and had only happened because a sponsor had acquired his guest spot.
 In a joint statement, Bonello and Beacon Media Group (the company that runs RTK 103) said: ""The independent financial advisor would return to the station as a guest on Christine Delicata's programme Għal Kulħadd after the recently-acquired sponsor for the slot pulled out.""
 The sponsor was unaware the arrangement would impact Bonello, the statement said.
 ""As mentioned in Beacon Media's initial statement, there were never any ulterior motives in RTK's acquisition of a sponsor for the slot occupied by Mr. Bonello. There was certainly no attempt on Beacon Media's behalf to silence anyone.""
 Bonello's appearance on the RTK programme is not a sponsored advert, the statement said, adding that he is not paid for appearing on the show.
 ""Beacon Media and Mr Bonello are pleased recent misunderstandings have been cleared and look forward to collaborating going forward,"" the statement said.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/mta-marks-25-years-reflects-curse-success.1097544,"As Malta’s tourism numbers soar to unprecedented heights, Leslie Vella, deputy CEO of the Malta Tourism Authority (MTA), warns that the island is nearing its limit and that the sector’s growth needs a strategic reassessment.
 Speaking to Times of Malta on the MTA’s 25th anniversary, Vella said Malta “can no longer keep going in the direction like there is no tomorrow”. He noted that the island is approaching the maximum number of tourists it can comfortably accommodate, cautioning: “We are very close to reaching that limit.”
 Vella, who also serves as the MTA’s chief officer of strategic development, stressed that there are limits to growth, especially in small territories like Malta. “Most things can’t keep growing, whether construction, development, or tourism within a small territory. We very quickly reach limits and exceed them.”
 In 2023, Malta welcomed over three million tourists, an 8% increase over the previous record set in 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic temporarily halted the industry. Vella referred to these figures as “the curse of success” but expressed optimism that there is still time to change.
 He advocates for a shift away from what he describes as the “religion of growth”, which focuses solely on increasing numbers rather than sustainability. Vella likened the situation to needing “a trim rather than a drastic haircut”, suggesting that the solution lies not in halting tourism altogether but in scaling it back to more sustainable levels.
 He hinted that the MTA is exploring several strategies to achieve a more sustainable balance in tourism. These include promoting domestic tourism and targeting long-haul markets, such as the United States and Australia, which, typically, generate higher spending and longer stays than short-haul tourists.
  Vella emphasised the need for a holistic approach to the tourism sector that involves coordination with other industries and policymakers. “Tourism does not work in isolation,” he said, stressing the importance of collaboration among stakeholders to adopt a comprehensive strategy for the future.
 Reflecting on the MTA’s 25-year history, Vella, a key figure in Malta’s tourism sector for over four decades, recounted how the industry has evolved. When he began his career, the National Tourism Organisation of Malta (NTOM) was the primary body overseeing tourism. Established in 1984, the NTOM served as “the marketing arm of the ministry of tourism”.
 Malta’s early identity as a tourist destination was shaped mainly by its appeal as a summer getaway for British tourists. Vella described this initial approach as “heavily influenced by a colonised mindset” aimed at providing “a Mediterranean version of Britain”.
 By the 1980s, the focus had shifted to making Malta a year-round destination, attracting visitors from across Europe by leveraging local culture and heritage as a key asset. “Being entrusted to deliver the message of what your country is and seeing people enjoy it is a great privilege,” Vella said.
 The MTA was established in 1999, expanding beyond marketing to encompass broader aspects of tourism management, including licensing, compliance, enforcement and product development.
 
 Back then, around 1.2 million tourists visited Malta annually – a far cry from the over three million in 2023. “The main difference between then and now is the volume,” Vella explained, attributing the surge to significant changes within the sector.
 The advent of the internet, the spread of the euro, the formation of the Schengen area and the introduction of low-cost airlines in the 2000s were all pivotal in transforming Malta into a mass tourism destination. The arrival of Malta’s first Ryanair flight in 2006 marked a new era, with visitor numbers rising rapidly.
 When the MTA was set up, its vision was to position Malta as a destination of choice rather than just a convenient stop. According to Vella, this goal has been met and exceeded, with Malta now recognised as a sought-after location that consistently outperforms expectations.
 As the MTA celebrates 25 years, Vella expressed hope that the sector would be viewed not as a “monster” but as a powerful tool to appreciate Malta’s unique offerings.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/man-food-truck-dreams-battered-23000-import-nightmare.1097193,"An entrepreneur whose electric food truck from China reached a dead end before his business even got started has chronicled a “bureaucratic nightmare” that culminated in the vehicle’s destruction – the only solution to the ordeal.
 Over a year ago, Shane Rowe purchased the truck from a Chinese company, eager to expand Yardie’s, a small family-run coffee distribution business, by selling the Jamaican Blue Mountain brew on Malta’s streets.
 But before he knew it, the plan ground to a halt and he was battling to overcome hurdles to be able to smash his new vehicle – the only way he could plug the draining cost of daily fees to keep it in customs limbo.
 Rowe estimated that he lost just over €23,000. Breaking down the investment that went nowhere, he said the truck and shipping cost almost €20,000, with an extra €800 just to keep the vehicle at the port for an additional three weeks. He paid a further €1,500 to the destruction company just to see his investment crushed.
  It turned out that, despite his checks and assurance, the electric vehicle was non-compliant with EU standards and could not be allowed entry into the country; that the Chinese supplier refused it back on these grounds; and that the only route was to demolish it.
 That option, however, also hit a brick wall when Rowe was informed by Transport Malta that the vehicle could not even be scrapped because it had to be registered first. And this was not possible.
 Meanwhile, the family’s financial burdens were becoming increasingly untenable as the vehicle remained stuck at customs, incurring daily costs.
 When Rowe sought to buy the electric food truck in March 2023, he said the supplier had assured him it would meet necessary EU regulations and that he would not face any issues.
  Based on this, an unsuspecting Rowe proceeded with the purchase.
 He contacted Transport Malta to ask what was needed to import the vehicle and was provided a list that included a Certificate of Conformity (CoC).
 Returning to the supplier’s website, Rowe saw the CoC listed, and noted it claimed to comply with EU regulations.
 By April last year, the purchase agreement and payment were made, “following further discussions and reassurances”.
 While the supplier had initially quoted shipping costs at around €500, a year later, when it was time to ship the truck, these had increased “significantly and unexpectedly” to over €4,000, Rowe noted, adding he had no choice but to proceed at that point.
 To have everything in order, he contacted a customs clearance agent as the food truck made its way to Malta in June. One of the first things he was asked was whether he had spoken to the Malta Competition and Consumer Affairs Authority.
 The agent advised him to seek the authority’s approval of the CoC, and Rowe sent it over, only to be informed it covered certain aspects of the vehicle, including electrical work, but did not comply with EU regulations.
 With the truck already en route to Malta, Rowe repeatedly contacted the supplier to obtain the correct CoC and any other necessary documentation, but he said they were unable to provide it.
 So, when it arrived on June 16, its business journey, which was about to start, stalled abruptly. It was stuck at customs due to “insufficient documentation provided by the supplier”, Rowe said, explaining it was classified as a food cart rather than an electric vehicle.
 According to the customs clearance agent, the typical solution in such cases was to return the shipment to the country of origin. Despite the vehicle’s non-compliance, Rowe said the supplier refused to cooperate and accept the cargo, leaving him with no viable alternative.
  Rowe tried every road, turning to various officials and entities, including the Transport Ministry, to support him. He sought assistance from the Chinese Embassy in Malta and the Maltese Embassy in China but said this did not lead to any resolution, and the supplier continued to “shun responsibility”.
 “Both embassies informed me they had no jurisdiction in the matter. The Maltese embassy attempted to help by directing me to a customs clearance agent, but I already had two working on the case,” he said.
 “The agents advised that it was unprecedented for a company to refuse to take back cargo with incorrect documentation,” Rowe said.
 Facing this impasse, he had no choice but to begin to explore the only way out – scrapping the vehicle before he put it to any use. However, even that proved to be fraught with complications and a Catch-22 situation: the truck could not be demolished because it was not yet registered. And it could not be registered because it was non-compliant.
 The aspiring entrepreneur started to lose steam. But he continued to chug on, as the costs to keep the vehicle at the wharf increased daily.
 He worked with TM and MCCAA to find a solution and, eventually, an exception was made to release the vehicle from customs for destruction.
 But even the process of coordinating this frustrating twist faced delays. Rowe contacted the approved destruction facility and continued to plead for expedited release to minimise the “immense financial burden and emotional strain” on his family.
 Yardie’s was finally smashed to pieces on July 19 thanks to a bureaucratic nightmare with no clear resolution in sight.
  While he recognised the blind spots in some of the actions he took, he pointed to the irony of spending weeks chasing multiple organisations for the possibility to destroy his own truck.
 “As an aspiring entrepreneur, I was simply trying to start a business and contribute to the economy,” he said, adding it has been a “tough lesson”.
 Rowe chose to highlight the vehicle shipment issue to avoid others experiencing similar pitfalls.
 And while it has been a costly journey, he said he did not feel it was a road to nowhere and his hopes and dreams for Yardie’s coffee have not been crushed.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/digital-innovation-hub-opens-doors-startups-smes.1101358,"A new digital innovation hub has opened in Mrieħel, providing start-ups and SMEs access to advanced technology and resources.
 Inaugurated on Thursday, Economy Minister Silvio Schembri said DiHubMT aims to foster innovation, collaboration, and business growth by offering cutting-edge tools and professional support to start-ups and SMEs.
 The hub hosts among others, ten 3D printers, a podcasting studio, access to a metaverse platform, hot desks and meeting rooms.
 The hub cost €6.6 million and was co-financed by the EU. 
  A high-performance computer - the first of its kind locally - will be installed on-site in May next year, offering computational power that researchers currently seek abroad, the minister said.
 “The potential of the digital (sector) is enormous. For an island without natural resources, we need to continue investing in people,” he said.
 CEO of the Malta Digital Innovation Authority Kenneth Brincat described DiHubMT as “a platform where ideas are born, grown, and become a reality"".
 He also highlighted Malta's growing reputation in the tech industry, referencing a Business Insider article that noted the area has “more AI startups per capita than the United States"".
 The hub's head Bernard Montebello meanwhile focused on the place's role in fostering a sense of community among entrepreneurs through mentorship opportunities, networking, and workshops.
 The hub is partnered with over 220 hubs across Europe.
  The hub already hosts seven start-ups, six of which are locally founded. These Happy Pot - a 3D printing company specialising in sustainable plant pots.
 Times of Malta spoke to Chris Mercieca, 24, co-founder of Happy Pot, who praised the hub’s resources.
 “The space is excellent because we finally have a place to put our heads together and come up with ideas... but the fact we have access to people, workshops, and technology is insane,” he said.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/plans-major-san-gwann-odz-supermarket-withdrawn-outcry.1092737,"Plans for a massive supermarket project outside the development zone in San Ġwann have been withdrawn two days after a public outcry. 
 Objectors received an email from the Planning Authority on Monday stating: ""Please be informed that the application has been withdrawn.""
 On Saturday, Times of Malta revealed the application to build a 7,000 square metre supermarket adjacent to a private secondary school.
 Prime Minister Robert Abela was among those who opposed the project, saying he felt it is a “non-starter” and that the town's Labour-led council would object.
 The proposal was to build a two-storey supermarket with underground parking on a 7,000-square-metre site on Triq tal-Balal and Triq tal-Prepostu, in an area of San Ġwann known as Ta’ Ġnien Tut.
 The site is just over 250 metres from another supermarket, while an application for a supermarket and a DIY store on a site directly across the road is still being processed.
 The PA had already been inundated with objections to the proposed development, particularly because the site in question is agricultural land outside the development zone and located close to a school, St Michael Foundation for Education.
 According to the public application form submitted by architects JG Periti, Jason Pace is the sole owner of the site in question. However, the PA website lists the developer as being Meleney Gauci.
 The total area of the site is around 12,000 square metres.
 The area proposed for the project abuts Wied Għomor and Wied il-Kbir, protected areas of ecological importance and sites of scientific importance.
 Objectors insist that the application runs contrary to the PA’s rural policy and objectives of the Strategic Plan for Environment and Development, which limits land take-up for uses which are not necessary or legitimate in rural areas.
 “San Ġwann already has numerous supermarkets and the take-up of agricultural ODZ land, let alone land that is on the doorstep of a school and a protected ecological area, is certainly not necessary or legitimate,” the objectors wrote in their representation filed with the PA.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/aps-advanced-negotiations-buy-hsbc-malta.1097941,"Updated 11.15pm with HSBC statement
 APS Bank is in advanced negotiations to take over HSBC’s Malta operations, according to inside sources who spoke to Times of Malta.
 HSBC announced on Wednesday morning that it would be carrying out a “strategic review” of its operations, its clearest hint yet at a possible exit from the country.
 Insiders told Times of Malta that negotiations between APS and HSBC’s global shareholders have been underway for several years, ever since it became apparent that HSBC Malta was looking to wind down its operations.
 In a company announcement issued late on Wednesday, HSBC Malta said it did not know of any such talks.
 HSBC Malta said ""it is not aware of any such negotiations taking place between the majority shareholder and APS Bank p.l.c. or any other third party but has requested clarification of the position from its majority shareholder."" 
 The bank's shares fell 18.2% in trading while APS Bank shares rose 11.5%. 
 HSBC's exit is believed to be driven by the bank's gradual pivot away from Europe and smaller markets towards Asia.
 The negotiations are believed to have been sparked by international parties who, knew of HSBC’s intention to leave Malta and approached both banks to see if there was interest.
 
 The discussions did not directly involve HSBC Malta, whose CEO Geoffrey Fichte earlier this year insisted with Times of Malta that the bank was in Malta “ for the long run”.
 Although negotiations are ongoing, the two parties are believed to agree on several key elements of the deal, including its overall price. 
 Nevertheless, sources say, advisers on both sides of the negotiating table will work to iron out several details before the deal can be concluded.
 The deal would see APS purchase HSBC’s 70% stake in the bank, although it remains to be seen whether HSBC opts to keep a foothold in the market by holding on to a minor share of the pie.
 Although negotiations are progressing smoothly, the transition could take some time. 
 Sources say that regulatory approvals and procedures make it unlikely that the takeover will be completed within the next 18 months.
 The move would see APS up its market share significantly, growing to rival that of market leaders BOV and overshadowing all other banks in Malta. Whether this raises any regulatory concerns over  competition across the market remains to be seen.
 This expansion would effectively mean that HSBC’s customers would eventually be transferred to APS.
 The move is not without its doubters.
 Some figures in government are believed to be pushing for a foreign buyer, but it is unclear whether any reputable foreign banks have expressed concrete interest in HSBC’s Maltese operations.
 HSBC has been quietly chipping away at its European operations and pivoting towards growing its presence in Asia. Reports last year revealed it would be selling or drastically streamlining its presence in 12 European countries, effectively slashing a fifth of its operations.
 Sales across several countries followed, from France to Greece to Russia.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/insurance-association-calls-mandatory-workplace-pensions-budget.1098480,"The Insurance Association Malta has urged the government to make workplace pensions mandatory in the forthcoming budget while introducing a transitory framework for employers to contribute towards their employees' pensions.
 ""With people living longer and not always managing to set aside sufficient funds for their future, a mandatory workplace pension will help to smooth the transition to retirement while maintaining a good standard of living,"" it said.
 “Malta should adopt the British model and introduce mandatory workplace pensions with a voluntary opt-out. Experience has shown that for this to succeed, employers should also pool in and contribute to entice employees to take part,” the association said.
 The Association said private pensions were still relatively under-developed. Although the foundations had been laid, workplace pensions and private third pillar pensions still had a long way to go.
 “As the government works on finalising its budget for 2025, we urge it to consider our proposals and present a more ambitious and courageous approach by introducing mandatory workplace pensions that will also encourage employers to contribute. In this way employees will think twice before opting out,” it said.
 With contributions made tax deductible for employers, they could also benefit from a tax credit on the amounts made, the association said. 
 It added that at a recent meeting at the finance ministry, it also called for effective enforcement of drink and drug-driving laws and raised issues related to workplace safety, electric vehicles and the challenges the repair industry faced, as well as fire safety in buildings.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/emney-barred-taking-new-clients-financial-regulator.1098503,"Updated 12.30pm with Em@ney statement
 A payments services provider has been ordered to stop taking on new clients as its operations come under scrutiny from the financial regulator.
 Em@ney, a Ta’ Xbiex digital payments provider, hit the headlines this month after  Times of Malta reported how its clients were unable to access their funds for “several days” without explanation.
 In directives published last week, the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA) ordered Em@ney to stop taking on new clients until it ensures that the “proper governance and internal controls” are in place to operate its payments services licence in accordance with the law. Em@ney has also been ordered to process client transactions in a “timely and efficient manner” after carrying out the necessary anti-money laundering checks.
 The company is to report weekly to the MFSA on the status of client transactions being processed. The regulator said Em@ney must ensure that any decisions taken are done by individuals authorised by the MFSA to act on its behalf.
 A company spokesperson has blamed the delays in processing client transactions on “technical difficulties” with its IT systems caused by a change in management.
 The former chief executive officer and board of directors have, however, pushed back at the claims.
 In a joint statement last week, the company’s former CEO, Germano Arnò, and former board directors said they “bear no responsibility for the recent decisions made by the new management of Em@ney”.
 Since the handover occurred, “the former board no longer has any influence over the company’s operations”, they continued, before “entirely” attributing the suspension of banking services to the new management.
 “Despite his [Arnò’s] attempts to offer support, the new leadership chose to make sudden changes to the platform and discontinue services built over years of hard work and perseverance,” the statement read.
 Three years ago, the company was fined €360,000 by the Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit (FIAU) for a series of anti-money laundering breaches concerning clients involved in passport sales, cryptocurrency and with potential links to organised crime.
 The fine has been appealed by Em@ney.
 Cannabis associations have been hard hit by Em@ney’s problems, with many of them using the payment provider’s services.
 Association owners also report being given different explanations for the outages; one said they had been attributed to a change in company director, while another said the company had told him they were undergoing a “periodic review” by the FIAU, during which time account services would be unavailable.
 In a statement, Em@ney said it was complying fully with the regulator's order not to take on new clients. 
 The company said it was currently in the process of re-onboarding all its existing clients, in like with Know Your Client and due diligence requirements. 
 The re-onboarding is necessary because the company ""lost access to critical banking IT systems and data"" as a result of an ""uncooperative"" provider, it said. 
 All clients who have been re-onboarded can use its SEPA transfer system, it said. 
  Em@ney insisted it had followed all necessary procedures in terminating its previous CEO, including informing the MFSA and Malta Business Registry. 
 It denied claims that 3,000 Italian clients lost access to their funds, saying the company has around 1,000 clients in total, with 40 per cent of those being Italian. 
 No clients are being left without assistance, it said, with a dedicated team focused on client cases.

 Last week, Emoney customers said they were unable to access their money after weeks of being unable to make cash deposits, shortly after the company told them it was suspending money transfers and discontinuing its debit cards.
 Responding to the complaints, the Pietà-based company said it had encountered “technical difficulties” while changing IT provider from one owned by the previous management, who it said had also refused to hand over customer data.
 Emoney said the former management being “uncooperative” had contributed to “further delays in releasing funds for some customers”.
 But in a joint statement this week, the company’s former CEO, Germano Arnò and former board directors said they “bear no responsibility for the recent decisions made by the new management of Em@ney”.
 Since the handover occurred, “the former board no longer has any influence over the company’s operations”, they continued, before “entirely” attributing the suspension of banking services on the new management.
 “Despite his [Arnò’s] attempts to offer support, the new leadership chose to make sudden changes to the platform and discontinue services built over years of hard work and perseverance”, the statement read.
 “Arnò urges the new management to communicate openly with clients, many of whom are left without adequate information or solutions, further fuelling frustration.”
 Stressing that the former CEO “no longer has any control over... access to information”, the statement – issued to “protect the professional reputation” of the former management – called on the new management to “prioritise the needs of customers”.
 Arnò founded Emoney in 2011, becoming CEO the following year and serving until last month, according to his LinkedIn profile.
 His time steering the company was not without controversy; in 2021, Emoney was fined €359,339 by the FIAU. The company is appealing the fine.

 In a ceremony led by Princess Anne, Gerard Grech was appointed a Commander of the British Empire (CBE) at Windsor Castle on April 23. 
 ""I am hugely honoured to receive this appointment. I was pleasantly surprised by how well Princess Anne was briefed on my work,"" Grech said in comments to Times of Malta. 
 ”I was incredibly pleased with the intimate presentation of the award, especially considering that my family were able to be present. I am very grateful to have shared that experience with them.”
 Grech was raised in Kerċem and had ‘an idyllic childhood’ in Gozo until he left for the UK when he was 13.
 His father is the late Dr Joseph Grech, who was the former chief medical officer for Gozo and Comino.
 From a young age, Grech said he had a keen interest in the arts and technology. After working in the music business for a number of years, Grech decided to get an MBA, where he began to discover the new and powerful relationship developing between mobile phones and media.
  “This happened around the year 2000. There was a wave of innovation ushering through at that time and I wanted to grab hold of it,” said Grech.
 Since then, Grech has worked with companies like Nokia Growth Partners,  Skyscanner and  Orange. He also sits on the UK's Digital Economy Council and the World Economic Forum's Digital Board.
 Grech was a founder and former chief executive of Tech Nation, a UK Government-backed initiative that helped develop Europe’s digital ecosystem.  Tech Nation facilitates the growth of founder-led tech companies through coaching and accelerator programs and creates a platform for entrepreneurs to connect and share knowledge.
 Grech left the CEO position in 2023 after five years in the role. He remains an advisor at Tech Nation but has also taken on the role of the Managing Director of  Founders at the University of Cambridge.
 Founders is a new strategic initiative focused on accelerating the formation and scaling of new technology companies.
 This is not the first award Grech has received. In addition to his CBE, he was also recognised for his contribution to the FinTech Industry at the FinTech Awards London 2023.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/audit-slams-europride-budget-blowout-procurement-flaws.1102483,"Spending on last year’s EuroPride event exceeded the original €2.5 million budget by 86 per cent, an audit has revealed.
 A report by the auditor general detailed how spending on the 10-day event dedicated to the LGBTIQ+ community “significantly” exceeded its original budget, with a total spend of €4.6 million.
 When questioned about the discrepancy, the Office of the Prime Minister blamed it on “unexpected adverse weather conditions”, as well as the omission and undervaluation of certain expenses like security.
 This explanation, however, did not appear to hold water with the auditor general, who noted that bad weather only impacted the event’s opening ceremony, which had to be shifted to Ta’ Qali’s MFCC, and security accounted for just nine per cent of the total spend.
 “…these reasons cited by management could not have been the sole cause of this variance,” the report notes.
 “Major” shortcomings in procurement procedures were found during the audit.
 “Given that the bid to host the event in Malta was won in 2020, and the EuroPride Parade 2023 agreement was finalised in October 2022, it was presumed that management had sufficient time to plan the event and procure the required goods and services in compliance with standing regulations,” the auditor general said.
 The report says that despite these time frames, none of the goods and services purchased for the event were acquired via a tender.
 Furthermore, no quotes were obtained for a considerable number of other purchases, which were procured directly from the open market, and for which no direct order approvals from the respective permanent secretary or finance ministry were found.
  The report says the piecemeal approach used for the procurement of certain services was likely split to circumvent the need for a tender.
 “Under no circumstances would it have made sense from a logistical perspective to have different service providers setting up a stage and roof structure during the two consecutive weeks of the event,” the auditor general said.
 
 The auditor general noted at least eight instances whereby quotations for lighting, video and stage set-up, were provided not more than two days before the required service was to be delivered.
 From an operational standpoint, as well as considering the nature of these expenses, the auditor general said it is difficult to envisage how service providers were willing to provide these services at such short notice.
 Additionally, no reference was made to the required layout, design, desired appearance and availability of equipment, which would have been discussed at some stage.
 “This suggests that the service provider had been selected directly beforehand (without obtaining direct order approval), also implying that the quotations were very likely obtained merely to conceal the bypassing of procurement regulations,” the report says.
 In response to the findings, the Office of the Prime Minister said certain goods and services procured for the event were acquired under “time-sensitive circumstances”.
 In cases where direct orders were used, the Office of the Prime Minister said it was due to the immediate nature, which precluded the standard timeline for obtaining departmental tenders or multiple quotations.
 Who was responsible?
 Auditors found significant difficulty in identifying the key government personnel responsible for the event’s organisation and management, with the situation complicated by a shift in ministerial portfolios and the event being organised in tandem with an NGO.
 The auditor general said clear ownership and accountability should be established when projects transition from one ministerial portfolio to another.
 All financial transactions, decisions and key project milestones must be consistently recorded to maintain a complete audit trail.
 The report struck a frustrated tone in this regard.
 “Unless roles and responsibilities are clearly recognised and defined, ownership cannot be established,"" the auditor general said.
 ""Consequently, identifying who should be held accountable for any shortcomings in the organisation of the event, particularly those relating to the procurement of goods and services, and the fact that the budget allocation was substantially exceeded, can become an arduous task.""
 When organising similar events, the roles and responsibilities are to be clearly defined, the auditor general insisted.
 The audit was able to identify one key officer in the event’s organisation, namely the head of secretariat of Parliamentary Secretary for Equality Rebecca Buttigieg. This, however, appears to have gone against established procedures, as the head of the secretariat is a position of trust appointment and, therefore, the person should not exercise executive powers.
 Despite this, the auditor general found that the head of secretariat monitored calls for quotations, certified invoices, forwarded purchase orders, corresponded directly with artists who participated in the event and took receipts of EuroPride merchandise.
 All this goes against the guiding principle outlined in a manual on resourcing policies and procedures, which states that people engaged on a position of trust basis should not enjoy executive powers on government matters, the auditor general said.
 The auditor general urged those responsible to delve into the matter to establish how the head of secretariat took on responsibilities beyond those expected of the position held.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/budget-failed-address-low-fertility-workfamily-conflicts-women-lobby.1100271,"The Malta Women's Lobby on Wednesday slammed the absence of ""evidence-based, gender-sensitive policies"" in the drafting of budgetary measures.
 While acknowledging the inclusion of a few positive measures in the budget plans for 2025, the Malta Women's Lobby said ""gender budgeting"" was still not an essential component of future fiscal planning,
 MWL said women were directly impacted by four measures:
 The 2025 budget also promised the distribution of panic buttons to victims of violence.
 ""Yet, the government’s insistence on a gender-neutral approach obscures the reality of the disproportionate impact of violence against women, rendering the measure less effective in addressing gender-specific safety concerns.
 ""Moreover, we earnestly hope this initiative will not encounter the setbacks and delays faced by the previously promised electronic tagging programme,"" the MWL said in a statement. 
 The MWL said Budget 2025 fell short of addressing the country’s low fertility rate and related family-work conflicts.
 It said that in a recent National Commission for the Promotion of Equality (NCPE) study parents voiced a clear demand for adequate and generous work-family policies such as the introduction of special leave for the parents specifically for when their children fall ill, and longer, better-paid family leave that would allow both parents to spend more time with their infants before returning to work.
 ""The budget sidesteps these pressing concerns and only offers an ineffective one-time €1,500 bonus for parents of three (or more) children, missing a critical opportunity to address Malta's declining fertility rate with sustainable, family-focused policies.""
 This budget clearly shows that Malta continues to lack a holistic, gender-sensitive approach to budgeting, despite ongoing discussions about gender mainstreaming since 2000.
 A gender mainstreaming approach would ensure that decisions relating to financial planning align with the needs and realities of each and every member of society.

Send your questions about personal finances, inheritance, gifting or other personal finance topics to moneycoach@timesofmalta.com. 
 I am a 21-year-old undergraduate student who also works a part-time job for around 15 hours a week, making €10 an hour. I have established an emergency fund of about €2,000. 
 I am mainly interested in ways in which I can optimise my money, and I am sending this message to ask about some of the best strategies to do this.
 I had already purchased a couple of ETFs about three years ago, namely €1,500 in each of QQQ and VOO.
 I am currently turning a bit of a profit, but I can understand that my current strategy isn't sustainable.
 What is the best way to invest my current savings, and income, such that I can grow my money rather than just saving it?
 I had read that it would be a good idea to invest portions of my monthly income, even small amounts like €100 or €200 EUR. Could you guide me on this?
 Sincerely,
 A young guy
 First of all, allow me to congratulate you on your achievements so far – not every 21-year-old can boast an emergency fund of €2,000 and €3,000 in investments, while also studying.
 Before continuing my response, allow me to make it clear that I am not licenced to offer investment advice – for that it is best to seek the services of a professional investment advisor.
 That being said, I can provide guidance on optimising your savings to not only ensure growth in the future but also maintain long-term sustainability. This is in fact a concern shared by many of my clients, and it normally becomes an urge when people are in their late 30s or early 40s and realise that they barely have any savings, let alone investments.
 In your case, you are in the best possible position if you can make that small monetary contribution consistently per month and allow it to grow exponentially through the power of compound interest.
 You might think that your current strategy is not sustainable... and I am curious to understand the reasons for this.
 From the choices you have made it tells me that you are well-versed in the world of investing. If one considers the S&P 500 for example, over the past 90 years it gave a return of 8-10% on average per year. Does this mean that it should be a no brainer choice? Not at all. After all it depends on a person’s risk appetite, financial goals and other aspects which an investment advisor can lead you better in. Always consider all angles when making any investment choice.
 I find that the best way to keep disciplined in your savings and investing is by being consistent, which means doing it monthly. This not only leads you to the benefits of dollar-cost-averaging, where you buy into the market at different price levels, ensuring a smoother ride long-term; but it also ingrains a discipline in you that can be quite beneficial long-term. Remember, it is not about the amount you save and invest per month, but about consistency. Start small, even €50 on a consistent basis can do the trick, and then gradually increase the amount as you see fit.
 Don’t pressure yourself: it is better to start small and keep to it, rather than start big, and then start stressing if you don’t save that amount. Remember things happen in life, and at times it is normal to take a pause. I passed through such a period myself when my daughter had sensory issues, and my wife had to stay with her for a whole year. We had to get used to one income rather than two, and that meant that I had to give my saving and investing a pause, and I don’t mind revealing that... this is all normal. The important thing is to restart once you get back on your feet.
 Make a plan, see how much you can consistently save and invest per month, and keep to that amount for a few months and gradually increase it. Furthermore, ask yourself:
 The above should help you think, initiate a plan, and start executing it at your own pace. At 21 years, the sky is literally the limit.

 Luca

https://timesofmalta.com/article/new-supermarket-ard-discount-open-round-corner-wellbee.1098079,"ARD Discount, a popular Italian discount supermarket chain, will be opening its first store next week, just up the road from giant chain Wellbee's in Mellieħa, introducing another budget supermarket to the island.
 The discount supermarket will be located less than 100 metres from its Maltese rival on Triq il-Kbira and according to a Google Listing, the store will open on September 19. 
 ARD Discount is a joint venture between Italian retailers Ergon and Maiora with over 240 stores across southern Italy and Sicily and has a 40,000 square metre distribution centre. 
 Last year it opened its first store in Sardinia, with plans to open a further nine stores on the Italian island.
 According to its website, it offers over 900 items from 40 different brands, such as Buono & Gusto, Fatti a Fette and Frutti di Frutta. It also offers its own range of low-cost products.
  On Wednesday, ARD Discount announced the opening of the Maltese store on social media platforms.
 “Big things are coming to Malta, stay tuned for something awesome,” the post read, providing no further details on where the store will be located. 
  The opening of the new store adds to the ever-growing number of discount supermarkets popping up across the Maltese islands. 
 The announcement of the new supermarket comes after the Planning Authority approved the construction of a new LIDL supermarket on the site of the former General Softs Drinks factory in Qormi.
 The development is a joint venture between the German supermarket chain and the Mizzi Organisation following initial plans by subsidiary company Mizzi Estates to transform the site into an apartment complex. 
 Lidl, which opened its first Malta store in Santa Venera in 2008, now has 10 outlets across Malta and Gozo.
 Earlier this year, Italian supermarket giant Eurospin opened its first store in Mosta, right next door to competitor Lidl. Risparmio Casa, another Italian discount store, also opened a store in the same locality.
 Earlier this year, plans for a massive supermarket project outside the development zone in San Ġwann were withdrawn following two days of public outcry.
 The proposal was to build a two-storey 7,000 square metre supermarket adjacent to a private secondary school.
 Prime Minister Robert Abela was among those who opposed the project, saying he felt it was a “non-starter” and that the town's Labour-led council would object.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/central-bank-standin-governor-salary-topped.1096290,"As Edward Scicluna steps aside to defend his innocence in a high-profile fraud case, Central Bank deputy governor Alexander Demarco has taken the helm without a pay increase, the bank has confirmed.
 Demarco remains on the same salary as he did throughout his tenure as a deputy governor with no additional benefits or perks.
 “No alternative arrangements have been made to date,” a spokesperson said.
 He told Times of Malta Demarco’s remuneration remains unchanged since his reappointment as deputy governor on January 1, 2024. 
 Demarco will stand in for Scicluna who, last Tuesday agreed to step aside in face of fraud and misappropriation charges in relation to the Vitals hospitals case.
 Scicluna is among dozens of former politicians, civil servants and others charged in connection with their alleged involvement in the fraudulent deal to privatise three hospitals.
 He stepped aside from carrying out the functions of governor after facing pressure from Prime Minister Robert Abela. However, Scicluna,  whose term as governor expires in December 2025, will retain half his pay throughout his hiatus.
 Asked to lay out the salary of deputy governors at the bank, the spokesperson declined, saying that “it is not the policy of the Central Bank of Malta to publish the salaries of the governors”. 
 Demarco is a veteran of the bank, now entering his fourth decade with the central bank.
 He was first made deputy governor in January 2014, initially put in charge of running the bank’s financial stability unit.
 Three years later, he was named the bank’s deputy governor for monetary policy, leading its banking and financial markets divisions, among others.
 Before being made deputy governor, Demarco found himself at the centre of a controversy, when then-communications minister Austin Gatt accused him of leaking confidential information to then-opposition leader Joseph Muscat.
 Demarco, Gatt alleged, was acting as a consultant to the opposition, having reviewed a report for the Labour Party.
 A series of internal probes cleared Demarco of any wrongdoing, finding Gatt’s accusations to be unfounded.
 However, he was told off by a disciplinary committee which, in exonerating Demarco of the accusations, noted that he should have exercised more caution in the matter.
 The affair led to a protracted row with then-Central Bank governor Michael Bonello. Demarco filed a judicial protest accusing Bonello of keeping the outcomes of the investigations exonerating him secret.
 Bonello responded in kind, filing a counter-protest to rebut the accusations.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/tourism-revenue-expected-exceed-3-billion-end-year.1100353,"Revenue from tourism is expected to exceed an unprecedented €3 billion by the end of the year, the Tourism Ministry said on Thursday. 
 In a press conference, Malta Tourism Authority CEO Carlo Micallef said tourism revenue has already seen a 23% increase, having already reached €2.2 billion by August. In 2023, the country made a total of €2.7 billion in revenue from tourism. 
 Pivoting to the MTA’s efforts to increase connectivity, Micallef said Malta has direct flights to 110 airports both within and outside of the EU and has undertaken marketing efforts in more than 40 countries. 
 Thanks to Aer Lingus starting to operate in Malta, Micallef said this has allowed Malta to be connected to North America, reaching 15 airports in the US and two in Canada. 
 The MTA, Micallef said, is actively courting another two legacy carriers for travel to Asia and Australia, to expand routes to Malta in the region. 
 The authority has undertaken a competitive marketing strategy to continue to grow tourism during the winter period. The effort, Micallef said, is tailored specifically to different niches and based on data to send targeted advertising to consumers more likely to be higher spenders. 
 According to MTA data, tourists from the United States tended to be the highest spenders while in Malta, followed by those from the UAE, Ireland, Norway, Canada and Australia. 
 Malta is actively competing with destinations such as Budapest, Rome, Paris and Dubai in the winter season while in summer advertising pivots to compete with Mediterranean resort-style locations, including the Spanish and Greek islands as well as Cyprus. 
  Micallef said that tourism in the winter period grew from 993,253 passengers in the 2022-2023 season up to 1,272,059 passengers in the 2023-2024 season. The number has more than doubled since the 2012-2013 period when it stood at 514,273. 
 The tourism industry has been able to grow sustainably because it is cultivating growth in the winter months and staying its hand during the summer season, with hotels being able to keep their room rates up throughout. 
 “You’re not going to see any special offers to Malta, everyone is keeping up their price because we are attracting tourists who are interested in the Maltese product,” he said, adding that the country will no longer see the phenomenon of hotels having to close up for the winter. 
 The average room rate hovered at €202 per night in five-star hotels last year, up from €165 in 2019, while in four-star hotels they stayed at €104 per night, up from €90 in 2019. 
 In line with global trends, Micallef said that the average length of stay has also continued to dip, going from 7.3 nights in 2022 to 6.8 nights in 2023. 
 He said this is viewed positively as it has not impacted spending while hosting travellers for fewer nights lessens their impact on the community. 
  Asked how the government is planning to balance out the so-called quality tourism against the pressures created by instances of mass tourism, including public cleansing and crowding, Tourism Minister Clayton Bartolo said the strategy is no longer courting mass tourism and aims to keep summer traffic steady while continuing to grow in winter. 
 Additionally, he said that the government has plans to announce reform for the tourism accommodation sector, although he declined to elaborate further when asked. 
 “In the coming weeks, we will be going public with a consultation that will help us make that next leap in the sector,” he said. 
 “I believe the same way we introduced the skills pass and left good results for the industry, we will be achieving something similar in this next step.” 
 Bartolo said the government has also stepped up investment in problem areas where the pressures of tourism are felt more keenly, such as increasing waste collection times in the Swieqi, St Julian’s and Sliema areas. 
 Bartolo said the core of the ministry’s strategy is moving away from mass tourism as a whole.
 “We want to give tourists a good experience, focus on spending and have more sustainable bed nights all year round,” he said.  
 “We feel that on these three pillars, we can take tourism to a higher level and so the wider community can benefit from it and not just feel it as a burden.”

https://timesofmalta.com/article/teachers-receive-calls-return-overpaid-salaries-pay-issues-arise.1100407,"Updated 2.55pm with ministry response
 Teachers are facing a raft of payment issues, with many being overpaid and asked to pay the money back, teachers' unions confirmed on Friday. 
 Since Thursday, both the Malta Union of Teachers (MUT) and the Union of Professional Teachers (UPE) have received complaints from their members after receiving incorrect payments.
 The issues seem to stem from changes to teacher pay brought in with the new sectoral agreement signed between the government and the Malta Union of Teachers (MUT) in July.
 The agreement included revised starting salaries, a one-off payment and increased allowances backdated and paid in arrears, among other measures.
 But since Thursday, teachers have reported issues receiving payments agreed upon by the deal, with many saying they received incorrect amounts, while others received calls from government officials asking them to pay back the overpaid sums.
 One teacher told Times of Malta she was alerted to discrepancies in her pay after receiving more than €13,000, which “didn't make any sense at all” as a colleague of hers who had been teaching a year longer received only €9,000. 
 In total, she received over €3,300 in arrears, including almost €1,000 for having taught for more than 16 years - and more than €2,300 for teaching for over 17 years.
  “I have tried calling the department but haven't heard anything. I also emailed them. At this point I'm the one chasing them to return their money; it is an absolute embarrassment from their end,” she said.  
 The teacher added that teachers had been “left in the dark” after receiving no guidance on how their payments would be calculated. 
 “As usual, teachers are not treated with the respect their profession deserves,"" she said.
 MUT president Marco Bonnici said that while “the majority” of state schoolteachers received their adjustments according to the agreement, “there are still some individuals and groups who have not received the adjustments.”
 “We are informed – and have been in communication with the education ministry – that there are still some individuals and groups who have not received the adjustments,"" Bonnici said, pointing to “errors” which he said were “being addressed by the ministry.”
 Calling the situation “complicated”, he said the union was pressuring the ministry to respond to teachers' calls for clarification.
 Bonnici said that while “few” teachers had reported errors so far, many had contacted the ministry “to understand what they received.”
 He added the union was confident the issues would be resolved by the end of the year.
 But Union of Professional Teachers (UPE) executive head Graham Sansone suggested the problem was larger than one confined to a few teachers, saying the union had been “inundated” with complaints from its circa 3,500 members.
 “From what we’re noticing, the majority of arrears payments are incorrect,” he said.
 Sansone said the union was helping its members to work out accurate payments due.
 Stressing the government was “already recalling significant amounts of money,” Sansone said teachers had reported receiving calls from government officials asking them to pay back up to €5,000.
 On Friday afternoon, a spokesperson for the education ministry said while the “majority” of educators had received their pay adjustments “smoothly”, the ministry acknowledged “some discrepancies occurred, resulting in incorrect payment amounts for a limited number of individuals.” 
 The spokesperson said the ministry had “proactively reached out to educators impacted by overpayments to ensure clarity and transparency.” 
 He added that a dedicated email address - info.edu.agreement@gov.mt - had been set up to handle enquiries related to teacher payments.
 Shadow Education Secretary Justin Schembri said he had been contacted by affected teachers, but noted it was difficult to calculate payments en mass as “all were personalised” due to provisions of the sectoral agreement.
 The agreement factors in how many years a teacher has been active, with additional allowances included for those who have been teaching more than 20 years.
 Schembri said that in one case, however, two Learning Support Educators (LSEs) who joined the same year had been paid a difference of €5,000.
 He warned that many teachers might not know if their calculations were correct, however, noting some could be happy to receive an additional payment despite it potentially not being equal to the full amount owed.
 “I advise teachers to send questions to the salary department asking for a breakdown; this is the only way to avoid it,” he said.
 A circular issued to educators earlier on Friday after Times of Malta reported the issue, did not acknowledge if there were errors in the system.
 It instead invited educators with ""questions about your individual outcome"" to contact the education ministry by email if they have any questions.
 Teachers Times of Malta spoke to complained of being paid too much or too little, while others expressed their confusion at payslips seeming to contain contradictory or inaccurate figures. Nearly all were unwilling to speak openly about the issue, however.
 
 As of last month, teachers must now get written permission before speaking to the media and have to tell their bosses what they intend to speak about.
 The move has attracted criticism from educators and politicians, with Sansone calling the rules ""unheard of"" and independent candidate and academic Arnold Cassola branding them ""fascist"".

https://timesofmalta.com/article/malta-sign-international-maritime-convention.1094006,"Malta is expected to sign an important United Nations convention on Wednesday in a ceremony that will see a special UN book brought to the country for the occasion.
 Verdala Castle will host a United Nations convention inviting foreign dignitaries from Europe and around the world to add their signatures to an international maritime treaty.
 The treaty aims to provide certainty to purchasers of ships sold in ‘judicial sales’ – when vessels are sold by authorities to settle outstanding debts – by ensuring such ships are not rearrested by old creditors. 
 But as well as foreign representatives, the convention will also see the official UN treaty book brought to Malta for the signing, an event considered to be an exceptional event by legal experts. 
 It is hoped that through the convention, international shipping – responsible for transporting around 90% of world trade and of which Malta is a significant player – will become more stable and attractive to investment.
 First signed by 15 countries in Beijing in September, the UN Convention on the International Effects of Judicial Sales of Ships was introduced to combat what maritime experts say was an unstable situation resulting from illegitimate claims of old creditors against legitimate buyers of ships in judicial sales. 
 When ship owners are unable to settle their debts, often the only way forward is the arrest and judicial sale of the ship with the sale price used to pay off the debts.  
 But legal experts say legitimate buyers who purchase such vessels may face serious challenges when hit by claims from old creditors who refuse to consider the matter settled, despite the ship passing to a new owner.
  They argue this puts off potential buyers, who can sometimes struggle to see the registration of the ship’s previous owner, or its mortgagees removed in favour of their own.
 This can lead to so-called ‘double arrests’, with such vessels being arrested for a second time despite having been bought ‘clean’ by new owners, with the convention aiming to put a stop to these tactics. 
 Maritime lawyer and Comité Maritime International president Ann Fenech – the CMI coordinator at the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law – said it would “ensure stability” for the sector and promote interest in judicial sales.
 She said the move would lead to better sale prices, with buyers more confident their new vessel would not be rearrested and provide more certainty to crews keen to be paid and repatriated to their families.
 
 Stressing its importance for Malta, one of the largest flags in the world, Fenech said it was important for buyers and their financiers to be able to invest in such vessels “without fear they will be rearrested in other jurisdictions.""
 The convention has already been signed by China, Burkina Faso, Comoros, El Salvador, Grenada, Honduras, Kiribati, Liberia, São Tomé and Principe, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Singapore, Syria and Switzerland, Ecuador, Tanzania, Belgium and Luxembourg.
 Following the EU signing up in March, European countries including Malta are now free to add their signatures to the convention. It is expected that various EU countries will sign on Wednesday.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/mda-pushes-minimum-wage-rise-universal-15-corporate-tax-rate.1098097,"Malta’s minimum wage should rise to at least €1,100 a month while corporate tax rates should be harmonised to remove disparities between foreign and local firms, the Malta Developers Association believes.
 The proposals are among a raft of suggestions that the MDA has presented to the government ahead of its Budget for 2025.
 Those suggestions range from the expected, such as renewing schemes to encourage the restoration of old properties or purchases by first- and second-time buyers, to more left-field ideas, such as tax breaks for people who park their cars in garages or making interest paid on home loans tax-deductible.
 Arguably the MDA’s most radical pre-budget proposal, however, is that of totally overhauling Malta’s corporate tax structure to result in a flat 15% rate for all businesses.
 The MDA would like to see tax rates for foreign businesses gradually raised from their current effective 5% rate, while tax rates for local entrepreneurs are slowly slashed from their 35% rate.
  To help address housing affordability, the MDA is proposing a revamp of tax rates for landlords of rental properties. The MDA believes that long-term rental properties rented out for €1,000 or less should be subject to a 5% tax rate. Currently, all rental properties are subject to a 15% rate, irrespective of value.
 Other MDA proposals include:

https://timesofmalta.com/article/hold-mfsa-fines-tripled-last-year-previous-year.1094491,"Malta's financial regulator last year issued fines totalling three times the amount levied in the previous year.
 The Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA) issued €444,800 worth of fines through 77 enforcement actions last year, according to its 2023 annual report tabled in parliament on Wednesday.
 This is more than three times the amount issued in 2022, when €147,445 worth of fines were issued through 44 enforcement actions.
 
 The MFSA issues licenses to banks, insurance companies, investment firms and all other financial institutions operating in Malta.
 It is responsible for overseeing and enforcing financial regulations on more than 2,000 entities and often issues fines to punish infringements and deter financial crime.
 From 474 investigations, the MFSA issued 77 enforcement measures in 2023. These ranged from 60 administrative penalties to five directives, four settlement agreements, three licenses cancelled, two individuals not deemed fit and proper, and one entity that was struck off the register.
 Another entity had a competent person appointed to ensure compliance, and another had its license suspended.
 CEO Kenneth Farrugia told reporters that enforcement actions, especially fines, must be proportionate, but crucially, dissuasive, to ensure a stable and secure sector going forward, and acknowledged that if the courts slash MFSA fines on appeal, enforcement that is fair and works for everyone must be remodelled with authorities and lawmakers.
 ""Nearly half of our inspection also had an anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing element, and we undertook 44 FIAU-delegated supervisory engagements specifically focused on financial crime compliance,"" he said.
 ""These efforts underscore our resolve to combat financial crime and uphold Malta's reputation as a secure, safe and transparent financial hub.""
 The annual report also notes that last year the authority received 352 licence applications across various sectors, with 84 per cent being approved. The remaining 16 per cent were either withdrawn by the applicants or refused by the MFSA.
 The MFSA's supervisory interactions with its licenced entities quadrupled between 2019 and 2023 and increased by 50 per cent last year alone.
 These interactions included inspections, meetings, and even ""mystery shopping"" exercises to assess compliance.
 To support the intensifying workload, the MFSA has grown its workforce significantly, according to the report.
 It added 107 new recruits last year, bringing the total to nearly 500 full-time equivalent employees. This expanded team underwent extensive training, logging more than 27,000 hours last year.
 Meanwhile, the ""stable and resilient"" financial sector continues to thrive, seeing an 11.8 per cent growth last year, generating €1,251 million in gross value added.
 The sector grew by nearly 6,500 people between 2019 and 2023, the authority said.
 MFSA chair Jesmond Gatt said the industry has seen steady growth, reflecting the strength and stability of Malta's financial ecosystem.
 ""Locally, the industry has demonstrated remarkable resilience and growth in 2023, outperforming many of our peers in the Euro area,"" he said.
 Gatt and Farrugia also fielded questions on Central Bank governor Edward Scicluna, who stands charged in court over the hospitals deal and who still sits on the MFSA's board of governors.
 They confirmed his case is being monitored and he is still considered as ""fit and proper"" to hold onto his seat. His case is not being treated any differently from similar cases in the past.
 Any further decisions will be taken in due course, as the court case progresses, they insisted.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/mellieha-mayor-caught-offguard-mta-push-tables-chairs.1097676,"Mellieħa mayor Gabriel Micallef has expressed surprise at the Malta Tourism Authority’s (MTA) application to increase the area for tables and chairs in the town’s parish square.
 The application, which covers the space in front of the Mellieħa parish church, was submitted without prior consultation with the local council, raising concerns about the process.
 
 An MTA spokesperson clarified that the application is part of the Mellieħa parish square master plan, launched earlier this year.
 “This type of application sets limits for any future proposals for tables and chairs,” the spokesperson said.
 “It ensures that future operators cannot exceed the parameters established in the plan. If approved, the application will also nullify existing permits in the area.”
 The process, which began in February, aims to regulate the use of public spaces in Mellieħa’s square, balancing both commercial and community interests.
 However, Micallef noted that the first meeting between the council and the MTA only occurred in late August – months after the process had begun.
 “I was abroad when this issue surfaced, and I was sent several photos of the permit,” Micallef said.
 “I was caught by surprise as I don’t recall any consultation about this.”
 Micallef’s primary concern is the lack of public consultation.
 
 In a social media post following the August meeting, which included the tourism minister, MTA officials and architects, Micallef stated that while the plan had been explained, the council’s request for formal public consultation was turned down.
 The MTA responded that stakeholders had been kept informed but never directly confirmed that a consultation had taken place.
 “This was one of the final administrative actions required to establish the parameters for parking areas and to limit lines for current and future proposals for tables and chairs,” said the spokesperson.
 “The elements of the plan do not necessarily reflect the MTA’s original ideas, as they had to be adjusted to reflect local realities and practicalities. Furthermore, the application carries out the widest possible consultation exercise, where anyone, not just Mellieħa residents, can submit comments,” continued the spokesperson.
 Mellieħa’s mayor remains concerned about the potential impact on the community.
 Micallef referred to Victoria, where unchecked commercial expansion has negatively affected public spaces despite the city having its own master plan.
 “We need to make sure we proceed in a balanced manner; we don’t want to face the same issues as Gozo,” Micallef said.
 To address the matter, Micallef said the council would undertake its own research to represent residents’ concerns.
 “We can’t move forward without consulting the people,” he said. “At the end of the day, they are the ones who elected us.”
 The issue of tables and chairs has been contentious in the locality. In April, residents and activists staged a protest at Misraħ iż-Żjara tal-Papa, in Mellieħa by occupying restaurant tables and chairs, claiming that an establishment was illegally using public space without a permit.
 They said they wanted to send a strong message against the occupation of public spaces by tables and chairs, which they said were choking streets, pavements and squares, and accused “useless authorities” of facilitating rampant abuse.
 They argued that public spaces belong to the community, insisting it was within their rights to reclaim them.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/hili-ventures-hit-1-billion-revenue-in-2024.1092873,"Malta-based Hili Ventures is expecting to achieve revenues of over €1 billion in 2024 for the first time since it was incorporated just over a decade ago.
 This was announced as the group published its consolidated financial statements for the year ended 2023, in which it registered revenues just short of the billion-euro mark at €987 million, marking an increase of 26% over 2022.
 Chairman Archie Bethel said, “Last year was a record year for the group, including a major acquisition in Poland, 11 new McDonald’s restaurants across Europe and more than 1,300 people added to the team. The results speak for themselves, and we are even more motivated to deliver on the many ambitious projects in our pipeline this year. We pledge to keep delivering real value to our shareholders, while being a good neighbour in the communities in which we operate.”
 Chief Executive Officer Melo Hili said, “It is important to recognise that this is ultimately the result of 12,000 people working in diverse teams and industries, across 10 countries, with a common set of values. Seeing everybody’s work pay off, especially after the challenges of the past few years, strengthens our resolve to keep driving market leadership in each industry we operate in.”
 Hili Ventures holds a diverse portfolio of businesses and is best known for its major pillar Premier Capital p.l.c., which is the developmental licensee for McDonald’s in Malta, Estonia, Greece, Latvia, Lithuania and Romania, with 185 restaurants across these markets.
 The group’s portfolio also includes 1923 Investments p.l.c., which owns iSpot Poland Sp. Z o.o., Poland’s largest Apple Premium Reseller business which has a network of 47 stores and service points across major Polish cities.
 All of the group’s direct operating subsidiaries, including Hili Properties p.l.c. and Breakwater Investments Limited (previously known as HV Marine), registered growth in varying degrees, with group EBITDA reaching €125 million, compared to €99 million in 2022.
 Setting its sights on 2024, the group is eyeing further growth in each industry and building on previous success by expanding its network and internationalising its service portfolio further.
 It is also awaiting planning permission for its landmark Six Senses Comino Hotel, an eco-luxury destination which will be built on a smaller footprint than the current development. HV Hospitality Ltd, the group’s hospitality arm, has also committed to restoring substantial areas of land around the site by planting more than 55,000 endemic trees, shrubs and plants.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/food-inflation-slowed-stabbilta-scheme-introduction-central-bank.1096965,"The government’s controversial Stabbiltá scheme, which saw the price of some 450 food items slashed by 15%, has contributed to food inflation dropping by 2%, according to a new economic forecast published by the Central Bank on Tuesday.
 The scheme, introduced in February, was touted as a measure to contain inflation across several essential food products.
 The Central Bank report notes that once the scheme was introduced, inflation across almost all food products slowed, with some (such as margarine, pasta and preserved milk) reversing their price increases altogether.
 By June, the price of food products affected by the scheme was two percentage points lower than it was before the scheme’s introduction in January, the report says.
 However, the report says, it is difficult to gauge the precise impact of the scheme, since these figures also include brands and food items that were not included in the scheme.
 Nevertheless, Malta’s food inflation across some food products, particularly processed food, remains higher than that across the Euro area, the report continues. It ties this to Malta's dependence on importation, making Malta's food inflation more volatile than that of many other European countries.
 More broadly, the report predicts that Malta’s GDP will gradually slow down, dipping from 5.7% in 2023 to 4.4% this year and, eventually, 3.4% by 2026.
 The country’s deficit, which has seen it placed under the EU’s excessive deficit procedures, will drop from 4.9% (or almost €1 billion) in 2023 to 3.1% by 2026 as inflation-mitigation measures are gradually cut.
 The bank predicts that Malta’s debt-to-GDP ratio of 50.3% by last year’s count will rise to just over 54% over the next three years, but will remain below the Maastricht criteria’s 60% threshold.
 There is good news for workers, with the bank predicting that Malta’s average wage is set to grow “at a significantly faster rate” throughout 2024 after lagging behind inflation for several months.
 The report suggests that wages will grow by 5.1% in 2024, as they try to make up for their “lagged response” to the rising cost of living, which has seen people’s wages outpaced by their daily expenses.
 This means that wages will finally start to “catch up” to the rising cost of living, with the real value of people’s wages getting closer to what it was before the cost of living crisis that hit the world in recent years.
 But this rapid growth will be short-lived, with the growth in wages set to dip to 3.8% in 2025 and 3.2% in 2026.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/excommissioner-slams-insulting-mediterrane-film-festival-expenditure.1094748,"Updated 10.55 with PN statement below.
 Former film commissioner Oliver Mallia said on Monday it was ""insulting"" that only €1 million was invested in local productions over the span of a year, while the Mediterrane Film Festival - a one-time annual event - cost almost  €4 million.
 Mallia raised the issue on social media in a ""public letter"" to President Myriam Spiteri Debono.
 His comments follow an appeal by the president, who, speaking at a Mediterrane Film Festival flagship event on Sunday, urged the Film Commission and Commissioner to respect the principles of accountability and good governance in a bid to foster the public’s trust in their operations.
  Mallia commended Spiteri Debono for her comments, saying her message could not have come at a better time.
 “You delivered your message at an event that was not included in the budget approved by Parliament for 2024 and which was organised by an entity that, for the past five years, has ignored its legal obligations and systematically failed to report its annual expenditure to parliament,” said Mallia.
 In her address on Sunday, the president said the number of local workers employed by the film industry had grown from 300 in 2017 to 1,000.
 However, Mallia refuted the claim that there were currently 1,000 full-time workers in the film industry.
 In his post on Facebook, Mallia maintained that a national film festival was ""necessary"". 
 Mallia knows first-hand about the impact of film festivals: he organised the Valletta Film Festival for several years.
 On Monday he suggested that the €8 million spent on the two editions of the Mediterrane Film Festival could be better spent, including investing in a Centre for Cinema, joining the Council of Europe programme  Eurimages, providing more funding to local productions, and creating better film programmes to help boost local film literacy.
 PN joins criticism of Film Commission's spending
 The Nationalist Party on Tuesday also joined criticism of excessive spending by the Film Commission, saying taxpayer funds were being squandered to benefit the few.
 Referring to the Mediterrane Film Festival and the concluding Golden Bee Awards, shadow minister Julie Zahra said that while the film industry was important, the PN was concerned that the Film Commissioner was dictating everything without consulting anyone.  
 The government, she said, was not being clear about what returns the country was getting for its spending. What use was it to spend excessively to get foreign guests to announce prize winners, when the actual winners did not turn up?  
 Zahra said the PN agreed with President Myriam Spiteri Debono that the film commissioner should respect the principles of accountability and good governance.

 The group held its annual general meeting on Thursday, which saw Bernard Mangion of Ben Estates and Alan Grima from Dhalia retain their positions as vice president and treasurer respectively. 
 The other council members elected during the AGM are David Aquilina from Belair, Stefan Consiglio from Pierre Faure Real Estate, Stephen Mercieca from Zanzi, George Vassallo from Frank Salt, Henry Zammit from The Elite and Sam Zammit from Remax. 
 Speaking at the event, Bonello said that his main objectives for the future include upgrading estate agents’ skill sets to deliver more value to end users and encouraging more smaller estate agencies to join the section to increase inclusivity. 
 MDA CEO Leon Chetcuti said that the group has been integral in supporting the growth of Malta’s booming real estate industry. 
 “Through the EAS, MDA is today the largest association representing estate agents in Malta and Gozo and significant progress has been made to improve this important service to the industry and general public,” he said.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/gdp-8-third-quarter-provisional-estimates.1101619,"The Gross Domestic Product for the third quarter of this year increased by 8 per cent to €5.9 billion, according to provisional estimates. 
 In volume terms, GDP rose by 4.9 per cent, the National Statistics Office said on Wednesday.
 The GDP deflator went up by 2.9 per cent compared to the same quarter last year. This represents a decrease of 2.6 percentage points in comparison to the year-on-year rate recorded in the third quarter of 2023.
 The production approach
 The production approach, also called the output approach, measures GDP as the sum of the Gross Value Added (GVA), which is the difference between value of output and the value of intermediate consumption and taxes, less subsidies on products.
 During the third quarter of 2024, GVA rose by 5.7 per cent in volume terms when compared to the corresponding quarter of 2023.
 The expenditure approach
 The expenditure approach is another method used to calculate GDP and is derived by adding final consumption expenditure, gross capital formation and exports, less imports.
 Domestic demand had a positive contribution of 4.9 percentage points to the year-on-year GDP growth rate in volume terms.
 External demand had a neutral contribution.
 In the third quarter of 2024, final consumption expenditure witnessed an increase of 6.3 per cent in volume terms: This was the result of an increase in the expenditure of households and general government of 5.1 and 10.5 per cent, respectively.
 Conversely, non-profit institutions serving households' final consumption expenditure decreased by 1.4 per cent.
 Gross fixed capital formation increased by 5.3 per cent in volume terms.
 Exports and imports of goods and services in volume terms rose by 3.8 and 4.4 per cent, respectively.
 The income approach
 The third approach to measure economic activity is the income approach, which shows how GDP is distributed among compensation of employees, operating surplus of enterprises and taxes on production and imports net of subsidies.
 Compared to the third quarter of 2023, the €435 million increase in nominal GDP was the result of a €223.6 million increase in compensation of employees, a €211.0 million rise in gross operating surplus and mixed-income, and an increase of €0.3 million in taxes on production and imports, less subsidies.
 Gross National Income 
 GNI differs from the GDP measure in terms of net compensation receipts, net property income receivable and net taxes receivable on production and imports from abroad.
 Considering the effects of income and taxation paid and received by residents to and from the rest of the world, GNI at market prices for the third quarter of 2024 was estimated at €5.2 billion.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/easyjet-buy-maltabased-sr-technics.1091848,"Budget airline EasyJet is set to acquire Malta-based aircraft maintenance company SR Technics.
 EasyJet plc, Europe’s second-largest budget airline, notified the Malta Competition and Consumer Affairs Authority (MCCAA) of its intention to buy SR Technics, with the authority giving notice of the one-week time window for objections to be filed.
 
 SR Technics Malta Ltd, a prominent maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) company within the aviation sector, originally opened its base in Malta in 2010 and EasyJet is one of its main clients. 
 It recently moved into its cutting-edge six-bay hangar facility at Ħal-Farruġ, which spans 40,000 square metres, with more expansion plans in the pipeline for the next two years. It invested over €42 million in its new facility, which was inaugurated by Prime Minister Robert Abela in March 2022.
 The Zurich-based company currently employs 430 professionals specialising in comprehensive heavy base maintenance services for the Airbus A320 family narrow-body fleet.
 SR Technics was initially set up as the technical department of the former Swiss Air but was established as a separate company in 1997.
 Luton-based EasyJet plc is a European point-to-point airline with a fleet of 336 Airbus A320 family aircraft, operating 1,018 routes across 35 countries and 155 airports. The airline also sells package holidays and travel insurance to customers on an agency basis.
 In its notice, issued in terms of the Control of Concentrations Regulations and published also in The Malta Government Gazette, the director general of the Office for Competition invited interested third parties to submit their written objections on this notified concentration within seven days.
 Last October, SR Technics Malta announced that it had secured a new three-year contract with EasyJet, which it described as a “valuable customer since 2010”.
 “We are extremely pleased and honoured to secure a new three-year contract with our high valued and important customer. This goes to show the incredible relationship we have cultivated as we marked the 13th year of collaboration,” SR Technics Malta general manager, Daniel Galea had said on that occasion.
 Brendan McConnellogue, director of engineering and maintenance at EasyJet, said the airline was delighted to be continuing its longstanding relationship with SR Technics in Malta, “who have demonstrated to us they are the right partner to continue supporting our industry-leading maintenance operations for our modern fleet of over 300 Airbus A320 aircraft”.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/employers-students-less-impressed-standards-committee-ruling.1101805,"The University Students’ Council (KSU) and the Malta Employers’ Association (MEA) have criticised a parliamentary committee's decision to admonish ministers Clint Camilleri and Clayton Bartolo over allegations of ministerial misconduct.
 The Standards Committee's measures do not go far enough to address governance concerns, they said in separate statements. 
 The committee ruled this week that Bartolo must apologise in parliament and refund excess payments made to his wife Amanda Muscat, who was paid as a top ministry consultant while doing secretarial work.
 Camilleri, who remains Gozo Minister, and Bartolo were both found guilty of abusing their power by securing false consultancy jobs for Muscat.
 Bartolo has since resigned as Tourism Minister over a separate scandal, but KSU has maintained that Camilleri’s position is untenable.
 “KSU maintains that Clint Camilleri’s position is also untenable and that he should shoulder political responsibility and resign,” the council said in a statement.
 Last week, before Bartolo’s resignation, KSU led 16 other student organisations in calling for both ministers to step down.
 The MEA also expressed dissatisfaction with the parliamentary decisions, with director general Kevin J. Borg arguing that the governance failing at the heart of the scandal ""has not been fully resolved.""
 “We remain concerned that this scandal has negatively affected the psyche and morale of honest workers and citizens,” Borg said. 
 He further criticised Bartolo’s comments that “degrees and qualifications aren’t everything,” labelling them as contrary to the association’s education, training, and meritocracy principles.
 Meanwhile, the Malta Chamber of Commerce, which had urged the government to act decisively, declined to comment further.
 A spokesperson said, “We are not engaging anymore on this issue. We have already said what needs to be said in our press release and will not be commenting any further.”
 Previously, the chamber called for Prime Minister Robert Abela to enforce stricter ethical standards for ministerial conduct, stressing the need to treat such breaches with the seriousness they deserve.
 During Wednesday's parliamentary committee session, Opposition motions demanding that Camilleri resign as a minister,  Bartolo be suspended as an MP for 30 days and Muscat to refund the full amount she earned as a consultant at Camilleri’s Gozo Ministry were voted down by the Speaker, who held a casting vote.
 The Opposition has since said that it is dissatisfied with the sanctions adopted by the committee. Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech has urged people to attend a demonstration planned for outside parliament next Monday - its second such event in week.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/bov-makes-637m-pretax-profit-three-months-increase-36.1092067,"Bank of Valletta has reported a pre-tax profit of €63.7m for the first three months of this year, a year-on-year increase of 36.8%.
 Last week HSBC Bank Malta reported a pre-tax profit of €39.3m for the same period. 
 BOV said its positive performance was influenced by an improvement in operating income, reflecting a growth of 22.9% to €117.4 million when compared with the same period in 2023. This was driven by increased returns both from an interest and non-interest income perspective.
 Net Interest Income stood at €98.3 million, an increase of €24.8 million when compared with the first quarter of 2023. This reflected expansion in both the customer lending and proprietary investment portfolios over the last 12 months, as well as improved rates on cash balances.
 Net fee and commission income was up by 11%, mainly influenced by higher amounts being achieved on credit-related business.
 Operating costs including strategy amounted to €49.1 million, equivalent to a 6.8% increase on previous year results.
 The bank said the Cost to Income Ratio continued trending downwards, standing at 41.8% in the first quarter. These developments were reflected in a 20.4% pre-tax Return on Average Equity, which was a 4.4% improvement over that recorded in the first quarter of 2023.
 ""With a gross loan-to-deposit ratio of 53.4% and strong sanctioning levels of business and retail loans, the Group is well positioned for further growth and to deliver its 2024 targets. The €47 million reduction in the deposit base equivalent to a 0.4% drop on FY23 end results aligns with expectations; nevertheless, the Group retained high levels of liquidity,"" BOV said.
 Speaking during the announcement, BOV Chairman Gordon Cordina said the results were extremely encouraging and testament to the bank’s ongoing efforts to grow its core business.  
 He observed that while the European Central Bank (ECB) had maintained the rate on its deposit facility at 4% since September 2023, it may start reducing the current level of monetary policy restriction sometime in 2024. In preparation of a falling interest rate scenario, the bank has been proactively restructuring its balance sheet, through the redeployment of treasury funds into longer-term assets, and a productive expansion in good-quality credit. The bank’s exposure to cyclical fluctuations in rates has thus been reduced and this should generate a more stable positive performance over time.
 ""We also believe that Malta’s current and near-term economic environment has remained benign, supporting our positive expectations vis-à-vis further growth in our loans, and the preservation of asset quality over the coming months,” he said.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/aps-confirms-interest-acquire-hsbc-malta.1101692,"APS Bank confirmed for the first time on Thursday that it is pursuing the acquisition of the 70.03% stake in HSBC Bank Malta currently held by HSBC Continental Europe and has submitted a non-binding offer.
 Earlier on Thursday, HSBC Malta said a number of bidders had shown interest in acquiring its shares and it would be convening an extraordinary general meeting to obtain shareholder approval to allow the interested parties to conduct due diligence checks and take negotiations to the next level. 
 Times of Malta last September revealed that talks between APS and HSBC’s global shareholders had been underway for more than two years. At the time APS bank CEO Marcel Cassar said the bank owed it to its shareholders to explore opportunities for growth. HSBC Bank Malta had said it was unaware of the talks - since they were being held with the parent company. 
 On Thursday, APS said it is being assisted in the acquisition process by Alvarez & Marsal as lead financial advisor, and Ganado Advocates as legal counsel. Other advisors are lined up to join once work on a potential transaction, including any due diligence exercise, unfolds in due course.
 ""During this period, the bank’s board of directors and management will be engaging with their various stakeholders to help inform them further about the rationale and merits of such an acquisition.""
 The biggest shareholders in APS are the Archdiocese of Malta 55.2% and the Gozo Diocese 12.7%.
 ""As shown consistently in recent years, the bank has been growing steadily, improving efficiencies, services and revenues thanks to the significant transformational investment in technology, people and systems. This has led the APS Bank Group to a strong market position which also brings with it greater responsibilities. The bank has long identified the need for scale as a priority and this led to many months of studies and extensive, professional evaluation that now underpin the non-binding offer,"" APS said.
 ""In the bank’s view, its proposal presents the best future for all the stakeholders of HSBC Bank Malta plc, and of course those of APS Bank plc.""
 HSBC is the second largest bank in Malta with a 21% market share, following Bank of Valletta, which has a 44% share. APS is the third largest bank with an 11% share of the market.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/cap-tcns-incentive-maltese-return-home-chamber-budget-proposals.1097243,"The Malta Chamber is proposing a cap on the percentage of non-EU workers each business can employ, tax exemptions to entice Maltese abroad to return home and parking fees to help end traffic congestion.
 These are among the 36 'priority' proposals outlined by the Malta Chamber in a document ahead of the 2025 budget. 
 The chamber said a strategic workforce was needed to address shortages and ensure a balance between staffing and the country's capacity to accommodate workers.
 Its suggestion to cap the percentage of non-EU workers, known as third-country nationals, comes amid concerns of overpopulation. The chamber said such capping should not apply to businesses providing essential services or where it is otherwise crucial.
 Identifying 12 main priority areas, the chamber called for a new economic model for Malta that favours a high value-added economy over the current model, which it says is based on population growth at lower productivity levels.
  At a news conference, Chris Vassallo Cesareo, president of the Malta Chamber said the time for action is now. 
 ""Last year we presented 219 proposals.  Only four were implemented.  The rest remain valid,"" he said. 
 ""Now we are making further proposals. Without further delay even if difficult or unpopular, the government has to take measures to address the pressing issues.""
 Fielding questions from Times of Malta, chamber CEO Marthese Portelli said she could not comment on the  prime minister’s promise of the ""biggest tax cuts in history"" in the upcoming budget.
  “It would be quite immature to say what our position is because we do not have the details yet, but we can definitely say that any reduced tax rates need to be seen in context.”
 She said chamber's proposal last year for COLA not to be taxed had been met with a negative response “because of financial issues.”
 The document presented by the chamber says that the transformation of Malta's economic model requires a multi-year investment plan on energy coupled with the gradual removal of subsidies, and measures to promote environmentally sustainable modes of transport including the introduction of parking fees.
 On planning, the Malta Chamber advocated for a review of the Strategic Plan for the Environment and Development (SPED), last carried out in 2015.
 It said public areas should be regularly cleaned and maintained and there should be a centrally managed permitting system. 
 On tourism, it calls for a moratorium on applications for tourism accommodation and a ""clear plan"" for tables and chairs, which many have complained have overtaken public space. 
 A percentage of the VAT generated by each locality should be invested back into the area, it said. 
 It repeated its proposal to introduce parking fees in central urban areas, but said these should be payable to an e-mobility wallet, which would be used to fund sustainable transport options.
 With the e-mobility wallet, the government would allocate an annual amount to each wallet to be used for various environmentally sustainable or shared transportation options.
 It calls for improvements in public transport access to and from industrial estates, ensuring coverage of all key routes, all shifts, and better access to factory locations, particularly at night.
 Additionally, it suggests linking car license fees to usage and restricting certain activities that cause congestion during peak hours, with incentives for night shifts and the pooling of delivery fleets.
 While urging the incorporation of planned tax refunds by cheque into revised tax bands, the Malta Chamber also calls for improvements in tax collection, a reduction in public spending, and a focus on value-added expenditure.
 It says the incorporation of planned tax refunds by cheque into the revised tax bands would eliminate the administrative burden of issuing these cheques and improve the monthly take-home pay of employed individuals.
 It also advocates for encouragement in the uptake of supplementary pensions and the implementation of an auto-enrolment with an opt-out mechanism for employees.""
 The Malta Chamber calls for a five-to-10-year energy investment plan, to be developed in consultation with the private sector, with clear milestones and deliverables based on realistic growth projections and the available skills.
  “The plan must ensure that the investment in the distribution network is not only adequate for immediate needs but also serves us well for the next three decades.”
 It should also support broader renewable energy generation and distribution, while addressing the liberalisation of energy distribution.
 Alongside a widespread national campaign on climate change, the Malta Chamber advocates for the gradual reduction of subsidies, with a minimum of six months' advance notice, to avoid subsidising excessive consumption and to increase the uptake of renewables.
 Under the heading 'Value-Added Employment', the chamber called for tax exemptions for highly qualified Maltese people who return to Malta. 
 It is also calling for constant monitoring of temping and outsourcing agencies. Temping and outsourcing agencies would not qualify as permanent employers under its proposals.
 It proposes that employment licenses for third-country nationals be extendable for an additional three years after the first year of successful employment with the same permanent employer, provided that third-country nationals meet certain educational requirements, possess specialised skills in demand, and have a good record of adhering to laws and integrating into society.
 It also advocates for encouragement in the uptake of supplementary pensions and the implementation of an auto-enrolment with an opt-out mechanism for employees.""
 Employers who contribute should be granted more attractive tax incentives than those currently offered.""
 The Malta Chamber has also called for investment to ensure an adequate electricity supply, a stable distribution network, and adequate water supply and sewage systems that meet demand.
 It has put forward proposals to support sustainable renewable energy adoption, including a feed-in tariff for businesses that offers better returns on investment.
 Regarding competitiveness, the Malta Chamber states that the country needs to transition towards a more sustainable approach to infrastructural development that considers economic growth, competitiveness, and environmental, and social sustainability.
 On tourism, it says that “to remain competitive against other Mediterranean countries, quality should be maintained throughout all elements of the supply chain, not least, our infrastructure.”
 The Malta Chamber also notes the increasing turnover and changes in high-ranking positions within government ministries, entities, authorities, agencies, and departments.“
 This instability does not bode well for the country,” it notes.
 It also calls for proactive, coordinated, and impartial enforcement at all levels.
 The Malta Chamber argues that, in addition to aiming to improve business efficiency and productivity, the government must invest in necessary reforms to ensure good governance across the board.“
 Budget 2025 must seek to tangibly transform the current economic model into one that results in a well-being economy benefiting society at large,” it says.
 The underlying principles of good governance play a crucial role in this.
 Ethical businesses are being penalised for being good corporate citizens, while unethical operators thrive by evading or circumventing their obligations due to a lack of proper enforcement and good governance.
 ""Failures in good governance undermine ethical business practices and society at large,"" it said.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/hsbc-bank-malta-future-plans-employees-union-calls-transparency.1098427,"The Malta Union of Bank Employees urged for ""transparency and fairness... in the interest of employees and the country"" after HSBC's parent company announced it would be carrying out a ""strategic review"" of its indirect 70.03% shareholding in HSBC Bank Malta.
 Rumours of HSBC exiting the Maltese market have swirled for years, fuelled by the global bank's gradual pivot away from Europe and smaller markets towards Asia.
 On Monday the MUBE said while it reserved the right to do so, it would not enter into the merits of whether HSBC should be acquired by or merged with a foreign entity or a Maltese one or whether it was dissolved and its assets sold.
 
 ""These are decisions to be taken at the corporate level, though it expects that all decision makers act with the utmost respect for their own governance and corporate social responsibilities.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/construction-least-important-industry-malta-growth-national-survey.1094206,"Construction is the last industry upon which to build Malta’s economy, according to respondents to the latest edition of the State of the Nation survey.
 The survey asked respondents how important they viewed several industries – from financial services to manufacturing, film, and retail – to be in growing Malta’s economy, asking them to rate each industry out of a score of five.
 Two of Malta’s primary industries, gaming and construction, came dead last, with construction scoring a lowly 2.97, comfortably below all other industries.
 Another of Malta’s staple industries, tourism, topped the rankings with a score of over 4.5, with retail and financial services also scoring highly.  
 
 The findings of the State of the Nation survey, now in its fourth edition, were presented during a conference at Verdala Palace on Thursday morning. The survey asked 1,064 people about their views on several issues, including religion, culture and politics.
 The construction sector has long been a bone of contention, with many, including finance minister Clyde Caruana, warning that Malta must overhaul its economic model to move away from construction, or risk facing severe social and economic challenges.
 Other cabinet members, including economy minister Silvio Schembri have been more cautious, saying that the country’s economic model just needs some tweaking.
 Nevertheless, most people appear to be satisfied with their economic situation. Four out of every five respondents say that their standard of living is within the norm, and the number of people who think that they will be better off in a year’s time is on the rise.
 But people are increasingly feeling that their rights are not being adequately protected. Just over half of all respondents (52%) say that this is the case.
 
 This is the lowest portion since the survey began, dropping from a high of 67% in 2022. A further third say that their rights could be better protected, while one in ten believe that their rights aren’t being protected at all.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/fitch-affirms-malta-credit-rating-revises-gdp-growth-upwards.1098091,"Fitch Ratings has affirmed Malta's 'A+' credit rating with a stable outlook, highlighting the country's robust economic performance while drawing attention to fiscal challenges that could pose risks in the future.
 Malta's economy continues to show strong momentum, Fitch noted, highlighting projected GDP growth of 5.7% this year (versus 0.8% for the Eurozone and 2% for other A-rated countries).
 This upward trend has been bolstered by the services and financial sectors and a robust recovery in tourism. In the first half of 2024, tourist arrivals surged past pre-pandemic levels by 32%, according to the credit rating agency.
 Fitch’s GDP projections for Malta have grown more optimistic in the past few months. When the agency last rated Malta, in March, it said it expected 4.1% growth this year and 3.7% in 2025.
 Now it is saying the economy will grow by 5.7% in 2024 and 4.3% in 2025.
 Despite the upbeat growth figures, Fitch pinpointed structural challenges, particularly in the labour market.
 Unemployment is expected to remain low at 3.2% on average over the rating horizon, well below the eurozone average of 6.5%. However, the Maltese economy faces skill shortages and low productivity – issues which persist despite a massive influx of foreign workers. These challenges could hinder future growth potential if not addressed, Fitch warned.
  Prime Minister Robert Abela highlighted the disparity in projected growth rates between Malta and the Eurozone average. That fast economic growth would allow Malta to lower taxes and maintain energy subsidies ""while still reducing the deficit,"" he said.
 Fiscal Concerns and Narrowing Deficits
 Fitch projects Malta’s fiscal deficit to gradually narrow, reaching 4% of GDP this year and declining to 3% by 2026. However, the agency flagged uncertainties regarding the government's fixed-price energy policy, which currently lacks a clear exit strategy. Energy subsidies are closely linked to international price developments, and their future cost could pose fiscal risks, it noted.
 The government has previously said that it will keep subsidies in place until new, cheaper ways of purchasing energy become available. That is expected to happen when a second interconnector is completed.
 Malta’s deficit, which is high by European standards, means the country is currently the subject of EU excessive deficit procedures under new rules introduced this year.
 The government has said it is committed to keeping debt below the 60% of GDP threshold and wants to slash the deficit to 3% within the next two years.
 Following a revision of Malta's national accounts, the country’s debt ratio stood at 47.3% of GDP at the end of 2023. Fitch forecasts that this ratio will rise to 49.6% by the end of 2024, still below the 'A' median of 53.3%. Financing risks are considered low due to ample liquidity in the domestic banking sector and a strong domestic investor base, with only 18% of government debt held by non-residents.
 Malta's external position remains solid, with the country being one of the largest net external creditors in Fitch's sovereign universe. The net international investment position is forecasted to exceed 80% of GDP by the end of 2024, with modest current account surpluses averaging 1.4% of GDP from 2024 to 2026. However, Fitch noted that these external assets are inflated by multinational activities in sectors like finance and aviation, which have limited ties to the domestic economy.
 Fitch noted that uncertainties surrounding the EU's Minimum Tax Directive could also pose medium-term risks to public finances. Corporate tax revenues are a crucial source of government income, helping to balance the low share of labour taxes and the considerable VAT gap, one of the largest in the EU. Malta has opted for a six-year transition period for the introduction of the 15% minimum effective tax rate for companies.
 Fitch noted the government's efforts to improve VAT tax collection and address concerns over tax planning structures as part of Malta's Recovery and Resilience Plan.
 It again highlighted uncertainty surrounding Malta’s cash-for-passports scheme, which was projected to generate revenues of 0.6% of GDP this year. Malta is currently being sued by the European Commission's at the European Court of Justice to end the scheme.
 Malta ranked high on Fitch’s ESG relevance score metric, with the agency saying the country enjoys a stable political environment, effective rule of law, and relatively low levels of corruption.
 Fitch indicated that Malta's credit rating could be upgraded if the government manages to achieve sustained fiscal consolidation, leading to a downward trend in debt. Conversely, the country risks a rating downgrade if government debt continues to rise, economic growth slows or regulatory and taxation changes make Malta less appealing to foreign investors, the agency said.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/gozitan-construction-sector-expecting-see-decline-activity-survey.1101738,"The construction sector in Gozo is expected to see a decline in activity, while the arts, recreational and entertainment sectors are anticipating better conditions, a survey has revealed.
 The results of the Gozo Business Sentiment Survey noted that business activity on the sister island is expected to be “less optimistic” in the coming six months, while most businesses anticipated stable conditions.
 Half of the respondents (50 percent) expect their business environment to remain unchanged in the next six months, while 30 percent of businesses expect a downturn in their business environment. 
 The construction sector stands out from all the other sectors- with 40 percent of businesses predicting a decline in activity.
 
 “This indicated a more moderate growth in the construction sector compared to that observed in recent years,” the report noted, highlighting how the figures align with the Gozo Regional Development Strategy’s vision to shift focus away from construction. 
 On the other hand, 20 percent of businesses foresee a performance improvement, with more than 30 percent of businesses in the arts, recreational and entertainment sectors anticipating better conditions. 
 The survey, published on Friday, was conducted by the Gozitan Regional Development Authority and the Gozitan Chamber of Commerce. The survey was conducted in September 2024, with the findings compared to those published in June 2024. 
 According to the survey, while issues related to a shortage of suitable employees and rising cost pressures remain the top concerns, their significance has ""declined"".
 Data shows that the shortage of employees continues to be the leading challenge for businesses in Gozo, yet notes a drop in the concern. 
 In September 2023, over 50 percent of Gozitan businesses said the main concern for their business was the lack of suitable employees. 
  A year later, over 40 percent of businesses now believe the shortage of employees is their top concern. 
 Another top concern for businesses is cost pressures. 
 Last year, cost pressure was the leading challenge for Gozitan businesses- with over 60 percent reporting it as their top concern.
  Concerns about cost pressures gradually eased, with the issue reported as 22 percentage points lower in September 2024 when compared to a year prior.
 Sales slowdown also remains a concern, cited by 24 percent of businesses, a rise of eight percentage points from March 2024.
 ""It’s worth noting that seasonal factors likely contribute to heightened concerns about sales in the September period, particularly for certain industries,"" the survey noted.
 ""In addition to these primary concerns, around 30 percent of businesses highlighted other challenges, including issues related to logistics and infrastructure.""
 Regarding prices, most businesses reported that they do not anticipate a change in the prices of the products and services they offer over the next six months, with 60 percent of businesses expecting their output prices to remain stable.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/maltese-startup-develops-foam-tech-say-prove-revolutionary.1096939,"Keith Azzopardi and his team at Smart Materials Limited believe they have developed a revolutionary polyurethane foam that could be used in multiple industries.
 Founded in 2020, the Maltese start-up has developed the game-changing material, which behaves differently from any other foam currently on the market.
 “When you stretch typical foam, it expands, and when you press it, it contracts,” Azzopardi, CEO and co-founder, explained. “Our foam, however, gets harder when compressed.”
 According to him, since the 1980s, big brand names and manufacturing companies across different industries have tried and failed to develop such type of foam on a scale viable for the market.
  A study by Sheffield Hallam University on auxetic foams, which exhibit similar properties, highlighted the challenge: “Auxetic foams could be a potential alternative to conventional foam… However, most of the potential applications are limited by the substantial lack of scale-up manufacturing methodologies to produce large auxetic foam samples.”
 What sets Smart Materials Limited apart is their innovative approach to developing the foam.
 “Others have produced foams with similar properties but we altered the production process. This allows our foam to be far more customisable, achieving properties that others couldn’t,” Azzopardi noted.
 The potential applications for this foam are vast, spanning industries from automotive to footwear and even aerospace. However, the company has chosen to focus initially on revolutionising mattresses.
 “We want to start with mattresses but, eventually, aim to transform the footwear and automotive industries as well,” Azzopardi said.
 Traditional mattresses require multiple layers of foam to provide comfort and support, which results in higher material usage, increased production complexity and more storage space.
 Smart Materials Limited’s foam, needing only a single layer, addresses these issues.
 “Our foam is more adaptable to different body types and uses fewer materials, giving us a competitive edge in the market,” Azzopardi explained.
  Sustainability is another major advantage of their product. According to the European Bedding Industry Association, up to 30 million mattresses reach the end of their life cycle each year. With fewer layers and materials, Smart Materials Limited’s foam is easier to recycle, making it a more sustainable option.
 Azzopardi’s interest in unconventional materials dates back to his PhD in metamaterials – the study of materials not found in nature – under the supervision of Ruben Gatt, an expert in the field. It was during this time that he first experimented with foam.
 “We knew it had potential but we initially walked away from it because we didn’t know how to handle it,” he admitted.
 Today, Smart Materials Limited is ready to bring this innovation to the market. Azzopardi revealed that several major brands in the foaming and chemical industries have already expressed interest in their product. The company is now exploring opportunities to sell the foam’s recipe and customisation techniques.
 Azzopardi envisions Malta as a technology hub, driven by innovations like theirs.
 “I’ll be satisfied when everyone is sleeping on our foam, running in shoes with our foam and travelling in cars equipped with our foam – whether they realise it or not,” he said.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/hili-ventures-company-prepares-bid-buy-the-point-shopping-complex.1097902,"Marsamxett Properties, a Hili Ventures company, has announced plans to acquire Tigné Mall p.l.c. , the publically-listed company that runs The Point shopping mall.
 The Hili subsidiary has been gradually acquiring a major stake in the Sliema-based retail venture over the past years and now holds just over 49.68% of the issued share capital of Tigné Mall.
 It is now out to buy the rest of the company’s shares, which are listed on the Malta Stock Exchange.
 Marsamxett Properties said the board of directors of Tigné Mall was officially informed of its intention on Tuesday.
 Details of the offer, including the buying price and terms and conditions, will be announced over the coming days with the publication of the Offer Document.
 Tigne Mall p.l.c. shares closed trading at 95c on Tuesday.
 The company’s second-biggest shareholder is Mapfre MSV Life p.l.c., which as of April 2023 held a 35.46% stake in the company. Malta’s two largest retail banks, HSBC and Bank of Valletta, also held significant stakes as of October 2023 at 12.81% and 16.7% respectively.
 If Marsamxett Properties succeeds in acquiring 90% of the company, it will then be eligible to squeeze out remaining shareholders and assume sole ownership of The Point. 
 Tigné Mall in the first half of 2023 announced a pre-tax profit of €2.4 million. 
 It said at the time that its occupancy rate was very high, indicating a strong demand for premium retail space.  
 Tigne Mall p.l.c. was set up in 2013 after MIDI plc, which designed and built The Point shopping mall, sold its entire shareholding in the venture. Those shares were purchased by a combination of the previously mentioned institutional investors as well as members of the public. 
 The company's deed over land in Tigne expires in 2099.  
 Malta-based Hili Ventures is a diversified group active in food service, retail, real estate, hospitality, shipping, oil and gas, engineering, and technology. Through its various subsidiaries, the group owns a vast portfolio of commercial real estate assets across Europe, including shopping centres, health care facilities and office buildings.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/malta-gdp-growth-slows-still-tops-eu-table.1093168,"Malta’s gross domestic product was up during the first three months of 2024 compared to the same period last year, but has dipped slightly since the end of 2023, new NSO data shows.
 GDP calculates the value of goods and services produced by Malta’s economy, effectively measuring how well a country's economy is performing.
 The data shows that GDP grew by 4.6% during the first quarter of this year, now standing at €4.9 billion in nominal terms, or roughly €8,800 for each person in Malta.
 While this is 8.4% (or some €380 million) higher than at the same point last year, it represents a slight dip from the previous two quarters, when it had hit the €5 billion mark.
 
 The data indicates that Malta’s economic growth is largely driven by its services industry, with financial services, real estate and professional or scientific services all recording strong growth rates over the previous year.
 Likewise, exports of goods and services remain a driving force of Malta’s economy, although their contribution to Malta’s economic growth has dipped compared to previous quarters.
 The data suggests that Malta’s GDP growth remains higher than any other EU country.
 EU data published earlier this month shows that GDP across both the EU and the Eurozone had grown marginally by 0.4% in the first quarter of 2024, compared to the first three months of 2023.
 Prime Minister Robert Abela was quick to point this out, posting on X that Malta’s economy had grown at twelve times the rate of that across the rest of the European bloc.
  A longer-term view of the data shows that Malta’s economy recovered strongly in the aftermath of the pandemic, rebounding sharply in the spring of 2021 before gradually stabilising as the months went by, often registering gradual growth from one quarter to the next.
 Central Bank estimates suggest that Malta's GDP is expected to moderate over the longer term, dipping slightly to 3.3% by 2026.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/40-gozo-businesses-reported-increased-workforce-past-year.1094091,"Nearly 40% of respondents in a Gozo business survey reported that they increased their workforce in the past year, and more than half plan to recruit more within the next six months, particularly in the tourism, manufacturing, and professional services sectors, the Gozo Business Chamber said. 
 The Gozo Business Sentiment Survey was held in association with the Gozo Regional Development Authority (GRDA). 80 businesses in Gozo were surveyed in September and another 80 in March 2024.
 Overall, respondents reported a relatively stable 12-month period from April 2023 to March 2024. 
 Their primary challenges were employee shortages and cost pressures. The cost pressures identified as a main business concern reflect themselves in the price expectations of products or services purchased and the price expectations of products or services sold. In March 2024, 60% of businesses have highlighted that they did not intend to increase the prices of products and services sold over the next six months, the chamber said.
 Nearly 60% of businesses made investments in the past year and more than half plan to continue investing over the next six months, especially in wholesale and retail trade, construction, arts and entertainment, and accommodation and food services.
 45% of businesses acknowledged the potential impact of climate change on their operations, with half taking measures to enhance resilience. This contrasted with higher awareness levels observed in other EU firms, the chamber said.
 Key budget measures impacting businesses included the increase in the minimum wage and COLA adjustment, a reduction of tax on part-time work, increase in stamp duty for Gozo properties, UCA Scheme incentives, and the Micro Invest Scheme.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/fight-equality-far-over-gay-rights-movement-celebrates-pride.1098112,"Malta’s LGBTIQ community still faces challenges despite the progress seen in recent years, the Malta LGBTIQ Rights Movement said on Saturday.
 “We have achieved a lot in 20 years, but laws don’t transform society overnight, and they are not enjoyed by all,” said MGRM co-coordinator Cynthia Chircop in a speech at Valletta’s Malta Pride Concert.
 She told audience members that since the organisation’s first pride march, the group had continued to garner support and “pride kept growing and change happened.”
 But despite the progress, the community was still facing discrimination at work and when accessing government services, “and the Equality Act has not been mentioned since the last election"", said Chircop.
 She said in Malta the LGBTIQ community was “still waiting for a new sexual health policy to tackle many issues including contraceptives, STIs [sexually transmitted infections] and education”.
 Meanwhile, free access to medicines used to prevent HIV (‘PrEP’ and ‘PEP’) “remains an electoral promise”, she said.
 “Over a year later, the gender clinic still does not have a psychiatrist, affecting trans [transgender] healthcare. LGBTIQ asylum seekers lack access to legal support, are rejected as unfounded or for lack of evidence and risk violence in detention and open centres.""
  Chircop said public incidents of harassment or assault were still being reported, while ""people still question our right to have a family.”
 Pointing to a lack of representation, she said children in LGBTIQ families “feel invisible at school because they don’t see families like theirs anywhere” while bullying and a lack of state support were realities for those in the community.
 Calling bigotry “hard to eradicate”, Chircop signalled the movement’s support for LGBTIQ communities in other countries facing private and state persecution.
 “We march for a future where everyone, regardless of who they are or who they love, can live freely and without fear,” she said.
 “The fight for equality is far from over, and our presence is a reminder to all that we are here, we are queer, we are proud of it, and we are not going anywhere.”
 Chircop thanked the late former PN MP Karl Gouder for ""being vocal in the journey towards marriage equality"" and Nicky Sansone, the inspirational 55-year-old who  died last month following a public battle with cancer.
 She also thanked activist organisations including Moviment Graffitti, Drachma, Aditus, LGBTI+ Gozo, Checkpoint Malta and ARC.
 In a similar call on Friday, Moviment Graffitti said the government should take pride month as an opportunity to help address pending issues faced by the LGBTIQ community and not only stand and march with them.
 Malta Pride started on Friday September 6 and closes Sunday.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/who-fly-national-colours-archbishop-warns-malta-low-birth-rate.1102395,"Archbishop Charles Scicluna marked the 50th anniversary of Malta becoming a Republic by addressing the country’s declining fertility rate and questioning who would “represent Malta’s identity and fly our national colours” when his generation dies. 
 Delivering a homily at St John’s Co-Cathedral, Scicluna recalled how in 1964, the year Malta gained Independence, Malta’s birth rate was 2.74. In 1974, when Malta became a Republic, it was 2.08. 
 Now, in 2024, Malta has the lowest fertility rate in the EU, with a birth rate of 1.08. Experts forecast that the already low fertility rate will  continue to shrink in the years to come.
 “Malta’s current birth rate is so low, that it is below replacement level,” Scicluna said.
  “We need to think about the roots and causes of this downward trend, and in the interest of our heritage and the preservation of our ethnicity, we need to be proactive in promoting the blessing of offspring to our families.”
 He prayed to God to grant Malta the “blessing of new births in our beloved and sweet land”.
 Scicluna noted how this year’s budget has tried to address the issue and encourage young couples to plan their future and fulfil their “natural vocation” to become mothers and fathers of the country’s future generations. 
 This year’s budget - among other measures - includes a €1,500 one-time payment for the third and every subsequent child, a boost in marriage tax credit and a €250 increase in child allowance.
  Scicluna said measures such as providing fair wages and affordable housing would encourage families to thrive and grow.
 “For what would the Republic have achieved if it makes economic progress and reforms its institutions but does not provide for the gift of future generations,” he asked. 
 ""Who will be there to represent Malta’s identity and fly our national colours when our generation fades away? Who will be there to proudly declare this island as a sweet homeland that cherishes its identity and serves as a haven for the life and love and its people?""
 He concluded his homily by appealing to the people to pray that future descendants will be there when the time comes ""for us to hand over the baton"".
  Scicluna also expressed gratitude for the country’s achievements over the past 50 years and paid tribute to contributions by politicians, public servants, judiciary, army and law enforcement.
 “We should recognise the ever-growing role of civil society and the important contributions of non-governmental organisations in several areas ranging from social services to human rights, to the environment and justice,” he added.
  He also honoured the legacy of Sir Anthony Mamo, Malta’s first president, and commended his successors for upholding the dignity of the office.
 Pontifical Mass was attended by President Myriam Spiteri Debono, Prime Minister Robert Abela, his wife Lydia Abela, Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech, his wife AnneMarie Grech, and other ministers.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/local-shortages-adhd-medicines-posing-serious-challenges-sufferers.1102508,"Psychiatrists have voiced “serious concerns” about the limited availability and choice of ADHD medication in Malta, in the context of a global shortage of these essential treatments. 
 Psychiatrist Rosemarie Sacco, president of the Association for Child and Adolescent Mental Health (ACAMH), said this shortfall was adversely affecting the treatment and well-being of individuals with ADHD, both children and adults. 
 Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder typically diagnosed in childhood but that persists into adulthood. It is characterised by difficulties with sustaining attention, emotion regulation, excessive activity, and impulse control. Medication often plays a crucial role in managing these symptoms effectively.
 In Malta, around five per cent of children have a diagnosis of ADHD. However, at present, the country’s government formulary offers a narrow range of treatment options.
 The main medications available locally are methylphenidate-based stimulants and atomoxetine, but both are in short supply. The government formulary includes only a 10mg preparation for immediate-release methylphenidate.
 Additionally, for prolonged-release methylphenidate, the formulary offers only a limited selection of dosages – specifically 18mg, 27mg, and 36mg – each available only under specific circumstances.
 The problem of limited options is compounded by the current global shortage of these same medications, making it even more challenging for psychiatrists to find the right medication and dosage for individuals with ADHD, she explained.
 “Having access to a variety of medication types allows for a more personalised approach to treatment, which is essential for effective management of ADHD,” Sacco said.
 But, up till now, several essential medications like guanfacine, Adderall, dexedrine, and lisdexamfetamine are completely unavailable. 
 These medications are crucial for treating ADHD because they provide different mechanisms of action and benefits, which can be better suited to meet individual patient needs. The lack of diverse treatment options can make it difficult to find effective management strategies for individuals living with ADHD.
  Moreover, “alternatives to the currently available preparations of methylphenidate are critical”, added psychiatrist Daniel Vella Fondacaro.
 For instance, short-acting medications like Ritalin typically require administration during school hours, as their effects only last for about four hours. This can pose challenges for children who need to take medication at school.
 In contrast, longer-acting options may help children manage their ADHD symptoms throughout the school day without needing to take medication while there.
 This flexibility allows treatment plans that better align with each child’s unique lifestyle and daily schedule, ultimately improving their behaviour and ability to focus during school. 
 Concerta is a long-acting methylphenidate that starts working about an hour after you take it and can help manage symptoms for up to 12 hours. However, in Malta, Concerta is not widely available through the government formulary system, which tends to focus on generic versions of medications. 
 Before the current shortage of methylphenidate, Concerta was only accessible to a limited number of individuals who had it prescribed before 2021.
 Since then, “newly diagnosed patients have not been automatically entitled to receive Concerta, meaning they would have to pay a significant amount out of pocket for it”, said Nigel Camilleri, the psychiatrist founder of ACAMH-Malta, who was also sharing his personal experience as a parent. 
  “While generics can be good alternatives in some situations, they aren’t always exactly the same as the brand-name drugs,” Andrea Saliba, also a psychiatrist, emphasised. 
 Concerta has a special release mechanism that is protected by a patent, meaning generics can’t copy how it works. Because of this, it’s important to look at not just how well a medication can be absorbed in the body but also how effective it is in treating ADHD, as differences in how drugs are made can lead to different outcomes for patients.
 Additionally, there are other forms of methylphenidate medications, such as Medikinet XL and Equasym XL, which provide additional options to accommodate different lifestyles. 
 Medikinet XL contains both an immediate-release component (50 per cent of the dose) and a prolonged-release component (50 per cent of the dose), while Equasym XL has a similar set-up with 30 per cent immediate-release and 70 per cent prolonged-release components. 
  The design of these medications allows an immediate effect, while the prolonged-release portion would maintain symptom control throughout the afternoon, eliminating the need for a midday dose during school hours. 
 This means that individuals can benefit from consistent therapeutic effects for about eight hours. This allows the medication to wear off just in time for evening meals and better-quality night sleep, keeping in mind that common side effects include reduced appetite and sleep disturbance. 
 Increasing treatment options can be particularly advantageous for individuals balancing school, work and personal activities.
 The association called for immediate action to address these shortages, expand the formulary and ensure that Maltese patients have access to the full spectrum of evidence-based treatments available in other countries. 
 “Children and adolescents with ADHD deserve the same standard of care as their peers across Europe,” Sacco concluded.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/doctors-back-call-public-inquiry-benefits-fraud-scandal.1096328,"Doctors are backing a call by a group of NGOs for a public inquiry into the benefits fraud scandal.
 The scandal was revealed by Times of Malta last year, when it was reported that former MP Silvio Grixti was implicated as being at the centre of a scam which saw hundreds of people being granted benefits for severe disabilities they did not suffer from.
 Grixti was subsequently arraigned, along with a number of other people.
 Subsequently, the president of the Medical Association of Malta branded the benefit fraud racket as “organised crime”.
 A group of NGOs last month demanded a public inquiry into the benefits fraud scandal.
 The activists - Repubblika, aditus, The Daphne Caruana Galizia Foundation, Moviment Graffitti, Kopin, KSU, Manueldelia.com, Occupy Justice and UĦM Voice of the Workers - handed a letter addressed to the prime minister at the Auberge de Castille, calling for a public inquiry.
 On Monday, MAM joined the call for an independent public inquiry into the scandal, which it said had ""significantly undermined the integrity of our institutions and eroded public trust in the sickness benefits process"". 
 The association said that ""disturbingly"", members of the cabinet that approved a presidential pardon for those implicated in the fraud are allegedly linked to the fraud, ""raising concern about the fairness of the process"".
 ""In stark contrast, medical professionals, who had their signatures forged as part of this scheme, have received no justice, not even an official apology,"" MAM said.
 It urged full accountability and transparency to restore public confidence and ensure justice is served.
 ""The medical community, along with the general public, deserves a thorough investigation and a genuine acknowledgement of the wrongs committed.
 It is crucial that vulnerable patients receive the support they are entitled to without the interference of political misconduct.""
 MAM said a prospective public inquiry should also address the return of the embezzled funds and the timing of the presidential pardon.
 The ministry involved in this fraud should never be the same one responsible for ensuring that the money is returned, it added.

 The training covers Maltese words and phrases related to patient care, hygiene, first aid and emotional support, with a special focus on empathy and effective communication. The program includes various practical sessions in simulated environments and is being delivered in Malta by a qualified nurse who is a teacher by profession. 
  Of those 200 students, 150 are nurses who are sometimes in charge of wards and who therefore most need to be able to understand patients speaking Maltese. The other 50 spots were given to carers on a first-come, first-served basis. 
 Healthmark recruits, trains and deploys carers and nurses to several of Malta’s hospitals and elderly homes. Jointly owned by db Group and James Caterers, it is the country’s single largest healthcare employer. 
 MTRM is a private company within the General Workers Union licensed and accredited for training by Malta Further and Higher Education Authority (MFHEA). 
 Its mission is to provide adults with educational opportunities to acquire and improve the necessary skills and competencies to become self-sufficient and gainfully occupied.
 Healthmark CEO Charlotte Sant Portanier said the company strived to ensure it provided enough workers to meet Malta’s healthcare demands.
 “But alongside that we must make sure that every worker is not just qualified but also sensitive to our local environment and the needs of our patients,” she said.
 MTRM CEO Lewis Spiteri said the programme was already making an impact on healthcare services and thanked Healthmark for bringing the programme to fruition.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/i-m-still-dizzy-exhausted-longcovid-patients-remain-trapped.1091679,"A long-COVID sufferer has spoken about the way the virus has caused “drastic” changes to her body and impacted every aspect of her life.
 The woman has called for more awareness to help many patients like her who have contracted the virus and have never completely shaken it off.
 Anna* caught the virus in October 2022, having had no previous health conditions. But 18 months later, debilitating symptoms have persisted.
 Back then, she initially had some fever and cold symptoms, but soon started experiencing typical symptoms of long-COVID, including difficulty concentrating, fatigue and post-exertional malaise (PEM), the worsening of symptoms following even minor physical or mental exertion.
 Three months later, she was still hoping it was just a slow recovery. But after about half a year, it became clearer it was more than that.
 “I was unable to do even the smallest tasks of everyday life, such as grocery shopping and showering. I was also unable to read, watch films and listen to music.
 “I was – and still am – experiencing dizziness, palpitations and nausea when exhausted.”
 Anna explained that fatigue was not a feeling of tiredness, but of deep exhaustion, characterised by pain and dizziness as well as the inability to sleep and rest well.
 “Brain fog is a lot less peaceful than the word may suggest. I experience it more as a thunderstorm in the brain,” she said.
 “I had strong symptoms, including cognitive ones, which meant that even organising help was often overwhelming,” Anna admitted.
 Attempts to describe her symptoms have often baffled others, including some doctors, and she has had to keep explaining they were not psychological.
 “In this situation, reading about the experiences of others and research findings greatly helps,” Anna said.
 Her biggest problem has been not knowing who to talk to about everyday life arrangements and questions about continuing or adapting work.
 “I had to learn the technique of pacing to avoid the worsening of symptoms,” Anna said.
 “While doctors were friendly, I got most helpful information, including the crucial technique of pacing, by reading, which, in itself, is a difficult task for most of those affected,” Anna continued.
 Over the last 18 months, there have been some changes in the symptoms and energy levels, Anna acknowledged.
 “Occasionally, however, these make it even harder to know when to stop to avoid worsening symptoms.”
 Anna is going through further cardiology check-ups at Mater Dei Hospital’s Long-COVID Clinic, but her GP has said there was nothing more to be done for her main symptoms of fatigue and PEM.
 “It was and is difficult to explain the disease to friends and colleagues. I believe that more visibility in the public sphere would have greatly helped the process of adapting to my condition, which was often misunderstood as ‘a bit of tiredness’,” Anna said.
 She was trying her best to remain optimistic about a cure. “That is why it is important for the disease to get publicity and for research to get funding.”
 Patients like her needed an official website directing them towards medical and social services and information about how to deal with long-term sick leave, or the need to adapt working conditions, schooling, and so on.
 Those requiring long-term sick leave and those who had care obligations also needed financial support, as well as support with daily necessities.
 Access to anti-viral medication was also called for, given “a big fear” of the worsening of symptoms due to another COVID-19 infection.
 While she still managed to work and go about her daily life, this was only because she was “privileged” to have a lot of flexibility at work and because she stopped all other activities.
 “I am lucky I have recovered to the degree that I can organise my household – but only by planning meticulously, with short tasks and long breaks, and by adapting my lifestyle. I walk much less than I used to – to shops or to work – and sport of any type is out of the question.”
 The hardest part of all this was that even positive input, such as a short chat with a friend, reading a friendly e-mail, or taking a short walk, causes PEM, Anna said.
 “It means that to rest, I have to switch off completely; even my thoughts. This is a daily struggle.
 “It is also a struggle not to worry too much – because, of course, worrying, too, will give you symptoms and take away energy. Even answering these questions causes symptoms.”

https://timesofmalta.com/article/health-minister-rules-future-vitalslike-deal-st-luke.1093243,"The Health Minister has ruled out the possibility of a Vitals-like deal for St Luke's Hospital that would see the Gwardamanġa hospital privatised again. 
 On Thursday, JoEtienne Abela said the plan was to revamp Malta's old general hospital and run it as a government-led operation.
 Nine years ago, the Maltese government gave away St Luke's and two other hospitals in a concession deal to Vitals Global Healthcare (VGH).
 VGH was meant to refurbish the hospitals and operate them on behalf of the government. Despite the multi-million deal, pledged projects were never carried out, deadlines were missed and St Luke's remained abandoned. 
  The concession was later passed on to Steward Healthcare.
 A judge described the whole hospitals' deal as ""fraudulent"".
 Former prime minister Joseph Muscat, his then chief of staff Keith Schembri and former health minister Konrad Mizzi are facing charges of bribery, trading in influence, money laundering, and various other crimes.
 On Thursday, health minister JoEtienne said plans are in hand to move outpatient wards, day surgery, and dental procedures currently based at Mater Dei Hospital to St Luke's. 
 The University of Malta's medical and nurses' schools will also move from MDH to Gwardamanġa under new plans, he said. 
 Those plans, include revamping and constructing new buildings in the St Luke's complex. 
 While the government will lead the project, it does not mean stonewalling the private sector. 
 ""Cooperation with the private sector served us in the past and is serving us in the present. I don't see why there should not be cooperation with the private sector.""

https://timesofmalta.com/article/mam-files-judicial-protest-stop-outsourcing-ivf-procedures.1093323,"The Medical Association of Malt (MAM) has filed a judicial protest seeking to stop the government from outsourcing IVF procedures to the private sector. 
 This comes after Prime Minister Robert Abela announced the government would be sending couples on the waiting list for IVF to private clinics for treatment, during an electoral campaign event earlier this month. 
 The government subsequently announced it would be spending €6 million to send some 650 couples for private IVF treatment, in a bid to slash waiting times. 
 But the MAM says that this violates an agreement the government had entered into with doctors following a 2018 strike over the transfer of public hospitals to the private company Steward Healthcare. 
 In this agreement, the MAM said that the government promised it would carry out “meaningful” consultation with the association and obtain its consent prior to forging ahead with any planned privatisation or outsourcing of any services that are offered as part of the national health service. 
 The state disrespected this agreement when it published tenders for these services without any consultation or consent, as stipulated in the aforementioned agreement, the association said. 
 “MAM is protesting that the Government is showing a lack of transparency. This is crucial in the light of the Vitals/Steward fraud,” MAM president Martin Balzan said. 
 “The Association insists that any privatisation of medical services has to abide by signed agreements, have patients' best interest at their core and there has to be proper scrutiny of how taxpayer money is being spent.”
 Balzan added that the country’s health infrastructure was now “in crisis” thanks to the defunct deal that saw three state hospitals handed over to the private company VGH and later Steward Health Care. This crisis can only be resolved if the way forward is planned holistically and with the involvement of all stakeholders, he said. 
 While the MAM is not against involving private sector operators to cut waiting lists, including for IVF, but this should not be done at the expense of ignoring obligations. 
 “The blatant disregard of existing agreements and the lack of consultation does not reassure doctors that the government has learned the lessons from the Vitals/Steward fraud,” Balzan said. 
 The MAM is calling on the government to stop further privatisation until proper meaningful consultation is complete.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/health-minister-wants-introduce-organ-donation-circulatory-death.1102219,"The health minister said on Monday that he wants to build on a Bill moved by an Opposition MP to facilitate organ donation by making organ retrieval possible when a patient has 'circulatory death'.
 At present organs can only be retrieved once patients are certified as being brain dead.
 Minister Jo Etienne Abela said in parliament that he wanted to go beyond that so that organs could be retrieved when a patient had 'circulatory death'.
 (That would mean that organs may be taken when a patient's circulatory and respiratory functions have stopped, and death is pronounced by a physician.)
 The minister pointed out that this had already been introduced in other countries, such as the UK, and had led to an increase in organ donations. 
 It was also for this reason, among others, that the hospital's Emergency and Intensive Care departments needed to be enlarged. 
 The minister was replying to questions by Labour MP Rosianne Cutajar.
 He recalled that in October he had backed a bill tabled by Nationalist MP Ivan Bartolo introducing an 'opt-out' system for organ donations.  
 At present, people wishing to donate their organs need to ‘opt-in’ by registering to donate their organs for transplant once they die. Bartolo had proposed to reverse the process so that anyone over 16 would be presumed to have given consent to donating organs unless stated otherwise.
 Abela said he not only backed but had also seconded Bartolo's bill, but he wanted to go further.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/clinic-using-chinese-medicine-tackle-malta-obesity-crisis.1098127,"Malta’s chart-topping obesity rate has led to the setting up of a weight-loss clinic that uses traditional Chinese medicine to tackle the health problem.
 The alternative medicine, based on a form of acupuncture called acupoint thread embedding, is being offered at Paola’s Mediterranean Regional Centre for Traditional Chinese Medicine (MRCTCM), which launched its specialist clinic last month but has been treating around 30 patients since January.
 “The goal of the new weight-loss specialist clinic is to address the underlying cause of obesity, a common health issue in Malta, by applying Chinese therapy without side effects and relying on pharmaceutical drugs,” the centre said.
 Malta has for years topped overweight and obesity lists, with predictions suggesting the problem that over a third of the adult population will be obese by 2030.
 Around a quarter of Maltese adults are already considered obese, putting Malta far ahead on the obesity scale, according to Eurostat and the World Health Organisation.
 In March, the MRCTCM, opened jointly by the Maltese and Chinese government 30 years ago, approached Public Health to propose treating obesity in an alternative way.
 The idea was to invite volunteers to carry out a research programme that would study the effects of acupuncture on weight loss, draw comparisons and collate data that would shed any doubts on how the treatment worked.
 But government funding for the research was not available. So, it has proceeded anyway to offer the therapy at its clinic.
 Centre director Dr Feng Hua has been practising this form of acupuncture for obesity – also known as catgut sutures – on thousands of patients in China for the last 15 years.
 It comes with a major caveat: it is not currently endorsed by scientific organisations such as the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, the Endocrine Society and the FDA.
 But from experience, Dr Feng Hua is convinced of the effectiveness of injecting what is called a collagen line into specific muscles – around 10 selected acupoints – every two weeks.
 She said catgut embedding means cutting down on the frequent appointments of standard acupuncture – the effects of which stop once the needles are removed.
 This is because the collagen lines remain effective in the body until they dissolve after two weeks.
 The prolonged stimulation provided by the catgut sutures, embedded at strategic acupuncture points, reduces appetite and helps regulate the digestive system, reducing bloating, while enhancing and accelerating metabolism, Fua explained.
 She said the treatment was slightly painful, particularly a couple of days after the embedding. Fua maintained patients were able to endure the discomfort and “accept it is doing its job”.
  Fua said it was still early days to see the effects on patients that have attended the clinic since it only opened a few weeks ago. But the centre was confident about the results.
 A female patient in her 40s, who has already undergone the treatment and wished to remain anonymous, told Times of Malta she lost seven kilos over three months, insisting the benefits extended far beyond mere weight reduction.
 This patient, however, was nowhere near obese at the beginning of her weight loss journey. At around 55 kilos, she just wished to shed some more weight.
 A director of a private hospital, she said her “journey” with catgut embedding began as an exploration into alternative weight-loss methods and turned out to be a “transformative experience”.
 It led to an immediate decrease in appetite in her case and was pivotal in helping her make better food choices.
  “Without the constant cravings for unhealthy snacks and sugary treats, I found it easier to base my diet on nutritious, wholesome foods. Fruits and vegetables became the cornerstone of my meals, providing essential vitamins and minerals that not only supported my weight loss but also improved my overall health,” she said.
 The patient said she no longer felt the compulsion to eat out of habit and emotion.
 “Instead, I began to listen to my body’s true hunger signals and chose foods that were both satisfying and nourishing.”
 Asked what happened to patients when they stopped the therapy, Fua said positive results were often retained because they led to changes in lifestyle and dietary habits.
 “Once the body starts to feel so good and healthy, and receives positive feedback, it continues to follow this lifestyle.”
 Fua said catgut embedding also works on and stabilises the endocrine system, so even when the treatment stopped, it continues to work long term.
 The length of the treatment depends on the individual and the amount of weight that needs to be lost, but generally, results are seen after three months, she said.
 The average reduction was around two kilos a month, but this could plateau in the second and kickstart again, Fua estimated, adding she was against quick weight loss because this can be easily regained.
 The lower the starting weight, the harder it could be to shed the kilos, she said.
 The centre’s current profile of patients was mostly female, aged between 40 and 60, but some men have started dropping in since the clinic was officially opened, Fua said.
 Men in Malta have the highest rate of overweight and obesity of the 52 countries making up the WHO’s European region. Women in Malta were the second highest.
 The medical team at the MRCTCM provides other ancient Chinese therapies like moxibustion (the burning of leaves on body points), cupping and Tuina (a Chinese massage) to deal with various diseases.
 Fua said the Maltese were open to and accepting of conventional Chinese concepts and trusted in these alternative forms of treatment, which did not have side effects.
 The overall message is that acupuncture can be used not only to treat pain, and Fua urged those who were tired of using medication for their problems to give it a try.
 “We hope we can help many people because obesity leads to other symptoms, including knee, thigh and hip problems. We see people limping in the streets and we feel sorry for them,” she said.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/funeral-doctor-naged-megally-held-monday.1096876,"The funeral of doctor Naged Megally will be held on Monday.
 Megally's funeral will take place over a year after his death, as his family spent months battling to determine the cause of his death.
 Mass will be held at St Margaret Parish Church at Sannat, Gozo at 4.45 pm. 
 His daughter, Anastasia Megally, announced the details of her late father’s funeral on Saturday.
  Megally, a specialist in foetal medicine who worked at Mater Dei hospital, died on 5 July 2023, after developing medical complications. 
 Megally, long-afflicted by a neuromuscular condition, had a long and complicated medical history which, according to his family, was not adequately diagnosed and assessed before medication was administered during his last weeks in hospital. 
 His wife and children fought for a magisterial inquiry to determine the cause of his death. The family repeatedly requested an autopsy, insisting that the procedure was to be done within the scope of a magisterial inquiry. 
 The family sought recourse before the criminal courts seeking judicial authorisation, but their bid proved unsuccessful. 
 The family also claimed hospital authorities were holding the body of Megally “hostage” inside the morgue for months.
 This year, the court held hospital authorities and the Superintendent of Public Health responsible for breaching the fundamental rights of Megally’s family by denying them a private autopsy to determine the cause of his death.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/the-never-secret-vitals-mou-kept-secret-six-years.1097197,"A Vitals agreement that the government kept under wraps for years was “never secretive”, former Malta Enterprise CEO Mario Galea claimed in court last week.
 Yet, Malta Enterprise fought tooth and nail to keep its contents secret, citing “commercial sensitivity.”
 Various government entities also claimed to the auditor general that they did not even have a copy of the 2014 memorandum of understanding (MoU).
 The auditor general was finally given a copy in 2020, only after a damning report concluded that the mere existence of the MoU indicated collusion between the Vitals investors and government officials.
 Times of Malta  discovered the existence of the memorandum of understanding in 2017, after obtaining a presentation by the Vitals investors bragging about how they had signed an agreement with the government to run the Gozo, St Luke’s and Karin Grech hospitals.
 The presentation referencing the agreement predated the official tender to run the hospitals by several months.
  Attempts by Times of Malta to get a copy of the agreement from Malta Enterprise were rebuffed on “commercial sensitivity” grounds. Judge Joanna Vella Cuschieri upheld Malta Enterprise’s refusal when an appeal was filed.
 Although the memorandum of understanding only refers to the Gozo hospital, the auditor general said it served as the basis for the entire concession being awarded to Vitals through what was meant to be a competitive tender.
 The deal awarded to Vitals and later taken over by Steward was struck down by a court last year on “fraud” grounds. Top former officials, including ex-prime minister Joseph Muscat, face criminal charges over the Vitals deal.
 What does the MoU say? 
 The agreement, signed by ex-minister Chris Cardona, was for the setting up of a Gozo medical school, “which shall include the extension and operation of the Gozo General Hospital”.
 It bound the investors to set up a company in Malta to develop and operate the project, “which company will appear on behalf of the investors on the final agreement”.
 Cardona, who was responsible for Malta Enterprise when the agreement was signed, told a court that the first time he met the Vitals investors was during the signing at Castille.
 Cardona said it was his ministry staff who informed him that the “run of the mill” agreement needed to be signed by him.
 A magisterial inquiry into Vitals uncovered evidence that the government was always planning to include all three hospitals in the deal.
 Brian Tonna, the man who set up secret companies in Panama for ex-government officials Keith Schembri and Konrad Mizzi, was involved in meetings with Pakistani businessman Shaukat Ali about the hospitals project as early as June 2014.
 Ali and Tonna have both been charged in connection with the deal.
 In January 2015, the government was advised that handing the hospitals contract to a group of investors without first issuing a public tender could present a “legal hurdle”.
 It was eventually decided that a request for proposals would be necessary. The request was issued in March 2015, five months after the MoU was signed.
 In an added twist, Konrad Mizzi’s then-permanent secretary Ronald Mizzi appointed Tonna to the evaluation committee that would assess the tender bids, despite his connections with Ali.
 The inquiry found there was “considerable argument” over who should sit on the committee.
 On the closing date of the submissions for bids, Tonna was replaced by his Nexia BT partner Manuel Castagna.
 Mizzi resigned as permanent secretary in July after a court found there is enough evidence for him to face trial in connection with the deal.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/joseph-muscat-associates-linked-steward-slush-fund.1092681,"A €1 million “political support fund” created by Steward Health Care is suspected to have been set up to pass on bribes to Joseph Muscat, Keith Schembri and Konrad Mizzi.
 The funds were held by Accutor AG, a Swiss company suspected of being used as a centralised money-laundering hub for payments linked to the hospitals deal involving Vitals and Steward.
 Investigators have zeroed in on how soon after leaving office, both Muscat and Mizzi signed consultancy agreements linked to Accutor, while Schembri is also suspected to have indirectly benefited from the “political support fund”.
 The funds were moved from Steward to Accutor under the guise of a consultancy agreement. Steward boss Armin Ernst described the Accutor agreement in an August 2019 internal e-mail as intended to support “political and government activities and interactions”.
 Investigators concluded that the chances Muscat, Schembri and Mizzi happened to all then go on to independently form relationships with Accutor is considered so negligible that the possibility is excluded.
 
 The trio are facing money-laundering and criminal association charges in connection with the hospitals deal, together with a long list of other individuals and companies.
 Financial experts said the existence of the political support fund was clear evidence that Steward was masking political payments under the guise of consultancy services.
 They observed that had the arrangement in any way been a donation towards genuine political purposes connected to Malta it would not have been necessary to send the payments offshore to Switzerland.
 Muscat inked a consultancy deal with SpringX Media, a company affiliated with Accutor, five months after Ernst made reference to the ""political support fund"" and within weeks of resigning as prime minister in January 2020.
 The ex-prime minister received four €15,000 payments from Accutor and a related company called SpringX Media.
 A January 2022 search of Muscat’s home yielded little evidence that the €60,000 the ex-prime minister received from Accutor and an affiliated company called SpringX Media was for genuine work, according to investigators.
 Muscat was prepared for the search with copies of his consultancy contract with SpringX Media, as well as some “generic” powerpoint presentations linked to the work he claims to have done.
  In comments to Times of Malta yesterday, Muscat said if the authorities required supporting documentation for his work, they could have asked him for the necessary information.
 “I had also written to the police soon after learning that the inquiry was concluded.
 “Instead of calling me to provide evidence to show that the allegations against me were simply a pack of lies, a decision was taken to issue charges against me without hearing me, against all convention.
 “I will now provide this evidence in the adequate forum at the appropriate time. Like I was proven right on the (secret company) Egrant saga, I will be proven right again on Egrant 2,” Muscat said.
 Muscat said extensive parts of the inquiry rely on “hearsay” evidence from a “Indian person”, claiming he received €18 million annually from the hospitals deal.
 On the “political support fund,” Muscat said he is not aware and cannot comment about correspondence and alleged actions by other persons.
 “That is why I believe that the best course in the public’s interest is for the inquiry to be published.
 “Because of this, I have personally taken the initiative before the court to try to make this possible in full legally rather than through selective leaks,” Muscat said.
 Times of Malta revealed Muscat’s link to Accutor in November 2021.
  The Mizzi connection
 Investigations noted how in the days leading up to the August 2019 e-mail about the political support fund, Ernst wrote to Mizzi seeking his support on a major issue that he knew would require the minister’s sponsorship.
 Investigators noted how the issue – namely the transfer of ownership of the Barts medical school – rapidly made its way to cabinet thanks to Mizzi’s support.
 The Barts deal appears to have been aborted after Mizzi resigned from cabinet in November 2019 over the Daphne Caruana Galizia murder scandal.
 A few months after resigning, Mizzi entered into a consultancy agreement with a Maltese company – Ikons Limited. Investigators noted how this coincided with Ikons receiving €180,000 worth of payments from Accutor.
 Investigators discovered how the consultancy agreement, dated March 2020, was between Ikons, Mizzi and Alex Cutajar, a former aide to the minister.
 While Cutajar was assigned specific work tasks under the agreement, investigators flagged how no specific tasks were assigned to Mizzi, raising suspicions why he was included in it.
 Contacted for comment, Mizzi said the allegations against him on the hospitals concession are purely speculative and just conjecture.
 “Contrary to the insinuations, I have never received any payments or committed any wrongdoing. Any claims to the contrary are utterly baseless. No payments were ever received from Ikons. Any attempt to link me with the concession through Ikons is also preposterous,” Mizzi said.
 The ex-minister said that to date, he has only received partial disclosure of the documentation pertaining to the inquiry into the hospitals deal.
 “I now await for further disclosure and look forward to disproving any allegations in court through a rigorous and fact-based process. Further clarity on unfounded allegations will emerge from the judicial process. Until then any rampant speculation does harm to this process,” Mizzi said.
  Schembri’s Whatsapp groups
 The “private relationship” between Malta’s politicians and Accutor is best exemplified in six Whatsapp groups which included Accutor’s owner Wasay Bhatti and Schembri, investigators said.
 In these chats, Schembri and Bhatti discussed foreign investment projects linked to the Accutor company.
 Schembri is believed to have used the ‘political support fund’ payments Accutor received from Steward to develop his business relationship with Bhatti.
 Contacted for comment, Schembri said he had been an easy target for years.
 “These are all lies and presumptions. I deny ever receiving any money from any person mentioned in the inquiry. I hope our justice system will eventually kick off as I still believe that eventually all these devious allegations will get quashed,” Schembri said.
  ‘€18 million earmarked for politicians’ 
 Former Accutor director Kamal Sharma is claiming millions were earmarked for Muscat, Schembri and Mizzi.
 Sharma, a former Accutor director, alleged Vitals consultant Shaukat Ali told him Muscat, Mizzi and Schembri were “partners” in the hospitals deal, and were set to receive €18 million from it.
 
 Ali, a figure who appears to have made millions from the deal, allegedly told Sharma that he was paying the ex-prime minister €15,000 monthly.
 Former partners raise red flags on man behind Joseph Muscat payments
 Investigators said that while Sharma’s testimony was “credible”, they were unable to corroborate the claims as much of the money Ali extracted from Vitals flowed to secrecy jurisdictions like Dubai, Switzerland and Tunisia.
 This, the investigators said, meant they were unable to ascertain the onward flows of these funds and who were the ultimate beneficiaries.
 Contacted for comment, Ali said all the allegations are absolutely baseless and unfounded, and stem from untrustworthy, unreliable and unstable people and sources, whose facts are based on suppositions, lies and fabrications.
 “I will not further comment on this matter as I understand that this matter is pending before the courts of Malta and that I will potentially be charged with matters concerning the allegations mentioned by you in your questions.
 “I feel we have become the victims of a political football and the subject of vile allegations made by mendacious people… I have faith that the truth will be known in court and justice will prevail,” Ali said.
 Sharma told Times of Malta in 2021 that he and his business partner Tyrone Greenshields resigned as Accutor directors after growing increasingly suspicious about the company’s activities.
 In the summer of 2019, the pair say concerned Accutor employees in Malta and elsewhere brought details about many large payments made into and out of Accutor AG between 2017 and 2019.
 These transactions, they say, had not been recorded in the customer relationship management system and records were missing from the usual shared file folders that they accessed regularly.
 The transactions involved parties and sums that neither of the two directors say they knew about.
 They further say Accutor employees had been instructed not to inform them about these transactions, details of which they say were also withheld from reports prepared for the two directors.
 Upon investigating the transactions, Sharma and Greenshields confronted Bhatti about the payments as well as two other Accutor officers, who were authorised to process transactions.
 “They had no reasonable explanations for the concerning financial activities and it was clear that, in their minds, neither Tyrone nor I were supposed to know about these transactions”, the two former directors had told Times of Malta.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/revealed-steward-funded-smear-campaign-chris-fearne.1094706,"A campaign to smear former health minister Chris Fearne with “fake” corruption claims was funded by Steward Health Care, leaked corporate records show. 
 The campaign against Fearne was part of a wider €6.5 million secret operation authorised by Steward to target their perceived opponents in Malta and abroad. 
 Practices included using bank records, accessing sensitive phone data, and planting “fake” media stories about corruption among Maltese officials. 
 The operations were coordinated by senior Steward officials who corresponded regularly with private spies at two London-based intelligence firms called Audere International and CT Group, according to emails, encrypted messages, and financial records. 
 The records were obtained by OCCRP and shared with Times of Malta and the  Boston Globe. 
 Leaked files show how Steward allocated some of the costs for these operations to its budget for running the St Luke’s, Karin Grech and Gozo hospitals. 
 Fearne, who is facing fraud charges in connection with the annulled Steward deal, appears to have been one of the key targets of the Malta operation. 
 
 The ex-health minister and his former chief of staff Carmen Ciantar last year slammed the unknown “dark forces” behind the “fake claims,” which included allegations of an illicit €3.2 million payment. 
  Fearne and Ciantar have urged the police to uncover who was behind the claims. 
 Speaking to reporters, Fearne said the alleged disinformation campaign against him was an “attack on the very integrity and wellbeing of the Maltese State.”
 “If confirmed it would not be coincidental that this disgusting act was carried out at a time when I was rigorously insisting on Steward fulfilling their contractual obligations,” Fearne said, adding that when the allegations emerged last year, he had asked Maltese police to investigate the ""fake documents"".
 Asked for comment on whether police had indeed investigated the claims against Fearne and Ciantar, a Maltese police spokesperson said: “following police investigations, no evidence was found about the alleged matter that could lead to a criminal prosecution.”
 Although Fearne initially backed Steward taking over the contract from Vitals Global Healthcare in February 2018, the relationship appears to have soured thereafter. 
 That same year, Steward Malta CEO Armin Ernst hit out at Fearne when payments under the government contract were held up. 
 “I am truly getting exasperated,” Ernst wrote to Fearne in October 2018. 
 “It is not possible to run the operations of an organization when … revenue transfer from GoM [Government of Malta] become a matter of guess work of what, when and how much will be received. Is there anything else going on I should know about????,” Ernst said in the e-mail. 
  A minute later, Ernst forwarded the e-mail with the words: “Just as an FYI...” to Keith Schembri, chief of staff to former prime minister Joseph Muscat. 
 An investigation by the Auditor General found Schembri and ex-health minister Konrad Mizzi frequently dealt with Steward behind Fearne’s back. 
  By 2021, senior Steward staff contemplated suing Fearne and Malta’s government in the US, where they planned to allege extortion and solicitation of bribes, a leaked email shows. 
 “This is NOT an idle threat,” wrote Steward senior executive Mark Rich in an email to its Maltese lawyers in May 2021. “We are literally prepared to drop a case in US Federal Court naming Fearne and others as bad players… just launching the case will put [Malta’s government] in the penalty box.”
 No lawsuit followed, however, Ernst appeared to have kept tabs on Fearne, and operations codenamed 'Project Albacore' and 'Project Bluefin' were launched, e-mails and documents show. 
  In a December 2021 e-mail, Ernst flagged a media report claiming irregularities linked to the Foundation for Medical Services, which fell under Fearne and Ciantar’s remit. 
 “Attached a report just published that for first time hints at some significant irregularity within Chris Fearne’s realm.
 “There have always been rumors of a romantic relationship between him and Carmen Ciantar,” Ernst wrote in the e-mail. 
 That same month, Steward directed its law firm, Quinn Emanuel, to hire CT Group, an intelligence firm whose staff includes the UK government’s former counter-terrorism chief. 
 In July 2022, CT Group pledged to “deploy into the public domain information about the main opponent of the Client’s concession in Malta” in a commercial proposal obtained by OCCRP. The aim was to identify “improper” behaviour and leak it anonymously to Maltese media.
 CT Group declined to reveal the identity of the “main opponent” when asked by reporters.
  But later that year, CT Group passed on what it said was a bank wire transfer record showing €3.2 million moving to an account held by Carmen Ciantar’s daughter.
 The payment, dated November 2019, was purportedly sent by a former business partner of Igor Levitin, a longstanding advisor to Russian president Vladimir Putin.
 An internal document titled 'Malta: Abuse of Passport Scheme' alleged that Fearne used his ministerial position to lobby to issue a Maltese passport to Levitin’s brother as part of a quid pro quo for the payment.
  Data embedded in the document suggests it was authored by CT Groups’ former director Will Crawford. 
 In October 2022, Ernst sent the bank transfer record and the document alleging abuse in the passport scheme to Steward's UK law firm, Quinn Emanuel. 
  Lawyers for Audere denied that their client had engaged in unlawful conduct, but declined to respond to detailed allegations and questions, citing confidentiality. They said Audere “takes its legal and regulatory compliance obligations seriously and acts in accordance with the same.” 
 CT Group said it is “committed to and complies with all laws and regulations in all jurisdictions in which it works.” It added, “Your email contains serious false allegations,” although it did not dispute specific allegations or respond directly to reporters’ questions. 
 Six months after Ernst passed on the details about the alleged wire transfer, the records and briefing document prepared by Crawford were shared with Matthew Caruana Galizia, the director of the Daphne Caruana Galizia Foundation, via an intermediary.  
  Caruana Galizia contacted the Austrian bank named in the record and the former business partner of Levitin, who purportedly sent the funds. Both said it was a forgery. 
 Sources told Times of Malta that an investigation into the claims by local authorities was unable to uncover any proof to substantiate the purported €3.2 million transfer.  
 Alex Cobham, chief executive of the UK-based NGO Tax Justice Network, called the document a “clumsy and inexpert” fake.
 “While the document claims to relate to a transfer made on 22 November 2019, the SWIFT code (specifically, the message input reference) indicates a transfer made on 22 February 2018.”
 The bank transfer record eventually surfaced last summer on websites elsewhere, including in Ukraine, where it was subsequently picked up by the media in Malta. 
  It is unclear whether CT Group, Steward, or Quinn Emanuel were aware the document was fake.
 Leaked files show how Steward allocated costs for its spy operations to its Malta budget, which was primarily funded by taxpayers under the €90-million-euro per year hospitals contract.
 Soon after CT Group began investigating Fearne for Steward in early 2022, the UK spy firm billed £207,000 (€244,000) to the US company’s Maltese subsidiary, Steward Malta Management Limited, an invoice shows. 
  That company’s leaked bank statements for previous years and an internal budget approved by Steward’s board in February 2023 show that the subsidiary’s main source of income was the Maltese government. 
 The records also showed how bills from CT Group and Audere totalling $2.9 million (€2.7 million) for 2022 had been “allocated to Steward International (via Malta).” A further $1 million (€900,000) “place holder” was budgeted “via Malta” for upcoming intelligence work in 2023. 
 Under instruction from Steward’s general counsel Herb Holtz, Steward initially paid Audere’s bills from its US headquarters, then charged costs back to Malta, financial records show.
 In May 2022, Steward’s senior executives met in Dallas to discuss what are called “intercompany charges”, costs incurred by one subsidiary later reallocated to another for accounting purposes, including Audere, fees of more than $700,000 (€652,000) for intelligence fees paid for by US-based Steward Healthcare LLC.
 But a budget for Steward’s international division approved by its board the following February shows how those Audere fees had been reimbursed ""via Malta"".
 Ciantar whose daughter was named on the ""fake"" record, described the experience as “devastating, both professionally and personally.”
 “You can imagine the horrible sensation of facing these heinous public lies without knowing who is behind them,” she told reporters. 
  CT Group told OCCRP that allegations it handled fabricated documents were “false” and said it “is confident the intelligence sourced is [sic] this project is genuine and accurate"".
 Quinn Emanuel said the firm “has no knowledge of – and certainly played no role in – any of the alleged activities you describe” and declined to comment further, citing attorney/client privilege. 
 Steward Health Care did not respond to a request for comment about Fearne.
 Fearne was not the only person of interest to Steward. 
 Documents show the company enlisted Audere to find information on its own staff. 
 An internal report dated April 2023 included compromising personal information extracted from the company device of a former senior employee Steward worried might leak information to its auditor. 
 Identifying the employee by the codename 'Pudding', the report alleged that he had solicited a sex worker, a possible criminal offence, the report noted. The report’s author was an Audere director, its metadata reveals.
 Separate leaked correspondence from earlier that year shows how a compromising photo of the employee, who is not being named owing to the personal nature of the information Audere compiled about him, was shared with Audere’s founder Charles Blackmore, after he requested a photo of “Pudding”.
  In other correspondence outlining a possible approach to the employee by an “agent,” Blackmore discussed putting the plan to “Herb” - an apparent reference to Holtz. Other correspondence from Audere staff shows that “HH” had engaged the intelligence firm.
 Steward's probe of the employee appears to have been prompted by concerns he might leak damaging information about a possible several hundred million dollars hole in the company's budget to Crowe, an external auditor for a real estate deal Steward was involved in.
 Audere said when contacted that the “false” allegations were “of the most serious kind that could be levelled against an investigations firm and industry professionals. 
 Another target of the operations was British businessman Fraser Perring. 
 Perring’s company, Viceroy Research, makes money by “short selling” stocks — betting that the share prices of other companies will go down, and then publishing negative information which further depresses the prices. 
 Viceroy had just released an investigation into Steward’s relationship with Medical Properties Trust, its biggest stakeholder, alleging Steward had fraudulently overvalued its Colombian assets by around €46 million in a sale to Medical Properties Trust.
 Steward appears to have enlisted Audere to keep tabs on Perring soon after. 
 The assignment was led by Monika Rihma, an Audere director Blackmore described in leaked communications as being “closest” to Steward’s general counsel, Herb Holtz.
 Holtz did not respond to question, and Steward did not respond directly to questions on the intelligence work.
 However, in a comment to the Boston Globe, Steward said, “While general counsel and as a private lawyer since then, Holtz has neither recommended nor sanctioned any illegal or unethical activity.”
 Lawyers for Audere, Blackmore, and Rihma called the allegations “false” and “seriously defamatory” but declined to dispute specific claims, citing confidentiality. 
 Perring told reporters he started to notice strange disturbances at home: his CCTV system stopped working, and he came home to unexpectedly find his door unlocked and computer open. He filed incident reports with the police, though no further action was taken. 
 A surveillance report reveals how a five-man team of security professionals staked out Perring’s home in rural England over six days in March 2023, shortly after Viceroy published its investigation into Steward.
 The report was authored by Greyprism, a security company founded by two veterans former members of the UK’s Special Forces. It documented the location of entrances, exits, and CCTV cameras at Perring’s property, and revealed that a tracker was placed on his car. 
 Greyprism’s report doesn’t disclose who its client was but leaked documents show that the report was in the possession of Audere, which had been working for Steward for more than five years on assignments connected to the Malta hospital deal. 
  An account called viceroyleaks soon appeared on Twitter (since renamed X) and began posting negative slurs about Perring and Viceroy’s research. “This account's sole purpose is to expose #fraud, #scam and #insidertrading of Fraser Perring and Viceroy … YOU WON'T GET AWAY WITH IT!,” the account posted on March 8, 2023.
 Perring later reported the viceroyleaks account to police, who recorded a crime of malicious communications. 
 Leaked correspondence shows how Audere’s Blackmore screened the website’s account’s posts before they went out. In one, Blackmore said he had sent the contemplated post to “HH” for review — an apparent reference to Herb Holtz. 
 Documents handled by Audere detailed other confidential personal information about Perring.
 The information included Perring’s HSBC bank account number and balance, transactions going back over the previous five years —  including from his Swiss private banker — and the numbers, times, lengths, and costs of his recent phone calls. 
 It is unclear how the confidential information was obtained, but Perring told OCCRP that the information was “100 per cent accurate” and that he had never kept records of the information or shared his login details. 
 A document detailing the information also recommended “researching” Perring’s banker’s account which “may prove advantageous in the likelihood it is being deployed as a conduit for VICEROY or other entities.”
  Lawyers for Audere, Blackmore, and Rihma called the allegations “false” and “seriously defamatory” but declined to dispute specific claims, citing confidentiality. 
 A lawyer for Greyprism said its client “acts in accordance with the law” and “would not, and has not, acted in the manner alleged and in breach of its legal obligations.”
 Citing confidentiality, data protection, and legal privilege, the lawyer said Greyprism could not discuss specific cases, but said the company “does not conduct unlawful physical or technical surveillance.”

https://timesofmalta.com/article/health-ministry-extends-urgent-emergency-deadline-third-time.1096110,"The health ministry has extended its urgent call for private operators to provide emergency health services for the third time, as private hospitals continue to seek clarifications.  
 St Thomas Hospital, St James Capua and Da Vinci Health have all expressed an interest in responding to the call first issued on July 12. 
 They were originally given just eight days to apply, as the health ministry battled to solve overcrowding and waiting times of up to 12 hours at Mater Dei’s emergency department.  
 The call will now run into its fourth week, with a deadline that has been extended three times and is now set to close on August 7. 
 A spokesperson for St Thomas told Times of Malta they intend to submit a proposal but some points “remain unclear”.   
 These include forecast patient volumes and other operational details. 
 Da Vinci confirmed they too intend to participate provided “the referrals are based on the services they can offer.”   
 St. Anne’s Clinic ruled out participating altogether.   
 “While we work with government closely on other PPPs, St Anne’s cannot help with an emergency room on the scale the government requires.” 
 Earlier this month, St James Capua showed interest in the proposal. Its chairman Josie Muscat affirmed his hospital’s capability to meet the government requirements.
 Over the past four weeks, private healthcare operators have been seeking clarifications to the original request for proposals, independently from each other.
 Successful bidders had to prepare their facilities to enter service within four weeks of signing the contract.   
 Asked whether St Thomas would have to employ additional personnel, a spokesperson said, “this depends on the daily number of patients expected to require assistance [and] the matter is being discussed with the authorities.” 
 “Our facilities are already well-equipped to handle emergency cases, but we are assessing whether minor upgrades or modifications are needed  to accommodate the specific requirements,” he added.
 Da Vinci said that to provide the services requested, they would need to employ more doctors, nurses and security officers but the facilities they currently have do not require major alterations.  
 It criticised the design of the request for proposals as “restrictive like a one-size-fits-all”, highlighting that not all private healthcare facilities have the same capabilities and strengths. 
 Private operators have been asked to provide services that include the treatment of uncomplicated head injuries, wounds requiring suturing, chest infections, urinary and skin infections, stable abdominal pains and gastroenteritis. 
 The health ministry has offered a fee structure that ranges from €30 per GP consultation to €200 per 24-hour in-patient stay.
 St Thomas Hospital believes this is “generally fair and reflective of the services outlined.” 
 “However, we are reviewing the details to ensure it aligns with the operational costs and the level of care we aim to provide.""
 Da Vinci said it considers the fees “acceptable, but others are inadequate and do not address the potential additional expenses that often need to be incurred.” 
 St Thomas anticipates it will be able to provide the required services within a few weeks after receiving the final go-ahead. 
 St Thomas is situated in Qormi but runs a sister facility – the Good Samaritan Hospital – in St Paul’s Bay.  Da Vinci Health runs a facility in Birkirkara. 
 Ministry sources had previously told Times of Malta that there are four or five operators capable of providing the services required. 
 Health minister Minister Jo Etienne Abela said on Saturday that outsourcing care “was not crisis management.”

https://timesofmalta.com/article/today-front-pages-july-27-2024.1095952,"The following are the top stories in Malta's newspapers on Saturday.
 Times of Malta leads with news that Edward Scicluna has officially been axed from the financial regulator’s board of governors.
 The newspaper also reports that France's high-speed rail network was hit by arson attacks that disrupted travel for hundreds of thousands of passengers on Friday, just hours before the opening ceremony of the Paris Olympics.
 The Malta Independent reports that Steward boss Ralph de la Torre has been summoned to a bi-partisan senate hearing as part of a probe into the collapse of its United States division.
 It also reports that the European Central Bank has continued to refuse to comment on the legal proceedings which involve Scicluna.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/watch-free-menstrual-products-given-three-girls-schools.1098643,"A pilot project to provide secondary schoolgirls with free menstrual products kicked off on Friday, intending to eliminate the stigma surrounding menstrual hygiene from a young age. 
 The Menstruation Pilot Project will involve around 900 secondary schoolgirls hailing from Gozo College Middle School, Mosta's Maria Regina College Secondary and Birkirkara’s St Monica Secondary School.
 Students will no longer have to whisper, usually in shame, to their friends to ask if they have an extra pad or tampon, but now will have dispenser machines at school providing the products for free.
 The dispensers provide two types of pads, for different menstrual flows and one type of tampon. The products chosen were the most preferred by students, according to an initial study for the project.
 The dispensers will have two distribution methods tested. An automatic dispenser, that works by simply pressing a button, and tokenised dispensers, where students will need a dongle.
 Both methods will provide pads and tampons, and there is no capping on how many products students can take. 
 The number of dispensers per school was determined based on the student population. 
  Katrina Delia said she is happy her school, St Monica Secondary, is part of the initiative to end the stigma associated with periods. 
 “It’s not the first time one of us might have forgotten a pad or a tampon at home, or even someone just got their period at school. Now it is comfortable to know I can just grab a pad whenever I need one,” the 15-year-old told Times of Malta.
 She said there is still a stigma on menstrual hygiene, and it can still be a hushed topic among friends. 
 “This is something that women and girls experience, and something normal and we should break the stigma down.”
 Another student, 14-year-old Michela Camilleri, said she knew many young students who see periods as “disgusting”.
 “This scheme will show that periods are natural and perfectly normal,” she said. 
  The pilot project to provide free menstrual products in schools was included in the Labour Party’s electoral manifesto. A budget of €500,000 was allocated to the project.
 The distribution of free menstrual products in all state, church and private schools is planned to begin in the next academic year (2025/2026) and the pilot project will provide the necessary feedback before the implementation of the full-scale project. 
 Speaking during the launch and unveiling of the dispenser machines, Parliamentary Secretary Rebecca Buttigieg said the project’s goal is to reduce the stigma surrounding a “natural process” every woman experiences. 
 She said it is also a way to reduce the absenteeism of female students who fail to go to school during their period and to ease the financial burden of families to purchase these essential products. 
  Buttigieg explained the initial phase of the project included a study to assess the costs of the menstrual products available in Malta and to see the experience of other countries that have adopted similar projects. 
 Several countries have introduced schemes providing access to free menstrual products in schools. The University of Malta took a similar step last year when its students’ council introduced a free menstrual product dispenser at its Msida campus. The locker was broken into by thieves a  month later.
 The government is also discussing the possibility of reducing VAT on these products. Currently, VAT on menstrual products stands at 18%. 
 To address the stigma surrounding menstruation, several initiatives will be launched in schools, including awareness-raising campaigns.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/second-mpox-case-detected-first-case-found-less-severe-strain.1097564,"A second case of the mpox disease has been detected in Malta, while a case found last week has been confirmed as being of a less severe strain, the Health Ministry said.
 It said the second case involved a Maltese resident who was exposed to the disease through sexual activity in Malta.
 ""The individual is currently clinically stable and does not require hospital admission. The patient has been isolated and contact tracing efforts are underway to prevent further transmission. Further testing is being carried out to identify the specific clade of the mpox virus of this case,"" the ministry said on Tuesday. 
 It also explained that the mpox case reported last week, had been identified as clade II, which is less severe than clade I.  
 Mpox, formerly known as Monkeypox, is caused by a virus, which has two distinct clades: Clade I and Clade II.
 Clade I is predominantly found in Central Africa and is known for causing more severe illness and higher mortality rates.  Due to its severity, the World Health Organisation last month declared Clade I a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). 
 Clade II is less severe and has a significantly lower mortality rate. Clade II is responsible for the ongoing global outbreak that began in 2022, spreading primarily through human-to-human sexual transmission. In Malta, 35 cases were investigated in relation to this global outbreak up to 2023.
 ""The current case in Malta falls under this clade and is the first case being reported for 2024,"" the ministry said.   
 Last week, the ministry said the patient was clinically stable and did not require hospital admission, although isolation was ordered. The disease was contracted by sexual transmission and was considered an imported case.  
 
 Malta first detected earlier strains of mpox in 2022, with the first case reported in May when the patient returned from a country where several cases of the virus had been detected. 
 By August of that year, the number of cases had shot up to 31, with Malta registering the fifth-highest incidence rate of mpox in Europe at the time. 
 Later the government made a vaccine available to primary contacts of mpox patients free of charge.
 Mpox spreads between people mainly through close physical contact with someone who has the virus.
 Close contact includes skin-to-skin (such as touching or sex) and mouth-to-mouth, or mouth-to-skin contact.
 It can also include ""being face-to-face with someone who has mpox (such as talking or breathing close to one another, which can generate infectious respiratory particles)"".
 How to stay safe:
 The Health Authorities urged the public to adhere to the following preventive measures to curb the spread of the virus:
 1.     Safe Sex: Practice safe sex and have open conversations with partners about sexual health.
 2.     Avoid close contact: Refrain from close, skin-to-skin contact with individuals who have a rash resembling Mpox.
 3.     Hygiene practices: Maintain good hand hygiene by washing hands frequently with soap and water or using an alcohol-based hand sanitiser.
 4.     Safe practices: Be cautious during social gatherings and intimate contact. Avoid sharing personal items such as towels, bedding, and clothing with infected individuals.
 5.     Seek medical advice if you experience symptoms or have been in contact with someone diagnosed with mpox.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/miss-malta-hopeful-told-anorexia-kill-year.1098385,"A Miss Malta hopeful has opened up about how she was told anorexia would kill her within a year and why taking part in beauty pageants has given her the confidence to speak out about her eating disorder.
 Edera Fenech, 22, who is representing Mosta in the contest, said she was diagnosed with anorexia just over a year ago, with a devastating prognosis that changed her attitude.
 “I felt I had no choice but to recover,” she told Times of Malta. 
 
 “I was spending four to five hours at the gym and eating almost nothing – maybe a can of tuna, or nothing at all.”
 The young woman described how she struggled to recover.
 “Putting on weight was harder than I thought,” she admitted. “But now, I can call myself a warrior.”
 In recent weeks Edera shared her progress on social media, saying she wanted to use her Miss Malta platform to help others.
 She posted photos of herself when she was in hospital while heavily suffering from the disorder, which is characterised by an intense fear of gaining weight. 
 “I’m standing here to be an inspiration and the voice to help others with the same disorder since we need more awareness,” she said.
 Her aim is to encourage others that it “is possible to feel better”.
 The illness gives sufferers a distorted view of their own body image but Fenech believes taking part in beauty pageants has helped with her recovery.
  “Pageantry empowered me. It gave me the courage to take up space and cement myself in society,” Edera said, adding that the most important thing pageants have taught her is to be a leader.
 She is keen to break the negative stereotypes surrounding beauty pageants, such as Miss Malta, one of the oldest such contests in the country.
 “It’s a lot more than just looking beautiful and parading the stage,” she said.
 Fenech also wants to highlight the misconceptions surrounding anorexia, particularly the belief that it is solely a “woman’s illness” or an issue of vanity.
  “It makes me feel disappointed and frustrated at the same time. Everyone can get this kind of disorder and it’s not a matter of attention but a matter of self-awareness,” she explained.
 She urged anyone struggling with eating disorders to seek help as early as possible and encouraged people to reach out to Dar Kenn għal-Saħħtek, the Centre for the Treatment of Obesity and Eating Disorders.
 Fenech remains grateful for the support she received from her family and her partner.
 “If it wasn’t for them, I’d have never been able to get over it. I wouldn’t be here without them,” she said.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/no-police-reports-rumours-butcher-selling-cats-dogs-sausage-meat.1094305,"Updated 7.10pm with health ministry response
 A health inspection has found ""no evidence"" that a Gozitan butcher turned sick cats and dogs into sausage meat and sold them on to unsuspecting customers. 
 In a statement after the rumours about the butcher went viral, the health ministry said there were no cases of foodborne illness linked to the man.
 The rumours spread like wildfire on Friday, causing panic and disgust in equal measure. They claimed that several people had fallen sick over the weekend after eating sausages from the butcher, with health inspectors allegedly later uncovering evidence of the misdeed during an inspection.
 But police, health and government sources who spoke to Times of Malta said that although they heard the rumours in recent weeks, there is no evidence to indicate they are true.
 In a statement late on Friday evening, the health ministry said officials within the Environmental Health Directorate had carried out inspections at the alleged butcher outlets but found they were not in operation.
 A team made up of Police, the Veterinary Services Directorate and the Environmental Health Directorate then carried out an inspection on Friday afternoon at various sites in Gozo in relation to the alleged butcher.
 ""No evidence or equipment related to the production of Maltese type sausage was found,"" the ministry said. 
 ""No cases of foodborne illness were reported to the health authorities which were linked to the alleged butcher.""
 A police spokesperson told Times of Malta that they were first alerted to the rumours over a week ago but had not received any reports over the matter.
 Times of Malta has chosen not to name the butcher in question at this stage.
 But members of the butcher’s family who spoke to Times of Malta strongly denied the rumours, describing them as “malicious falsehoods”.
 “This is absolutely untrue. All our family spent our lives around animals and loves animals, so we would never do anything like this,” they said.
 They confirmed that the rumours have been circulating for several weeks, but say they have no idea how or why they started. What’s more, they say, the shop is no longer operational.
 “The butcher shop has been shut for over a decade, so how could we have done the things they are talking about?”
 Attempts to contact the butcher himself were unsuccessful, while calls to the butcher’s landline number indicate that the number no longer exists.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/zebbug-local-council-serve-christmas-lunch-lonely.1101941,"The Żebbuġ local council is organising a Christmas Day lunch for those who will be alone on Christmas Day.
 “We want to organise a community safe space for people who would usually be alone on Christmas Day,” Żebbuġ mayor Steve Zammit Lupi said.
 “We talk a lot about loneliness and mental health, but during this month we can get carried away with Christmas decorations and forget about the community spirit.”
 Following discussions with other members of the council, Zammit Lupi approached the parish priest who offered one of the parish’s centres for Christmas Day. Food will be prepared by Rafel Sammut, head chef of Briju restaurant.
 “I will be volunteering on the day, and other individuals have already reached out to volunteer during the lunch,” he said, adding no pictures or footage will be taken during the lunch to respect the privacy of the guests.
 According to Zammit Lupi, this is the first time the council is organising a Christmas Day lunch. Every year the council organises festive events for residents.
 He said while the invitation is open to everyone, it is mainly directed at Żebbuġ residents.
  When asked if loneliness was prevalent in the locality, he said while no one had told him they felt alone, he is aware some residents do suffer from loneliness.
 “I hope other local councils will be encouraged to do something similar and help their residents on Christmas Day,” he said.
 Anyone in need of more information about the lunch can call the council on 2146 8181
 The council’s initiative to bring the community together and ensure no one is left alone at Christmas is similar to the Curia’s annual traditional Christmas lunch organised for needy and lonely people.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/exposed-millions-moved-hospitals-deal.1093037,"A catering company suspected to be involved in a 10% kickback scheme. A medical equipment supplier with hidden owners. A secret shareholder who received monthly €100,000 consultancy payments.
 Investigators who combed through the deal to privatise three state hospitals found signs of crime wherever they looked.
 
 Wire transfers were layered. Consultancies flourished. Incoming cash was used to pay former investors – behaviour more commonly associated with Ponzi schemes. 
 The entire deal seemed designed to divert public money into private pockets.
 And investigators believe it was done with the help of Joseph Muscat and his chief enablers, Keith Schembri and  Konrad Mizzi, who shielded the concession from scrutiny and ignored reports of criminal activity, while they privately fostered personal relationships with key actors.
 The bigger plan
 Investigators believe Vitals – and later Steward – stakeholders had no intention of running Maltese hospitals for the 30-year lease period they agreed to. The real aim, they say, was to quickly find a higher bidder to sell the concession to.
 There was massive money to be made: the 30-year deal has been conservatively valued at €4 billion, and a 2017 study by PwC calculated it would generate €2.2 billion just through medical tourism.
 Selling a business is not a crime. But prosecutors suspect key players involved in the deal did a great deal more than that. According to calculations made by Vitals’ own financial chief, around €26 million was stolen in just the first two years of the 30-year deal.
 Companies that provided services to the hospitals – from cleaning to catering, IT to engineering – were allegedly required to fork out a 10% kickback in exchange for that business.
 Individuals suspected of having a hidden interest in the deal were given massive consultancy contracts, or deals guaranteeing them one-off success fees and settlement payments. 
 And Maltese government money intended for the hospitals was secretly used to purchase companies that were then given hugely lucrative deals by the hospitals, investigators believe.
 The Vitals concession
 Investigators were tasked with parsing the now-cancelled hospitals deal to identify patterns of suspected criminal behaviour.
 It was a difficult task, given the complex web of companies and contracts investors used to structure the concession. And the job was made even more difficult because many of the companies involved were based in secrecy jurisdictions like Dubai and Switzerland, which do not share company or tax information.
 Vitals and Steward received hundreds of millions of euros through the concession between 2016 and 2023, when a civil court annulled the entire deal on the basis of fraud.
 That money was intended to be used to run Karin Grech, St Luke’s and Gozo General hospitals. The investors were also contractually bound to invest millions to revamp those facilities – work they never did. 
  Throughout the concession period, money moved through multiple companies, in different countries, using a network of lawyers, auditors and accountants. In some cases, money sent to some people appears to have then been forwarded to others.
 Practically all the companies involved stopped filing audited accounts from the moment they were involved in the hospitals concession, making it easier to obscure money flows.
 How much money vanished?
 Given the elaborate way in which money was extracted from the concession and moved, it is hard to quantify the total amount of money that investigators believe was misappropriated in all.
 What is clear is that it runs into millions. Vitals’ own financial controller, Saba Abbas, calculated that around €26 million was misappropriated between June 2016 and November 2017 – more than half of all the money Vitals received from the government by that point.
 That €26 million calculation does not include millions more paid to key players through deals structured as consultancy payments or success fees.
 Investigators’ work has led to prosecutors filing criminal charges against dozens of people involved in the deal, including Muscat, Schembri and Mizzi, Ali and other Vitals and Steward shareholders, managers, lawyers, accountants and civil servants.
  All those alleged to have taken money have insisted they are innocent of charges. Muscat has called the investigation a “political vendetta”.
 “The institutions are working – working against Labourites,” he said last month.
 Mizzi has called the charges he faces based on “pure conjecture” and said he received no money through the deal.
 Schembri described the prosecution as “lies and presumptions” and also denied “ever receiving any money from any person mentioned in the inquiry [into the hospitals concession”.
 Steward has argued that it was the one defrauded, saying it was duped into taking over from Vitals on the back of false promises by the Muscat-led government.
 Money flowed in two main directions.
 Huge amounts moved to companies linked to, or controlled by, Shaukat Ali Chaudhry or his family, lending credence to investigators’ suspicions that the Pakistani businessman was the secret owner of Vitals.
 Money also moved from Vitals to another group of Ali-linked companies in Switzerland. These companies also disbursed money to Ali and his associates. But they also paid others linked to the deal, like Joseph Muscat, and served as the vehicle for a “political support fund” that Steward established.
 Cash injections from the Maltese government generally triggered a flurry of financial activity. Vitals habitually made seven- and eight-figure payments to its parent company Bluestone within days of receiving Maltese taxpayers’ money.
 In all, over €21 million was transferred from Vitals to Bluestone between 2016 and the first two months of 2018.
  A 2023 Times of Malta  investigation shed light on some of the things that money bought: luxury hotel stays, cars, private school tuition and even Netflix subscriptions. Vitals director Ram Tumuluri said that money came from “investor sources”, not Maltese concession funds.
 Bluestone would also make payments of its own. In one case, it sent a company called Mount Everest a €3 million ‘success fee’ for having won the Malta deal. Mount Everest is linked to Shaukat Ali Chaudry, a Pakistani businessman who was based in Gaddafi’s Libya before shifting focus to Malta after the Libyan dictator was killed.
 Ali has also denied any wrongdoing, telling  Times of Malta he was never a Vitals shareholder and that claims to the contrary come from “untrustworthy, unreliable and unstable people and sources”.
 1. How the money flowed: Consultancies
 Ali was not a Vitals shareholder – at least not on paper. But he was the single largest beneficiary of the hospitals deal. His companies, sons and wives received millions from Vitals and companies linked to it, while other companies linked to him sent money to others involved in the deal, including Joseph Muscat.
 Consultancy work can be legitimate. But it is also a known method for laundering money and masking illicit payments, as the value of consultancy work is subjective.
 Vitals and Steward paid some eye-watering figures for nebulous consultancy work.
 Ali was engaged as a ‘senior consultant’ on a €100,000-a-month deal. One company linked to him, STE Health, got a €400,000-a-month consultancy deal with Vitals. Another Ali-controlled firm, Global Asset Holdings, charged Vitals €340,000 over 14 months. In theory, that money was to provide a ‘procurement consultant’. Investigators found nothing to justify that expense.
 The money flows continued when Steward Health Care bought out Vitals, investigators concluded.
 Eurasia, owned by one of Ali’s sons, charged Steward €400,000 to carry out ‘global healthcare feasibility studies’ to run hospitals in Ghana and Macedonia. Steward also paid yet another Ali-linked company an €80,000-a-month fee for consultancy work, investigators found.
 Consultancy also looms large in this case with regard to another defendant facing criminal charges – Joseph Muscat.
 Muscat received four payments of €15,000 each over a four-month period from an Ali-linked company, Accutor AG, shortly after he resigned as prime minister. The payments were flagged as suspicious by banks and stopped suddenly. The deal was meant to run for 36 months, for a total of €540,000. 
 Muscat says the money was for legitimate consultancy work that had nothing to do with the Maltese hospitals. Investigators believe the payments fit the modus operandi adopted by Ali and his business network and note that no evidence of Muscat’s work has been found.
 Just as Muscat started receiving payments, another man facing charges in connection with the deal, Konrad Mizzi, was also engaged as a consultant by a company linked to Accutor AG, Ikons Global.
 Mizzi says he never received any payments from Ikons and denies wrongdoing.
 Keith Schembri also had a relationship with the Accutor group. Unlike Muscat and Mizzi, his ties appeared to be longer-term: he was in extensive contact with Accutor chairman Wasay Bhatti about various international projects the group appeared to be planning, in places like Tunisia and the Philippines. 
 Other key figures, like Bluestone’s official owners Ram Tumuluri and Mark Pawley, also allegedly received millions, though investigators believe those two were essentially figureheads who were obliged to then pass money on to others.
 2. How the money flowed: Kickbacks
 More broadly, investigators believe that public money was also extracted from the concession through a network of kickback arrangements with Vitals’ various suppliers.
 Companies contracted to provide all sorts of services – from cleaning to construction, IT to medical procurement, catering to payroll – all seemed to have arrangements in place that allegedly required them to pay 10% backhanders to key players in the concession.
  There appeared to be a boilerplate structure for such arrangements, with a Tunisia-based company, Incorp, playing a major role.
 Incorp was established in 2009 with Ali’s two sons, Asad and Wajid, as its majority shareholders. In early 2017, just as Bank of Valletta asked Vitals for details about Incorp’s shareholders, the Ali brothers vanished from the company’s official structures. Yasar Zafar, a Tunisian involved in other Ali family companies, became Incorp’s sole shareholder.
 Contracts unearthed by investigators indicate construction, cleaning and catering companies hired by Vitals were to pay a 10% kickback on those contracts to Incorp.
 They estimate that the company received well over €1 million in such payments.
 3. How the money flowed: Procurement
 There was a third, more creative way in which the hospitals deal is alleged to have churned out money for its architects: by controlling hospital procurement. 
 One way it allegedly did that was relatively straightforward: it engaged a company owned by Ali’s sons, Eurasia, as the hospitals’ suppliers of IT equipment. Eurasia is the same company that charged Vitals €400,000 to carry out feasibility studies.
 Another method was far more complex.
 Investigators believe key players quietly bought two companies contracted to supply the hospitals, without using a cent of their own money.
 The first, Mtrace, was a medical equipment company developing an expensive cancer treatment device called a cyclotron.
 
 The second, Technoline, had a broader remit: that of exclusively supplying the three privatised hospitals with medicines and medical equipment.
 Prosecutors believe that in both cases, Maltese taxpayer funds were used to secretly buy the companies, on behalf of hidden shareholders that would then profit from the companies’ advantageous positions.
 Vitals spent €2.3 million of concession money on Mtrace and its cyclotron project. But the project went nowhere, the cyclotron languished unused for years, and Steward eventually pawned the company off to Malta Enterprise for €2 million.
 That suggests the concessionaire first used Maltese public money to secretly purchase Mtrace and fund cyclotron development, then charged Maltese taxpayers a second time to sell the company and failed cyclotron project back to them.
 Technoline cost more to purchase – roughly €5 million – and documents suggest that money came from a Jersey-based, Vitals-linked company in the form of a loan note.
 Literally weeks after Technoline came under new ownership, Vitals handed it a contract to act as the hospitals’ exclusive procurement partner. That meant all medical procurement had to go through the firm, rather than the open market.
 Technoline’s bottom line revved up 20% in its first year after the deal, then continued to see average year-on-year growth of 10%. A Steward-commissioned report calculated that the exclusivity deal led to €1.2 million in overpayments in just 10 months.
 Steward gradually wound back that deal, and Technoline’s parent company, Gateway Solutions, used its hefty annual dividends to rapidly pay back the loan that funded its purchase.
 On paper, the benefits of the lucrative deal flowed to the company’s stated owner, Ivan Vassallo. But investigators believe Vassallo was just a front for other, secret shareholders.
  The Muscat government’s role 
 Maltese government officials were aware that not all was well with the concession, documents indicate.
 In June 2016, before Vitals started operations, Muscat received an e-mail warning him about the company’s legitimacy. He forwarded that e-mail without comment to Schembri, who passed it on to Mizzi.
 Three weeks later, a private analysis group engaged by Malta Enterprise concluded that Vitals’ parent company did not have the experience or capital to manage the hospitals concession.
 The deal went ahead anyway.
 Schembri and Mizzi often exchanged e-mails with key players like Tumuluri on their private e-mail addresses. Schembri used six different e-mail addresses to discuss the deal – including one using the alias ‘Frank Pillow’.
 The Muscat-led government consistently pushed back financial deadlines to ensure Vitals and Steward were not deemed in default. Schembri knew from late 2017 that Vitals believed its own director, Tumuluri, had misappropriated millions of euro. Mizzi arranged for Steward to get a €100 million payment if it lost the hospitals deal.
 All those alleged to have profited from the hospitals concession deny wrongdoing, and say the charges they face are based on investigators misinterpreting or misrepresenting facts. Some of those, including Muscat, Schembri and Mizzi, will be arraigned in court next week. Vassallo, Sladden and Hillman will also be charged this week.
 Others, including Shaukat Ali, Armin Ernst, Ralph de la Torre,  Ram Tumuluri and Mark Pawley, are also expected to face charges.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/revised-plans-video-renders-reveal-malta-first-crematorium-look.1100359,"A funeral company that intends to set up Malta’s first crematorium has submitted revised plans for the facility and visual mock-ups of how it could look.
 The plans were submitted to the Planning Authority by Active Group, which owns Camilleri Funeral Directors.
 The facility will be built on land close to the Addolorata cemetery in Paola.
 The renders show a multi-level crematorium surrounded by tree-lined walkways. Building schematics on the PA website show it containing two columbariums – used for storing urns holding cremated remains – a viewing room and a multi-purpose hall.
 The schematics also show two underground reservoirs, a cold room, reception area, garage and store. The plans for the facility also show grass surroundings including a ‘cremation garden’.
  Active Group Ltd director Johann Camilleri told Times of Malta the plans had been redesigned to conform with PA guidelines for crematoriums rubber-stamped by the planning minister in September.
 He said the changes included reducing the area of the facility from around 700 square metres to 500 square metres and lowering the building’s height.
 Aesthetic changes have been made to reduce the visual impact and better blend with the environment, he said, pointing to alternative building materials and the use of the more “earthy colours” in the new designs.
 Earlier on Thursday, Luqa local council added its voice to that of Paola council, objecting to the plans and calling for an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) while raising concerns over air pollution.
  Responding to the concerns, Camilleri said an EIA was “in progress” and his company was “investing in state-of-the-art equipment with the lowest possible emissions found in the industry,” adding there was “no better alternative.”
 He stressed the distance of the facility to nearby residences was “well within required parameters.”
 Camilleri added that the video renders of the site were conceptual and for illustrative purposes only and not for direct interpretation.
 The new plans submitted to the PA are currently being reviewed, according to the funeral company’s Facebook post.
  The long-awaited guidelines limit cremation facilities to 7.7 metres in height and say they must use the best air-filtering technology on the market while meeting emission targets.
 Crematoriums cannot be built in sensitive areas such as agricultural land, scheduled sites or industrial zones and should be easily accessible.
 Constraints are also placed on the building layout, which should include a mortuary, viewing room, cremation chamber and post-cremation room. Cematoriums should also have a garden of remembrance with a columbarium.
  Malta legalised cremation in 2019, allowing for cremation services to be added to existing cemeteries, with Parliament approving the Cremation Act, legalising standalone crematoria, some three years later.
 While several applications for the development of standalone crematoria have been submitted to the PA since, progress towards building one has been slow due to planning and environmental concerns.
 Meanwhile, families who wanted to cremate their loved ones have been forced to turn to companies in Sicily or the UK – a service that can cost around €4,500.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/exposed-secret-plans-accutor-dividends-steward-joseph-muscat.1097482,"Updated 6.15pm with comments from Joseph Muscat
 A Swiss firm that paid Joseph Muscat as a ""consultant"" had a secret backdoor deal to receive 30% of Steward Health Care's dividends from its “fraudulent” hospitals deal. 
 It is the first time that details of the secret agreement have become known.
 A magisterial inquiry into the failed hospitals deal which led prosecutors to file charges against Muscat and dozens of others only mentions it in passing.
 The secret deal granted the Swiss-based Accutor participation rights in Steward’s Maltese operation – essentially a share of a company’s profits through dividends and earnings.
 Muscat’s government facilitated the transfer of a €4 billion public contract for Steward to run the St Luke’s, Karin Grech and Gozo hospitals in February 2018, after the previous concessionaries Vitals Global Healthcare crashed out.
 Armin Ernst, who led Steward Malta after having served as CEO of its predecessor Vitals, signed off on the secret profit-sharing deal with Swiss firm Accutor Consulting one year later, in April 2019. 
  E-mails obtained by OCCRP and shared with  Times of Malta indicate the profits were intended for Pakistani businessman Shaukat Ali, who had previously held a  hidden interest in Vitals Global Healthcare.
 Ali faces charges of forming a criminal organisation with Muscat, Accutor Consulting owner Wasay Bhatti and others in connection with the “fraudulent” award of the hospitals contract.
  E-mails indicate that the ""substantial debts"" Steward Malta faced meant no dividends were paid out prior to a court terminating the hospitals contract in 2023. 
 Steward Malta did however pay over €7 million to Accutor between 2018 and 2020 for ""political consultants"", ""jet expenses"", ""lobbying"" and ""payroll services"".
 Nine months after the secret profit-sharing agreement was signed, Muscat was put on a €15,000-per-month consultancy by Bhatti. 
 Muscat received four payments totalling €60,000 in payments, two of which came from Accutor Consulting, the same company that was a party to the agreement.
 Investigators suspect the consultancy contract was used as cover to pass on hospitals deal kickbacks to Muscat.
 The ex-prime minister, however, insists the consultancy contract has no connection to the Malta deal. 
 The profit-sharing agreement also gave Accutor Consulting 30% of the equity value if Steward Malta was sold.  
  In a November 2022 e-mail, Ali wrote that he would be open to receiving payments that would help “consolidate” his position via an “exit clause” of “100M,” without giving further detail. 
 Muscat’s government had signed a deal with Steward, guaranteeing it a €100 million government payout if the hospitals contract was terminated.
 A court order to annul the hospitals deal also struck down that side deal. Steward and the Maltese government are currently locked in international arbitration proceedings over that €100 million payment. 
 
 Ali and Bhatti declined to comment when contacted about the secret profit-sharing agreement, citing a court-imposed gag order.
 Muscat and Steward did not respond to a request for comment.
 However, in later comments to Times of Malta following publication, Muscat's lawyer said the ex-prime minister is ""completely extraneous"" to the agreement and had no knowledge of the arrangement. 
 Muscat's lawyer said reference in the criminal inquiry to the agreement ""does not pertain"" to his client.
 ""It is also worth noting that publicly available information shows that Accutor Consulting AG is not owned by the individuals in question [Shaukat Ali and his son Asad], raising doubts about their ability to enter into agreements through this company,"" Muscat's lawyer said. 
 A four-year criminal inquiry into the hospitals deal makes fleeting references to a participation rights agreement, however, investigators appear to have been unable to unearth the full details of it.
 In June 2019, according to the inquiry, Steward Malta boss Armin Ernst forwarded “drafts” of two agreements to a Steward employee. 
 Ernst instructed the employee to “Please delete these files immediately!!!!” after printing them.
 The inquiry report speculates that Ernst may have been keen to delete the files as they would have revealed the existence of the “unnamed participant” granted rights over dividends from Steward Malta.
  Investigators described Accutor as a central link for suspect payments and relationships made between key players in the hospitals deal, including Muscat, his chief of staff Keith Schembri and ex-minister Konrad Mizzi.
 Times of Malta has previously reported how Steward paid Accutor roughly €7.6 million between 2018 and 2020, with invoices and e-mails indicating the payments were for “political consultants,” “jet expenses”,  “lobbying” and ""payroll services.
 According to testimony by former Accutor director Kamal Sharma, the payments to Muscat stopped abruptly after Accutor’s bankers flagged them as suspicious. 
 As regulatory and media attention grew on Accutor in 2021, Ali’s son Asad asked Ernst if the profit-sharing agreement could be shifted away from the Swiss company “at the earliest”.
 A new agreement appears to have been drawn up, with the cut on the Malta dividends instead assigned to a Delaware-based company called K4C LLC. 
  In November 2022, Ali emailed Ernst, requesting payment under the profit-sharing deal, “in order for us to keep receiving funds as everyone else is getting paid from this operation”.
 Ali noted that the request for their money was an “ongoing embarrassing subject"".
 Ernst responded saying he would need to discuss it with Steward US boss Ralph de La Torre, but noted that “no dividends are being taken out of Malta at this stage” due to the “substantial debts” that had been accumulated.
 In February 2023, a civil court terminated the hospitals contract on fraud grounds.
 An appeal by Steward was dismissed in October 2023. 
 While the original court decision had pinned the blame for the ""fraudulent"" deal on Steward, the court of appeal said it also believed there was ""collusion between Steward and senior government officials or its agencies"".
 Steward’s US division filed for bankruptcy in May 2024.
 This article was produced with support from OCCRP and the Daphne Caruana Galizia Foundation.
 In a reaction, the shadow minister for health, Adrian Delia, said the latest developments further confirmed fraud in the granting of the hospitals concession. They showed secret manoeuvres to rob the people of Malta and Gozo, undermining their health. 
 Delia said the Nationalist Party would continue to seek the truth and insist on the reimbursement of the €400 million issued as part of the hospitals deal by the government.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/noncommunicable-diseases-malta-main-cause-death.1094550,"Non-communicable diseases are the main cause of morbidity, disability and deaths in Malta and worldwide, according to a new report.
 NCDs are described as diseases of long duration, not infectious, and result of a combination of genetic, physiological, environmental, and behavioural factors. This includes cardiovascular diseases, mental health conditions, diabetes, obesity, cancer, and chronic lung diseases.
 The Health Ministry and the Superintendence of Public Health on Thursday launched the Policy Framework for the Prevention of Non-Communicable diseases and Promotion of Wellbeing.
 In 2019, almost 91 per cent of all deaths in Malta were caused by an NCD.
 The framework proposes reorienting health services towards prevention, creating healthier environments, and boosting health literacy and emergency preparedness to decrease mortality rates.
 It stresses that the strategy must focus on data-driven decision-making and advocates for an overarching government and societal approach.
  Health Minister Jo Etienne Abela said the impact these diseases have on our country and population is not insignificant.
 ""It is, in fact, very big,"" he told a conference in Valletta.
 Charmaine Gauci, the Superintendent of Public Health, described the burden of NCDs as enormous, particularly the economic burden created by direct medical costs and indirect costs due to a loss of productivity.
 Gauci, an expert in disease prevention, highlighted that NCDs are largely preventable through effective interventions.
 She suggested eight priority areas to focus on for NCD prevention, including the reduction of tobacco use, reduction of alcohol use, reduction of obesity, access to a healthy diet, an increase in physical activity, promotion of mental health, promotion of environmental health and early diagnosis.
 The WHO Regional Office for Europe supported the framework through the WHO - Malta Country Cooperation Strategy 2022-26, which is aligned with the WHO’s Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of NCDs.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/malta-first-crematorium-open-doors-two-years.1098745,"Malta’s first crematorium could be up and running within two years, according to a funeral director with plans to build and operate one in Paola.
 Johann Camilleri told Times of Malta his team was revising plans submitted three years ago to conform with planning rules for crematoriums approved by the government last month.
 He said his company Active Group Limited was having to downsize its original plans for a 700-square-metre site to one of 500 square metres – the maximum allowed by the new policy – but remained committed to the project.
 “It is less feasible, but still doable... It will mean a couple of months delay, but this gives our engineers time to see how to reduce the size of the plans,” he said.  
 
 Camilleri said his company was aiming to submit revised plans to the PA by the end of next month and was hoping to offer cremation within the next two years.  
 In 2021, his company Active Group Limited applied to build a crematorium on private land close to the Addolorata cemetery, a location Camilleri described as “ideal” for the facility.
 Addolorata is Malta’s main cemetery and has been in use since the 1860s, although evidence suggests the Tal-Ħorr hill it was built on has been in use for burial purposes since prehistoric times.
 Malta legalised cremation in 2019, permitting cremation services to be offered at existing cemeteries, and in 2022 introduced the Cremation Act, legalising standalone crematoriums.  
 But it would be another two years until a policy for the development of such facilities was approved, with Planning Minister Clint Camilleri rubber-stamping the final guidelines last month, paving the way for companies to turn their ideas into tangible proposals.
  
 Camilleri stressed that despite the development of crematoriums now being given the green light by authorities, “the most important question is how many companies will be allowed to build one”. 
 Warning of the dangers of the sector becoming a “free-for-all”, he said that with estimated demand representing between 500 to 1,000 requests for cremations annually – between 10 and 20 per cent of the around 5,000 deaths per year – it was not feasible to have more than one operator in the country.
 “Malta cannot take more than one crematorium; if there were two, it is very likely they would both go bust... I know for a fact there isn’t the demand to sustain more than one,” he said.  
 Explaining that his planned crematorium represented an investment of around €3 million, Camilleri said his company would be “less willing to invest in top-quality equipment” if the sector was opened up to the free market.  
 Pressed on whether such a warning represented a desire to create a monopoly, he said the government could avoid the dangers associated with monopolies by issuing a tender for a crematorium operator, allowing it to set prices and guarantee quality standards. 
 “Cremation should not be left up to the market,” he said, warning such a scenario could allow “inexperienced operators” to begin operating, driving down standards. 
 However, he said his company would “go ahead anyway” if the government did not decide to issue a tender, pointing to his company’s acquisition of the Paola site and the money it had already poured into research and development for the project.
 Times of Malta understands that at least one other company also has plans to open a crematorium within the next years.
  The newly announced policy, a partial review of existing cemetery regulations, offers design guidelines for standalone crematoriums. 
 It specifies appropriate locations, how the crematorium should be designed sustainably, and ensures compliance with environmental and health regulations. 
 The building should take up no more than 500 square metres and the main structure cannot be taller than 7.7 metres. Additionally, the crematorium must be situated at least 183 metres away from any residential buildings.
 Crematoriums not part of a cemetery will only be considered if outside the development zone but up to 1.5km from the boundary of principal urban areas. In Gozo, cremation facilities will only be considered in Rabat and Xewkija.
 Until now, families wishing to cremate their loved ones had to send the body to Sicily or the UK, a service costing around €4,500.
 The issue came to the fore recently after well-known performer Roger Tirazona spoke about the distress of failing to fulfil his dying father’s wish of having his body cremated and taken to the Philippines.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/concerns-raised-youth-selfharm-rates.1096004,"The rate of young people contemplating suicide is gradually increasing with NGOs calling for more to be done to address the mental health of young men and women.
 Richmond Foundation and Victim Support Malta said that today’s young people face an array of pressures that range from the financial, environmental and emotional. All these pressures are exacerbated by social media that amplifies expectations of unrealistic perfection.
 Data obtained from the police about the rates of suicides and attempted suicides by people under 24 has shown a gradual increase over the last decade. Last year five people between the ages of 15 and 24 ended their own life: the highest number since 2014.
 The pattern was reflected in the number of young people who attempted to commit suicide: with 19 people under the age of 24 – including one under 14 – trying to end their life in the first six months of the year – the same amount as the total for 2021.
  The police data shows that the bulk of people who died by suicide in the past decade were men. In fact, 230 out of the 277 total people who died by suicide since 2014 were male. This pattern was also seen in the younger age groups: 22 out of the 29 people under 24 who died by suicide since 2014 were boys.
 “The rise in suicide rates among young people, particularly males, is a complex issue with multifaceted causes.
 “Factors such as academic pressure, social media and societal expectations that often stifle emotional expression can contribute to this alarming trend,” said Gestalt psychotherapist Lynn Sammut, who heads the Well-being Services at Richmond Foundation.
 Sammut is concerned about the mental health of young people. There has been an increase in young people reaching out for help and saying they were having thoughts about suicide, she says.
 “We have also had many young men and their loved ones contacting us as the struggles with relationships and break-ups have a reported high impact on their well-being and at times reportedly result in contemplation of suicide,” she said.
  Karl Grech, from the NGO Victim Support Malta, also raised concerns about the mental health of young people.
 “This period of young adulthood is often marked by individuals trying to determine their life path, leading to feelings of falling behind peers. In today’s world, social media can exacerbate this issue by creating the illusion that everyone else’s lives are perfect, while one’s own life may seem lacking in comparison,” he said.
 Sammut said that Malta’s socio-economic and environmental landscape presents specific challenges for young people. Several factors contribute to the mental health crisis among this demographic.
 These included economic pressures: “While Malta has experienced economic growth, the cost of living, particularly housing, has risen significantly, impacting young people’s financial stability and future prospects. This can lead to increased anxiety and stress,” she said.
 There were also educational challenges as the Maltese education system faced pressures related to overcrowding and teacher shortages.
  Then came social pressures: “A highly competitive job market, coupled with traditional societal expectations and environmental concerns,” she said adding that Malta’s small size and increasing population density contributed to environmental challenges such as traffic congestion, air pollution and limited green spaces.
 “Addressing these issues requires a multi-faceted approach that involves investing in mental health services, improving educational opportunities, creating sustainable economic growth, and prioritising environmental protection,” she said.
 Grech, from Victim Support Malta, said: “Today’s reality is characterised by faster-paced living, less space, fewer green areas to unwind, more chaos, and more work. This leaves people feeling stressed and overwhelmed. Growth should be approached differently to ensure an adequate quality of life for all members of our society.”
  He spoke about the need to invest in a national mental health system at all levels, from primary schools to the broader community.
 “Increasing the number of multidisciplinary mental health professionals in schools can help identify and address issues early, working on both students and their families. As the work done with a student is irrelevant without addressing the issues stemming from the family unit,” he said.
 There was need for more mental health professionals within the community to assist individuals in processing issues that arise at both individual and family levels.
 “Providing distress tolerance skills and psychoeducational tools to both children and adults can help them understand and manage their emotions and experiences,” he said, adding that research had shown a link between lack of expressing emotion and suicidal ideation.
 If you have been affected by suicide, Victim Support Malta offers a free and confidential multidisciplinary therapeutic service. Contact 2122 8333 or e-mail info@victimsupport.org.mt. Richmond Foundation has supported many people through their Olli chat, 1770 helpline and free therapy services.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/vitals-saga-threatens-malta-reputation-foreign-investment.1092174,"The fallout from the Vitals' saga is tarnishing Malta's reputation and threatening prospective foreign investment, the Chamber of SMEs warned on Thursday. 
 The warning was sounded following the publication of survey results showing that business owners in Malta are mostly concerned about good governance.
 CEO Abigail Agius Mamo told journalists the survey was held before news that a four-and-a-half-year inquiry into the government hospitals' concession deal had been concluded. 
 That inquiry has led to criminal charges levelled at former prime minister Joseph Muscat, current deputy prime minister  Chris Fearne, Central Bank governor Edward Scicluna and several others.  
 Agius Mamo added that had the survey been carried out today, the ""results would have been much worse"".
 Some 400 owners of micro, small, medium and large businesses participated in the survey, claiming that good governance was their top concern, followed by overpopulation, inflation and corruption.
 ""Foreign investors seek our reputation: good reputation attracts reputable investment; bad reputation attracts bad investments,"" Agius Mamo said, warning that politicians set an example via their actions.   
 ""We are constantly urging good business practice: pay taxes and obey the law, but if those at the top don't set a good example, we will face many more problems further down"".  
 SME chamber president Paul Abela said he was especially concerned about Robert Abela's reaction to news that the inquiry had been concluded, comparing the prime minister's statements with those of former prime minister Dom Mintoff.   
 ""The prime minister said he wants to revise how inquiries are conducted.... we used to hear those sort of statements in Mintoff's time. Mintoff used to change the judges when he knew a case would be decided against him,"" Abela claimed.
 Abela has heaped scorn on a magisterial inquiry concerning the Vitals hospitals deal that triggered criminal charges against top political figures, initially claiming the magistrate was purposely delaying the conclusions.
 Once concluded, Abela said that while he did not have a copy of the document, the inquiry was biased and that sections of the judiciary were part of an ""establishment"" that was out to destroy the Labour Party. 
 Employers' bodies,  President Myriam Spiteri Debono,  law students, NGOs, a  former chief justice and politicians have all expressed concern over his comments.
 The SME barometer for the first quarter of this year was conducted by the Chamber of SMEs and MISCO.
 Among others, business owners were asked for the ""two most important issues the country is facing"" that they would like the government to do something about.
 Thirty-three per cent flagged a lack of good governance while a quarter of the respondents mentioned corruption.   
 Thirty-one per cent meanwhile raised concern over overpopulation while 30 per cent said inflation was a top issue for them. 
 Owners were also asked about the challenges that their business was facing. 
 Shortage of employees was by far the biggest issue, with over 40 per cent saying it was one of the two most significant problems for them. 
 However, MISCO director Lawrence Zammit said that rather than a shortage of people, lack of skills was the main issue. 
 Inflation was flagged as the second biggest challenge by a little over a quarter of respondents.
 Almost three-quarters of those surveyed believe the country is headed in the wrong direction. That figure is slightly lower than 2023's last quarter when 80 per cent said Malta is in the wrong direction.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/she-walk-shower-clothes-on-living-with-dementia.1091677,"Retired pharmacist Rosa Borg was sitting at the dinner table with her family when she suddenly fell into a trance. She sat still, staring into thin air for about 10 minutes.
 When she snapped back into awareness she started sobbing. She knew something was terribly wrong with her.
 Rosa was 71 when she was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease. Her brain was dying, her memories were fading away and, perhaps most painfully, she knew it.
 Her daughter, Anne Cuschieri, witnessed the process up close. Anne, the youngest of three siblings, became her mother’s carer and supported her ageing father as he dealt with the heartbreak of being forgotten by the woman he loved.
  Dementia is an umbrella term that refers to several conditions and symptoms associated with a decline in memory or other thinking skills, severe enough to reduce a person’s ability to perform everyday activities.
 Alzheimer’s is the most common type of dementia, causing problems with memory, thinking and behaviour. Symptoms usually develop slowly and get worse over time, becoming severe enough to interfere with daily tasks.
 “My mother knew there was something very wrong with her and she was terrified,” says Anne, sitting in the living room of her Sliema apartment.
 Anne recalls how the family first realised there was a problem when her mother began repeating herself. Soon after the repeating started, the trances followed.
  After consultation with doctors and psychologists, her mother was put on medication to try to slow down the progress of the disease.
 The first years were the hardest.
 “Relatives suffer tremendously. But the dementia patient suffers a million times more. The beginning is very hard. They know there is something wrong with them and they know they are losing their memory,” says Anne.
 The family decided to be open about the condition, informing neighbours because they needed their support.
 Caring for her mother was exhausting for both herself and her father, Joe. So, after some time, Anne – together with her husband and their two children – moved from their Naxxar home to Sliema to be closer by.
  “She started escaping from my father – who had a history of heart disease. She would cross the road without looking and come to me and ring the doorbell and start crying to be let in. She’d say: ‘I want my mummy’. They live in the past. Then she would come upstairs. I’d sit her down and call my father and tell him she is here.
 “She would talk about ‘a stranger’ in the house – referring to my father. Then she would say she has to go because the children are alone at home. There was huge confusion. I’d tell her: ‘Ma, I’m your child’. I don’t know who I was to her when she was talking to me,” Anne says.
  The family tried hard to keep their mother at home – a place that was familiar to her. But things started getting out of hand.
 “She stopped recognising my father. He started locking the door and she started climbing out of the ground-floor window. I was a mess – coping with work, with my father and my mother. I was even helping with my father’s sister – my aunt – who lived round the corner and had dementia too,” Anne says.
 Her aunt, May Borg, had vascular dementia. She wrote down parts of her life story on a calendar to remember who she was.
 “Even she knew she was losing her memory. They grab onto that and they are terrified. They stop wanting to meet people and go out because they know they can’t handle a conversation.”
 Anne’s two older brothers, who both live abroad, supported from afar. She also had great support from her employer who allowed her the flexibility to be able to care for her parents.
 Eventually the family had to move Rosa into a care home.
 “My mum would wake up in the middle of the night and go to the kitchen and start defrosting and eating chicken. She would walk into the shower with her clothes on. My father was weak and could not rest. We were both exhausted: physically, psychologi­cally and emotionally. We were judged with comments such as: ‘I kept my mum with me till the end.’”
  Moving Rosa out of the house and into a care home was traumatic for all.
 The family was also dealing with Joe’s complications from heart surgery and Anne’s diagnosis with cancer.
 As the years passed, Rosa’s condition deteriorated. She died in 2012, 12 years after her diagnosis.
 “You are grieving from the first day because you are losing the person. My father went through moments of frustration. He was a very calm man, but he was very tired. When she moved into a home, he went to visit her every day. He would tell us that he married her in sickness and in health and until death do them part.”
 He died a year later.
  Throughout this, Anne had the support of her family and the Malta Dementia Society. She is now working to ensure that support is even more visible and accessible for people with dementia and their families, and has taken on a more active role in the society.
 Charles Scerri, an associate professor at the University of Malta’s Department of Pathology and co-founder of the Society, said it is beneficial for people with dementia to live in the community if possible as this allows them to remain in a familiar environment.
 This is why early diagnosis is important as it allows for better treatment and gives the person a chance to take decisions.
 While Malta has made great strides in the dementia field, there was still a lack of trained staff and specialisation.
  He spoke about the need for more awareness about how dementia is impacting society. Dementia costs more than cancer and cardiovascular disease. International figures show that dementia costs between €23,000 and €28,000 per person per year.
 Scerri spoke about the need for more investment and about the importance of employment flexibility for filial caregivers.
 According to Eurostat data published last October, Malta recorded the highest rate of deaths caused by dementia in Europe, with just over 80 deaths per 100,000 people in 2020. A total of 6,552 were registered to have dementia in 2018. That figure is expected to reach 14,117 by 2050. 
 This year, the government launched the seven-year National Dementia Strategy.
  The Malta Dementia Society offers support to people with dementia and their loved ones in care homes and in the community. Services include DancingToDementia for people with dementia; Reaching Hands Support Group for relatives; the Malta Dementia Working Group for people living with early dementia; and Kuluri u Tifkiriet, which is a reminiscence art therapy programme for people with dementia.
 Services also include talks, legal support, psychotherapy and cultural outings. In September the society will be holding a conference to mark its 20th anniversary.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/brave-nicky-sansone-dies-cancer-shortly-lifecelebration-party.1096485,"WARNING: SOME READERS MIGHT FIND THE ATTACHED VIDEO UPSETTING
 Inspirational Nicky Sansone died on Thursday, two weeks after throwing a party to celebrate her life when told of her terminal cancer.
 She recorded her life with cancer on Tiktok and uploaded her last video just on Wednesday, urging her followers to “enjoy life, live, love, and smile”. 
 Lying in bed, she said it was her last video and thanked her followers before saying in a faint voice: ""Live, love and smile"".
 Sansone, 55, told Times of Malta last week that she decided to throw a party in celebration of her life after being told she had weeks to live.
 Doctors had told her they feared she might not make it to her birthday on August 24.
  “We had to bring it forward because they don't think I will make it until then. It ended up being a bigger event with over 120 people. I was overwhelmed,” she had said.
 Sansone was diagnosed with cancer in November and immediately resorted to TikTok to record her battle and her views of life, urging people to check out any symptoms immediately.
 “Smile, live, love and enjoy life to the fullest,” was the message s
  “For many people, it’s life-work-life-work. They forget to live. The world has become so sad. Enjoy life. Stop fighting. Stop complaining. Live. People worry about such stupid things.  I did too,"" she said. 
  “Some people don’t cherish what they have until it’s gone. So, if you have something and it’s good focus on the good,” she said in an interview with Times of Malta from her bed at the Sir Anthony Mamo Oncology Centre.
 Sansone believed her first symptoms came three years ago, when she started losing weight. But back then she attributed the weight loss to the fact that she had cut alcohol from her life completely.
 In November, she went for a swim with a friend and got so breathless that she had to get out of the water. She went to a doctor who sent her to get an X-ray immediately.
 She went to hospital and tests showed that her lungs were full of water.  She was diagnosed with stage 4 aggressive cancer and began chemotherapy. The cancer had spread and it was too risky to do anything.
 That was when she decided to throw a party to celebrate her life.
 Tributes for Sansone poured in as the sad news of her demise was announced. Most underlined her message: 'Live, love and smile.""
 The MGRM Malta Gay Rights Movement expressed its condolences to her partner and her family. ""We will keep Nicky's memory alive by taking her advice, and ""Live life, love and smile,"" the movement said.

 The police were alerted about the fight on Triq il-Kavallieri ta’ Malta at 10pm.
 Officers found blood on site, but the people involved in the argument had left for hospital in a private car.
 The people included a 47-year-old from Mosta who suffered grievous injuries and three other men - also from Mosta, aged 19, 20 and 21. The three younger men suffered slight injuries.
 The police said in a statement a weapon with a blade was used during the argument. 
 The police are investigating the case and looking to identify other people involved in the argument.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/doctors-welcome-inquiry-report-slam-lack-health-services-investment.1097901,"Updated 7 pm with Ministry statement 
 The doctors' union on Wednesday welcomed the conclusions of a magisterial inquiry into a man's sudden death while awaiting hospital treatment, but said the government should acknowledge that patients were waiting for hours for services owing to under-investment in the health infrastructure.
 The inquiry by Magistrate Joe Mifsud concluded that medical staff who treated former policeman Stephen Mangion were not guilty of any wrongdoing, Health Minister Jo Etienne Abela said later that these professionals had faced a barrage of public anger when they had done all they could to save his life. 
 The Medical Association said the doctors had done their best – despite a failure of systems due to lack of infrastructure.
 ""The MAM is very satisfied that the enquiring magistrate found that doctors and indeed all other health care professionals performed their duties in an ethical and professional way,"" the union said.
 It was true however that patients had to wait for unacceptable periods of time for all government services as €400 million of investment had gone down the drain, and virtually zero investment had been made in infrastructure in the last 11 years, the union said. The minister had to be honest and admit this publicly and apologise to patients for this situation not blame those who did their best for patients in such unfortunate circumstances, the union said.
 Its reference to €400 million was the sum paid by the government to Vitals/Steward to run three public hospitals in a deal later annulled by the courts because of fraud. 
 Referring to other comments by the minister during a press conference on Tuesday, the union said it was disappointed that the health ministry had not discussed outsourcing of services with it. It pointed out that people in Malta paid €10,000 for an IVF procedure, when most centres in the European Union charged under €2000. 
 The union said it had refrained from publicly alarming the public about the sad decision taken by the health ministry for a ward specifically designed for critical patients needing ventilation to be closed and for patients to be placed in hospital wards which were not equipped for such patients. It said that since these critically ill patients were in danger of dying, respiratory physicians had written to the State Advocate to protest the ministry's decision.  
 The union said it was always ready for discussion but would not be a scapegoat for the government’s failure to sufficiently invest in the health infrastructure.
 In a statement later on Wednesday the Health Ministry denied the claims made by the MAM, saying that the association has been “obstructing” attempts at reform with a “confrontational and negative attitude”. 
 The ministry said it was “devious” to suggest that the ministerial inquiry somehow undermines the medical profession. 
 “It is high time that doctors, patients and society at large are made aware of the obstructive stance that MAM has persistently adopted in MAM-Government interactions. This stance has reached levels that are affecting the transformation of Healthcare Services and society’s expectations of delivery of care,” they said. 
 The ministry listed a number of reforms they say the MAM has “opposed, obstructed or slowed down”, which included: 
 The ministry said it nonetheless remains open to constructive discussion as it continued to hold with other trade unions.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/joseph-muscat-charged-bribery-corruption-court-pleads-not-guilty.1093148,"Joseph Muscat pleaded not guilty to bribery, corruption and other crimes on Tuesday, as he entered court to the cheers and adulation of hundreds of supporters. 
 It was the first time in Maltese history that a former politician was charged with such crimes. If found guilty, he faces up to 18 years in prison. 
 The charges stem from a 2015 agreement with Vitals, a company with no healthcare experience, to redevelop three public hospitals. It led to accusations of massive financial mismanagement and corruption. 
 The former prime minister was one of 14 individuals and nine companies charged during Tuesday's historic court hearing.
 
 Among them were his former chief of staff Keith Schembri and former minister Konrad Mizzi. 
 The court session began at 11.30am and lasted more than eight hours, as the magistrate had to manage scores of lawyers following the attorney general’s decision to press charges against the defendants collectively. 
 It was an even longer day for some of the hundreds who answered Labour firebrand Manuel Cuschieri’s call to show up in Valletta to lend  Muscat their support.
 Many arrived early and hung around throughout the day, even after Cuschieri made a silent exit.
 They chanted, clapped and cheered as Muscat, Schembri and Mizzi entered court.
 Some insulted journalists tasked with reporting the event. 
  Inside the court, there was a flurry of legal arguments and procedural challenges. 
 The defence lawyers demanded that the attorney general substantiate the requested amounts for freezing orders with concrete evidence.
 Magistrate Rachel Montebello approved freezing order requests to the tune of millions against the various people facing charges, to defence lawyers’ protests.
 
 Seven hours into the sitting, Francesco Refalo from the AG’s office said the prosecution was asking the court to impose some bail conditions even though the accused were not charged under arrest.
 “And we’re asking this, especially after seeing certain public comments and statements and spin after these charges were filed.
 ""We want to avoid that this case is reduced to a trial by media. We want to protect proper administration of justice and so while this case is ongoing, we want the accused to refrain from further public comments.
 “Those comments are more appropriate to some TV series... And they may undermine the proper administration of justice.”
 He was asked to specify who was attacking the prosecution.
 Refalo pointed to comments by Muscat, Mizzi and Vitals auditor Chris Spiteri on social media as well as press conferences.
  The request by the AG’s office to impose restrictions on the accused drew strong reactions from defence lawyers who said it was an unfair request.
 They assured the court that their clients had no intention of absconding.
 The magistrate prohibited the parties and their lawyer from handing any parts of these records to third parties.
 Only faithful reporting of court proceedings is to be allowed.
 “The case is tried in court and court alone, not through the media. So, the parties and their lawyers are banned from handing any of the data to third parties or making any public comments about any testimonies or evidence in the proceedings,” the magistrate said.
 As for travel restrictions, the court did not prohibit the accused from travelling abroad but they must make sure to appear for every sitting so as not to stultify the proceedings.
 The court also reserved the right to set out further conditions at the next sitting or in the interim.
 To make sure they abide by this obligation the court imposed a personal guarantee of €25,000 on each of the accused.
 During the hearing, defence lawyer Edward Gatt questioned the involvement of a UK expert, referred to as “Sam” in the investigation. Gatt aimed to challenge the expert’s credibility and the procedures followed during the inquiry.
 All defence lawyers in fact registered their objection to all the the experts nominated in the magisterial inquiry.  
 The magistrate overseeing the case emphasised the relevance of the questions posed by Gatt and other defence attorneys, particularly regarding the validity of searches conducted at various locations, including Muscat’s residence.
 Testimonies confirmed that a search at Muscat’s home in 2021 was postponed due to a media leak, raising questions about the handling of information during the investigation.
  Former inspector Anthony Scerri, who participated in the Muscat home search, testified about the process and the involvement of foreign experts. Scerri confirmed that documents and devices were seized during multiple searches at locations connected to the accused, including the offices of Vitals auditor Chris Spiteri.
 But the details that emerged from the courtroom showed the police did not carry out a parallel investigation to the inquiry. They acted under magistrate’s instructions.
 Speaking last night, Opposition leader Bernard Grech said it was confirmed during the court sitting that the police did not actively investigate the hospitals' case.
 This, he said was shameful.
 He said he was warning Police Commissioner Angelo Gafà that he should not continue to serve those who had put him in his post and “controlling him”.
 Grech labelled Muscat and his associates as “political pirates” and criticised Robert Abela for defending them.
 Outside the courtroom, the atmosphere was charged with emotion. Dozens of Muscat’s supporters gathered, expressing their conviction that the charges were politically motivated attempts to undermine the Labour Party’s grip on government.
 
 They chanted slogans in support of Muscat, with some holding placards stating, “I am Joseph Muscat”, reflecting their unwavering loyalty to the former prime minister.
 When Muscat and other defendants finally emerged from court at 8.50pm, a good number were still there, determined to show their support to the very end.
 “This is a repetition of Christ’s story,” one man said, drawing parallels between Muscat’s prosecution and the persecution of Jesus Christ. The case is expected to be lengthy and complex, with significant implications for all parties involved.
 The case was adjourned to June 13 and 19.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/actress-launches-organ-donation-campaign-friend-transplant.1096886,"When her close friend had to be urgently airlifted to another country for a heart transplant, a renowned Maltese actress was inspired to start a campaign to encourage people to register as organ donors.
 Lara Azzopardi, known mostly for her roles in local television series and films, brought together the wife of the prime minister, the opposition leader and the health minister, among others, to remind people that their organs can live in other people after their death.
  Azzopardi, who is a nurse by profession, spent seven years working at the renal unit at Mater Dei Hospital and she admits the countless hours she spent working for people who suffered from kidney diseases opened her up to the good cause of organ donation.
 But it was her friend’s serious heart condition and urgent transplant that inspired her to go a step further and launch the campaign.
 When he was 17 he discovered he had cardiomyopathy – a condition that prevents the heart from pumping blood efficiently throughout the body – but managed to live with it normally for 35 years through periodical interventions. During a routine check-up last November, however, his doctor noticed that his heart had been behaving abnormally in the weeks prior to the appointment.
 That is when he was told he needed to be admitted to hospital urgently, and by the first week of December he was airlifted to Sicily to wait for a heart transplant, which he received on December 8.
 Doctors later told him that had he not gotten the transplant in time, he could have suffered a cardiac arrest that could have killed him at any moment, he told Times of Malta.
  Opposition Leader Bernard Grech joined the campaign, saying he and his wife had registered to become organ donors when they were just 22, and said one of the best gifts in life is giving part of oneself.
 Lydia Abela, the prime minister’s wife, said meeting people who need a heart transplant highlights the preciousness of life, and saving people’s lives is the ultimate gift of love.
 Health Minister JoEtienne Abela said that despite being always tragic and unpleasant, death can also be transformed into new life. An organ donor’s death can save up to eight other people’s lives, he said, which is why people should seriously consider registering as donors.
 PN MP Adrian Delia and Public Health Superintendent Charmaine Gauci also joined the campaign, sending out their own messages of hope and urging people to register to become organ donors.
 Anyone who has turned 16 can become an organ donor by signing up through eID on organdonation.gov.mt.
 Alternatively, people can request a registration form to be sent to them by post, which they then fill in and send back, or by filling in the form at Mater Dei’s renal unit.

 The man, from St Paul's Bay, was carrying out some work at a house on Triq L-Awwista. 
 A magisterial inquiry and police investigations are ongoing.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/i-deleted-social-media-apps-friends-thought-something-wrong.1098102,"A few weeks ago, Gisèle Degiorgio made a decision that would surprise many of her friends and colleagues. She deleted all social media apps from her phone.
 The 39-year-old pianist and music educator says she is already feeling the benefits. She now feels calmer, and her mind is “more clear and less bothered”.
 “This decision has actually removed from my mind the negativity of social media, such as discussions that turn into arguments and people venting as they immediately turn to social media,” she says.
 Gisèle is of the generation that remembers life before social media, first logging on to Facebook at the age of 22.
 As she grew older, the impact of social media became increasingly negative.
 “When I was younger, I used to see it differently. These were platforms to build connections. But then, as I grew older, I started to feel they are much more invasive. I have ‘followed the flock’ and shared posts and photos to share happy moments.
 ""But then I started to question: Do I need to know if she or he did this and that? I used to find myself wasting time and scrolling while looking at fake concepts of life: people posting about their happy moments painting a picture of perfection. Then, when someone dies, the platform goes to the other extreme,” she says.
 According to a report by MISCO for the Malta Chamber published earlier this year, 90 per cent of people in Malta say they access social media networks at least once a day.
 And Gisèle is not the only one to feel the negativity. Research has increasingly shown that social media can take a toll on mental health.
  Anton Grech, one of Malta’s leading psychiatrists, explains that social media creates pressure on two levels: unrealistic expectations and addiction. 
 People share posts of their best moments.
 “As a result, people are developing unrealistic expectations about their appearances and life. International research shows this is leading to increased cases of depression, especially among young females,” said Grech, clinical chairperson of Mental Health Services.
 The second issue is more insidious – addiction. People are getting addicted to the dopamine kick released in the brain when scrolling and being exposed to “new and exciting” information every couple of minutes. In some cases, this behavioural addiction is taking over people’s lives.
 While Gisèle’s experience didn’t reach that extreme, she still felt the need to step back.
 Her breaking point was when her young daughter asked her to put down her phone.
 “I didn’t want to be that parent who gets lost in my screen, so deleting social media apps is a start. At least I want to try and lead by example.”
 When Gisèle first joined Facebook, the intention was to connect with friends. She moved on to setting up a professional Facebook page and an Instagram account as life – and her career – progressed. 
 After becoming a mother to two children – now aged two and four – she joined online parenting groups in search of advice, but they left her feeling lost.
 “I realised that: I just need to figure it out, like my mother did,” she says.
  Six weeks ago, Gisèle deleted her social media apps. Now she only accesses her accounts from her computer, logging in briefly every other week to share posts about her work.
 When she shared a post announcing her decision, reactions were mixed. While relatives welcomed her brave decision to “detox” from social media, some colleagues were shocked by the idea.
 “Other friends thought something happened – like a cyberattack that drove me to withdraw from social media. Which of course it didn’t,” she said.
 Gisèle is pleased with her decision so far, and she can still communicate with friends via WhatsApp.
 “I do appreciate that social media can be an important tool to let people know about your work. But it was becoming too much. I know that one can choose what to follow on social media but, in the end, it remains a place where people feel the need to get approval, praise and support among many other things. It is not real life… Now I find that I am reading more articles. I hope to pick up a book soon, and my mind is more clear and much less bothered,” she says.
 The excessive use of social media is leading to more young people being diagnosed with behavioural addictions, according to Grech.
 “Over the years, we have seen an increase in this type of behavioural addiction. People seek help for symptoms such as anxiety, low morale, problems with relationships, or issues at work. And when you dig deeper, you find that the cause is social media addiction,” said Grech.
 Countries are beginning to take notice of the issue. This week, the Australian government announced plans to set a minimum age for social media use in response to growing concerns about mental and physical health. The law would make Australia one of the first countries in the world to impose such an age restriction.
 While some advocate for age limits, Grech believes education, not prohibition, is the answer.
 Grech explained there was an additional factor that was contributing to the negative impact of social media – the use of negative and hateful comments.
 “When you say something bad to someone’s face and see their reaction, a natural process kicks in, and you feel bad. This does not happen on social media. It is resulting in a society that is much more cynical and mistrusting,” he said.
 “We have reached a stage where people feel that, if they are not on social media, they are left out – they do not know what’s happening. It has become the new piazza (village square) in a world when we no longer meet face-to-face in the  piazza and get to really know one another.”

https://timesofmalta.com/article/edward-scicluna-sacked-cabinet.1095981,"The government is planning to axe Edward Scicluna from his top role at the Central Bank in the coming week, should the governor continue to refuse to resign following a damning court decision.
 The Cabinet will likely make the final decision during a meeting on Tuesday, Times of Malta is informed.
 Scicluna is expected to be replaced by Alexander Demarco, who currently serves as the bank’s deputy governor. The Central Bank of Malta Act and European Central Bank legislation both state a governor can only be removed if found guilty of serious misconduct or if he no longer fulfills the conditions to perform their duties. Sources said the government will base its legal reasoning on the argument that Scicluna can no longer perform his duties because he will be facing trial.
 Government sources conceded that the former finance minister might have a legal argument to challenge the decision but added the government plans to go ahead anyway.
  Scicluna, along with former deputy prime minister Chris Fearne and 13 others, is in court over charges of fraud, misappropriation and fraudulent gain related to the privatisation of Gozo, Karin Grech and St Luke’s hospitals.
 All the accused learned on Wednesday that their case will go to trial after Magistrate Leonard Caruana ruled there is enough evidence ‘at first glance’ for the case to continue. All have insisted on their innocence.
 Following that decision, Prime Minister Robert Abela strongly indicated that Scicluna should step down as governor.
 
 “The correct decision for the Central Bank governor can be seen from the example set by the former deputy prime minister, Chris Fearne and the example set by permanent secretary Ronald Mizzi. I believe good sense will prevail. I believe the national interest will prevail, as will the interest of the sector currently overseen by Professor Scicluna,” Abela had said.
  Fearne resigned from the Cabinet as soon as charges were filed against him two months ago. Mizzi resigned on Wednesday. But Scicluna has refused to budge, telling Times of Malta  on Thursday morning that his position remained unchanged: “I will abide by the EU treaties. We [the Central Bank] are an independent institution. We have our own rules.”
 Since the arraignment in May, Scicluna has maintained that neither the government nor the opposition can compel him to resign. As he dug his heels, the government upped the ante: on Friday he was removed as deputy governor of the Malta Financial Services Authority.
 Sources said they feared Scicluna will not change his position and is prepared to take on the government, potentially leading to an embarrassing legal battle.
 The position of CBM governor is one of the most delicate jobs in Malta, since it requires not only a deep understanding of economic policies and financial systems but also an unwavering commitment to integrity and independence. The government is planning to pass on that mantle to Demarco, who was appointed deputy governor in 2014, after having joined the Central Bank of Malta in 1984. For most of his career, he worked in the bank’s Economic Research Department as a senior economist.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/how-mould-made-sick-took-woman-months-realise-cause-symptoms.1094330,"Soon after starting a job as a shop cashier, Charlotte began experiencing strong headaches, bowel problems and overall weakness and then “unbearable pain”.
 It took her months to realise the cause of her symptoms: she was breathing in mould particles.
 They were being blown onto her face by an extractor fan that sucked air from a mould-lined storeroom and expelled it above the cash desk.
 Her doctor confirmed that her symptoms matched black mould exposure. Now Charlotte, 57, wants to share her story to raise awareness about the dangers of inhaling mould, a common site in Maltese homes.
 “It was so scary. I thought something was seriously wrong with me. Then I realised it was because of mould. People need to know.”
 According to the health authorities, long-term exposure to mould can be harmful and it is important to treat any mould at home or at work.
 “Preventing mould, or dealing with it quickly if present, is very important and public health authorities stress the need for awareness and taking action to reduce the risks from mould,” a spokesperson said.
 According to provisional data from the National Hospital Information System of the Directorate for Health Information and Research, 16 patients were hospitalised for aspergillosis (an infection caused by mould) between 2016 and 2023. The spokesperson noted that immunosuppressed patients are more at risk of developing all types of infections including fungal infections.
 Most people who are exposed to mould do not end up in hospital. Symptoms due to mould exposure can vary, but common ones include sneezing and stuffy nose; coughing and wheezing; itchy, red, or watery eyes; skin rashes; headaches and feeling tired.
 Charlotte, who did not want her real name used, ticked most of the boxes.
 It all started in October last year when she was looking for a job and a friend offered her one working as a cashier in the bottle shop she owned.
 While working there, she often got congested but initially dismissed it as being sinuses at that time of the year.
 Since it was winter, she did not turn on the air conditioning at work, but she did turn on the air curtain machine located above the main door and close to the cash desk as it circulated the air “like a fan”.
 Then in January she was out with a friend and felt dizzy. Within days she started getting strong headaches. She worried something was seriously wrong with her health.
 The symptoms started piling up, including muscle pain, bloating, loss of concentration and overall weakness.
 One day she went into a storeroom and noticed there was mould. She decided to clean it and, since there was no bleach around, she used a cleaning product. When she was done and went back to the cash, she could smell the cleaning product coming from the air curtain machine. That was when she realised the air blowing onto her was coming from the storeroom. She was inhaling mould particles.
 She asked her boss to treat it but, there was an issue with a leak from a neighbour’s property. The boss covered it in tape, but her symptoms persisted.
 Charlotte went to a doctor who confirmed that her symptoms matched mould exposure and told her to leave the workplace.
 She followed the instruction, she is feeling better now, but some symptoms still linger.
  While the Occupational Health and Safety Authority says complaints about mould are rare, it said employers must ensure their workers’ health and safety, including protecting them from mould at work.
 “To address mould, employers should have skilled staff to advise on necessary measures like improving ventilation, fixing leaks, and addressing dampness… Employers should have systems for workers to report issues and ensure these complaints are investigated,” a spokesperson said.
 If mould is found during inspections, the authority will act according to the law, considering the level of compliance. Actions can include improvement notices, orders to fix issues, fines, or legal action for severe cases.
 Mould is a type of fungus that grows in damp and humid places. It spreads by releasing tiny spores into the air. It can be found indoors and outdoors and can grow on many surfaces like wood, paper, carpets and food. It can look like spots of many different colours, and it can smell musty, the Health Ministry explained.
 Not all moulds are equally harmful. Some moulds, like aspergillus and cladosporium, can cause allergies and breathing problems. Others, like black mould, are more dangerous because they produce toxins.
 “Breathing in mould spores can cause various health problems, especially if you have asthma, allergies, or a weaker immune system. It can lead to allergic reactions, asthma attacks, and other breathing issues. Harmful toxins from certain types of mould may cause serious health problems including nerve damage and, in rare cases, death,” the spokesperson said.
  To prevent problems from mould, you need to control moisture and humidity. The health authorities recommend the following:
 • Use dehumidifiers and air conditioners to keep indoor humidity below 60%;
 • Make sure bathrooms, kitchens and laundry areas are well ventilated;
 • Fix any leaks in your roof, windows or pipes right away;
 • Clean and dry wet or damp areas within 24-48 hours;
 • Regularly check and maintain your heating and cooling systems;
 • If you think you have mould in your home, it is best to remove it with household products, soap and water, or a bleach solution. If you find any difficulties, ask for professional advice.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/free-diabetes-glucose-monitors-extended-patients-50-years-old.1098033,"A scheme that provides free continuous glucose monitors to patients of Type 1 diabetes has been extended to patients up to 50 years old. 
 This is the second time the scheme has been extended this year. It was first extended to include patients up to 45 years old in May. Prior to that, it had previously only been available to patients up to  35 years old. 
 In a statement on Friday, Health Minister Jo Etienne Abela said that the government is committed to addressing the conditions of diabetes, as it is estimated that the disease affects roughly 10% of the population. 
 Thanks to an investment of €300,000 the government was able to extend the service to a wider band of people, he said. 
 The adjustment now means an additional 160 people will be able to benefit from the scheme, bringing the total number of people who enjoy the benefit to 950. 
 Sensors inserted just under the skin, often on the arm or belly, detect glucose levels of the wearer and send the information via a transmitter to a smartphone app.
 The user can then monitor their glucose levels to better understand how things like food and activity are impacting them. 
 They can also alert the user to high or low glucose levels so they can make changes to treat or prevent high blood sugar or low blood sugar episodes before they become bigger issues.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/wsc-blames-third-parties-ecoli-contamination-two-st-julian-beaches.1092992,"E. coli contamination in two St Julian’s bays was caused by improper waste disposal into water culverts, the Water Services Corporation said on Friday.  
 Health authorities this week warned swimmers to avoid Balluta Bay and  St. George’s Bay because E. coli, a bacteria associated with untreated sewage, was detected in water at both bays. 
 Swimming in the two bays is still not recommended.  
 A spokesperson for Water Services Corporation (WSC), the entity responsible for Malta’s sewage system, said the contamination was not their fault.  
 “The contamination is not caused by WSC's sewage network. Instead, it results from blockages due to third-party activities and improper waste disposal by said third parties into water culverts which shouldn’t be used for such use”.  
 “Our network has been thoroughly tested and confirmed to be leak-free,” the spokesperson said.  
 Sources involved in monitoring sea-water quality said sewage spills sometimes happen because system overloads.  Tourist hotspots like Sliema and St Julian’ sare especially susceptible because of their dense population, particularly in summer months.  
 A spokesperson for the health ministry said the beaches will remain ""closed"" until three consecutive tests for the presence of E. coli are negative. 
 But when Times of Malta visited St George's Bay on Friday morning, many bathers were sunbathing and taking a dip. The only indication that the beaches were ""closed"" were signs warning that bathing was ""not recommended"" due to ""extraordinary circumstances.""  
 The sign makes no mention of the presence of E.Coli in the water.
 E.Coli is the bacteria most commonly associated with food poisoning. While most adults recover from infection with E. coli within a week, the Mayo Clinic notes that young children and older adults infected have a greater risk of developing a life-threatening form of kidney failure.
 This week's two contaminated bay warnings follow a similar warning made for Tal-Għażżien in St. Paul’s Bay last week. That bay was declared free of E.Coli this week.  
 Malta is currently being sued by the EU for what Brussels says is a violation of the EU Waste Water Directive by dumping untreated sewage at sea. 
 MEP candidate Peter Agius has also asked the National Audit Office to investigate the government for misuse of EU funds that were intended to develop sewage treatment facilities. 
 WSC says it is investing €310 million to modernise Malta’s water and sewage infrastructure. They say that money will be used to upgrade sewage treatment facilities to increase capacity and efficiency, improve the sewage network, implement water monitoring technologies and enhance wastewater recycling and reuse initiatives.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/police-say-never-saw-78-boxes-investigation-related-vitals-case.1093917,"A police officer unequivocally confirmed that the police never investigated the Vitals case but only assisted the magistrate conducting the inquiry, relying on its conclusions when pressing charges against a former prime minister and his associates. 
 The 78 boxes of evidence making up the inquiry were never in police possession and police only assisted in transferring those boxes from the Attorney General’s office to court. 
 That point was driven home by lawyers assisting Joseph Muscat, his former chief of staff Keith Schembri, former minister Konrad Mizzi and a number of other persons and entities charged with money laundering and corruption in their alleged involvement in the now-annulled hospitals privatisation deal. 
 
 The case resumed on Thursday in much calmer settings than the previous first hearing, when rowdy cheering crowds gathered outside the Valletta law courts to support Muscat. 
 The case involves a deal, originally struck in 2015, in which the management of three of the country’s hospitals was handed over to Vitals, a private company, with no experience in healthcare. The concessionaire changed to Stewart Healthcare in 2018.
 At the very start of Thursday's hearing, presiding Magistrate Rachel Montebello mapped the way forward, making it clear the sitting would not extend beyond 3pm, thus directing the parties to make good use of the allocated time, avoiding useless and repetitive questions. 
 It was one of the prosecuting officers who stole the limelight when he was called to the witness stand after the court upheld the defence’s request to produce him as their witness to shed light on how criminal charges had been issued. 
 This information was important for the defence to decide whether to contest the evidence produced so far by the prosecution on a prima facie level.
 The defence argued that the law granted this right to the defence at this early stage of the proceedings before the court decreed whether there was sufficient prima facie evidence for those charged to stand trial on indictment. 
  Failure to allow such witnesses would result in defective proceedings.
 The magistrate upheld that argument and inspector Wayne Rodney Borg, one of the prosecutors, took the stand.
 Defence lawyers fired a series of questions in rapid succession, all basically focusing on the police work done in relation to the Vitals case. 
 Over and over, the inspector explained that that work was limited to assisting the inquiring magistrate by serving notices of summons to those called before her. Other officers were involved in searches ordered by the magistrate. 
 But police “absolutely had no visibility on the inquiry” and did not carry out any parallel investigation. 
 Grilled about his involvement in pressing charges, Borg insisted he had only signed the charges as prosecutor but not as investigator. 
 The decision not to investigate was taken “collectively” with his superiors.
 Asked to identify his “superiors” the inspector named superintendent Hubert Cini, Assistant Commissioner Fabian Fleri and Commissioner Angelo Gafa’. 
 Police “relied on the conclusions of the inquiry,” said Borg, explaining how he had read the proces verbal and most of its appendices. 
 They also consulted the Attorney General herself who was present at a meeting attended by the inspector and three lawyers from her office, currently handling the prosecution. 
 “So you simply parroted what you read in the conclusions,” said defence lawyer Giannella de Marco, suggesting that the police had acted as “parrots” and “postmen”.
 Questioned about whether police had sent for any of the suspects to get their version before pressing charges, the witness invariably gave the same reply. 
 “The police did not investigate… We relied on the inquiry,” said the inspector, who admitted this was the first inquiry he was dealing with.  
 The inspector said he was aware that the inquiring magistrate had sent for Joseph Muscat to give his version. But was not aware that the former prime minister had not done so because of “constitutional proceedings he had instituted.” 
 Muscat’s lawyer, Vincent Galea, asked about a letter sent to the police commissioner by Muscat who wished to give his version. 
 The inspector knew about that letter. But, again, Muscat was not sent for because police had decided to rely on the magisterial conclusions. 
 Lawyer Jason Grima, assisting auditor Christopher Spiteri, said he wished to summon Borg’s predecessor in the case, former police inspector Anthony Scerri, to ask further questions about how police issued charges for an alleged €20 million fraud. 
 That request was upheld and the court ordered that Scerri was to testify in the next sittings. 
 Lawyer Franco Debono, assisting Sciacca Grill Ltd, together with lawyer David Bonello, made one last argument. 
 Since money laundering laws allow suspects to produce a “reasonable excuse” and given that in this case, police had not taken the suspects’ version before pressing charges, their action could result in a potential breach of fundamental human rights. 
 The defence reserved its right to act accordingly at the opportune stage, Debono said. 
 The case continues next week.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/love-islander-story-suicide-attempt-sparks-mental-health.1094390,"A Love Island Malta contestant who shared her story of surviving a self harm attempt at the age of 14 has sparked a mental health awareness campaign. 
 Tamika Ross spoke out during the popular reality TV show on Sunday about her struggles with mental health as a young teenager.
 “When I was about 13, I was very alone at school and home, and I was struggling a real lot with my mental health,” she said. ""And at 14, I had an attempt.”  
 A day after the episode aired, the contestants began wearing green wristbands with the slogan Mental Health Matters and carrying the national mental health helpline 1579. They will wear the wristbands for the remainder of the popular series. 
  The 19-year-old contestant said she shared her story because she thinks many people take mental health for granted and that there should be more awareness towards it.
  ""So many people are struggling and pretending to be good but aren't. Often the people who are smiling the most or making jokes are the ones who are really struggling. I just think there should be more awareness,"" she said.
 ""It is time to talk about it and bring attention towards it.""
 She had shared her story as part of a segment where contestants were encouraged to share important character-developing life experiences that could positively impact others.
 After the episode aired, many people took to social media to praise the teen for her courage in sharing her experience and encouraging her to stay strong.
  The 1579 Mental Health Helpline is a 24-hour national telephone helpline that provides immediate and free emotional support, advice and practical guidance for anyone in need.
 A spokesperson from the ministry of health said ever since the helpline launched in November 2022 around 13,000 people have called in asking for help. 
 Ross was not the only contestant who shared a vulnerable story on Sunday’s episode.
 Another contestant,  Miriam Muscat, shared her experience with a silent miscarriage, while a third, Kyonne Gravina shared what it was like growing up with a father with a criminal past.
 Before entering the villa, he had told Times of Malta that he wanted to use his experience on Love Island ""to show people that I’m different"".

https://timesofmalta.com/article/hospitals-deal-how-get-here.1091958,"It’s crunch time for the hospitals’ investigation.
 After nearly five years, a magistrate has handed 72 boxes of evidence to the Attorney General, indicating criminal wrongdoing in the deal.
 Ex-prime minister Joseph Muscat has already broken his own bad news: “I know I’ll be charged” he said at a press conference last Tuesday, hot on the heels of the inquiry being concluded.
 The details of the inquiry’s findings are not yet public.
 Muscat’s government signed off on a €4 billion deal handing three public hospitals to Vitals Global Healthcare (VGH).
 Despite the grandiose name, the investors behind Vitals had no tangible track record in healthcare.
 The deal was “fraudulent” from day one, the Auditor General and a civil court have previously ruled.
 Why?
 Muscat’s government secretly signed a memorandum of understanding with the investors, behind everyone’s back.
 The government then went through the show of issuing a competitive tender.
 Lo-and-behold, the same investors who signed the secret deal then went on to win the tender.
 It didn’t last long.
 By the end of 2017, Vitals was facing financial ruin, and the Karin Grech, St Luke’s and Gozo hospitals showed little sign of the promised investment.
 Seemingly out of thin air, another company – Steward Health Care – was endorsed by the government to run the hospitals.
 Ex-Vitals director Ram Tumuluri claims top government officials conspired with Steward to kick him and Vitals out.
 The deal with Steward too, would end in tears. A civil court terminated their contract last year, claiming both Vitals and Steward defrauded the government.
 An appeals court went a step further.
 Both the investors and government officials were complicit in the fraud, a panel of three judges, including the chief justice, ruled.
 Despite the strong words, the judgment in the civil court meant little in terms of criminal repercussions on the government officials involved.
 Until now.
  Muscat didn’t just oversee the “fraudulent deal.” He is suspected to have secretly profited from it.
 Weeks after resigning as prime minister, Muscat suddenly started receiving monthly payments of €15,000 from two Swiss companies, Accutor Consulting and SpringX Media. 
 On the face of it, the companies had nothing to do with either Vitals or Steward.
 A money trail uncovered by Times of Malta in 2021 showed otherwise. Accutor was used by Steward to funnel payoffs to the Vitals investors. Millions of euros and dollars were paid into Accutor by Steward.
 In March 2020, Muscat popped up on the receiving end of payments from Accutor.  Muscat claims these payments were for legitimate consultancy work.
 Bogus consultancy agreements are a common tool used to launder payments stemming from corruption. Such agreements give a clean air to dirty money. 
 This is the first time an ex-prime minister has faced a real possibility of prosecution.
 Staring down the barrel of criminal charges, Muscat vehemently denies wrongdoing.
 “Bring it on. I am bracing myself for it and I will fight it to win it,” he said last week.
  Keith Schembri and Konrad Mizzi, the ex-prime minister’s left and right-hand men, will likely face corruption charges.
 The trio have been joined at the hip since 2013, when Labour first shot to power.
 Muscat made Mizzi the public face of the hospitals’ deal. Schembri, as ever, was the one pulling the strings in the background.
 The entire negotiation procedure between VGH and the government remains steeped in mystery. The government committee that led the contract negotiations with VGH failed to retain any documentation relating to its work, according to an audit.
 
 Auditor General Charles Deguara has accused Mizzi of “misleading” his cabinet colleagues over certain financial aspects of a side deal with Steward.
 Mizzi denies wrongdoing.
 The ex-health minister has also been accused of “shirking responsibility” for the deal and refusing to cooperate with the Auditor General.
 Furthermore, Mizzi is said to have consistently signed off on changes to the original deal, that appeared to solely favour VGH’s interests, rather than the government’s.
 It is not yet known whether the magisterial inquiry has uncovered payments to Mizzi or Schembri in connection with the deal.
 Mizzi’s home was searched in 2021 and his mobile phone seized in connection with the inquiry.
 Schembri is known to have visited Accutor’s Swiss offices when he was still Muscat’s chief of staff.
 E-mails made public by Steward indicate Schembri played a key role in securing the company’s takeover of the deal from VGH.
 Both Schembri and Mizzi have kept a low profile since exiting politics in November 2019.
 Schembri was charged with money-laundering in 2021, but not in connection with the hospitals’ deal.
  Mizzi’s successor as health minister, Chris Fearne, as well as ex-finance minister Edward Scicluna are also reportedly facing the prospects of criminal charges.
 Both men have always publicly and privately distanced themselves from the “fraudulent” deal. However, this very inaction may prove to be their downfall.
 As the Auditor General put it, the finance ministry was not even consulted about the privatisation deal.
 Allowing this situation was a “gross shortcoming” in financial management of public funds, in a deal conservatively valued at €4 billion, the Auditor General said.
 Scicluna once famously said Muscat’s government had an inner core – including Mizzi and Schembri, who took decisions in a “kitchen cabinet”, behind the backs of other ministers.
 The ex-finance minister may very well have to answer in court why he let Muscat, Schembri and Mizzi cook up the hospitals’ deal in the kitchen cabinet, without trying to intervene and safeguard public money.
 Fearne too has come under fire for his backseat role in the deal.
 He famously welcomed Steward as the “real deal” in 2017, when they took over from Vitals.
 Although Fearne appeared to have been sidelined during negotiations with Steward, questions have been raised about why he failed to intervene and use his clout as health minister to put an end to the shenanigans.
 Fearne denied any wrongdoing in a statement on Friday.
 “I have no doubt there will be the same conclusions this time around. I have never broken any law or ministerial ethics,” the minister said, pointing out, however, that he could only speak on his behalf.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/maltese-missionaries-grapple-deadly-malaria-outbreak.1097435,"Maltese missionaries in Ethiopia are turning to the public for help to buy medicines as they grapple with an unusual, widespread and deadly malaria outbreak in a region they have been working in for 30 years.
 The Maltese missionaries run more than 100 schools and clinics that they have built over the decades in the Jimma Bonga region of Kaffa, Ethiopia.
 The region has long been plagued by other diseases and poverty challenges. But malaria was never one of them, and the devastating outbreak that has struck in recent months caught them off guard and left them struggling to provide enough medication for everyone.
 Nobody – not even the state authorities – is entirely sure what caused the outbreak, but they believe the effects of climate change could have played a part.
  Malaria is a mosquito-borne disease that can be prevented and cured but, in poor countries with lack of hygiene and proper medication, it can kill its victims. Its symptoms range from fever, chills and headaches to organ failure.
  It is particularly dangerous for young children, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems. Malaria is prevalent in some parts of Africa due to the warm, humid climates, a lack of access to healthcare, mosquito nets and anti-malaria drugs as well as inadequate infrastructure, poor sanitation and lack of proper housing.
 Fr Alex Cauchi, director of the Moviment Missjunarju Ġesù fil-Proxxmu, visited the group’s missionaries in the region a few weeks ago. He said that, shortly after he landed, he had to witness the funeral of a 15-year-old boy – who was otherwise healthy – but had been bitten by a malaria-infected mosquito two days earlier.
 “Wherever I went, people spoke to me about relatives they lost to the disease recently,” he said.
 The missionaries have been providing education and healthcare for decades but their clinics have now been overwhelmed with patients seeking treatment.
 They are now appealing to the Maltese public to help raise funds for antimalarial drugs, which are in short supply and expensive in the region.
 “We know there is a cure but the government does not provide it and in pharmacies it’s either extremely expensive or out of stock,” he said.
 A telethon will be held on Sunday and broadcast live on TVM, NET, ONE and Xejk, from 11am to 11pm, to raise money for this critical cause and also in aid of the group’s other projects in Africa and South America.

 A spokesman from the Maltese Olympic Committee confirmed that Gatt was tested after the race and returned a positive outcome.
 The Maltese swimmer said after the race that she did not feel at her best during the race.
 Gatt is the latest swimmer to test positive for COVID-19 at the Paris Olympics as several swimmers and waterpolo players were hit by the virus in the past few days in the French capital.
 The most high-profile casualty so far has been Britain’s two-time Olympic champion Adam Peaty who felt unwell after winning silver in the 100m breaststroke on Sunday.
 On Tuesday morning, Gatt was well below her best in the 1,500 metres heats at the Paris La Defense Arena on Tuesday.
 Lining up in the first heat of the race, Gatt was up against two other swimmers, namely Singapore’s Ching Hwee Gan and Chile’s Kristel Kobrich.
 Gan dominated the race from start to finish as she cruised home in 16 minutes 10 seconds and 13 seconds.
 Kobrich took second spot when clocking a time of 16:27.18.
 Maltese swimmer Gatt finished a distant third with a time of 17.00.54. Her effort was over 22 seconds slower than her own national record of 16:38.75 she had set in Rome in 2021.
 This was Gatt’s only assignment at the 2024 Games and was representing Malta in her second Olympic Games.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/activists-place-resign-banner-central-bank-pressure-builds-scicluna.1096011,"Activists placed a large banner with the word 'resign' on it outside the Central Bank on Monday as pressure builds on governor Edward Scicluna to step down.
 The NGO Repubblika held a demonstration at the Central Bank demanding Scicluna leave his post after a court found there was enough evidence for him to face trial for fraud related to the privatisation of three hospitals. 
 ""Edward Scicluna, if you have a shred of dignity, go,"" NGO president Vicki Ann Cremona said. ""Time will tell whether you are guilty, but the sense of responsibility to your country should compel you to resign. Step down now, without delay.""
  The civil society protest echoes calls from the Opposition for Scicluna to go, while Prime Minister Robert Abela has strongly indicated he should resign. 
 Last week Scicluna was removed from his role as deputy governor of the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA).
 And on Sunday, Times of Malta reported that the government is planning to   attempt to axe him from his role through a cabinet decision if he continues to refuse to step down and has already found a replacement for the role.
 Scicluna might have a legal argument to challenge the government decision and he told Times of Malta last week that the Central Bank has  its own rules and neither the government nor the opposition can compel him to resign.
 
 Scicluna was appointed Central Bank governor in 2021 and his term is meant to lapse in 2026.
  Around 20 people took part in the short demonstration on Monday morning. 
 Cremona said Scicluna was being egoistic, because he was clinging to his seat, despite knowing that he could be pushing away foreign investment to the country, putting people's jobs at risk.
 ""If he resigns, he won't die of hunger, mind you. He will have at least three pensions - one as a former MEP, another as a former minister, and another as a professor - and they're not the minimum pensions many people have,"" she said.
 ""Let us remind you that he had also gotten a €100,000 severance package to leave his ministerial job. We hope he's not expecting some other similar package to leave this role, because we will not accept that.""
  Cremona also said that Repubblika has formally asked the European Central Bank (ECB) to sack him.
 Calls for Scicluna's resignation started in May when he, along with former deputy prime minister Chris Fearne and 13 others, was arraigned in court over charges of fraud, misappropriation and fraudulent gain related to the hospitals deal.
 They all insist on their innocence, but Fearne had resigned immediately whereas Scicluna did not.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/joseph-muscat-insists-30-million-assets-freeze-excessive.1094501,"Former prime minister Joseph Muscat is challenging a €30 million freezing order imposed on his assets as part of criminal proceedings related to the hospitals deal.
 The assets freeze was imposed last month when Muscat was charged with money laundering, bribery and corruption, among a host of other charges related to the deal that saw three state hospitals handed over to Vitals Global Healthcare. He pleaded not guilty.
 Lawyers for Muscat have filed an application challenging the freezing order in court, saying that the sum of €30 million was inflated and that any freezing order with respect to Muscat should instead be limited to the €60,000 mentioned in the proces verbal of the magisterial inquiry that led to the arraignment.
 The lawyers insisted that before issuing the freezing order, the court should have itself been convinced that there was enough evidence to justify the amounts, instead of simply resting on the assertions of the prosecution that it was so.
 Lawyer Ishmael Psaila also pointed out that earlier this week a lack of clear evidence had seen a freezing order issued against Sciacca Grill lifted. That solidified the need for the prosecution to substantially prove how it drew up the figures listed in the freezing order.
 In his rebuttal, prosecutor Francesco Refalo said that the court at its discretion, may see fit to approve a freezing order if there was valid reason to do so and when the charges made against the accused supported the issuance of such an order.
 The prosecution, he said, had followed the letter of the law when drafting the freezing orders and that the amounts requested for the assets freeze related to the circumstances of the case. Refalo added that it was not the competence of the court hearing this challenge to decide on the merits of the case, but only to decide whether there was a valid enough reason to issue the freezing order or not.
 During the same proceedings, lawyer Stefano Filletti, appearing for Adrian Hillman, who stands accused of fraud and money laundering, argued that there was no documentary evidence to support issuing a freezing order against him and said that he had been targeted simply due to his friendship with Keith Schembri, Muscat's former chief of staff -who is also one of the accused.
 Pointing out that he would be resting on similar points of law to rebut all the defendants challenging the freezing order, Refalo went on to tell the court that he wished to compare the situation to when freezing orders were signed off during an arraignment. When a person was arraigned under arrest and the prosecution requested a freezing order, the court would not have seen any evidence to support this request and it based its decision on the circumstances around the charges.
 Similarly, he said, in this case, freezing orders were based on similar circumstances.
 Lawyers for Sciacca Grill also briefly made submissions during proceedings. On Tuesday, Magistrate Rachel Montebello discharged Sciacca Grill, a company that operates a chain of restaurants, from proceedings due to the prosecution failing to sufficiently prove why it had been included in proceedings. The prosecution held that the company, which once had ties to Keith Schembri, had skimmed money off contracts it received to supply the state hospitals. But lawyers Franco Debono and David Bonello successfully argued that the prosecution did not produce a shred of evidence to substantiate its claims.
 In court on Wednesday, Debono requested the court to note that, given the previous day’s events, the effects of the freezing order on the company had been extinguished due to a lack of prima facie evidence and out of “extreme caution” he asked the court to declare this as fact.
 Lawyer Edward Gatt, representing Keith Schembri and Konrad Mizzi, requested a constitutional reference on the current laws that regulate freezing orders, as in their current form they may present a situation in which the accused’s right to a fair hearing could be breached.
 Gatt said that in relation to this, proceedings had become “frustrating and tedious” and were becoming an obstacle to people being able to attain justice.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/new-sexual-health-strategy-free-emergency-contraception-condoms.1102251,"Emergency contraception should be added to the national formulary and condoms distributed for free, a long-awaited sexual health strategy unveiled on Tuesday recommends. 
 The strategy has now been opened to public consultation for feedback before it is finalised. 
 Health Minister Jo Etienne Abela launched the two-month consultation for the National Sexual Health Strategy 2025-2030 on Tuesday, and he described it as being “grounded in robust research”.
 The strategy aims to be inclusive and equitable to all populations including migrants, people with disabilities and LGBTIQ+ individuals, he said.
 “No strategy is perfect. It would be childish to expect it to be perfect in any way… This does not detract from the basic truth – that sexuality and sexual behaviour is individual, private,” he said as he called on the public to have their say during the consultation process.
 The public consultation for this strategy will be open for two months and begins on 11 December.
 To prevent the spread of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), the strategy suggests providing free condoms to anyone aged over 16. Adding the emergency contraception pill to the national formulary will help make it more accessible, it adds. 
  The emergency contraception pill, also known as the morning-after pill, was not available in Malta until 2016 when it was made legal and started being sold over the counter at pharmacies.  
 Abela also kept to a promise made a year ago, as the strategy proposes free preventive treatment against HIV for those who are at risk of contracting the virus.
 Treatments include PrEP and PEP: PrEP is a medication taken before sexual activity and reduces the risk of HIV transmission. PEP is a treatment that needs to be taken within 72 hours after a high-risk sexual encounter.
 This is the first time that Malta's sexual health strategy has been updated in 14 years.
 To this day, Malta's sexual health public policies are based on a strategy that was published in 2010 and was already considered outdated by GU Clinic doctors at the time of publication.
 An updated policy was originally meant to be released in 2021 but was sent back to the drawing board, because the research it was based on was found to be years out of date. Its revision was further delayed by the COVID pandemic. 
 The launch comes just days after Malta held its first-ever rally for World AIDS Day, underscoring the importance of timely and effective sexual health policies.
 Superintendent of Public Health Charmaine Gauci said it was important that everyday people felt a sense of ownership of the strategy, as sexual health was part of everyday life.
  The strategy direction was aligned with a World Health Organisation action plan and other EU policies and strategies, she said. Available data was evaluated, various stakeholder meetings were carried out and current government policy documents were reviewed. The public was also surveyed in 2022 and 2023. 
 “The vision is that we need to ensure that all members of the population...are enabled and supported to receive reproductive support,” Gauci said.
 Gauci also pointed out that Malta's rate of all STIs, except for chlamydia, is higher than the EU average. 
 Alexia Bezzina, a consultant in public health medicine, gave an overview of the strategy document and its recommendations.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/health-authorities-detect-first-case-mpox-malta.1097389,"The first case of mpox of the year has been detected in Malta, health authorities announced on Friday. 
 At this stage, authorities have not identified whether it is the new variant of the virus, which has sparked global alarm.
 The patient, who represents an imported case of the disease, which was sexually transmitted, is clinically stable and does not require hospital admission. 
 A health ministry spokesperson said the patient has been isolated and that contact tracing is underway to prevent further transmission. 
  The ministry urged the public to take the following precautions to reduce the risk of mpox transmission: 
 Malta first detected earlier strains of mpox in 2022, with the first case reported in May when the patient returned from overseas in a country where several cases of the virus had been detected. 
 By August of that year, the number of cases had shot up to 31, with Malta registering the fifth-highest incidence rate of mpox in Europe at the time. 
 Later the government made a vaccine available to primary contacts of mpox patients free of charge. 
 The UN health agency says on its website that mpox spreads between people mainly through close physical contact with someone who has the virus.
 ""Close contact includes skin-to-skin (such as touching or sex) and mouth-to-mouth, or mouth-to-skin contact (such as kissing),"" it says.
 It can also include ""being face-to-face with someone who has mpox (such as talking or breathing close to one another, which can generate infectious respiratory particles)"".
 WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris said Tuesday that if a person with the virus had lesions, ""if you're talking closely to someone, breathing on them, physically close, face-to-face, there is a possibility"" of viral spread, ""but this is a minor source"".
 Instead, ""what we're seeing is the close, physical skin-to-skin"" contact as the chief route of transmission, she told a briefing in Geneva.
 ""When you're talking to somebody, you're spitting out droplets,"" but ""it's not a very major form of transmission - and it's not a... through-the-air, long-distance sort of transmission"".
 ""More research is needed to fully understand the transmission dynamics,"" Harris added.
 The WHO recommends the use of facemasks for those with mpox, their close contacts and health workers treating them.
 There are two subtypes of mpox: Clade 1, endemic in the Congo Basin in central Africa; and Clade 2, endemic in West Africa.
 The surge in the DR Congo is being driven by surges of two different Clade 1 strains.
 The first is an outbreak in northwest DRC of what was previously known as Clade 1, now called Clade 1a.
 The second, in northeastern DRC, is a new offshoot of Clade 1 called Clade 1b, which was first detected in September last year and is spreading rapidly.
 The spread of Clade 1b, and its detection in nearby countries, were the main reasons behind the WHO sounding its top emergency alarm.
 Clade 1 mpox is known to be more virulent than Clade 2 mpox and has a higher fatality rate.
 As for whether Clade 1b is more dangerous than Clade 1a, Harris said: ""We don't have that data."" 
 ""Studies are underway to understand the properties of the new strain. But available epidemiological data doesn't really suggest that the clade 1b variant causes more severe cases and deaths.""

 The funds will help Maltese missionaries in Ethiopia to buy medicines as they grapple with an unusual, widespread and deadly malaria outbreak in a region they have been working in for 30 years.
 The Maltese missionaries run more than 100 schools and clinics that they have built over the decades in the Jimma Bonga region of Kaffa, Ethiopia.
 The region has long been plagued by other diseases and poverty challenges.
 But malaria was never one of them, and the devastating outbreak that has struck in recent months caught them off guard and left them struggling to provide enough medication for everyone.
 Nobody – not even the state authorities – is entirely sure what caused the outbreak, but they believe the effects of climate change could have played a part.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/woman-given-weeks-live-throws-party-celebrate-life.1096143,"A terminally ill woman who decided to throw a party after being told she could have weeks left to live said she is determined to celebrate life “second by second”.
 Nicky Sansone, 55, threw “a party in celebration of my life” in St Julian’s last Saturday after fearing she might not make it to her birthday on August 24.
 “We had to bring it forward because they don’t think I will make it until then. It ended up being a bigger event with over 120 people. I was overwhelmed,” she says.
  Sansone started documenting her story on TikTok after she was diagnosed with cancer in November. The video she shared of her birthday party had more than 23,000 views as people inundated her with messages of admiration and support.
 She uses her channel to share her own views about the importance of enjoying life and to urge people to check out any cancer symptoms immediately.
 “Smile, live, love and enjoy life to the fullest,” is the message she wants to leave behind.
 “For many people, it’s life-work-life-work. They forget to live. The world has become so sad. Enjoy life. Stop fighting. Stop complaining. Live. People worry about such stupid things.  I did too. Now, if I go for a drive, I appreciate seeing the sea twice as much as before.
 “Some people don’t cherish what they have until it’s gone. So, if you have something and it’s good focus on the good,” she says as she sits in a hospital bed at the Sir Anthony Mamo Oncology Centre where she was recently moved into palliative care.
 Sansone believes her symptoms started when she started losing weight about three years ago. Back then she attributed the weight loss to the fact that she had cut alcohol from her life completely.
 “I had gone through a rough patch and alcohol had become a problem. I decided I had to stop and I did. It’s been three years and two months now,” she says. After changing her lifestyle to a healthier one, she started walking and swimming regularly.
  In November, she went for a swim with a friend and got so breathless that she had to get out of the water. She went to a doctor who sent her to get an X-ray immediately.
 She went to hospital and tests showed that her lungs were full of water. Doctors extracted 500ml from each lung. They tested the liquid and found traces of cancer. Further tests showed it likely originated from her ovaries and spread throughout her body. She was diagnosed with stage 4 aggressive cancer and began chemotherapy.
 Sansone says she carried out smear tests over the years but was not regular with them and skipped them occasionally.
 Things went well initially.  The plan was to operate to remove the tumours spread around her body but when surgeons opened her up they realised the cancer had spread and it was too risky to do anything.
 They changed her treatment and tried different options until the oncologist told her that there was not much more that could be done.
 “I asked: ‘how much do I have?’ She said: ‘it’s hard to say’.”
 That was when she decided to throw a party to celebrate her life.
 Among those present were many from the LGBTIQ community who turned up to thank Sansone for her contribution. In a Facebook post shared after the party, the MGRM described her as “an important person in Malta’s LGBTIQ history and an amazing, beloved woman who changed many people’s lives…”
 They described how she was one of the first women who offered LGBTIQ people a space, through opening Gaiety, in Paceville around 30 years ago  and, later, when she opened Nix Bar, in St Julian’s.
 Back then, in the 1990s, the gay community had no place to go, recalls Sansone who witnessed the change unfold as people no longer felt they had to hide.
 “I’m overwhelmed. I still can’t believe what’s happening… I had opened gay bars but did not expect recognition,” she says.
 She goes on to add that, as an animal lover, her main worry for the future is leaving her two cats Tiger and Billy – but she knows they will be in safe hands as her friends will be taking them in.
 Her cats feature in some of her TikTok posts where she talks about how “they know”.
 Apart from her treatment journey, her posts also document happy moments such as when her avocado plant sprouts, scenes from a recent trip to Sicily and getting her favourite ice cream from a kiosk in Baħar iċ-Ċagħaq.
 She also laughs at herself such as at how, because of a side effect of chemo on vision, she must use a magnifying glass to check the expiry date on the eggs in her fridge.
 Her videos also contain messages of awareness about regular health checks. She talks about having ADHD and OCD and her determination to fight to continue living and to try to remain positive despite the good and bad moments.
 Throughout her videos, where she thanks her followers for their kind words and support, she repeats the message to “enjoy life to the fullest”.
 “In my posts, I tried to be as positive as possible telling people to enjoy life and not take it for granted as you never know what’s round the corner. Your perception of life changes so much when you are in this situation. I’ve forgiven people who have done me wrong. Because... Why? Like this, my mind is at peace,” she says.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/government-planning-convert-mount-carmel-old-people-home-minister.1097448,"Mount Carmel hospital will be converted into a home for the elderly, Health Minister Jo Etienne Abela has announced
 Speaking during an Fliving debate with PN MP Adrian Delia, Abela said the government plans to phase out the psychiatric services offered by the hospital. 
 Instead, the government plans to convert the hospital into a ""second St Vincent De Paul"". 
 He said the Attard hospital is ideal for this use. 
 In May, the government initiated a four-year plan to close down Mount Carmel.  
 He cautioned that improving the healthcare service is not just about ""new buildings."" 
 The minister said adequate human resources, including foreign workers, were needed. 
 Abela also announced that Mater Dei Hospital will be offering ""after-hours"" operations during the week and on Sundays, in a bid to cut down waiting lists. 
 Pressure on the country's healthcare service came into sharp focus this week after a 55-year-old man died at Mater Dei Hospital's emergency waiting room where he was left waiting despite allegedly complaining of chest pain.  
 Abela has announced an inquiry into the death. 
 The minister has previously announced plans to increase the number of round-the-clock health centres in Malta from three to five.
 Another project - the Paola Health Centre - has been plagued by delays. 
 The government is mulling severing ties with the contractor responsible for the Paola health hub after a series of missed deadlines in the project’s final stages means it has been unable to open its doors to the public.
 Although construction work has been completed, sources say the contractor has missed as many as 17 deadlines in recent months, most linked to certification and quality control.
 Ex-prime minister Joseph Muscat and a slew of other former government officials are facing charges linked to corruption in the health sector.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/the-footballer-got-sight-back-i-saw-three-footballs-instead-one.1097585,"Judy Kandal’s dream to one day play football in Saudi Arabia was almost cut short when his vision began to blur  and he was “seeing three footballs instead of one”.
 Eye tests revealed that the 21-year-old had an eye condition known as keratoconus in which his cornea – the clear, dome-shaped front of his eye – became thinner and gradually bulged outward into a cone shape.
 This resulted in distorted vision because the job of the cornea is the refraction of light and focusing.
 Five months ago, he underwent a partial cornea transplant and is now about to resume his passion and play football again.
  “If my life was at 60%, I feel like it’s at 90% now,” said Judy as he sat for an interview in the operating theatre at St Thomas Hospital where, five months ago, transplant surgeon Andre Grixti replaced part of his cornea.
 Judy, who is Kurdish, moved to Malta when he was three years old. He was born in Turkey and his family then moved to Syria and, later, Iraq. In 2006, during the Iraqi civil war, the family came to Malta where they had other relatives, including Judy’s grandparents.
 “We came for a better future and Malta was able to provide that and I’m very thankful for that,” he says.
 Judy attended primary and secondary school in Malta and went on to become a restaurant manager. Football has been a great love of his since he picked up a ball at the age of six.
  “I started playing with Ħamrun Spartans and spent eight years there. Then, I moved to Melita for a year… There was an activity for players who wanted to try joining the Stoke City FC Academy in the UK. I went for it and got chosen but, a week before I was meant to go to London, my grandfather died of cancer, so I did not go,” he says.
 The promising striker was also shortlisted to play with Malta’s national team but could not be part of the squad as he does not have Maltese citizenship.
 Then, about three years ago, round about the time when he joined Gżira United, he started noticing that something was wrong with his vision.
 “My vision was so clear before but, as years passed, I started noticing my vision was going blurry. At work, I couldn’t see clearly when taking bookings… when playing football, I would see three balls rather than one.”
 At first, he thought this could be a symptom of exhaustion. But, after some time, he went to see a doctor.
 His doctor was Grixti who is leading a new programme of full and partial cornea transplants at St Thomas Hospital, a private hospital in Qormi.
 The hospital recently began performing transplants with corneas from abroad after entering a strategic partnership with a European tissue bank – Banc De Sang Teixits.
  Based in Barcelona, Spain, the organ bank is supplying donated corneas to patients at St Thomas Hospital. This means they do not have to rely on the limited local cornea donations.
 Grixti explains that the cornea is made of three main layers: the outer layer, or epithelium, the stroma and the inner endothelium. 
 “Conventionally, a full transplant is carried out that replaces the full cornea. However, certain diseases affect a particular layer of the cornea, and we have now moved to partial transplants,” he said.
 One condition that benefits from this type of partial transplant is keratoconus – Judy’s condition.
 In this case, the intervention carried out is called a deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK) that involves replacing the two top layers and keeping the inner layer, which is the one that leads to most corneal rejection. This also means a faster recovery time for the patient.
 Judy has about a month left before he can be cleared to return back to the pitch. Now that his operation has been successful, he has set his sight beyond Maltese shores.
 “I dream to go to Saudi Arabia, or any Middle Eastern country, to play football,” he says.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/no-cases-mpox-registered-malta-health-ministry.1096935,"No mpox cases have been registered in Malta this year, the health ministry said on Monday while advising those travelling to affected countries to take precautions to avoid contracting the virus.
 Health authorities were ""closely monitoring any potential cases"" and had strengthened surveillance systems to detect and respond to suspected cases of mpox, it said in a statement.
 “Early diagnosis is crucial, and the public is being informed about recognising the symptoms,” the ministry said less than a week after the World Health Orgnisation (WHO) declared mpox a global public health emergency.
 The virus, formerly called monkeypox, causes fever, muscular aches and large boil-like skin lesions.
 The ministry said people living in or travelling to affected countries, and those in close contact with affected communities were at “moderate’ risk of contracting the virus.
 Those travelling to the affected countries without close contact with the local community were considered at low risk, it said. 
 The ministry recommended avoiding close contact with people suffering from a rash resembling those caused by the virus, and to avoid contact with objects and materials used by those diagnosed with mpox.
 Rashes caused by mpox usually begin on the face before spreading to elsewhere on the body, and start as a flat sore which develops into an itchy or painful liquid-filled blister, according to the WHO. 
  The ministry encouraged the public to wash their hands frequently and employ alcohol-based hand sanitiser.
 Those with symptoms of the virus or who have had close contact with someone with symptoms are advised to speak to their family doctor about testing and treatment, it added. 
 Formerly called monkeypox, the virus was first discovered in humans in 1970 in what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
 It is an infectious disease caused by a virus transmitted to humans by infected animals but can also be passed from human to human through close physical contact.
 In May 2022, mpox infections surged worldwide, mostly affecting gay and bisexual men, due to the clade 2b subclade - a variant of mpox. In response, the WHO declared a public health emergency which lasted from July 2022 to May 2023. 
 A global public health emergency is the highest alarm level under International Health Regulations, which are legally binding on 196 countries. 
 Back in 2022, Malta's monkeypox case rate was one of the highest in Europe.
 That outbreak, which has now largely subsided, caused some 140 deaths out of around 90,000 cases.
 The clade 1b subclade, which has been surging in the DRC since September 2023, causes more severe disease than clade 2b, with a higher fatality rate.
 The WHO warned that more Clade 1 mpox cases were likely to be confirmed in Europe soon after Sweden announced the first case outside Africa.
 Last week, the Democratic Republic of Congo said the mpox outbreak had killed 548 people there so far this year.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/duo-planning-sicilytomalta-kayak4kate.1097444,"Three months after getting into a kayak for the first time, Andrew Pisani is planning to paddle 100 kilometres between Malta and Sicily for charity.
 The 42-year-old Caritas worker will set out with personal trainer Robert Scerri, 43, from Marina di Ragusa on the morning of September 29 and plans to arrive at around 5 pm in Exiles, Sliema.
 Their biggest supporter will be five-year-old Kate Feriggi, as the challenge aims to raise funds for therapy to help her live with Tatton-Brown Rahman Syndrome.
 Kate is one of just 200 people in the world with the condition, characterised by physical and intellectual disabilities.
  Pisani volunteered to join Scerri, an avid kayaker, when he first heard about the challenge, dubbed Kayak4Kate.
 “I didn’t think it would be that hard,” he laughs. “I feel the pressure but I know we can do it.”
 The duo are training rigorously, spending six days a week in the gym and on the water, with their longest kayaking session so far being 65km in a single day. They have so far managed to raise €10,000.
 During the challenge, they will be supported by a boat carrying around 10 people, who will provide nutrition, guidance and also emotional support.
 Kate will track their progress from abroad, where she will be undergoing therapy.
 “She will be with us in spirit and online,” said Scerri, who was inspired to create the challenge after meeting Kate. “I am excited and confident we can do it.”
 Last year, Kate’s parents told Times of Malta how she requires three to four hours of therapy each day with the treatment costing €2,500 a month.
 Her mother said she is so thankful for the pair’s efforts to help her child.
 “To have friends like this is a blessing for us,” she said.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/he-innocent-even-not-crowds-voice-support-muscat.1093117,"Updated 12.30pm with longer video
 Joseph Muscat’s alleged role in a massive fraud that stole millions from Maltese pockets mattered little to the throngs of people who gathered outside the law courts in his support on Tuesday morning.
 “He’s one of the greatest people in Malta,” one demonstrator told Times of Malta. “I think he’s innocent, and even if he isn’t…. he lifted me up off the ground. I used to get a €570 pension, now I make over €900.”
 That sentiment was reflected in comments others gave Times of Malta.
 “He filled Malta with money,” one said. “He made us decent,” another said. “When he came to power, we started living.”
  Demonstrators filled Republic Square from 9am, well before Muscat and others were scheduled to be arraigned in court and charged with bribery, corruption, money laundering and other crimes.
 The former prime minister is among 14 people to face criminal charges on Tuesday in connection with the €4 billion, 30-year deal the Muscat government signed to privatise state hospitals.
 That deal was annulled by a civil court and panned by the National Audit Office, which drafted three separate reports about it. It was also flagged as a suspected criminal enterprise by experts engaged as part of a magisterial probe, which was concluded last month.
 Investigators found that money provided by Maltese taxes to run three state hospitals was moved through a convulted network of companies by professionals engaged by the deal’s key players. The misappropriation amounted to millions of euro.
 Muscat has denied any involvement and said the case is based on conjecture.
 All that mattered little to the people gathered in Republic Square on Tuesday morning.
 “This is a repetition of Christ’s story,” one man said, drawing parallels between Muscat’s prosecution and the persecution of Jesus Christ.
 The crowd – mostly older and largely male – chanted “Joseph, Joseph” as they waited for the former prime minister to show up.
 A Times of Malta reporter only spotted a handful of young people in the crowd, and none of them wanted to speak on camera. Most women asked to comment also declined to do so, or were stopped from doing so by their partner or friends.
 “When I emailed him at 1am, he replied the next day,” a man said when asked why he was there. “I think he’s to be taken more seriously than the courts. He’s a just man.”
 Labour Party officials have confided that they worry tempers could flare within the crowd.
 And there were slight signs of that as a Times of Malta reporter milled through the crowd, seeking people willing to talk about their presence there.
 “Are you a prophet?” one man barked as the reporter asked a demonstrator if he thought Muscat was innocent.
 
 “We’re here for Joseph, not to promote you,” a woman told journalists.
 Another grabbed the reporter’s arm, but was quickly escorted away and told off by other demonstrators. “He’s just doing his job,” another told the angry crowd circling the reporter.
 But while the crowds were keen to publicly back Muscat, in private some acknowledged they had concerns.
 “Police never take you to court for nothing,” one confided off-camera. “But I’m a Mintoffjan, I had to come today.”  
 The crowds were also less willing to back Muscat’s lieutenants Keith Schembri and Konrad Mizzi, who will also appear in court to face charges on Tuesday.
 “I can only speak about Joseph,” many said when asked if they believed Schembri and Mizzi were being framed, too.
 And one made it clear he was not just there because of the hospitals scandal. The Nationalist Party, he said, was the cause of many of Malta's current ills. 
 ""Traffic is all down to them [PN],"" he said. ""They didn't build a single road during their time in power, so now the government has to redo them all at once.""
 What about the increase in cars on Maltese roads? 
 ""Well obviously cars would increase, because before everyone went hungry and now there's work. Labour brought employment so people need to buy cars,"" he reasoned.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/six-elderly-hospitalised-july-heatwave.1096045,"Six elderly people were admitted to hospital because of health conditions exacerbated by the recent heatwaves.
 A health ministry spokesperson said the six patients, all over the age of 60, required hospitalisation between July 1 and 22.
 “On preliminary investigation into the reason for admission, these patients were not admitted as a direct consequence of heat-related incidents but because of some form of infection, mainly chest infection, causing fever that dehydrated them quicker because of the additional background heat,” the spokesperson explained.
 Malta and Gozo were this month hit by sporadic power outages amid high temperatures, with some localities experiencing power cuts that lasted for more than 20 hours.
 At the same time, the weatherman issued a yellow weather warning, as the air temperature was to rise to 36°C.
 Enemalta blamed the faults on heat damage to high-voltage cables. To control the situation, Enemalta installed 14 diesel-powered generators in various localities to cope with the crisis.
 Times of Malta reached out to the health ministry in the wake of the Superintendent of Public Health’s call for people to look out for vulnerable and elderly people. She revealed that a total of 80 “excess deaths” were recorded during a heatwave that hit Malta last summer.
 ‘Excess deaths’ refer to the number of deaths from all causes during a crisis above and beyond what would have been expected  under ‘normal’ conditions.
 The health spokesperson said there were no reported deaths due to direct effects of heat ‒ namely dehydration and heatstroke ‒ from July 1 to 22.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/watch-stroke-erased-speech-i-m-alive.1093016,"Ryan Armaoui is on a remarkable journey to regain his speech after a stroke seven months ago temporarily erased his ability to communicate.
 As he slowly rebuilds his vocabulary, the 28-year-old’s message is clear – there is always hope.
 Ryan has set up a Facebook support group – Malta Stroke Survivors – to help stroke survivors who might be struggling to pick up the pieces.
 “I want to help anyone. I cannot do much, but I can speak to them... I will try to speak to them. I found support and I want to be of support to others.”
 Before the stroke, Ryan was working as an assistant manager at Olea restaurant. Part of his work was being front of house and meeting and greeting patrons. “I like to speak a lot. This was a part of my job I loved,” says Ryan, recounting the day of the stroke.
 It was a Sunday lunchtime last October when he was stocktaking at the restaurant that forms part of the Salini Resort.
 “I felt a headache. It kept escalating. It felt as if my head was exploding. There was pressure. Imagine someone squeezing your hand. But instead of feeling it on the outside, you feel it inside your head. I knew this was not something I could control… I was OK at 1pm. I was far from OK at 3.30pm. I don’t remember anything after that.”
  Ryan passed out at work.
 Minutes before he collapsed, he told a colleague he was not feeling well and asked him to call his girlfriend – Sarah Camilleri. He knew something was seriously wrong. He was rushed to Mater Dei Hospital.
 For Ryan, this was a blur and his next memory is being in hospital and feeling confused.
 ‘I could not remember the words’
 When he regained consciousness, he could not understand what was being said. It was like people were speaking a foreign language. And when he tried to speak, he could not find the words.
 “I would know, for example, that a teacup is something you drink from. But I could not remember the word,” he says.
 Ryan had suffered a stroke, which is caused by blocked blood flow to the brain or sudden bleeding in the brain.
 According to Research Trust Malta, stroke is the most common cause of severe disability in Malta with one in four men and one in five women expected to have a stroke by age 85.
  In Ryan’s case, the stroke impacted the areas of the brain that control speech and language, which is known as aphasia. The stroke also affected his right peripheral vision on both eyes.
 “Language took the biggest hit. And it’s the thing I loved. I really like people. It bothered me a lot that I could not express myself: what I was seeing and thinking.”
 During those 10 days in hospital, some words started coming back slowly. Meanwhile, his girlfriend acted as his “interpreter”.
 “I would point at items, and she says the word. When I was in hospital, my girlfriend played the film Harry Potter. It was the movie we would watch at home when one of us was sick. Listening to it helped me remember words.
 “Learning was pretty fast. Once you learn the words, they stick. It’s like there is an ‘off’ button for each word and you have to switch them all back on,” he said, recalling that he would stammer to talk as he started the path to recovery.
 In January, a friend introduced him to tutor, Fabienne Buhagiar, and she started tutoring him to catch up on the lost language.
 His stammering improved as his vocabulary – in both Maltese and English – was rebuilt.
 But in the beginning of April, Ryan suffered an epileptic fit.
 His doctor told him this was not uncommon following a stroke. It forced him to slow down a bit and take things a bit easier, but did not impact the progress he had made.
 Things have changed since the stroke: he cannot drive and travelling is difficult.
 What did not change is his overall positive attitude towards life.
 “For me, it’s a daily thing to improve. I’m 28 and I’m fighting to make it. Whatever it takes, I need to find a way. It was hard to find someone who went through it. I want this to improve. More than anything, I wish to help others who are living through it.
 “You never know what’s going to happen. I have a routine where I kiss my girlfriend before leaving the house and she does the same. Thank God, that day I did. Imagine I did not. That would be really sad. The day of the stroke was a normal, routine day at work. It was a normal, good day. It wasn’t. But I’m alive.”

https://timesofmalta.com/article/bank-of-valletta-silent-36m-steward-loan-bankruptcy-filing.1092099,"Bank of Valletta remained tight-lipped on the future of the €36m loan given to Steward Health Care when contacted by Times of Malta, after the company filed for bankruptcy in a US court on Monday.
 In a written reply, BOV said that it “cannot comment publicly on confidential client matters”.
 “We reaffirm that we have in place very strong due diligence and credit governance processes that meet regulatory requirements and expectations. The Bank adheres to all its regulatory obligations and informs the market as needed,” a bank spokesperson said.
 BOV were asked whether the bank featured as a creditor in Steward’s bankruptcy filing and what action the bank took to recoup the funds.
 In a statement published on Tuesday afternoon, PN called on BOV to “clarify its position” on the loan in the wake of Steward’s bankruptcy.
 This needed to be done in the interest of “the hundreds of thousands of Maltese people who trust the bank with their money”, as well as for the sake of Malta’s financial system, the party said.
 Taxpayers to foot the bill in case of default
 BOV had granted Steward a series of loans throughout 2018 and 2019 amounting to just under €36m, raising questions by independent candidate Arnold Cassola over the due diligence carried out by the bank.
 The loans were guaranteed by the government, effectively meaning that taxpayers would be footing the bill if the company defaulted on the loan.
 It is unclear how much of these loans have been repaid.
 Last year, Justice Minister Jonathan Attard said that Steward had “kept up” with loan repayments, but the news of Steward’s bankruptcy suggests that the matter now lies in the hands of a Texas court.
 Steward took over the concession that had awarded St Luke’s Hospital, Karin Grech Hospital and Gozo General Hospital to Vitals Global Healthcare in 2018, but the company’s presence in Malta was short-lived.
 Maltese courts scrapped the deal altogether in early 2023, under the suspicion of fraud. The decision was confirmed on appeal later in the same year, with courts finding ""collusion between Steward and senior government officials or its agencies"".

https://timesofmalta.com/article/watch-doctorassisted-dying-start-debated-in-new-year.1102241,"Malta should start discussing the introduction of doctor-assisted dying “in the new year” with the UK Bill serving as a blueprint for the national debate, Health Minister Jo Etienne Abela said.
 He stressed that the government would continue enhancing efforts to improve palliative care - also known as end-of-life care.
 However, in extreme circumstances where there was no hope, assisted dying could apply.
 The Labour Party committed to commencing a national discussion on euthanasia.
 The 2022 general election manifesto  stated: “The time has come for a national, mature discussion on the introduction of voluntary euthanasia for terminally ill patients.”
 The minister echoed what he said in an interview with Times of Malta in March when he recalled a close friend who was battling an illness and said that: “We will offer palliative care to patients, of course, but sometimes even the best palliative care leaves the patient in a lot of pain with no hope of surviving. In those circumstances, I believe doctor-assisted suicide is suitable and justified.”
  The UK Assisted Dying Bill passed its second reading last week following a debate that divided MPs across party lines. The bone of contention centres around whether sufficient safeguards are in place to prevent abuse.
 The UK  bill lays out a legal framework for people with terminal or incurable illnesses to seek medical assistance in ending their lives. Key provisions include: eligibility criteria requiring the individual to be over 18, mentally competent, and suffering from unbearable pain due to a terminal or incurable illness.
 It states that two independent doctors must evaluate the patient’s condition to confirm eligibility, followed by judicial approval from a high court judge, who ensures that all legal safeguards are followed.
 The bill also mandates consultation with family members, though the final decision lies with the patient, who retains the right to withdraw the request at any point before the procedure. 
 Following last week’s Second Reading, full approval and implementation may take up to two more years. After further committee reviews and potential amendments, the bill will need additional votes in parliament.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/steward-denies-creating-political-support-fund-hits-media-magistrate.1092735,"Steward Healthcare on Monday denied that it had created a political support fund or provided financial favours for any current or former Maltese officials or politicians.
 Times of Malta reported on Sunday that the company had set up a €1 million fund that was suspected to have been aimed at passing on bribes to Joseph Muscat, Keith Schembri and Konrad Mizzi.
 The funds were held by Accutor AG, a Swiss company suspected of being used as a centralised money-laundering hub for payments linked to the hospitals deal involving Vitals and Steward.
 “Steward strenuously objects to the suggestion that the company created a ‘political support fund’. We have never been asked for – nor provided – financial favours by any current or former Maltese official or minister and no such fund ever existed,"" the company said on Monday.
 The company made no reference to the fact the Maltese appeals court in October declared the contract as null after confirming fraud. Senior government officials were complicit in the privatisation fraud and the Maltese government had failed in its duty to protect the national interest, and defended Steward throughout the process, the court had said.
 Steward said it had purchased a concession for an end-of-useful life small community hospital, a rehab facility in poor shape; and an abandoned asbestos-infested building.
 ""We also inherited many unexpected liabilities totalling over €60 million. The original terms of the concession have been described by the Government of Malta itself, the EU, and the National Audit Office as “unbankable”.
 Steward spent years negotiating with the government in good faith to bring the concession in line with regulations and make it bankable,"" the company said.
 “It is during this time that Steward hired and paid Accutor as a business management consultant for a limited period. Those efforts to regularise the contract were unsuccessful and Steward was left with no choice but to terminate the contract for breach and launch legal proceedings against Malta with the International Court of Arbitration,"" the US-based company said.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/steward-denies-creating-political-support-fund-hits-media-magistrate.1092735,"Steward Healthcare on Monday denied that it had created a political support fund or provided financial favours for any current or former Maltese officials or politicians.
 Times of Malta reported on Sunday that the company had set up a €1 million fund that was suspected to have been aimed at passing on bribes to Joseph Muscat, Keith Schembri and Konrad Mizzi.
 The funds were held by Accutor AG, a Swiss company suspected of being used as a centralised money-laundering hub for payments linked to the hospitals deal involving Vitals and Steward.
 “Steward strenuously objects to the suggestion that the company created a ‘political support fund’. We have never been asked for – nor provided – financial favours by any current or former Maltese official or minister and no such fund ever existed,"" the company said on Monday.
 The company made no reference to the fact the Maltese appeals court in October declared the contract as null after confirming fraud. Senior government officials were complicit in the privatisation fraud and the Maltese government had failed in its duty to protect the national interest, and defended Steward throughout the process, the court had said.
 Steward said it had purchased a concession for an end-of-useful life small community hospital, a rehab facility in poor shape; and an abandoned asbestos-infested building.
 ""We also inherited many unexpected liabilities totalling over €60 million. The original terms of the concession have been described by the Government of Malta itself, the EU, and the National Audit Office as “unbankable”.
 Steward spent years negotiating with the government in good faith to bring the concession in line with regulations and make it bankable,"" the company said.
 “It is during this time that Steward hired and paid Accutor as a business management consultant for a limited period. Those efforts to regularise the contract were unsuccessful and Steward was left with no choice but to terminate the contract for breach and launch legal proceedings against Malta with the International Court of Arbitration,"" the US-based company said.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/we-couldn-t-honour-father-dying-wish-roger-tirazona.1097469,"The father of actor and singer Roger Tirazona had one final wish before he died – to be cremated and have his remains sent to the Philippines – a wish his family could not honour because Malta keeps waiting to build its first crematorium.
 Tirazona, who is also a visiting university lecturer, said his family was unable to fulfil his father’s wish due to the advanced stage of decomposition and the associated logistical challenges, compounded by the emotional strain of grief they were going through.
 
 Since Malta legalised cremation but still has no crematorium, it was very difficult to transport the body to the nearest crematorium in Sicily and “the wishes of a dying man couldn’t be honoured”, his son said.
 “His body was interred in a state grave where his remains will be removed eventually and lost forever,” he wrote.
 “I always believed that politics was there to serve the people and their existential concerns as well. What could be more existential than honouring a man’s life and death in a dignified way?”
 Roger Tirazona Senior died on January 11. Speaking to Times of Malta, Tirazona said his father died at home in his sleep, “covered by a blanket and his body stayed in that circumstance for quite some time” before he found him.
 Since he was in an advanced state of decomposition, the mortuary staff did not even use the burial clothes the family provided – a traditional Filipino outfit called ‘Barong Tagalog’.
 “We were not allowed to open the sealed casket due to rapidly advancing decomposition. I doubt that in these circumstances, flying the corpse to Sicily would have been practical, or respectful, to be honest,” he said.
 The family’s experience is not unique. Many have faced similar challenges in recent years, as the country’s only option for cremation has been to send remains overseas. This process can be both costly and emotionally taxing for grieving families.
 Despite the law legalising cremation in Malta being passed in 2019, progress towards building a domestic crematorium has been slow. While several applications have been submitted, planning and environmental concerns have hindered the process.
  Local funeral directors and advocates have called on the government to prioritise the establishment of a crematorium, citing the growing demand for this service and the environmental benefits it offers. They argue that a local facility would not only provide families with a more convenient and affordable option but also reduce the need for overseas transportation.
 “I cannot for the life of me fathom why this is the case, in 2024. Cremation is a fundamental civic service, that should be encouraged and subsidised by the government for environmental reasons, apart from meaningful existential reasons for the Maltese population,” Tirazona said.
 “It is incredible that this service exists for our deceased pets, but not for humans who opt for it.”
 Even worse, the grief and trauma of losing his father overwhelmed him, making it difficult to handle practical matters, he admitted. If cremation were a straightforward option, he could have honoured his father’s wishes without the added stress of arranging transportation to Sicily.
 “Not to mention that had we taken him to Siciliy, it would have made the burial tremendously more expensive. Such service should be accessible to people of all means and should not be setting people behind around €5,000 in airline charges and other expenses,” he said.
 “It is far better and more practical than a burial in overly saturated state-owned graves – and with a growing population, how long will these last?”
 Questions were sent to the health ministry.
 Since Malta legalised cremation in 2019, there was a significant increase in the number of people who began to consider this new burial option for themselves or their relatives.
 The law not only introduced a burial alternative, but also allows people the flexibility to decide what to do with the ashes. It specifies that each crematorium has a mortuary, a viewing room, adequate facilities for the extraction of implants from the body, a cremation room and a storage room for remains.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/joseph-rapa-dropped-aps-board-directors-vitals-inquiry-charges.1092195,"Joseph Rapa, the former health permanent secretary facing criminal charges over the Vitals' deal to run three state hospitals has been dropped from the APS board of directors.
 Rapa led Chris Fearne's health ministry as its top civil servant between March 2013 and May 2022, spanning the period of negotiations with Vitals and Steward and throughout the concession period.
 On Thursday the bank said that on May 8, the Diocese of Gozo, as a Qualifying Shareholder, had decided to ""temporarily withdraw the re-appointment of  Joseph Rapa as director"".  
 His charges are identical to two other permanent secretaries - Alfred Camilleri and Ronald Mizzi - meaning he is charged with fraud, having made fraudulent gains and misappropriation.
 He will also be charged with having committed crimes he was duty-bound to prevent.
 Rapa was nominated to APS board of directors in 2022.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/steward-health-care-files-bankruptcy.1092011,"Steward Health Care, the US healthcare giant embroiled in the ‘fraudulent’ privatisation of three of Malta’s public hospitals, is filing for bankruptcy, the company announced on Monday.
 In a statement, the company said that “it has commenced an in-court restructuring process through the filing of voluntary petitions for relief” in a Texas court.
 Steward CEO Ralph de la Torre said that a “primary factor” in its decision to file for bankruptcy was “Steward continuing to face challenges created by insufficient reimbursement by government payors as a result of decreasing reimbursement rates”.
 “Filing for Chapter 11 restructuring is in the best interests of our patients, physicians, employees, and communities at this time,” he said.
 Steward currently runs over 30 hospitals across the US, but has become increasingly embattled in recent years as its debts racked up.
 Steward became a household name in Malta in early 2018, when it took over the concession that had awarded St Luke’s Hospital, Karin Grech Hospital and Gozo General Hospital to Vitals Global Healthcare.
 The concession was annulled by Malta’s courts last year, under the suspicion of fraud. The decision to scrap the concession was confirmed on appeal, with courts finding “""collusion between Steward and senior government officials or its agencies"".
 Steward and the Maltese government have since been locked in arbitration proceedings.
 The saga took a new turn last week, as news broke that a magisterial inquiry into the role of Joseph Muscat and several other public officials in the deal had been completed.
 The inquiry spells bad news for many of the saga’s most prominent faces. On Tuesday, Muscat said that he expects to be charged, while others, including EU Funds Minister Chris Fearne and Central Bank Governor Edward Scicluna are also  expected to face lesser charges.
 Muscat, who has long been fighting to have the inquiring magistrate Gabriella Vella removed from the case, described the case as a personal “vendetta”. Meanwhile, Fearne insisted that he had never broken any law or ministerial ethics.
 Developments across the pond
 In a press conference in the US on Monday, Massachusetts state governor Maura Healey delivered a broadside against Steward's management following news the company had filed for bankruptcy.  
 “This situation stems from and is rooted in greed, mismanagement and lack of transparency on the part of Steward leadership in Dallas,” she said, as reported by Boston 25 News.  
 According to the news network, Steward employs 16,000 workers in the state and caters for 200,000 patients annually.  
 While reassuring state residents that hospitals operated by the company would be “operating as usual,” Healey said she could not guarantee there wouldn’t be disruptions.  
 Commenting on the bankruptcy, she said: “Ultimately, this is a goal of getting Steward out of Massachusetts.”  
 Last week, the state activated its ‘Incident Command System’ to maintain patient access to Steward healthcare facilities. 
 Steward’s demise follows the company's announcement last month it was closing its New England Sinai Hospital in the state after announcing in January the centre's financial performance had plummeted by 1,600% over the past five years.  
 The company blamed “skyrocketing expenses” for the decision and said it owed around $50 million in unpaid rent, according to Boston 25 News.
"
https://timesofmalta.com/article/the-network-enabled-vitals-ponzi-scheme.1093059,"Investigators did not mince their words. 
 The hospitals' deal had all the hallmarks of a “ Ponzi scheme”.
 Its design was simple: divert millions in public funds into private hands. 
 A close-knit coterie of politicians, enablers and front men were the suspected beneficiaries of the scheme. 
 The supposed investors behind Vitals, trusted by Joseph Muscat’s government to run three public hospitals, did little by way of investment. 
 On the rare occasion when private funds were invested in the hospitals, these were largely “swallowed up in fees and expenses” charged by people connected to Vitals, or used to refund earlier investors. 
 Public money was even used to buy or establish companies to generate private profits. 
 One such example is Technoline. 
 A total of €5 million in public funds was used to buy the medical supply company. 
 Former government officials Keith Schembri and Konrad Mizzi were set to take a cut from this, via a secret stake in Technoline. 
 Saba Abbas, Vitals’ financial controller, drew up a report estimating that €26 million in public money was siphoned off in just under 18 months. 
 The report landed on Schembri’s desk in 2017. Instead of immediately reporting the fraud to the police, investigators suspect Schembri used the information as leverage to boot out Vitals and usher in Steward. 
 This mass suspected diversion of public money had many alleged enablers and architects. 
 Auditors, lawyers and accountants were all allegedly complicit. 
 Some faces are familiar, others less so. Nexia BT’s Brian Tonna earned himself the moniker of a “professional money launderer”. 
 Tonna, who set up secret Panama companies for Schembri and Mizzi, was one of the early “architects” of the hospitals project. 
 Technoline’s owner on paper, Ivan Vassallo, is another suspected launderer. 
 Vassallo “created” invoices to lend a façade of legitimacy to suspected kickback payments. 
 Vitals' auditor Chris Spiteri was allegedly paid to look the other way.
 Instead of scrutinising transactions, Spiteri “set aside his professional ethics” and accepted a €50,000 bonus from Steward to give the Vitals books a clean bill of health. 
 The result: a “clean but ultimately unethical audit of Vitals,” which facilitated Steward’s takeover of the hospital concession in 2018. 
 Lawyer David Meli, who represented both Vitals and Steward, was identified as being in a position of authority to identify suspect financial arrangements and flows involving public funds. 
 The law firm DF Advocates and its partners have also been pinpointed as key enablers in the early concession deal. 
  Muscat, Schembri and Mizzi have been charged with criminal association. 
 This was not just about turning a blind eye. 
 Investigators charge that the ex-prime minister, his chief aide and the former health minister were actively complicit. 
 Of the three, Schembri is the one most heavily implicated.  He and “secret” Vitals beneficiary Shaukat Ali were two sides of the same coin. 
 The moment Mizzi signed off on the deal, Ali earned himself a $5 million success fee payable to a company in Dubai. 
 
 At that same moment, Ali was actively setting up “money laundering structures” in Dubai for Mizzi and Schembri.
 The timing was not a coincidence, investigators allege. 
 Similar “money laundering structures” were set up for Mizzi and Schembri in Panama. Muscat stood by his two men when their Panama plans were outed in 2016. 
 Unproven claims linked Muscat to a third Panama company – Egrant. 
 The three ex-government officials have once again been connected to “money-laundering structures”, this time in Switzerland. 
 Accutor, a Swiss company, was pumped with millions in cash by Steward Health Care. 
 Steward had been ushered in by Muscat’s government as the saviours of the hospital deal. 
 After pumping Accutor full of cash, Muscat, Schembri and Mizzi formed either direct or indirect financial relationships with the company. 
 The chances of these relationships having been formed independently and by coincidence are “negligible,” investigators say. 
 Others in power stood by while all this happened. 
 Politicians and their mandarins failed to put a stop to the rot. 
 Chris Fearne,  Edward Scicluna and their respective permanent secretaries Joseph Rapa and Alfred Camilleri have all been charged with fraud. Mizzi’s permanent secretary Ronald Mizzi has also been charged. 
 The inquiry offers snippets into their actions... or inactions. 
 Fearne was e-mailed details about the Vitals “consortium” by Tonna as early as July 2014. 
 He was also copied in on e-mails about the due diligence – or lack of it – that had been carried out on the people behind Vitals. 
 At the time of this correspondence, in June 2016, Fearne had already taken over from Mizzi as health minister. 
 Other evidence suggests Fearne was kept in the dark about certain aspects of the deal. 
 Scicluna too appears to have taken a backseat role throughout. 
 Months after the deal was sealed, e-mail correspondence shows Scicluna was still awaiting financial details about the concession from Mizzi. 
 A presentation about the deal’s impact on public finances was given at the Office of the Prime Minister. Mizzi and Schembri were present. Scicluna and Camilleri were not, investigators concluded based on analysis of e-mail correspondence. 
 Scicluna also appears to have been unaware that Camilleri sat on the board of Projects Malta. Projects Malta was the government entity tasked with handling the “fraudulent” award of the contract to Vitals. 
 “He [Camilleri] is either dumb by accepting to be on a board when he is not informed on what is happening or he was getting paid and thus he closed an eye or else he knew what was happening and he did not say anything to anybody”, a ministry official told Scicluna. 
 Ronald Mizzi appears to have been heavily involved at various stages of the concession. 
 According to testimony, members of the Projects Malta evaluation committee were directly answerable to him, bypassing the entity’s former chairperson Adrian Said. 
 Mizzi e-mailed Said a list of the people who would be appointed to the evaluation committee. The initial list included Tonna, who was later replaced by his colleague Manuel Castagna.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/new-paola-health-centre-cater-around-130000-people.1093006,"The new Vincent Moran Health Centre in Paola is expected to cater to around 130,000 people and will begin offering numerous services to the public in the “near future”, a government statement said on Friday. 
 Prime Minister Robert Abela, along with Health Minister Jo Etienne Abela, and Foundation for Medical Services CEO Robert Xuereb visited the six-storey centre on Friday.
 The centre was built with an investment of public funds and European funds. The new home is named after former health minister Vincent Moran, who died in 2018.
 It was explained how the centre will provide different services, including operations performed by surgeons and specialists for patients who can return home shortly after the same operation. 
 The centre will be combining many services under one roof and continue to reduce dependence on Mater Dei Hospital.
  On his part, Abela said he noted how professionals and the public are increasingly embracing the government’s vision for the health sector by placing more emphasis on community services. 
  He said the centre will also provide mental health care services, physiotherapy, and consultations on heart disease, which are currently being provided at Mater Dei but will soon be provided in the Paola centre. Other services offered include dental care, with a dental facility. 
 Abela stressed that community services remain the best tool for people to continue to live better and have a higher quality of life. 
 “The investment we are making in every sector, including health, continues to support people in every life situation,” he said. 
 On-site, there is also dedicated parking for workers’ vehicles, patients, and residents living in the vicinity of the Centre.

 Joseph Muscat and Robert Abela had not only relayed millions to Steward Health Care but continued defending it, even as it used taxpayers' money to cook up stories against its own deputy leader. 
 A campaign to smear former health minister Fearne with “fake” corruption claims was funded by Steward Health Care, according to leaked corporate records obtained by OCCRP and shared with Times of Malta and the Boston Globe. 
 The operations were coordinated by senior Steward officials who corresponded regularly with private spies at two London-based intelligence firms, according to emails, encrypted messages, and financial records. Fearne is facing fraud charges in connection with the annulled Steward deal. 
 In a statement, the PN said Abela was complicit because he was aware of the fraud and corruption taking place and until this day was resisting the opposition's attempts to recoup the money stolen.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/churches-come-life-music-organ-festival-returns-11th-year.1101016,"This Friday sees the welcome return of the Malta International Organ Festival, a celebration of the organ and its music and a creative journey through some of the country’s richest sacred spaces.
 Entering its 11th year, this year’s organ festival presents 10 concerts in churches across Malta and Gozo featuring a host of local and international artists.
 The festival opens with a performance by Grammy-nominated US organist Cameron Carpenter, described by Gramophone magazine as “one of the great virtuosos of our time,” at St Paul’s Anglican Pro-Cathedral in Valletta.
 Over the following two weeks, the festival will see organists joined by vocalists, brass and woodwind musicians and even an orchestra for the event’s closing concert at Paola’s Basilica of Christ the King on December 7.
 “We’re celebrating communities, our heritage and music in the centre of our towns and villages and have the best of the best coming to Malta to entertain us,” said the festival’s founder and artistic director Joseph Lia.
 “There are a lot of nice aesthetics – architecture, paintings, carvings and all the art incorporated in these churches – plus the music, which is one of the highest performing art forms.”
 Describing organ music being played in churches as “giving an additional dimension to these [church] works of art,” Lia said Malta’s sacred spaces will “come to life with music” throughout the festival.
 ‘Mega star’ 
 Despite the organ’s long history, the instrument and its repertoire continues to be developed – not least by maverick US organist Carpenter, who made waves with the debut of his self-designed electronic International Touring Organ, the world’s first full-scale portable organ. 
 Describing Carpenter as a “mega star... a big name,” Lia stressed the festival was seeking to showcase the wealth of music written for the instrument, pointing to the variety of musical themes explored and the range – and calibre – of musicians coming to perform.
 Saturday sees a concert dedicated to improvised variations on Maltese hymns, with performances the following week featuring works by Bach, Piazzola and Puccini.
 A Christmas-themed concert takes place on December 2, meanwhile, with an eclectic performance featuring various artists held the following Thursday.
 Ancient origins
 While a precursor to the organ – utilising waterpower instead of bellows – is thought to date back more than 2,000 years, the earliest version of the modern organ emerged in Europe around the eighth century.
 The organ had become a fixture in churches by the 10th century while continuing to see design refinements and improvements through into the early 17th century.
  By the early 18th century, it had become an important instrument in the arsenal of Baroque composers, particularly Bach (1685-1750), perhaps the most famous proponent of the instrument and composer of the fabulously dramatic Toccata and Fugue in D minor, a work that has become synonymous with the instrument.
 Malta’s organs
 With a strong Christian tradition, Malta is home to some 130 organs, most of which are housed in churches.
 In December last year, a new 4,000-pipe organ was installed in Paola’s Basilica of Christ the King while this year saw the completion of restoration works on the 200-year-old organ housed in Valletta’s St Dominic parish church.
 Both organs will feature in this year’s festival, with the Paola organ taking centre stage for the event’s grand finale featuring music for organ and orchestra.
 Describing the organ as “the king of the instruments,” paying homage to its “rich tones and colours and grand, majestic power,” Lia noted the festival also sees the inclusion of smaller, more “delicate” organs in churches such as St Mary parish church in Gudja and Valletta’s Jesuit church oratorio.
 “Our forefathers crowdfunded our churches with very good organs – some are big romantic organs, some are ancient organs of historic value and there are smaller organs comparable with the size of the space,” said Lia, a baritone singer.
 “This is why I started this [the festival], because I was working with organists when living abroad, and they knew that we have such very good organs – so we started discussing the possibility of organising a festival here.”
 New concert hall?
 While Malta boasts a wealth of sacred spaces to enjoy organ music, Lia would like to see Malta’s capabilities to explore the instrument expanded, stressing the need for a new purpose-built concert hall.
 “Something we lack here in Malta is a philharmonic hall with an organ – a secular concert hall like other European countries have,” he said.
 While stressing his love of sacred music, explaining he was “born in sacred music, great music,” Lia thinks a new concert hall equipped with an organ could allow him and others to explore a greater range of repertoire.
 “As an artistic director, I would be freer to programme more music... there’s not only sacred music, but there’s other music that sometimes involves the organ too,” he said.
 However, keen to stress the unique nature of the festival and its performance spaces, Lia encouraged those new to organ repertoire to “come and experience this in our churches.”
 “In this stressful world, audiences can come and relax in these places that were built for worship and enjoy this music.”

https://timesofmalta.com/article/tvm-news-channel-no-more-pbs-drop-news-logo.1098276,"The national broadcaster will no longer have an official news channel as of next week, with TVMnews+ dropping ‘news’ from its logo. 
 On Thursday morning, television producers received an email from PBS, informing them that as of Monday 30 September, TVMnews+ will become TVM+. The email also included the channel’s new logo. 
 The change has come ahead of the new programme schedule.
 This is the second revamp the channel has experienced in recent years. 
 TVMnews+ replaced TVM2 in 2021, after a massive rebranding effort by the national broadcaster.
 When the new channel was first announced, PBS said it would focus exclusively on news, sports, culture, history and current affairs programmes. 
 At the time, Times of Malta spoke to four  TVM reporters anonymously who all complained that TVM's news had been relegated to a ""government noticeboard"" and proper journalism was being ""stifled"".
 Viewers have noted that most current affairs programmes migrated from TVM to TVMnews+, and instead of focusing solely on news, the channel now broadcasts discussion programmes and documentary-style shows. 
 Shows such as ‘Paqpaq’, a programme on motorsports,  Tgħid x’Inhu?, a programme discovering objects in local museums, and a biographical documentary on different Maltese women's careers,   Il-Mara, are broadcast weekly on TVMnews+
 The most recent Broadcasting Authority report, published in August, noted how only an average of 5,589 people followed TVMnews+, a drastic drop when compared to TVM's 72,000 plus audience. 
 The report noted how viewers preferred to watch the news bulletin on TVM, rather than on TVMnews+.
 TVM is the most followed TV station: 41% of local viewers mentioned TVM as one of the three TV stations they watched the previous day.
 Questions have been sent to PBS.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/valletta-lights-republic-day-spectacle.1102462,"On Friday evening, the facade of the President’s Palace in Valletta served as a canvas narrating the island's history, as Malta celebrated the 50th anniversary of becoming a Republic. 
 For the significant anniversary, the day’s celebrations reached their climax in the evening, when a spectacular audiovisual show 'L-Istorja, Aħna’  took place at St George’s Square.
 During the occasion, President Myriam Spiteri Debono said this year’s celebration theme emphasises the need for all of us to reflect on Malta’s history and participate in writing its future. 
 She said the 50th anniversary is an opportunity to honour those who came before us and the sacrifices they made to bring us where we are today. 
  “It should also allow us to reflect on where we stand now, and what we are prepared to do for those who come after us,” she said. 
 She also noted the persistent challenges, both locally and internationally, and stressed the importance of responding to them appropriately.  She highlighted how material deprivation, social exclusion, over-development,  and population growth, as relevant and pressing concerns.
 Spiteri Debono concluded her speech by urging everyone to collectively pledge to continue Malta’s journey for the benefit of future generations and to raise and uphold Malta's name.
  During his speech, Prime Minister Robert Abela emphasised that Republic Day was not just about honouring the past but about “laying the foundations” for a bright future. 
 He described the establishment of the Republic as a significant achievement of the Maltese people, noting how over the past 50 years, the nation shaped an identity rooted in strong family values. 
 “No nation can forget its roots,” he said. 
 “The sense of identity must be passed down to future generations,” he added, highlighting the importance of passing on Malta’s unique language and identity to future generations. 
  Abela said Malta’s sovereignty is based on its economic resilience and it is through “unity, hard work, and identity” that the nation can take the Republic forward into the next 50 years. 
 He said there will be further reforms in democracy and a focus on improving the quality of life for the Maltese people. 
 ""We want to see our country leading the way in the green energy transformation, at the heart of the digital transition, celebrating the arts, and proudly showcasing the expressions of its artists,"" Abela said.
   Festivals Malta through the National Festivities Committee- and in collaboration with the Office of the President organised various activities throughout the long weekend. 
 The day started with a pontifical Mass at St John’s Co-Cathedral, followed by a ceremonial parade by the Armed Forces of Malta, who greeted President Myriam Spiteri Debono and Prime Minister Robert Abela among others in St George’s Square. 
 At noon, an investiture ceremony and medal awarding was held in the Grand Council Hall at the Grand Master’s Palace.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/no-public-bus-service-ed-sheeran-concert-logistical-issues-loom.1094338,"Public buses will not be operating a special service for the Ed Sheeran concert or even enter Ta’ Qali on Wednesday, as logistical concerns loom ahead of Malta’s biggest-ever paid concert.
 More than 30,000 fans are expected to watch the British icon, but while large concerts are normally held at the Floriana Granaries, Wednesday’s event will be held at the larger Ta’ Qali picnic area.
 Those attending will not be allowed to park their cars near the Ta’ Qali venue, with organisers providing a subsidised €10 return bus service at seven shuttle pick-up points across Malta instead.
 The service is on a first-come, first-served basis and is starting at 5.30pm, well before the concert.
 The response has been so overwhelming that the organisers have added more shuttle service pick-up points. But there is a limit to the number of vehicles available.
 Tickets for the shuttle service from Paola, for example, are already fully booked.
 Several raised concerns about the planned shuttle service on social media.
  “The pick-up locations aren’t even big enough to hold enough buses to cater for all those people,” one woman said.
 Some said it was unfair having to pay another €10 after having paid for concert tickets while others said public buses should introduce a one-off service to the venue to help with transporting fans.
 But when contacted, Malta Public Transport said public buses are being diverted away from the concert, so those planning to use public transport to get to Ta’ Qali will have to walk from the stops along the central link road to the concert, around 30 minutes.   
 A Malta Public Transport spokesperson said: “Due to the traffic management measures in place for the Ed Sheeran concert at Ta’ Qali on June 26, buses are being diverted to pass through the Central Link and stop on bus stops ‘Qali 1’, ‘Qali 2’ and ‘Qali 3’ – about a 30-minute walk.”  
 Thousands are expected to fly to Malta for the concert to watch Sheeran, who is behind major hits like Shape of You and  Perfect.
 The concert is the biggest since the Robbie Williams concert at the Granaries last September. More big concerts are expected next month, including Tom Jones, Ronan Keating and the Isle of MTV.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/artist-claims-maltabiennale-censored-artwork-president-say-absurd.1098493,"Maltese artist Keit Bonnici has claimed his artwork at the inaugural Maltabiennale.art was ""censored"" after it was removed without his consent and stored for a month in an undisclosed location.
 Bonnici said that his installation, Fuq l-Art , went missing on May 1, and only discovered its whereabouts after the biennale ended on May 31.
  Fuq l-Art involved bubble-wrapping and tightly securing one of Valletta’s iconic red telephone boxes. The box was topped with a bright yellow postage sticker bearing the origin ""United Kingdom"" and a blank section for the destination. The artwork was a commentary on decolonisation and the evolving role of monuments in public spaces.
 Speaking to Times of Malta, Bonnici said, ""As artists, we rely on exposure for our work. For one-third of the agreed duration, my piece wasn’t shown to the public - which affects my livelihood.” 
 The artist insisted he had not been informed about the reason for the removal and only retrieved the artwork from Heritage Malta after the biennale ended. “Why was my artwork held in secret storage for a month? Neither I nor the curators knew where it was. I was only allowed to collect it after the biennale was over. Heritage Malta never responded to my questions about this.”
 But Mario Cutajar, president of the biennale, dismissed the censorship claims as ""absurd"".
 He explained that Bonnici's work had been selected, approved, and sponsored for the exhibition. According to Cutajar, the artwork had become ""unsightly"" due to damage, prompting the organisers to ask Bonnici, via artistic director Sofia Baldi Pighi, to work on the maintenance of the piece.
  “On April 23, we asked Bonnici through the artistic director to carry out maintenance on the artwork that week. Nothing was done. One week later, on April 30, we repeated our request, stating that if repairs were not carried out, the piece would have to be dismantled. Again, nothing happened, and the artwork was removed that evening,” Cutajar told Times of Malta.
 The piece was damaged because parts of the bubble wrap were ripped off by members of the public, he said.
 Bonnici, however, defended this as part of the artwork’s evolution, saying the public's interaction with it was integral to the piece.
 “It’s a travelling object, and like anything transported, it can get battered. I have no issue with people interacting with the artwork. When an artwork exists in public space, it has the chance to evolve.”
 Artistic director Baldi Pighi assumed the role of mediator between Bonnici and the organisation and supported the artist’s stance. She shared her communications with Times of Malta, which showed her disapproval of dismantling the piece.
 “Artworks are mechanisms to foster discussion and convey critical thought, and once again, Keit Bonnici’s work proves effective,” she said.
 Baldi Pighi emphasised that out of the more than one hundred artworks in the biennale, the ones placed in public spaces have had the most impact.
 “Ask any person living in Malta, whether art professional or not, and the works they will remember are those in public spaces,” she added.
 A broader conversation about reclaiming public space for discussion and creativity is needed, Baldi Pighi said, pointing out that movements like Moviment Graffitti and eminent local artists ""have been crucial in the drive towards transforming public areas into sites for debate and free thought.” 
 Cutajar, however, criticised the timing of Bonnici’s public claims, questioning why the artist had waited over four months before speaking out. “I’m quite sure that had Mr Bonnici been censored in any way, he would have cried foul immediately, without waiting more than four months and claiming it in a post advertising the artwork for sale or exhibition.”
  Bonnici said he had been working on resolving the issue privately for months, with support from the biennale curatorial team and the Malta Entertainment Industry and Arts Association. Due to financial and legal concerns, however, he had chosen not to go public until recently.
 “I tried to speak earlier, but my hands were tied. We were still waiting for material reimbursement from Heritage Malta,” he explained.
 MEIA has since supported Bonnici, claiming that his case was not an isolated incident.
 “We received several concerns from other participants and MEIA members about organisational and ethical issues,” the association said.
 It added that discussions with Cutajar and Heritage Malta CEO Noel Zammit had revealed “a troubling lack of understanding of contemporary art practices, a dismissive attitude toward concerns, and an unwillingness to acknowledge any wrongdoing”.
 Bonnici was not the only artist to claim censorship at the biennale. Italian artist Sara Leghissa also reported that her pro-choice artwork Unborn Celebration was censored during the event.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/new-1m-fund-support-malta-indigenous-film-industry.1096058,"Arts Council Malta has announced a €1 million scheme to support the indigenous film industry.
 The Screen Support Scheme comprises five strands: screenwriting, development, short film, feature-length production, and cultural programmes. It covers works of fiction, documentaries, and animations, while one strand supports cultural programmes.
 ""We are among the few whose national-scale cinematographic expression is yet to materialise. The road is long, but every beginning has its end,” The chair of Arts Council Malta, Albert Marshall, said. 
 Financial support for Maltese filmmakers was previously under the remit of the Malta Film Commission, which fell under the Tourism Ministry and there was ongoing controversy over millions spent to support foreign film productions in Malta, as compared to support for the local film industry itself.
 The Creative Malta programme, widely known as the film fund, had handed local filmmakers €600,000 yearly to finance local film productions.
 The fund has now been increased to €1 million under the Culture Ministry.
 Earlier this month, Marshall said the film fund needs to be tripled to €3 million for Maltese indigenous films to thrive alongside the foreign movie industry—an increase he reminded people about at the launch. 
 “The Council has declared that there was a strong need for lobbying to increase the fund to €3 million, which is the promised amount,” said Marshall.
  During the launch, Culture Minister Owen Bonnici welcomed the scheme and said it was essential that all continued to work hard to strengthen the cultural and creative sectors. ""Therefore, it’s extremely important that we listen to the sector and work hand in hand to further strengthen it.”
 Director of Funding and Strategy at the Council, Mary Ann Cauchi said that the scheme will offer support through a mentorship process to encourage those new to the industry to apply.
 To apply for any strands, applicants must be independent audiovisual entities and submit complete applications by September 24 at noon. The results will be announced on November 21 and 22.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/watch-the-nightclub-still-partying-like-1999.1101130,"Stepping into Beachaven in St Paul’s Bay is like entering a 1990s time capsule. The seaside club, one of the last of its kind, still has its original décor – and there are no plans to update it.
 Most other popular nightclubs of the era like Natasha’s, Tattingers and Styx have since closed while venues like Liquid, known as Vibes in the 1990s, have rebranded and updated.
 But Beachaven still has its disco balls, neon lights, purple furniture and the club’s crown jewel: its glass dance floor.
 “People love it,” said 73-year-old owner Godwin Cutajar. Apart from a few upgraded lights and a revamped sound system, the club has remained largely untouched since it was last decorated more than 30 years ago.
 Cutajar first came across the venue as a customer in the 1970s, when it was known as Fondatore, and took over management in 1977 despite having no experience in catering or bar operations.
  Initially an outdoor lido with a beach club, the space underwent various transformations before Cutajar settled on its now iconic 1990s aesthetic.
 “So many people tell us, ‘Don’t change it. Leave it like that,’” shared his wife, 65-year-old Jeanette. The couple met in the club’s early years when disco classics from Donna Summer and Saturday Night Fever filled the air.
 “It’s the Beachaven love story,” Jeanette laughed, adding that she first visited the club due to her parents’ summer home nearby.
 “No one thought it would work, and here we are, married for 37 years,” she added. The couple, from different sides of the island – Godwin from Żebbuġ and Jeanette from Sliema – recall the sacrifices they made for Beachaven.
 Jeanette describes nights when Godwin would sleep at the club on crates of beer with only a mattress.
  “Beachaven is the love of his life, even before me,” she laughed.
 Keeping Beachaven alive for nearly five decades has been no easy feat, and the couple has faced many challenges, including frequent encounters with the police.
 “The police used to come en masse,” Jeanette recalled.
 They would often shut down Beachaven’s parties due to complaints about noise levels and parking issues affecting the coastline. However, after investing in heavy soundproofing and learning to carry all necessary licences, the police problems faded away.
 There was also some controversy among more conservative members of society as the clubbing season would open on Good Friday when everywhere else would be shut.
 “People would say, ‘what a shame’,” Jeanette said.
 The most recent threat to Beachaven came in 2019, when a powerful storm shattered two windows and flooded the seaside club.
 “The dance floor was full of fish from the fish farms,” Jeanette said. “We thought the club was finished.” But with help from friends, they managed to restore the space and continue operations.
  In 2015, after a stroke, Godwin’s eldest son Karl returned from abroad to help run the family business. The club’s management has now been passed to the younger son, Simon, who has been working there since he was 16.
 “My first memory of the club was sneaking in as a kid until my parents found me and kicked me out,” recalls Simon, now 30.
 Inspired to follow in his father’s footsteps, Simon has no plans to modernise the club’s retro charm.
 “Some people tell me to update it, but there are already so many modern places. I don’t think there’s anywhere else with this vibe left,” he noted.
 The Cutajar family believes Beachaven’s true magic lies in its ability to welcome generation after generation – four and counting. Under Simon’s management, Beachaven continues to attract an older crowd seeking nostalgia and a younger generation drawn to its now-retro vibe.
 Looking back on his years at Beachaven, Godwin is proud of the club’s legacy and pleased to pass it on to his son.
 “As far as I’m concerned, I’ve done everything there is to do, and now it’s Simon’s turn,” he said.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/alexandra-alden-eurovision-song-disqualified.1102535,"Updated 4:55pm
 A song submitted by former X Factor Malta judge Alexandra Alden has been disqualified from the Malta Eurovision Song Contest 2025 after being published in violation of competition rules, the public broadcaster announced Monday.
 In a statement, PBS said Alden’s song Magnolia was disqualified from Malta’s Eurovision song contest after it “received information” the song had been published prior to the end of November in violation of competition regulations.
 “Following a thorough investigation and verification of the facts, PBS has taken the necessary steps to ensure compliance with the competition rules,” the broadcaster said.
 The regulation cited by PBS says the lyrics and music of songs submitted to the competition must “not have been commercially released” before November 30.
 In instances of songs being made available before the given date, including on social media, artists should inform PBS for the broadcaster to make a decision on their eligibility, the rules say.
 The announcement comes just days after the 24 semi-finalists for the competition were revealed by Magic Malta’s hosts Daniel and Ylenia.
 A jury and the public will select the winner, who will represent Malta at the Eurovision Song Contest in Basel, Switzerland in May.
 Concluding its statement, PBS - which broadcasts the Eurovision Song Contest on its TVM television channel - said it was “committed to maintaining a fair and transparent process for all participants”.
 In a statement later on Monday, Alden said she was ""so disheartened"" by the decision and put the incident down to an acoustic ""prototype"" version of the song filmed ""years ago"".
 The singer said she had asked the person responsible to remove the song immediately, aware it could affect her submission to the competition.
 ""I informed PBS of what had taken place to be transparent and professional. It was already too late"", the singer said.
 ""I perform often and trying out works in progress of songs in a low-key, informal setting helps the creative process"", she said, adding that a new album featuring the song was not yet commercially available and the song was not yet ready for release. 
 ""I understand and respect the decision taken by PBS to avoid any potential friction with the Eurovision organisers and I wish the contestants so much luck"", said Aldren. ""Sing your hearts out.""

https://timesofmalta.com/article/mel-gibson-malta-potential-film-project-meets-robert-abela.1097954,"Top actor and Oscar-winning director Mel Gibson is in Malta for discussions in connection with a potential film project.
 The Australian actor, who was behind classic films like Braveheart and  Lethal Weapon, is among an 11-member team scouting Malta following an invitation by the Malta Film Commission.
 Prime Minister Robert Abela welcomed Gibson and the production team on Wednesday to discuss an upcoming production.
 Gibson is currently filming the sequel to 2004's The Passion of the Christ, which he co-wrote, produced and directed.
 The new film Resurrection is expected to bring together several actors of the original cast of  The Passion of Christ, featuring Jim Caviezel and Francesco De Vito. Reports say the film will be shot in Israel, Morocco and Italy.
 During the meeting on Wednesday, Abela said Gibson noted the strides made by the film industry in Malta. 
 Questions about the five-day visit have been sent to the Malta Film Commission. 
 Gibson was one of the most successful Hollywood stars of the 1980s and 1990s. He has been nominated three times for an Oscar - winning two in 1996 (Best Director and Best Picture) for Braveheart and nominated in 2017 for best director for  Hacksaw Ridge.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/new-jurassic-world-movie-start-shooting-malta-july.1091682,"A new Jurassic World film is set to start shooting in Malta this summer with Scarlett Johansson expected to take the lead role.
 The production has booked almost all facilities at the Malta Film Studios in Kalkara this summer and is set to shoot bet­ween July and September, multiple film industry sources told Times of Malta.
 The world-renowned franchise will only film part of its latest movie in Malta and there are no shoots scheduled on location.
 The Malta Film Studios offers, among other facilities, two infinite-horizon water tanks that film productions generally use for large-scale sound effects and underwater shooting.
  The Jurassic franchise first hit the big screens in 1993, with its blockbuster Jurassic Park, based on a novel by Michael Crichton and directed by Steven Spielberg.
 A sequel followed in 1997 and then in 2001, 2015, 2018 and 2022.
  The 2022 film, called Dominion, starred Hollywood actor Chris Pratt and was also partly  filmed in Malta, with scenes shot in Valletta, Vittoriosa, Mellieħa and Pembroke in 2020.
 In the film, Malta starred as a hub for a dinosaur black market where velociraptors leap over churches and chase lead characters through the streets of Valletta in chaotic scenes.
 Very few details have yet emerged on the new film, with Hollywood reporters saying it is set to premiere in July 2025 and that Johansson is expected to take a lead role in it.
 A two-time Oscar nominee, the 39-year-old actress shot to fame with the film Lost in Translation, and she is mostly known for playing the Black Widow in several Marvel Studios films, including the Avengers.
 The Jurassic World film is the latest in a series of big-time productions that have filmed in Malta over the past years, all of which made the best out of the remarkably generous government scheme that gives them 40 per cent cash back on almost all expenses incurred while their production films in Malta.
 The government has repeatedly said it is committed to retain the rebate – albeit controversial – to attract more blockbusters to Malta, and for the film industry to become a leading ‘motor’ in the island’s tourism strategy.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/factcheck-scam-social-posts-showing-injured-old-man-go-viral.1102250,"Claim: Bloodied old man was found lost in Malta.
 Verdict: The photo was taken in Los Angeles in 2018, showing a 91-year-old man after he suffered a racially motivated attack. The photo is being used by scammers to gain popularity.
 A photo of a seemingly lost bloodied and bruised man circulating online is just the latest in a long series of scam posts that have travelled the world and reached Malta’s shores.
 The posts show an older man struggling to get off the ground as blood streams down his face.
 “Does anyone recognize this old man?” the posts ask. ""He showed up at our house"".
 “Let’s flood our feeds to help find his family”.
 And people certainly obliged. One post was shared over 1,300 times by unsuspecting Facebook users on Monday and Tuesday, many imploring their friends to reach out to them with any information.
  But a quick online search quickly reveals that this photo is several years old and taken on the other side of the world.
 The man in the picture is Rodolfo Rodriguez, a (then) 91-year-old Mexican man who was the victim of a racist attack when he was assaulted with a brick on a Los Angeles street back in 2018.
 Rodriguez had travelled to Los Angeles to visit his family in California when a group of people attacked him with a concrete brick, telling him to “go back to Mexico”.
 He survived the attack, emerging with a broken cheekbone and several bruises on his face.
 The gang leader, Laquisha Jones, was arrested days later and eventually sentenced to 15 years behind bars.
  The Facebook posts sharing the Rodriguez’s image in Malta trace a well-worn path in an effort to dupe people.
 Last year, a spate of similar posts showing lost children and  injured dogs hit Maltese social media, each being shared thousands of times.
 And, more recently, scammers took to sharing photos of a three-year-old boy, claiming he was found in Malta.
 These photos are often shared by fake Facebook profiles to local property pages, each time asking readers to share the post as widely as possible. Comments beneath the post are often closed to prevent people from pointing out that this is a scam.
 The posts are believed to be an example of a sympathy scam in which a page or post tries to receive a large number of likes or follows by pulling at people’s heartstrings.
 The scammers will then change the post’s contents to promote a fraudulent scheme, often a fake cryptocurrency investment, banking on the post’s thousands of likes and shares to give it some added legitimacy.
 Scam Facebook posts such as this often contain several tell-tale signs suggesting that the post may be a hoax.
 The Facebook posts sharing this picture are just the latest in a long series of scam posts.
 The photo shows a 91-year-old Mexican man, Rodolfo Rodriguez, who was attacked in Los Angeles in 2018.
 The story was widely reported in the USA and internationally, often using the same photo used by scammers.
 The claim is therefore false as the evidence clearly refutes it.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/sam-smith-gives-spectacular-show-summer-daze-festival.1096803,"UK singer Sam Smith dazzled crowds in Ta' Qali on Thursday as they headlined the main event of the annual Summer Daze festival.
 Organisers said on Friday that more than 30,000 people attended the festival's main event on Thursday, with 65% of them specifically travelling from overseas to attend. 
 With an electrifying show that had attendees dancing and singing along throughout the night, Smith took the audience through a journey of their musical career, from the softer ballads of the first album to the more recent and racier dance tracks that had everyone dancing along.
 With the set featuring the figure of a woman lying asleep, spray painted with slogans that included the phrases “liberation”, “autonomy”, “revolution”, “ cease fire now” and “protect trans kids”, Smith was heralded to the stage with a spectacular light display and dancers holding flaming red torches up high.
  The crowd erupted into frenzied cheer as Smith made their appearance descending a small staircase in towering platform shoes, with a smile shining under an impressively waxed moustache and an elegant Vivienne Westwood pearl earring dangling from their lobe.
 Smith started off with familiar hits from their early career, including Stay With Me, I’m Not The Only One and  Like I Can, making a brief pause in the set to get the crowd to sing Happy Birthday to Julia, the band’s bassist. 
 While the heat didn’t seem to be keeping the crowd from enjoying the evening, Smith seemed unprepared for the temperature for the evening to border on 30 degrees.
 “I’m regretting all my outfit changes for the evening,” Smith said, before launching into a rendition of Too Good At Goodbyes. 
  Nevertheless, the heat didn’t stop them from changing into a series of daring outfits, including a billowing black gown, a puffy skirted coat of rainbow tulle and back into a slick black coat and veil, concealing a more revealing get up for a much-anticipated finale. 
 Smith went through a series of more dance-oriented hits, including Promises, Latch, I’m Not Here To Make Friends and Desire, which saw dancers tumbling into spectacular displays of movement in time to the thumping beat. 
 But the most anticipated moment of the show came in its finale, with Smith and entourage pulling out all the stops to deliver an exhilarating rendition of the sexually charged hit Unholy. 
  Smith took to the stage in a corset and thigh-high stockings, as the dancers came out in long, blonde wigs in imitation of Kim Petras, the German pop star who also features on the song, in a high-energy performance that had the crowd dancing along enthusiastically and screaming for more, finally ending in a fireworks display over the stage. 
  Fellow Brit Becky Hill, who rose to prominence after appearing on the first season of The Voice UK in 2012, had already managed to get pulses racing earlier in the evening with a fun and high-energy set. 
 Clad in leather and with a blonde ponytail swishing behind her as she danced across the stage, Hill’s powerful voice had people jumping in no time, starting the crowd off with a call and response for Crazy What Love Can Do. 
  Hill ran through familiar hits, including Back and Forth, Afterglow and  Disconnect, that left attendees with a deep bass line thumping in their chest as they sang along bathed in neon lights. 
 She expressed gratitude to the crowd, both because she had been recently recovering from laryngitis and for audiences enthusiastically returning to live performances after the COVID-19 lockdowns.
 “I’m so glad we made it through that and that we have live shows and music and partying again because this is my life,” she said, before launching into a version of Never Be Alone. 
 She went on to close off with I Wish You Well and  That’s What I Remember. 
  Organisers said on Friday that over 30,000 people attended the event, with 65% of attendees coming from overseas to watch the show. 
 These largely came from the UK, Italy, France, Germany, Poland, Spain, Turkey, Ireland and the US, they said. 
 Overall, the week-long festival is expected to attract some 60,000 attendees across all of its events. 
 “The pull of such an international audience is a testament to the quality and appeal of the headliners that SummerDaze continues to bring to the Maltese Islands, as well as partnerships with global brands such as the BBC, Creamfields and their newest addition of partnerships with the renowned Universal Music Group,” the organisers said in a statement. 
 “These relationships put Malta on the map and make it the more obvious destination for music lovers worldwide.”
 This edition of the Summer Daze Festival was organised in partnership with Universal Music Group, BBC Radio 1 Dance Anthems and Creamfields and also featured Shaun Farrugia performing on Thursday. 
 Events are set to continue throughout the rest of the week with Vida Loca at Uno Malta on Friday, a BBC Radio 1 Live Broadcast at Uno Malta on Saturday and close with performances by Kungs and Danny Howard on Sunday night at Cafe Del Mar.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/increase-arts-council-funding-revise-creatives-tax-rate-meia-urges.1098271,"The entertainment and arts association is urging the government to increase the Arts Council Malta funding and revise the 7.5% tax rate for creative professionals as it prepares its budget for 2025. 
 The Malta Entertainment Industry and Arts Association is also proposing incentives for property owners who rent to creative organisations.
 The association said in a statement the creative sector in Malta is a critical driver of economic growth, social cohesion and cultural identity.
 ""While the government has made notable progress in improving cultural infrastructure, particularly through investments in public cultural organisations and programming, the current resource and budget allocation to public projects and institutions versus the sector at large creates an imbalance that seriously limits the creative's ecology full potential.
 ""This misalignment has led to significant gaps in funding distribution and necessary operational foundations, leaving Malta's private creative industries struggling to compete,"" the MEIA said.
 Despite their capacity to be key drivers of sustainable economic growth, the island's creative industries remained undervalued, underfunded and lacked a definitive long-term sustainable plan, the association said.
 Outdated perceptions about the sector's role in the modern economy and the disappropriate focus continued to constrain its growth potential, it added.
 ""By ensuring an equitable distribution of resources and fostering a more supportive ecosystem for both public and private initiatives to co-exist and collaborate, these proposals seek to promote long-term sustainability and unlock the economic and social potential of Malta's creative sectors.""

https://timesofmalta.com/article/detective-work-required-match-royal-portraits-frames.1096889,"It is hard to tell how many paintings and portraits in the national collection have been dismounted from their original frames only to be fitted to others with which they share no common history.
 Judging by recent evidence, historical anecdotes about misplaced or looted items are not hard to believe.
 Historically, in many instances, the culprits were members of the invading French army in 1798 or were 19th-century British governors, officials and their wives in equal measure.
 The French are known to have removed items from palaces and auberges to be sent to France while the British relocated pieces of art or tableware from one auberge to another.
 In other cases, the reason for the disappearance of certain artefacts is less ‘criminal’. Materials deteriorate over time, especially when, in the past, they were subjected to outdated conservation methods below the standards of modern scientific techniques.
 Invasions of wood-eating termites, for example, would cause wooden frames to slowly disintegrate, necessitating their replacement.
 Historical disruptions and past administrative oversights aside, the matter is well known in professional circles but was recently raised by Richard Cachia Caruana, an eagle-eyed visitor.
 He served as a personal assistant and head of secretariat for Prime Minister Eddie Fenech Adami and adviser to Prime Minister Lawrence Gonzi until 2012. He was also Malta’s first permanent representative to the EU.
 Cachia Caruana observed that the portrait of Grand Master Pinto at the Palace in Valletta hangs in a frame belonging to the portrait of Emperor Francis I (Francis Stephen).
 Another portrait depicting Grand Master Ximenes “is found ‘squatting’ in a frame belonging to Emperor Charles VI”.
 These are not isolated incidents; other paintings also hang in incorrect frames.
 Sandro Debono, former senior curator at the Palace, confirmed the complexities that mark the history of the national collection.
 Basing his arguments on his doctoral research, Debono confirmed that the issue is historic and dates back to the French and British periods.
 “Historical looting and relocation of items contributed to the current confusion which can only be addressed by a veritable piece of detective work,” he said.
 The issue is not whether Emperor Francis I would have anything to say about being misidentified as Grand Master Zondadari. Or whether Grand Master Pinto would complain about having his portrait mounted to a frame belonging to a portrait depicting the Holy Roman Emperor.
 Cachia Caruana argues that misaligned frames and portraits, originally diplomatic gifts with significant historical importance, offer a skewed representation of Malta’s rich history.
 “The art might not always have been the most original, but the political message [in their donation] was important. These works should not only be judged on their artistic merit but on their historical and political significance as well.”
 He stressed the need to contextualise these artworks properly. “Heritage Malta now has the resources to re-examine every painting in their collection, including those previously deemed unimportant.”
 Emmanuel Magro Conti, a senior curator at Heritage Malta, acknowledged the issue and detailed ongoing efforts to rectify it.
 Speaking to Times of Malta, Magro Conti explained that the national agency, responsible for conservation and cultural heritage since its establishment in 2002, inherited these problems from the former Department of Museums.
 “We have been aware of these mismatches for quite some time now and we are thoroughly analysing what we have in our collection as we seek to construct their histories,” he said.
 The correct identification of the Holy Roman Emperor Francis Stephen, in a portrait that was noted in past inventories to be that of Grand Master Pinto and eventually Zondadari, is a relatively recent development.
 “These attributions were revoked, and research based on symbols, crowns, decorations and facial features within the portrait was carried out. Analysis of coats of arms, initials and/or symbols was also carried out in the quest for correctly attributing paintings with their frames.”
 Magro Conti said Heritage Malta is aware of several other mismatches, including a pair of frames featuring portraits of Grand Masters de Rohan and Ximenes, the former sitting correctly while the latter mounted to a frame that should belong to a portrait of Carl Theodore of Bavaria.
 All the shifting of these portraits occurred over a century ago during the British period.
 “These frames have been identified because they bear intertwined letters such as EM, which stands for Emmanuel Maria de Rohan, or FS, which stands for Franz Stephan, the Holy Roman Emperor.
 “We seem to have two Carl Theodore frames and one painting. The other frame with the Grand Master Ximenes portrait features the same coat of arms as those on the more elaborate Carl Theodore of Bavaria and even the intertwined capital letters CT, not CF for Charles Francis VI.”
 Magro Conti emphasised the importance of making informed decisions based on solid research and meticulously painstaking work.
 “Misaligned paintings and mismatched frames are only the tip of the iceberg. Scattered crockery and items from various dinner and tea services, flatware, cutlery and incomplete pieces of suite furniture, can only be re-united through a proper use of old inventories and laborious hands-on work.
 “We appreciate receiving observations from the public. We will make the necessary corrections when the time is right and we have solid bases for these changes to take place,” he assured.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/new-film-budget-reduces-funding-per-project.1096309,"The Arts Council’s new fund for indigenous films has an increased budget of €1 million but film-makers can now access less funding per project.
 The Screen Support Scheme, launched last month, replaces the Film Commission’s Creative Malta programme and shifts the indigenous film fund from the Tourism Ministry to the Culture Ministry.
 Despite the increase from the last official Creative Malta budget of €600,000 to the Screen Support Scheme’s €1 million, individual projects will receive less funding.
 Funding allocation per project has decreased in four categories: scriptwriting, development/pre-production, and production of feature and short films.
 For example, the maximum eligible budget for short films is now €20,000, compared to the €30,000 that had been allocated under Creative Malta.
 The maximum eligible budget to produce feature films has been reduced to €300,000, compared to the €380,000 awarded previously.
 While the number of projects eligible for funding has increased, some categories, like feature film production, still fall short.
 Film producer Oliver Mallia said: “Given the limited funding, a producer can apply for €300,000 from a total fund of €460,000. This means only one film can receive the full amount available.”
 The Screen Support Scheme includes five strands: screenwriting, development, short film production, feature-length production, and cultural programmes. The cultural programme strand is new, but the scheme lacks a strand for promoting and distributing local films, which was part of Creative Malta.
 While Mallia appreciated that the Arts Council listened to stakeholders before launching the scheme, he expressed his concerns about this omission.
 “Given the limited funds available, there is no support for distributing and circulating films,"" he said. ""This is a real blow to productions currently in post-production and looking at a release in the coming months.”
 He added: “You cannot perform miracles with a limited fund of €1 million. I never regarded this call as the answer to our issues; ACM has limited funds. What is important is what happens next; will it improve?”
 Arts Council Malta chairperson Albert Marshall previously called for the film fund to be tripled to €3 million for Maltese films to thrive alongside the foreign movie industry.
 Mallia believes the issue extends beyond funding and should focus on developing a comprehensive film policy covering all aspects from development to exhibition.
 He said it was incomprehensible that the ministry awarding funds to local filmmakers was not the ministry responsible for film.
 “All state aid support to cinema happens because of its cultural importance and not because of tourism, so maybe it’s time to revamp and move the Malta Film Commission under the correct ministry.”
 A spokesperson for Arts Council Malta said that the recommendations that came from the research consultation led to several changes in the funding block.
 ""The primary objective of these adjustments is to maximize the available funding and broaden the scope of beneficiaries who can be supported by the scheme,” they said.
 “Arts Council Malta has already gone on record stating that this is a first step and that the overall sum allocation needs to be increased in the coming years. As it always does with regards to the various funding programs it administers it will keep making necessary internal requests whenever it deems fit and justified as is in this case.”

 The Valletta Pageant of the Seas is being presented by the Valletta Cultural Agency, with the support of the Ministry for National Heritage, the Arts and Local Governance and Visit Malta.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/we-played-edsheeran-first-wedding-dance-now-see-live.1094512,"Lucianne Spiteri Gonzi was among those who could not wait for Ed Sheeran's concert on Wednesday night. 
 Wearing a T-shirt featuring the artwork of the British singer's hit album ""X,"" she  told Times of Malta that the pop singer has a special place in her heart.
  ""We played one of his songs for the first dance at our wedding,"" she said, standing alongside her husband. 
 Spiteri Gonzi hopes to recreate those memories when and if the British star performs ""Thinking Out Loud"" for the Maltese crowd. 
 Further up a queue waiting for transport to the concert venue, 23-year-old Sherice Abela, who was with her sister-in-law, said she was looking forward to attending her first-ever big-name concert. 
 ""I'm really excited; it's great to have these sort of events in Malta,"" she said. 
 ""I'm not his number one fan, but I love his songs.""  
 Spiteri Gonzi and Abela were waiting for transport at the Addolorata parking area to take them and many others to the Ta' Qali venue.
 Cars were not being allowed near the venue to avoid congestion, and many fans opted for a €10 shuttle bus service. 
 At the Paola parking people gave their two cents on the concert's car-free concept. 
 ""It's not a really good idea, they told us to come here a 5.30pm....... It's a long time to wait before the concert, and it's hot,"" Claire Borg who was waiting alongside her family said. 
 ""It's a good idea to provide transport, but a €10 fee after paying €100 for the concert was a bit unnecessary,"" another concertgoer said. 
 As he walked to the bus with his girlfriend, Enrique Galea, said he backed the car-free concept, saying it would stop people from drinking and driving. 
 Many expressed concerns over logistical issues after the event organisers announced that no cars would be allowed to park or even enter anywhere near the concert. 
 Shuttle services across Malta left for Ta' Qali at 5.30 pm. At Addolorata, long lines had already started forming half an hour before departure time. 
 But people were quickly being put on buses, and by 5.35 pm, all the packed buses had departed for the concert. 
 Those opting to use cab services like Bolt, Uber and e-Cabs still had to walk for around 20 minutes before getting to the concert. 
 All three platforms said they expected demand to surge before and after the concert. 
 The three cab companies advised independent drivers and fleets that employ drivers to be available for Wednesday night. 
 ""We certainly are expecting a surge in demand during this event and are concerned that there are not enough mobility options to cater for the demand that we anticipate,"" a spokesperson for Uber said.
 As a result, cab prices are expected to be significantly higher than usual. 
 ""Our suggestion would be to try and plan your movements outside of peak time. Arrive a little earlier, leave a little earlier/later,"" the spokesperson said.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/maltabiennaleart-advertising-promotion-cost-300000.1094745,"Advertising and events to promote the Maltabiennale.art cost the government more than €300,000, parliament was told on Monday.
 Tourism Minister Clayton Bartolo provided the figure in response to a parliamentary question by Nationalist Party MP Julie Zahra.
 Bartolo said his ministry spent €100,000 on advertising and events linked to the event, while the Malta Tourism Authority spent €224,713.
 He said the funding was approved by the Finance Ministry.
 In June, the House was told that the biennale’s launch event - held in March at the National Museum of Arts in Valletta - cost €72,383 excluding VAT.
 The total budget allocated to the biennale was €1.7 million.
 The Maltabiennale.art was held between March and May and included the participation of 80 artists from 23 countries whose work ranged from painting and drawing to installation, sculpture, and video.
 The Maltabiennale.art received criticism from the arts industry lobby MEIA, which slammed a “lack of professionalism” behind the large-scale event.
 The Nationalist Party also criticised the “disappointing” Malta Biennale, saying it was “more expensive” than the world-renowned Venice Biennale.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/culture-clash-book-festival-comic-con-share-date.1096505,"Book publishers and the head of the National Book Council say a date clash between two cultural events could impact the already struggling publishing industry.
 The Malta Book Festival is scheduled to take place at the MFCC, in Ta’ Qali from November 6 to 10 while Malta Comic Con will run over the weekend of November 9 and 10 at the Eden Arena, in St Julian’s.
 Merlin Publishers’ Chris Gruppetta said they did not have the manpower to attend both events.
 “My concern with the clash is that there’s a significant overlap in the people interested in books and comics, so the two events will cannibalise each other’s attendees,” Gruppetta told Times of Malta.
 “This year, the publishing industry is already in a crisis, so we are relying on book festival sales for a lift,” he added.
 He said, after a two-year hiatus, Merlin Library publishers will take part in the Book Festival and not Comic Con.
 National Book Council head Mark Camilleri described the clash as “unfortunate” and that the council had announced the dates of all its major events, including the Book festival, back in January
 “Both the Malta Book Festival and Malta Comic Con enjoy overlapping audiences while sharing common stakeholders,” he said.
 Publishers, booksellers and illustrators will have to juggle their time between these two large events.
 Camilleri explained that, by the time the Comic Con dates were made public, it was  too late to make any changes. The book council had contacted Comic Con organisers but efforts to resolve the issue were unsuccessful.
 “Malta Comic Con is a private entity and is fully within its rights to set its dates as it sees fit,” he said.
 “While we regret the clash this year, one hopes it can help draw attention to the importance of cooperation among cultural entities on the island, in a way that is mutually beneficial to all.”
 However, Wicked Comics, the organisers of Malta Comic Con, does not see the date overlap as a problem. Co-founder Fabio Agius believes people will be “delighted” to have multiple events to enjoy.
 While the clash was unfortunate, it was out of their control, he said. “These days, so many events are held in Malta it is virtually impossible not to clash with another,” Agius said.
 “Many people that attend the comic convention are interested in multiple scenes and will attend various events related to arts and culture. Experience has taught us that such clashes cannot be helped.”
 Agius pointed out that the Comic Con runs for two days while the Book Festival spans five days, giving people the opportunity to attend both.
 He said Wicked Comics had previously met with the Malta Book Festival organisers to discuss potential collaboration but the events were found to be logistically different.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/in-photos-sliema-youth-culture-1950s-1960s.1094319,"Exclusive footage of Sliema’s youth culture during the mid-20th century will be shown for the first time after a foundation spent the last three years building an archive. 
 Magna Żmien will be organising a talk titled The Place We Knew Isn’t That Far Away on the project and will be sharing exclusive footage for the collection for the first time on Monday, June 24. The event is targeted towards current and former Sliema residents to share their memories, but everyone is welcome. 
  The Magna Żmien Foundation archive focuses on saving analogue Maltese memories primarily from private collections.  
 The collection includes portraits of women in swimsuits at Fond Għadir, groups of friends joking along the front and recordings from a wedding at the former Imperial Hotel. 
 Photos and recordings primarily date back to the 1950s and 1960s. 
 Their latest project, supported by the Arts Council Malta ICO Fund, is sourced from the large archive private collections owned by Paul Caruana.  
  Caruana donated his collection to Magna Żmien to keep his family’s memory alive. The footage in Caruana’s collection was created by his father, uncle and Joseph Darmanin, also known as Il-Gululu. 
  Il-Gululu was a former president of the Malta Photographic Society whose portraits of his friends in his hometown manage to create an idyllic snapshot of a bygone era. The focus on Sliema was spearheaded by the foundation’s artistic director, Andrew Alamango, who is from Sliema and feels a strong connection to his roots.  
 Kris Polidano, a researcher at Magna Żmien, said Sliema has always held a unique place in Maltese youth culture.  
 “For generations, Sliema has been the go-to town for young people to hang out. My grandparents met at Chalet, as did many other couples back in the day, and even when I was a bit younger Sliema was where my friends and I would meet.”   
  A key feature of the collection is the series of photographs focusing on the landscape of Sliema.  
 
 The footage depicts Sliema as a village with a pulse as opposed to the cosmopolitan, commercial town it has turned into over the last 30 years or so.  
 “Of course you see the landscape changing but the heart and soul of Sliema remain the same,” she said. 
 The free event will take place Monday, June 24 at 7pm at the Valletta Design Cluster in Valletta.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/meet-24-contestants-hoping-represent-malta-eurovision-2025.1102406,"Christmas has come early for Eurovision fans, as the 24 semi-finalists of the Malta Eurovision Song Contest 2025 have been revealed. 
 The public and eager fans will have the chance to watch the performers battle it out during the semi-finals on the 4 and 6 February, with the grand final taking place on 8 February at the MFCC, in Ta’Qali. 
 A jury and the public will select the winner, who will represent Malta at the Eurovision Song Contest in Basel, Switzerland in May.
 The 24 semi-finalists were revealed by Magic Malta’s hosts Daniel and Ylenia.
  This year’s line-up includes a mix of established artists, Eurovision veterans and fresh new talent. 
 Making an appearance for the first time in the competition, Alexandra Alden, singer and former X-Factor Malta judge, will compete with her song Magnolia.
 
 Kurt Calleja, who previously represented Malta in 2012, returns with his track AZIZ/A, while one of Malta’s most popular artists, Fabrizio Faniello will once again return to the contest. 
 In 2001, Faniello finished in ninth place when he represented Malta at the Eurovision Song Contest in Copenhagen, Denmark, with the classic, Another Summer Night. He also represented Malta again in 2006 and was a semi-finalist in the local competition back in 2023.
 This time, he will join forces with singers Jessika Muscat, who represented San Marino at the Eurovision Song Contest back in 2018, and Victorio for their collaboration  F esta (No Time for Siesta).
 Some familiar faces from this year’s semi-finalists include Haley Azzopardi and Miriana Conte, who are once again competing to represent Malta at Europe’s largest singing competition. Azzopardi will compete with her song   Whistleblower and Conte with  Kant.
 For Nathan Psaila, this will be the third time he will be performing at the Malta Eurovision Song Contest. He will be performing Concrete.
 
 Folk-genre group Kantera, who placed second in the festival Mużika Mużika, will bring their unique energy to the contest with tongue-twister of a titled track  LalaRataTakeke LalaRataKabum. 
 Additionally, Justine Shorfid, who placed second in X Factor Malta, will perform her empowering track  Still I Rise.
 
 Former Malta Eurovision Song Contest semi-finalist and X-Factor participant, Mark Anthony Bartolo will once again try his luck with Hideaway.
 Kelsey Bellante, who formed part of last year’s girl group Erba’, will be performing solo this time, with her song  365.
 Familiar singers include Miguel Bonello, who will perform Breaking the Cycle and Stefan Galea with  Lablab (Talk Talk)
 Singer and songwriter Raquella Dalli will perform Silenced, while Victoria Sciberras, former X Factor Malta participant, will enter with  Juno.
 Out of the 24 semi-finalists, six are new to the show, including Kristy Spiteri, who will perform her song Heaven Sent and Matthew Cilia who will sing  Control.
 Dre’ Curmi will perform Te Amo and Martina Borg will hope to gain the audience's attention with  Yo Listen.
 Student and singer Krista Šujak will sing Unheard, while Kurt Anthony Cassar will perform his Maltese track  Miegħek Biss.
 
 This year will also see two Maltese bands perform; The Alchemists with their track Rubble & Stone and Adria Twins with  Qalb ma' Qalb.
 The last time a local band The Busker represented Malta was in 2023 when they failed to make it through the contest's first semi-final.
 Last year Malta was represented by Sarah Bonnici, who also crashed out at the semi final stage.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/anthony-horowitz-book-festival-special-guest.1094421,"Famed mystery writer Anthony Horowitz, the creator of teen spy Alex Rider, has been announced as the Malta Book Festival’s special guest, the Book Council announced on Tuesday. 
 Horowitz, who rose to prominence among young readers with his Alex Ryder books, has more recently taken to penning mystery and espionage stories for beloved characters James Bond and Sherlock Holmes.  
 The theme #bindingworlds has been chosen for the 2024 edition of the festival, with the aim being to highlight the power that literature has to bring together people from all walks of life. 
 Artwork by illustrator Ed Dingli has also been incorporated to highlight this theme, having created four different worlds of literary endeavour. 
 Born in 1955, Anthony Horowitz is a prolific British author whose work spans a variety of genres. Known among younger readers for his Alex Rider series of teen espionage novels, Horowitz was also notably licensed to produce fresh Sherlock Holmes and James Bond stories as blessed by the Conan Doyle and Ian Fleming estates, securing his position as an ever-dependable writer of high-quality and hi-octane entertainment with a global reach.
 More recently, his Hawthorne and Horowitz series — whose fifth book,  Close to Death, was released last April — takes a playfully meta-fictional stab at the murder mystery genre, with Horowitz writing himself into the stories as a John Watson-like presence to the titular Detective Hawthorne. 
 Horowitz is also no stranger to the world of audiovisual entertainment, both through adaptations of his literary work and his own screenwriting efforts. 
 The Alex Rider books have enjoyed both film and TV adaptations, while his 2016 novel, Magpie Murders, was made into an acclaimed BBC series starring Leslie Manville, whose six episodes were broadcast in 2023. 
 As a screenwriter, Horowitz was behind notable successes such as Midsomer Murders and the BAFTA-winning series  Foyle’s War.  
 Horowitz’s participation at the MBF 24 builds on a growing history of illustrious authors to grace the festival, with names like Salman Rushdie, Irvine Welsh, John Boyne, Naomi Klein, Joe Sacco and many others having participated at the event since its revamp from a fair to a festival in 2013. 
 
 “Needless to say, the National Book Council is excited to have an author like Anthony Horowitz headlining this year’s edition of the MBF,” National Book Council chairman Mark Camillieri said. 
 “While the Festival remains an integral part of the country’s cultural calendar and a proud reference point for the National Book Council’s work, we would be remiss if we rested on our laurels without striving to provide genuine added value for all of our visitors.”
 During the festival, Horowitz is expected to participate in several events, including a writing masterclass, a show for children and an interview with an academic. 
 The full programme of events for the 2024 Malta Book Festival (6–10 November) will be published in the coming weeks.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/malta-eurovision-entry-sarah-bonnici-ready-battle-ahead-semifinal.1092074,"As Malta's entry for the Eurovision Song Contest, Sarah Bonnici, prepares to take to the stage on Thursday, she is well aware she faces a challenge to qualify for the final.
 While the bookmakers say the chances of the 25-year-old securing a spot in Saturday's showpiece are low, the singer is ready for battle. 
 ""I am doing all I can to deliver a great performance, one I can look back on and feel proud of and be satisfied,"" she said. 
 ""Despite it being very challenging and the reality of the odds, I am very happy to face this with great courage, as I have been working so hard. We (the team) have prepared for this for so long, and we are ready to give a great performance... the rest is not in our control.""
  With her energetic number, Loop, Bonnici aims to have viewers ""on the edge of their seats with excitement"" as she opens the second-semi final on Thursday night in Sweden's Malmö Arena.
 She hopes to land one of the 10 spots in Saturday's final that are up for grabs among the 16 countries competing. Spain, France and Italy automatically qualify.
  The last time Malta made it to the Eurovision final was in 2021 when Destiny Chukunyere sailed through the semi-final with her song  Je Me Casse. Since then, both Emma Muscat and The Busker failed to make it through. 
 According to the odds aggregator eurovisionworld, Bonnici is at the very bottom of the list of 37 countries competing in Eurovision. Bonnici has less than 1% chance of winning the competition, bookmakers say.
 The Gozitan singer is undaunted, however, and has been buoyed by meeting the other contestants since she arrived in Malmö last week and from taking part in two dress rehearsals.
 ""I have received a lot of positive feedback, especially after the rehearsals,"" she said.
 ""Following the second rehearsal, a 30-second snippet of my performance was aired and the reaction was amazing. I am looking forward and very prepared to hit the stage again on the night to open the show."" 
  It's hard to not be impressed watching Bonnici embody her song title by looping through the air blindfolded, as she is supported by her dancers, who are also blindfolded. It's also hard to believe that she is a shy character. 
 “My parents used to call me the ‘singer of the fireplace or the mirror’ because I never wanted to sing in front of the public as I was so shy,” she said. “I was dancing by the age of three, but singing only at home, as I was too shy to be on stage or with a group of other singers or dancers.”
  At the age of 10, she began to attend a choir group and the teacher, Miriam Christine Borg, encouraged her to start singing on an individual level. 
 As she attended more solo singing lessons, her confidence grew, and by the age of nine she started to contest in small Gozitan singing festivals, often leaving as the winner. 
 In 2009, at the age of 11, she competed in the Malta Junior Eurovision Song Contest for the first time with ‘The Mambo Song’. The following year, she had the opportunity to join Malta’s representative, Nicole Azzopardi, at the 2010 Junior Eurovision Song Contest, as a dancer. 
 While Sarah is over 2,000km away from Malta, her fans are kept up-to-date through her social media channels.
 But she doesn't find it easy. 
 “To be quite honest, I always struggled with social media, and I still do,” she said. 
 Describing it as her “biggest struggle” Sarah said she makes a great effort to have a strong online presence, and it shows. As the countdown to the semi-finals creeps up, Sarah posts videos and stories on her Instagram every day and opens up to her fans about how she feels about her performance. 
 “It’s not easy, I have to always be online, always post and be present, which stresses me out sometimes. And at the same time, I try not to read too much of the comments, as I believe certain people just write comments without thinking and I do not want to get influenced by certain hate comments.
 “Unless comments are constructive, and I can learn from them, those are important to me.”
  Reflecting on her experience at the Malta Eurovision Song Contest, Sarah said it took her a while to accept that she won the national competition. 
 “I was never one of the favourites, I knew that. I would say I was one of the top five, but not the favourite one to win. But when the music video came out, people started to message me,"" she recalls
 She believes she and her team offer something different to what previous contestants offered in previous years, and that her performance, full of lifts, stunts and singing, caught the attention of the public.
 Growing up, Sarah recalls how she started to sing and dance from “day one”, and it’s easy to understand why once she began to describe her family. 
 “My mum can sing and play the guitar, my dad plays the piano, my uncle plays the guitar and sings, and another uncle plays the bass,” she said. 
 “We are a super musical family,” she says with a smile, recalling fond memories of her and her cousins putting together shows for the family to enjoy. 
  She recalls how all her family supported her journey to become a singer, even when she decided to quit her job as an accountant to take on singing full-time, but one person’s role stood out from the rest. 
 “My grandma, she recently passed away, I think she was always my biggest inspiration, my number one fan and the person who pushed me the most,” she recalled of her grandmother, Georgia Zammit, who died in March.
 “I grew up with her, she raised me. I used to do everything with her, from sundried tomatoes, cooking, and visiting the elderly,” she recalled. “She was such a positive person. She always pushed me to never give up on my dream.”
 “I’m dedicating all this to her. The saddest thing about her passing is that she won’t see me in Malmö, but she saw me perform in Malta. She was the first person I called when I won, and she was so happy.”
 Ten countries qualified from the first semi-final on Tuesday. They are Serbia, Portugal, Slovenia, Ukraine, Lithuania, Finland, Cyprus, Croatia, Ireland and Luxembourg.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/clinton-tamika-win-love-island-malta-season-2.1094709,"Clinton King and Tamika Ross were on Sunday crowned winners of the second season of Love Island Malta, walking away with a €20,000 prize.
 Following six weeks in the villa, full of gossip, drama, and couples falling in and out of relationships, the fate of the winners was left to the audience, with voting open between Friday and Sunday evening. A total of 45,000 votes were submitted.
 The finale, aired live on TVM, showcased the remaining four couples, Matthias Ablett and Henrika Galea, Ylenia Grech and Kyonne Gravina, Selwyn Grech and Miriam Muscat, and Clinton and Tamika.
 Shortly after the couple was announced as the winners, they were presented with two envelopes − one containing €20,000 and the other empty − they were asked to choose one at random.
  Tamika chose the envelope containing the cash and had the choice to keep the money to herself or split it with Clinton, which she did. 
 The couple won 48% of the public vote. 
 Clinton, 24, was one of the 10 original contestants who entered the villa six weeks ago while Tamika, 19, joined the villa earlier in June, during the “Casa Twist”, when the male contestants met a new group of Islanders, to test their loyalty and stir up the dynamics.
 Tamika had previously shared her struggles with mental health as a young teenager and her story of surviving a self-harm attempt.
  A day after the episode aired, the contestants began wearing green wristbands with the slogan ‘Mental Health Matters’ and carrying the national mental health helpline 1579.
 They wore the wristbands throughout the remainder of the series.
 Runners-up were couple Matthias and Henrika, followed by Ylenia and Kyonne in third place, and Selwyn and Miriam in fourth place.
 Love Island Malta, a local iteration of the UK-led reality franchise, follows single contestants, better known as “islanders”, as they competed for the prize money by coupling up and surviving public vote eliminations.
 During their stay, cameras and microphones all over the villa picked up everything the islanders said and did.
 As new contestants were brought in, others were eliminated if they failed to recouple or couple up with new contestants. 
 Love Island Malta has opened applications for the third season of the TV dating show to be broadcast in May 2025.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/awardwinning-play-malta-abortion-ban-comes-home.1098768,"An award-winning and critically acclaimed play focusing on Malta’s strict abortion ban will be performed in Valletta next year.
 Written and performed by Davinia Hamilton and Marta Vella, the play, Blanket Ban, explores the stories of Maltese women impacted by the strict abortion laws.
 In 2022, the play, produced by Chalkline Theatre, won the UK Untapped Award and received critical acclaim at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, one of the largest arts festivals in Europe. 
 Now, the London-based Maltese actors are excited to perform the show at Spazju Kreattiv in March 2025.
 “This feels like a full-circle moment,” Vella said.
 “While we have been so fortunate to share this work about our home country with British audiences, it’s Maltese audiences that need to see the show the most.”
 For three years, the two artists spent countless hours conducting dozens of interviews with women who anonymously contributed their own experiences of abortion healthcare in Malta. 
 “We are honoured to give a voice to those women who trusted us with their stories and I already get emotional at the thought that some of them will be sitting anonymously in the audience, watching.”
 Hamilton said Blanket Ban opened up a space for people to talk about their own experiences with abortion without the fear of being judged or talked down to and hopes Malta will be no exception.
 “Because abortion is a highly politicised issue, especially in Malta, women’s voices often get drowned out in the noise,” Hamilton said. 
 Malta is the only EU state that prohibits abortion in all situations, except when a woman’s life is at risk and under strict conditions. 
 While the actors feel the amendment introduced only last year is a step in the right direction, it is not enough. 
 “I think that when people are moralising about abortion, women become dehumanised,” Hamilton said. 
 “They are not people, they’re ideological containers, cyphers in some hypothetical fantasy. But women are real, and they deserve political freedom, and they deserve the right to decide what happens to their bodies.”
 Hamilton said she hopes the Maltese audience who go to watch the show will be open to listening to the stories they present, in all their “messiness and humanity”.
 “Shutting a door to conversation isn’t productive or helpful,” she said.
  Vella explained how the script for Blanket Ban never reaches a final draft, but is revised as the situation about abortion rights in Malta and around the world constantly changes.
 Last year, Blanket Ban had a month-long run in May at the Southwark Playhouse in London.
 “For this version of the show, we updated the script to reflect the changes in the year since we had last performed it. Blanket Ban is a docu-play, meaning it changes whenever the situation does.”
 The duo describe winning the Untapped Award and performing sold-out shows as a “dream come true”.
 “The experience of making and performing Blanket Ban has taught me a lot, about my creative process, about collaboration and also about my activism,” Hamilton said.
 One thing she did not expect was the number of women who would speak to the duo after watching the play because they felt the need to share their stories. 
 “We held space for many people. Maltese audiences who travelled to watch us, Americans devastated in the wake of the reversal of Roe vs Wade, and British people who didn’t realise how precarious the situation was in their own country.
 ""This phenomenon confirmed to me how necessary it was to create this space where people could talk about their own experiences with abortion, somewhere they wouldn’t be judged or talked down to.”

https://timesofmalta.com/article/these-winners-2024-national-book-prize.1098380,"Immanuel Mifsud took home the prize for best poetry when National Book Prizes for 2024 were doled out on Friday night.
 Mifsud’s Għażiż Ġismi, published by Klabb Kotba Maltin, beat titles by Maria Grech Ganado and Adrian Grima to the prize.
 It was a relatively quiet evening for Maltese fiction writers, with no nominees for best novel and prize assessors deciding not to award the best short story prize to either of the two nominated finalists, Trevor Zahra and Alfred Sant.
 There were no longlisted titles for the best drama prize.
 Adjudicators said they decided not to shortlist titles for best novel as the overall literary quality fell short of the expectations for a national award.
 No prize was awarded for the short story prize because both shortlisted titles fell short of the minimum score of 90 marks, they said.
 Warren Bartolo’s translation from the ancient Greek of Saffo, Il-Frammenti ta’ Saffo, won the prize for best translated work.
 Paul P. Borg won the prize for best literary non-fiction for his book shedding new light on poet Rużar Briffa, Fejjaqtni Int: Rużar Briffa – u Jien. 
 Judge, writer and Times of Malta contributor Giovanni Bonello won a lifetime achievement award, while Ryan Falzon was named the best emergent writer of the year.
 Winning titles were selected from a shortlist of 61 titles, published in the preceding year, across 12 competitive categories. In all, 49 books were shortlisted in the various prize categories, and 27 books for children and young adults were shortlisted in the six Terramaxka Prize categories.
 Adjudicators were full of praise for shortlisted contenders in Terramaxka categories, which focus on the best books for children and young adults.
 They praised the books for their engaging themes, contemporary illustrations, and the creative way authors and illustrators addressed new and important topics for young readers. The overall high standard of entries reflected the growing quality of children’s literature, they said.
 Claire Azzopardi’s Madame Ortensja Paskwalina De Rohan, illustrated by Moira Scicluna Zahra, won the prize for best original work for children up to age 7.
 Leanne Ellul’s Il-Każ tal-Kappell Ikkalibrat, illustrated by Marisa Attard, won the prize for children aged 8-12. 
 Claire Azzopardi was also a winner in the young adult literature category. She and co-author Glen Calleja took home the prize for  Iż-Żmien Kurjuż taż-Żgħożija. 
 Winners (see full list below) were announced at a ceremony held at the Maritime Museum in Vittoriosa.
 The National Book Prize is presented annually by the National Book Council (NBC), with winning titles chosen by an independent board of adjudicators.
 NBC executive chairperson Mark Camilleri emphasised the importance of collaboration between authors, editors, publishers, and the Council. He also announced the launch of a Foreign Rights Catalogue and the Malta Book Centre.
 Education Minister Clifton Grima emphasised the importance of literary excellence as a reflection of a nation’s intellectual development. He encouraged more Maltese writers to create works in the Maltese language, and commended the NBC for its work to promote Maltese literature both locally and internationally.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/sliema-benches-pay-tribute-victims-domestic-violence.1093099,"Public benches along Sliema’s popular promenade have been transformed into eye-catching and colourful memorials dedicated to women who were killed.
 The promenade above Sliema’s Independence Garden is now home to 35 vibrant benches, each one unique in artistic expression and colours.
 Spray-painted in different shades of blue, one bench depicts a woman with flowers in her hair and holding a dove, with the words ‘Her light shines’ written on the side. Another, in different tones of red reads ‘Violence solves nothing’.
  Another bench has the words  ‘Their memory shines’ painted, along with images of cats, which could be interpreted as a tribute to murder victim Paulina Dembska, the Polish student and cat lover killed in the same area in 2022.
 The Memorial Benches – Faces of Resilience project is an initiative by the Eastern Regional Council, in collaboration with the Sliema local council and the Gender-Based Violence and Domestic Violence Commission.
 Fourteen artists left their mark on the benches along Tower Road, each with their style to raise awareness of domestic violence.
  Anthony Chircop, the president of the Eastern Regional Council, said the council holds the title of Region of Culture 2024 and the initiative is a significant part of this year’s cultural calendar.
 “We wanted to create awareness of the support and assistance available for those suffering from domestic violence,” Chircop told Times of Malta.
 That is when the idea came about to provide workshops, guided by artist James Micallef Grimaud, where artists and community members could come together to paint and prime the benches and create a space that inspires reflection and awareness.
  Micallef Grimaud said the project is not only a means to commemorate the lives of the women lost but also to spark conversations about violence and resilience in the community.
  The artists who participated are Jack Stewart, Kristina Znakina Andonova, Saima Murtaza, Yuexin Kong, Hun Sun, Andrea Farrugia, John Schembri, Jarek Nalewajk, Aurora
 Invonne Mario, Matas Statulevicius, Jackie Fritz, Marilouis Guy, Sophia Guy and Rhys John Meredith.
 They were selected through an open call for applications back in March.
 Small plaques with QR codes will be placed on the side of all the benches, providing information on support services available for domestic violence victims.
 Chircop admitted that, while he has received positive feedback on the initiative, he has heard comments questioning if such an initiative is necessary.
 “There have been some people who said we are exaggerating and highlighting something that is not as serious as we are making it to be,” he said.
 “People say these are only a few isolated cases. Even if so, that is one too many.”
 The Malta Women’s Lobby praised the Sliema council and the Eastern Regional Council for the impactful initiative to raise awareness about violence against women through art.
 It also encouraged other local councils and regional authorities to consider similar projects to raise awareness on such pressing issues.
 The initiative is also a soft launch to the upcoming Sliema Arts Festival, to be held between July 19 and 21.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/watch-originali-bhali-changed-everything-hooligan-early-days.1096840,"Twenty years ago, Hooligan was among Malta’s best-known names.
 “After concerts, fans would crowd around my car trying to get a picture or an autograph. It was so crazy that our cars would often get damaged,” the man behind the moniker, Johnston Farrugia, reminisces.
 Known by many as Hooligan, Farrugia exploded to stardom in the early noughties with Malta’s first popular rap album in Maltese: Oriġinali Bħali.
 “Not many people thought rapping in Maltese would catch on and few people believed in me,” he said.
  Farrugia thinks the album was so successful because Maltese language rap was something new and original.
 “There were rappers in Malta but they sang in English,” he said.
 Hooligan released his debut album in February 2003 but his singles had already made such an impact that the Paceville venue holding the launch was too small to host all the people who turned up.
 “I ended up going outside after the performance and rapping with no microphone. I wanted to perform for everyone who had come for the concert but couldn’t get inside.”
 After another performance at the Farsons Beer Festival, Farrugia could not leave as fans had surrounded the backstage area.
  “They came backstage, threw away the barriers and I had to lock myself in a container and wait for the police to escort me out,” he recalled.
 “At least, I had beer flowing for the 20 minutes I waited.”
 Despite the chaos, Farrugia is grateful for that time.
 “Without fans, you are nothing. What can you do without them? Sing in the shower by yourself?”
 Hooligan’s name really took off after a guest performance in the Malta Eurovision Contest when he sang the album’s title track: Oriġinali Bħali.
  “After that, I started receiving non-stop calls from music shops to give them more CDs... they were selling like pastizzi,” Farrugia, who was 23 when the album came out, said.
 He said many thousands were officially sold but many pirated copies were also traded.
 “I used to get so many calls from the police station after they found pirated copies at village markets (monti),” Farrugia said.
  The album was among the most sold of 2003 and was number one in the music charts sourced by Exotique music store.
 “When I started, some artists used to laugh at the idea of rapping in Maltese but now they are doing exactly that,” Farrugia said.
 Twenty-one years later, there is a strong community of Maltese language rappers, with artists like Kapitlu 13, Owen Leuellen and  Il-Lapes among others, he said.
 Farrugia still performs but, if you go to see him, there will be one song you won’t hear. Oriġinali Bħali is the one song that he no longer performs.
 The lyrics about his bleached hair and baggy clothes no longer ring true.
 “I put everything that made me who I was into that song,” Farrugia said, but the track no longer describes who he is today.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/joseph-calleja-ira-losco-destiny-join-broadway-stars-schwarz-gig.1094119,"Maltese stars Joseph Calleja, Ira Losco and Destiny will be joining a cast of Broadway stars to perform Stephen Schwartz’s award-winning hits this September.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/cars-banned-ed-sheeran-concert-venue-10-shuttle-bus-35000-fans.1094269,"Ed Sheeran fans planning to watch the pop superstar in concert will not be allowed to park their cars near the Ta' Qali venue, with organisers providing a €10 shuttle bus instead.
 With more than 35,000 fans expected to attend the concert on 26 June, organisers Greatt have announced an official shuttle service provided by Koptaco for all attendees, to reduce traffic and parking problems in the area. 
 No private cars will be permitted in Ta’ Qali and the surrounding periphery on the night of the concert and ‘Y-Plate’ taxi drop-off points are a 20-minute walk from the main entrance. Those planning to travel via scooter or bike will be allowed to access the area. 
 “We strongly urge everyone to make use of this shuttle service for a convenient and hassle-free experience,” Greatt said in a statement.
 A round trip will cost fans €10 and organisers say the shuttle will pass through an exclusive route, ensuring a closer drop-off point near the entrance. 
 Shuttle pick-up points are:
 Additional parking fees will apply at private car parks. 
 The shuttle buses will depart from the pick-up points before the event at 5.30 pm and after the event at 11.45 pm. 
 Organisers urge fans to be at the pick-up points 10 minutes before the scheduled departure time. 
 ""Buses will be loaded on a first-come, first-served basis,"" organisers said.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/ed-sheeran-thrills-record-crowd-malta.1094516,"With bright lights and fireworks, Ed Sheeran burst onto the stage at Ta’ Qali for Malta’s largest-ever paid concert. 
 “This is my very, very first time in Malta and I’m so glad to be here,” he told an estimated 35,000 cheering fans. 
 Starting out in a black T-shirt stamped with ‘Malta’ in multicoloured letters, the British musical icon was in the national team’s football shirt by the time the concert ended just over two hours later. 
  It began with high-octane energy as Sheeran belted out his first track Castle on the Hill. 
 After giving a lesson on his trademark loop pedal, he took the crowd on a whirlwind of hits from his Mathematics series of albums. 
  Describing himself as their “vocal coach”, the singer-songwriter got the crowd harmonising for anthems like Give Me Love. 
 In-between tracks he talked about his music career from turning up to pubs in England where “no-one cared” to “travelling the world”.
 Encouraging everyone to hold their phones aloft for his global hit A-Team, he confessed he thought the song that made him famous would be a one-hit wonder. 
 Involving the crowd in many of his songs, he also brought on his band for classics like Lego House and introduced violinist Alicia Enstrom for hit  Galway Girl.
 There was an emotional moment when he spoke of the death of his best friend in 2022. 
 “It only hit me when I put dirt on his grave that he was not coming home,"" he said before revealing the tragedy inspired his track Eyes Closed.
 One of the highlights was a medley of songs like River,  Beautiful People and  I Don’t Care on which he has famously collaborated with other stars. Another crowd pleaser was  Thinking Out Loud, which he introduced as “the song your grandmother knows”.
 The latter half of the concert was a lullaby of gentler songs like Happier, Photograph, Perfect and  Afterglow.
 
 Describing the country as a “lovely place”, he switched outfits to a Malta football shirt before the stomping Bad Habits encore.
 “It’s been a wonderful gig,” he said. The huge crowd no doubt agreed.
 The run-up to the concert was dominated by concerns about traffic and parking arrangements but there were no reports of any major complaints or mishaps before the concert at Ta' Qali.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/no-panini-stickers-euros-anastasi-alternative.1093877,"For the first time since the 1980s, football sticker collectors will not be able to buy Panini stickers for the European championships at Valletta's Anastasi store because UEFA has decided to partner with another company.
 Since the 1970s, Panini has produced sticker albums for popular international tournaments, making it a staple in football sticker collecting. However, this year’s Euros will see a change, as the American-owned competitor Topps has taken over as the official UEFA producer for the 2024 and 2028 Euros stickers.
 “They are an American brand and this is the Euros, after all, so I doubt whether Topps will succeed. Nonetheless, I wish them luck,” said Dominic Anastasi, the owner of the Anastasi Panini store, the sole distributor of Panini stickers in Malta since 1970.
 Anastasi remains confident that his store will not be affected by this decision by UEFA, citing two reasons.
 First, he said that the World Cup, for which Panini produces the stickers, is far more popular than the Euros.
 Second, sales for the Euros always dip after the schools close for the summer because children will have fewer opportunities to exchange them. Schools will close by the end of the month, while the Euros last until July 15.
 When asked if Anastasi would ever sell the Topps stickers and album, he said: “No. My store is called Panini, I can’t do that. After 54 years in business with them, it is a matter of respect.”
 Anastasi explained that Panini has launched a separate series of stickers and an accompanying album called World Class 2024. The collection features all eight nations that have won the FIFA World Cup: Brazil, Germany, Italy, Argentina, France, Uruguay, England and Spain.
 Panini still has the advantage of owning the rights of certain teams. As a result, Panini still retains the right to feature some big names, such as Marcus Rashford, Kylian Mbappé and Marc-André ter Stegen, who will not be featured in the Topps album.
 Malta’s distributor for Topps is Miller Distributions Malta.
 The price of the Panini sticker pack and the Topps sticker pack are both €1. Yet, the Panini album is €3.50 as opposed to the Topps album, which is €2.99. Panini’s World Class 2024 has 387 sticker slots, while Topps has 728 slots.
 Anastasi also noted that the decision has affected the tradition of exchanging stickers in front of his store.
 “This decision by UEFA broke the chain of people meeting in front of the store. Some still do but most people have gone online for this cup.”
 He wholeheartedly believes that, once the World Cup comes around, we can expect to see people trading stickers outside his store again, just as they have done for decades.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/dream-insult-creatives-respond-new-culture-hub.1093097,"A recently announced multimillion-euro cultural hub in Marsa has been met with enthusiasm by the carnival community and mixed reactions by those in the arts community.
 Carnival’s artistic director called the planned hub a “dream” for carnival enthusiasts and said it would lead to even bigger carnivals in the future.
 But some of those Times of Malta spoke to were less flattering of the project, with one figure calling it “political propaganda”, an accusation flatly refuted by the head of the entity overseeing the project.
 Meanwhile, others from the dance, theatre and music world took a more measured approach, stressing that, while the project had potential, it was important to plan and manage it in the right way and not allow it to become politicised.
 The Planning Authority (PA) recently green-lit the development of a massive arts and culture hub in Marsa.
 The 77,200-square-metre project, spearheaded by Festivals Malta, is a revision of the ‘Malta Carnival Experience’ approved by the PA in 2016, now expanded to include facilities for dancers, musicians and other performing artists.
 In all, the project promises to deliver dance rehearsal studios, rehearsal space for 18 rock bands, a 914-seat outdoor theatre and a 380-indoor theatre, a performing arts museum, a 5D cinema, an audiovisual centre and a café in addition to 30 interactive workshops, 22 carnival float workshops and eight carnival costume workshops.
   Contacted about the development, carnival artistic director Jason Busuttil said the planned hub was a “dream” for carnival enthusiasts and would lead to bigger and better carnivals in the future.
 “Every party says in their manifesto there’ll be a carnival village – and now we’re going to have one,” he said.
 Stressing carnival associations had been “involved throughout” the process, Busuttil said the location of the site had been chosen due to its size and its proximity to Valletta.
 “Carnival is even bigger now than it was 10 years ago, so this will be suitable for all carnival companies,” he said, describing the reaction to the news from carnival enthusiasts as “great”.
 Asked if he was confident the project would go ahead after several failed attempts in the past, Busuttil seemed confident.
 “This project will happen for sure and carnival will be even bigger in the future.”
  Theatre director and Culture Venture founder Toni Attard said “any kind of infrastructure for the arts should be welcomed”, stressing space was now at a premium.
 Describing the hub as a “wonderful opportunity” and “definitely needed”, the director warned it was important to consult those in the industry when taking on such a large project, however, and not allow it to become politicised.
 “Everyone can benefit from this but we need to get industry players round the table and make sure these spaces are useful and available in a fair and equitable way,” he said, adding it was also important to think beyond the hub.
 “If inviting audiences there, we need transport infrastructure, for example,” he said, adding it was important to spell out whether the project was meant to benefit tourists or the local scene.
  Echoing Attard’s words, sociologist and metal musician Albert Bell said it was “important that people in the know be consulted”.
 “While we need architects to evaluate the building, we need musicians to give input on the rehearsal spaces and venues,” he said.
 Musician and Brikkuni frontman Mario Vella said he wasn’t convinced centralising rehearsal facilities in one hub was the best way of solving the issue.
   “I feel the best way of addressing this problem would be to create fully equipped rehearsal spaces dispersed around the island. Subsidised spaces that could be rented by the hour on any day by anyone,” he said.
 Emphasising the importance of such spaces being open to all, Vella warned that, should the authorities directly allocate spaces to specific artists, it could “risk turning the whole endeavour into an exercise in nepotism”.
  When contacted, the head of the country’s national dance company said it was important to find out how the promised dance facilities were going to be used and by whom.
 “The issue with cultural centres like this is they can be very ambiguous,” said ŻfinMalta artistic director Paolo Mangiola.
 “The first question is: who will use this? Are these dance studios designed to cultivate local talent? Will there be residency programmes,” he asked, stressing the importance of nurturing local dance artists.
 Commenting on so many artforms being under one roof, he said he was a “bit concerned” by the idea if done without a “clear vision”, emphasising “they all need their own space”.
 Asked if he had been consulted on the project, Mangiola said he hadn’t, adding he had “no idea what’s going on”.
  Meanwhile, theatre director and former Spazju Kreattiv boss Chris Gatt called the announcement of the new hub “a gimmick”.
 Slamming the announcement as “pre-election propaganda”, Gatt said “nobody knew about it” before it was announced.
 “It’s insulting to the artistic community; on the one hand, they say there’s no money [for the sector] and, then, they announce this,” he said, adding he was unconvinced by the project’s leadership.
 “What the hell are Festivals Malta doing managing this,” said Gatt, questioning the wisdom of placing an outdoor theatre close to an abattoir located nearby in the area.
  Responding to the concerns, Festivals Malta CEO Francis Agius downplayed fears of a lack of industry consultation, saying there “definitely” had been.
 “We had meetings with carnival associations and float builders, MEIA [Malta Entertainment Industry and Arts Association], musicians, dancers and Teatru Malta... naturally, some people felt left out,” he said.
 When contacted, MEIA president Maria Galea said the project had only been discussed briefly in a meeting with the authorities where other topics were also discussed.
 
 She said the MEIA stressed the need for “proper consultation” with the sector, adding none of the latest plans, presentations or strategy for the proposed hub were ever presented to the organisation or the creative community.
  Asked why Festivals Malta had assumed leadership of such a large infrastructure project, Agius replied that carnival, rock bands and dance companies now fell under the remit of the organisation.
 Quizzed on the appropriateness of the site chosen for the hub, he asked what was wrong with it, adding Festivals Malta had carried out studies showing how the project would enhance the area, including the old part of the nearby abattoir – which, he said, would be restored.
 Responding to accusations the announcement had been made for political gain, Agius called the idea “laughable”, stressing the application for the hub had been sent a month earlier and had been planned for around a year.
 “It’s not an election gimmick,” he said.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/ed-sheeran-ta-qali-a-step-step-traffic-guide.1094420,"More than 35,000 fans are expected to watch the British pop icon Ed Sheeran at the Ta’Qali picnic area on Wednesday.
 Thousands are expected to fly to Malta for the concert to watch the multi-grammy artist, best known for major hits like Shape of You, and  Castle on The Hill, yet there has been backlash over the decision to ban  private cars and  public transport from entering the Ta’Qali venue, with organisers providing a subsidised €10 return bus service at seven shuttle pick-up points across Malta. 
 Still not sure how to get to the Ta’ Qali venue? 
 Here’s a step-by-step guide for how to get to the concert by any means of transport- whether private car, public bus or cycling. The information has been provided by organisers greatt and NnG promotions.
  The main entrance for Standing A, Standing B, Seated X and Seated Z ticket holders is from the MFCC North Gate, by the Ta’Qali outdoor gym.
 Yes. Those ticket holders have a separate entrance, which is located on the side facing the National Park and should have received guidance via email.
 Specific parking arrangements have been organised for these ticket holders. 
 On-site officials will assist attendees with reduced mobility for drop-offs and pick-ups close to the entrance. It is important to present your blue badge for drop-offs. Safe pick-up points for after the event are minutes away from the main entrance and attendees are asked to follow guidance from officials on site.
 Yes. The pick-up & drop-off point is just outside the main entrance. 
 It is the same point for fans who will be dropped off/ picked up by private group transport,  coaches or  cars.
 It’s important to note that private vehicles will not be allowed to enter the entrance area.
 For those who are brave enough to drive to the venue, it is important to note that several roads will be closed on the day.
 This is where the above map comes in handy.
 Coming from the direction of Mosta, Triq Buqana will be accessible, and cars can drive into  Triq Il-Kbira. From there, they can follow traffic signs to the road leading to the entrance. 
 The road facing the picnic area will be closed off to traffic and will only be open for pedestrian access.
 Cars may exit the area via Triq Buqana.
 Triq Hemsija and the side roads leading to Ta’Qali will be closed.
 Coming from Attard, drivers can access Triq Durumblat and along  Triq San Ġakbu.
 Triq Vjal L-Istadium Nazzjonali will also be open to traffic.
 Looking at the map, a visual ring road around the venue has been created to ease the flow of traffic.
 Yes, but parking is limited. Parking areas are located next to the dog park, on the side of the main entrance, and along Triq Vjal L-Istadium Nazzjonali.
 If fans do plan on travelling by car, organisers encourage carpooling or alternative transportation due to the heavy income and outgoing traffic envisaged in the area.
 The service is on a first-come, first-served basis and a ticket is required.
 The shuttle buses will depart from the pick-up points before the event at 5.30 pm and after the event at 11.45 pm and organisers urge fans to be at the pick-up points 10 minutes before the scheduled departure time. 
 The shuttle service point is located behind the Millennium Stand.
 It is going to be a busy night for cab drivers. 
 All 'Y' plate cars have a designated area at the farmer's market parking. 
 No other zones will be accepted for cab pick-ups and drop-offs.
 Yes, but public buses are being diverted away from the concert. 
 A Malta Public Transport spokesperson previously told Times of Malta: “Due to the traffic management measures in place for the Ed Sheeran concert at Ta’ Qali on June 26, buses are being diverted to pass through the Central Link and stop on bus stops ‘Qali 1’, ‘Qali 2’ and ‘Qali 3’ – about a 30-minute walk.”  
 Don’t want to use the shuttle bus and are worried about parking hassle?
 Cycling advocacy NGO Rota is organising a bicycle bus from Valletta to the Ta’ Qali concert. 
 A bicycle bus is when a group of people cycle together and is considered a safer way of experimenting with cycling on busy-traffic congested roads. 
 The group will be meeting at 5.30 pm near the Triton Fountain and ride through Ħamrun, Santa Venera, Birkirkara, Attard and Ta’ Qali.
 Rota has posted the expected times for those who wish to join them at different points.
  A return bicycle bus after the concert will also be organised.
 Social media was flooded with ticketholders expressing their irritation at the traffic situation.
 “Jesus it’s going to be a nightmare,” one individual commented on social media. 
 “I guess it’s a blessing we never win Eurovision.”
 Another called out the organisers' decision as “shameful”.
  “All about the money in their pocket. Is there anything organised for those who are not able to walk for a long way,” the person asked.
 Another furious ticket holder, Angela Rogers, shared her frustrations with Times of Malta, questioning why the public could not park their cars in the numerous parking spots found in Ta’Qali.
 Odette Vella, director of Information at the Consumer Office of the Malta Competition and Consumer Affairs Authority (MCCAA) said it has initiated discussions with organisers regarding the last-minute chances to access arrangements. 
 Vella was speaking on RTK103 on Wednesday.
 Speaking to Times of Malta on Tuesday, Tourism Minister Clayton Bartolo did not agree with the backlash.
 ""This could be a chance as a country to make a shift when it comes to our transport,"" Bartolo said on Tuesday. 
  He was speaking after a brief walk-around at the concert site with organisers. 
 ""If everyone complains about traffic, but then expects to arrive at the venue by car, I believe this is a chance how we as a country can work together and everyone is responsible.""
 He said previous events have had similar traffic management plans.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/finalists-for-the-2024-national-book-prize-terramaxka-prize-announced.1097298,"The National Book Council announced the 49 finalists for the 2024 National Book Prize and Terramaxka Prize Tuesday. 
 This is the 47th edition of the National Book Prize, the highest literary prize assigned to authors, editors, translators, publishers and illustrators of books published in Malta in 2023.
 There are 12 categories, ranging from the best short stories to historiographic research, to the best children’s literature works.
 This year, no novels were shortlisted for the National Book Prize and the council received no entries for the Drama category.
 The winners in each category of the National Book Prize and the Terramaxka Prize will be announced during an award-giving ceremony on 20 September 2024. 
 Winning books will enjoy an adequate period of promotion, and a suitable showcase at the upcoming edition of the Malta Book Festival 2024 on 6-10 November. 
 The finalists that made it to the shortlist have been unanimously selected by an independent panel of adjudicators according to a set of established criteria.
 Twenty-two books have been shortlisted across the six National Book Prize categories, and 27 books for children and young adults have been shortlisted in the six Terramaxka Prize categories.
 The titles were published by 10 different publishers and authored by 27 different authors and translators. 
 Nine different illustrators contributed with their illustrations in books shortlisted in the Terramaxka Prize categories. As per regulations, the adjudicators were asked to select a maximum of five entries for each shortlisted category. 
 The categories of the National Book Prize for adults are Novels, Short Stories, Poetry, Drama, Non-Fiction, Translation, Research and Historiographic Research.
 No novels were shortlisted for the National Book Prize and no entries were submitted in the Drama category.
 The six categories of the Terramaxka Prize are:
 Picture books for children (ages 0–7), Children’s Literature (ages 8–12) and Young Adult Literature, as well as Picture books translated into Maltese (ages 0-7), Children’s Literature translated into Maltese (ages 8-12), and Young Adult Literature in Maltese Translation. 
 The adjudication process for the 2024 National Book Prize was launched in February 2024 with the publication of the longlist. By 2 April 2024, publishers and authors had submitted a total of 173 longlisted and eligible books to be considered for the current edition of the National Book Prize.
 The adjudication panel for the National Book Prize decided not to shortlist any titles in the Novels category in this year’s competition.
 ""This choice reflects a commitment to maintaining the highest literary standards and ensuring that the integrity of the prize is preserved. The panel found that, while many submissions demonstrated thorough research, the overall literary quality fell short of the expectations for a national award,"" the statement read.
 The decision was made after careful deliberation, with the panel agreeing that the focus remains on raising the bar for what constitutes exceptional literary work in Malta. In light of their comments, the panel suggested exploring opportunities to support authors through initiatives such as masterclasses, which could help bridge the gap between popular writing and literary excellence.
 Adjudicators highlighted the quality of research books, spread out across a wide range of publishers and boasting diverse themes.
 The poetry category was strong enough to warrant lively debate among adjudicators ahead of the final selection — speaking to the variety of interesting voices among the shortlisted entries — while the translation category featured works with significant cultural relevance and impressive efforts in translation. In the Terramaxka categories, the shortlisted books stood out for their engaging illustrations and well-crafted narratives. 
 As per regulations, only one prize will be awarded per category, and prizes will only be given in categories where the shortlisted titles meet a high standard of literary, cultural, or academic merit, with a minimum score of 90 marks.
 The prize money awarded in each National Book Prize category, including the special prizes, is €4,000. The only exception is the prize money for the translation categories of the Terramaxka Prize, which is €2,000. The publisher of each winning book will also receive an additional prize of €1,000 per winning book. 
 All of the National Book Prize shortlisted books are available in local bookstores and online shops, and will be available at the upcoming 2024 Malta Book Festival (6–10 November) to be held at the Malta Fairs & Conventions Centre (MFCC), Ta’ Qali.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/president-appeal-the-film-industry.1094720,"The President has urged the Film Commission and the Film Commissioner to respect the principles of accountability and good governance in order to foster the public’s trust in their operations.
 Myriam Spiteri Debono made the appeal on Sunday during the second Mediterrane Film Festival. The first edition was dogged by claims of lavish spending and a lack of transparency over how taxpayer’s money was used.
 There was also harsh criticism in 2022 over spending on the Malta Film Awards where British comedian David Walliams was paid €120,000 to host the event. That figure only became known after a freedom of information request.
 
 ""To foster the public’s trust in its operations, the commission and the commissioner have to keep in mind and respect the principles of accountability and good governance,"" the president said.
 ""Accountability and good governance, not least transparency, have to inspire decision-making. These principles should be at the basis of all operations, year in year out.""
 Spiteri Debono observed that according to the Budget, Malta would be spending €39.8 million on the film industry this year. A total of €3m will be used for the upgrading of film facilities, and €35m for incentives.
 
 ""I emphasise that this is the people’s money. Accountability and transparency cannot be underestimated. These values, together with the diffusion of information, are the basis for fostering and nurturing the people’s trust in the film industry,"" she said.  
 Earlier, the President briefly went over the history of the film industry in Malta and said everyone agreed that the development of a stable and sustainable film sector was beneficial for the country.
 But several challenges needed to be overcome, one of the most essential was sustained promotion. 
 The sector needed to overcome the perception that filmmaking did not provide a year-long occupation. Promotion of the industry was also of primary importance if the film industry was to develop into one of the pillars of the Maltese economy.  
  The Mediterrane Film Festival, now in its second year, was therefore a business development tool. 
 The President noted that whereas in 2017 around 300 local workers used to work in the film industry sporadically, that number had since gone up to 1,000, most of them working throughout the year, from one production to the next.
 ""This is laudable, but one must always keep in mind that the film industry must necessarily operate within a framework which fosters the public’s trust in the industry,"" the president said.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/love-islanders-boxing-match-cancelled-last-minute-humiliating-demands.1101782,"Updated 5.40pm with Bulletproof statement
 A boxing match between ex-Love Islanders Dale Mallia and Kyonne Gravina has been cancelled at the last minute due to unresolved contractual issues.
 Mallia and Gravina, also known as Bello and Kuġin respectively, announced the cancellation on Friday, citing last-minute changes to their contract.
 The nature of those last-minute changes remains a matter of dispute. While the two fighters say organisers Bulletproof Culture wanted to introduce ""humiliating"" post-match conditions, organisers say the fighters made ""unrealistic"" and last-minute financial demands.  
  Gravina said that the last-minute changes would ""involve us doing humiliating things in front of the audience”.
 Among these were shaving their heads, live laser tattoo removal, and getting each other's names tattooed as a condition of losing.
 Mallia added: “Some of the things they wanted us to do in front of people are ridiculous”.
 The fighters accused Bulletproof Culture of exploiting them for content.
 “They used us just for content,” Mallia said, with Gravina adding: “Just for them to gain views"". 
 The dispute escalated on Thursday when the pair sought legal advice following repeated amendments to the match conditions.
 The pair said that after they signed an agreement to engage in a match, organisers failed to put their own signatures to the terms and then proceeded to introduce various changes “unilaterally”. 
 “We focused more on the training than the contract,” admitted the fighters, who on Thursday said they hoped the matter would be resolved before the fight. 
 They expressed regret for disappointing fans who had purchased tickets, many of whom have since asked about refunds. Others, however, commended the pair for standing their ground.
 Organisers, however, say the allegations being made by Gravina and Mallia are untrue. The real reason the fight was cancelled had to do with money, they said. 
 In a statement on Friday afternoon, organisers said: 
 ""All the allegations being made by Gravina and Mallia are rejected as completely unfounded and false.
 ""In particular, it is not correct that the agreement with Gravina and Mallia failed due to lack of commitment from Bulletproof Culture. Unfortunately, both Gravina and Mallia had financial expectations which were unrealistic and not feasible in the circumstances. This also taking into account the fact that interest generated by the potential involvement of the pair did not meet expectations.
  ""We have nonetheless engaged with the involved parties and their legal representatives to address the concerns raised in good faith. Both Gravina and Mallia significantly raised their demands at the last minute, and a decision was taken not to entertain such requests.
 ""The fight between Gravina and Mallia was going to be just an exhibition fight within the main event. Therefore this fight was negligible in the highly anticipated event which will feature various respected and professional athletes.
 ""Furthermore, in relation to the comments made on alleged humiliating acts, Bulletproof Culture categorically rejects any suggestion that it has engaged in any degrading behaviour. This runs counter to our core values of respect and integrity and we have so far endeavoured to give a platform to promising individuals. The comments made in this regard are therefore extremely defamatory and Bulletproof Culture shall be taking all the appropriate action to safeguard its rights.""
 The Love Islanders' fight was part of the so-called ""biggest fighting event on the island,"" set to take place on Friday evening at Ta’ Qali.
 Despite the cancellation of Mallia and Gravina's bout, the event will feature 10 other matches.
 A spokesperson for Bulletproof Culture told Times of Malta: “They had a golden opportunity, but they missed their chance”.
 They said the cancelled bout was ""negligible"" when compared to the full event. 
 Fans and ticket-holders are now awaiting further updates, including whether refunds will be issued for Mallia and Gravina's cancelled match.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/concertgoers-look-back-anger-extortionate-gallagher-bar-prices.1098507,"People at a Liam Gallagher concert on Sunday night were left with a bitter taste in their mouth, saying they were bled dry by the prices for drinks during the show by concert organisers.
 As Gallagher thrilled crowds at the newly unveiled Ta’ Qali concert area, the event’s bar prices left many wondering if it was worth the aggravation.
 As has become customary in many concerts and large events, the concert adopted a credit system, where attendees were asked to buy a wristband to act as a digital wallet throughout the event.
 The wristband could then be topped up and used to buy drinks, with a minimum top-up of €25 credit.
 But, despite the widespread praise for the show and the event’s organisation, several people have taken to social media to express their dismay at the price of the drinks on offer.
 A pint of Stella Artois on draft, reportedly Gallagher’s tipple of choice, set visitors back a staggering €11, with a half-pint going for €9.
 Heineken was €1 less, with the cheapest beer on offer, a small can of Bavaria, being sold at €6.
 The bar’s price list shows that other drinks were no cheaper. A glass of wine was priced at €8, spirits with mixers going for €9, and the more cosmopolitan gin and tequila drinkers dishing out as much as €14 for their drinks.
 Non-alcoholic drinks were somewhat cheaper, although still well above market prices at €5 for a soft drink and €3.50 for a small bottle of water.
 To rub salt into the wound, punters say, they were charged a €2.50 “activation fee” when topping up their wristband for the first time during the event, effectively leaving them with €22.50 credit.
 Moreover, the bar’s price list shows that they were to be charged an additional €1 for a “refundable” cup but organisers say that this additional charge was never actually implemented.
 Several concertgoers who spoke to Times of Malta expressed their dismay at this system, saying they were puzzled to find that they only had 50 cents credit left on their account, despite only having bought two drinks.
 Others took to social media, describing the prices as “extortionate” and “a joke”, accusing organisers of exploiting the captive audience to boost their earnings. Others described the system as “a racket”, and an example of “greed”.
 The organisers’ website says that this cashless system was adopted to cut down on queueing time and hassle (“Don’t look for money every time you want to buy something,” the website says).
 The organisers say that concertgoers should top up “at least” €100 on their first top-up, to have “more time to enjoy the event”.
 They also assure concertgoers that they can apply for a refund for any unspent funds, but only as long as they have at least €5 unspent credit in their account and apply for a payout by tomorrow.
 Speaking to Times of Malta a spokesperson for the concert’s organiser, 356entertainment, defended the bar’s pricing scheme, saying that this was necessary to make the event feasible.
 While bar prices were higher than average, the spokesperson admitted, this was offset by ticket prices which were kept deliberately low, at €60 a pop for Sunday’s concert.
 “This was an intimate four-day festival to a crowd of 5,000 people which involved massive expenses and considerable financial risk on our part,” the spokesperson said, pointing to how tickets for the Oasis reunion tour are selling for 10 times the price of last weekend’s concert.
 “We overcharge on drinks to put the money back into the highest possible quality production, not to pocket it,” the spokesperson said. “Our events follow the highest standards of quality and safety but this involves a big expense.”
  The spokesperson argued that the company had to choose between charging higher entry prices or higher prices for drinks to make ends meet, ultimately opting for the latter.
 “The drinks were priced above average but they were at typical concert prices. Pricing was agreed upon in conjunction with our international partners, and we also gave out free water at medical tents and at the front of house.”
 The spokesperson said that concertgoers could have avoided the €2.50 activation fee by carrying out their first top-up online, before the show, as explained in an information pack sent to anyone who bought a ticket.
 As for the €5 refund cutoff, the spokesperson argued that this was necessary to cover bank charges and administrative expenses.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/broadway-coming-malta-performers-say-cant-wait.1096797,"For Broadway actors and singers Matthew James Thomas and Keri René Fuller, performing in Malta next month is more than just another gig. 
 “What we will be creating is something completely unique and it will be happening for the first time in Malta. I’m so excited for it,” said Thomas.
 He was speaking ahead of next month’s Defying Gravity concert at the Mediterranean Conference Centre, featuring a selection of music by Grammy, Academy and Tony award-winning composer Stephen Schwartz.
 It will be Schwartz’s debut appearance in the country and the first time his Broadway music has been arranged for orchestra and comes just two months before the release of a Hollywood adaptation of his award-winning musical Wicked.
 Thomas and Fuller will be joined onstage by local stars Joseph Calleja, Ira Losco and Destiny and fellow Broadway performer Michael McCorry Rose, accompanied by the Malta Philharmonic Orchestra.
 “For a minute, we didn’t think we’d be lucky enough to pull this off. Everybody’s schedules are crazy... they’re all superstars,” said Thomas.
 The British-born performer found early roles in cult films About a Boy and  Billy Elliot and is now based in New York full-time, where he starred in the 2013 Broadway revival of Schwartz’s  Pippin musical. 
 And while his career has taken him to venues across the world, the MCC offers something special: “Broadway is amazing but when you walk into that unbelievable, medieval-looking theatre you can feel it [the atmosphere] already... We’re so excited.”   
  Thomas’s relationship with Malta began a decade ago after his parents purchased a holiday home in Gozo, a choice that would pave the way for next month’s concert – the idea for which he came up with around five years ago.
 “I was waiting for an early morning flight and that’s when I decided I had to do something here... by that time, I had seen a lot of performances in Malta and had really got a sense for the intense amount of musical talent here. And it all just fell into place.”
 Stressing it was rare for Schwartz to make live appearances, he said the award-winning composer, arranger and lyricist had been enthusiastic about the idea of bringing his music to Malta, however. 
  “I sent a very impromptu email to Stephen asking if he wanted to do a concert in Malta and he emailed me back almost immediately saying yes,” he said, adding plans for the concert had to be put on hold after the outbreak of COVID-19 shortly afterwards, however. 
 And further challenges lay ahead. 
 “Finding the artists we thought would be great for the show, the availability of the MPO, raising money – and putting a lot of our own money into it to get it moving – finding the right venue and figuring out the right size audience for something like this... it’s difficult.”
 But he believes the difficulties will be worth it, stressing that, being able to hear Schwartz’s music performed live by a philharmonic orchestra, opens a “whole new world of opportunities”.
  Fellow performer Fuller added it had been a challenge deciding which repertoire to include in next month’s performance, stressing Schwartz’s catalogue includes “hit after hit... even this concert doesn’t include all of his amazing songs”.
 In addition to his more than five decades of work on Broadway productions, Schwartz has also penned music and lyrics for animated blockbusters The Prince of Egypt,  Enchanted,  The Hunchback of Notre Dame and  Pocahontas.
 Asked about working with the well-known Maltese performers taking part, Thomas called them “brilliant” and said the cast were having fun rehearsing together. 
 “Everyone’s got such a great sense of humour and they’re so enthusiastic and supportive…. they’re the best.”
 The pair also plan to run a series of masterclasses in September and believe the time is ripe with cultural activities seemingly on the rise in Malta. 
 Fuller said that while researching the local scene they discovered “so many music schools and dance studios, with more springing up”, stressing it was important to foster creativity in the next generation of performers. 
 Do the pair have any advice for young performers in Malta? 
 “Keep doing it [performing] as much as you can, everywhere and all the time... in front of your friends and family and even other places where you’re less comfortable,” said Thomas, while warning against relying on platforms like Instagram as the only place to perform. “It’s not the practice of being in a live space with an audience and acting hasn’t actually changed; your ability to communicate has to come through.”
 Last month, a leading Hollywood casting director told Times of Malta she was “not at all” aware of any Maltese films, something the two Broadway actors think should be addressed.
 Describing the award-winning Maltese film Luzzu as “amazing”, Thomas said it was a shame that audiences “don’t know Maltese stories”, stressing the country should “not just be a place for people to film because it looks like somewhere else”.
 “There’s so much history in this country and I just want to see more of it,” he said, adding the pair had seen some “unbelievable independent films... and most of them haven’t come from the [United] States”.
 Fuller agrees: “This is a culture that is deserving of being celebrated... there are very deep roots here but they could be tapped more.”

https://timesofmalta.com/article/international-artist-cascada-headline-valletta-nye-celebrations.1101227,"German dance music star Cascada is set to headline Malta's New Year's Eve Celebration in Valletta this year, the Culture Ministry has announced.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/how-death-friend-spawned-artistic-piece.1094359,"When guitarist and artist Andrew Schembri passed away in June 2023, many of his close friends were left in a state of shock. His artist friend Evan Demicoli was shaken.
 After allowing himself time to take in the loss of his friend, Demicoli began a constructive grieving process that led him to create his debut artwork, Dmugħ.
 The artwork focuses on loss, love and hope, and takes an intimate look at parents who have lost their children.
 Dmugħ (tears) zooms in on the relationships of Isabelle Bonnici and her sons, both named Jean Paul, Catherine Schembri and her son Andrew, and Darrin Zammit Lupi and his daughter Rebecca.
 The artwork forms part of the exhibition Shifting Contexts held at Spazju Kreattiv, which is curated by Trevor Borg and explores the theme of water.
 Demicoli said the reason he titled the artwork Dmugħ was not only because of the theme of the exhibition but also because he was inspired to create the piece while he was crying.
 Demicoli and the guitarist knew each other since they were both children.
 “We grew up together in Żurrieq and began our creative processes together. When he passed away it was a huge shock to the system and I felt compelled to dig deeper within myself.”
 Demicoli said once he knew what he wanted to create he reached out to Schembri’s mother, Catherine. He knew he did not just want to focus on Andrew for the piece and wanted to make it a more holistic journey of loss.
  That triggered him to contact Isabelle Bonnici who he was already assisting in her fight for justice after her son Jean Paul Sofia was killed in a construction collapse. Finally, he reached out to Darrin Zammit Lupi, who lost his daughter Rebecca in January 2021, aged 15.
 The work invites the viewer to reflect on the past, the present and the future. The viewer engages with the past by means of portraits of Jean Paul, Andrew and Rebecca.
 The viewer is then encouraged to engage with the present by means of sitting and watching powerful and vulnerable video testimonies of the parents.
 In the emotionally charged videos, the parents share intimate details of how they remember their children as well as how they have managed to keep going since their children’s passing.
 With tears in his eyes, Zammit Lupi shares how, if given the chance to see his daughter again, he would give her “the most bone-crushing hug imaginable”.
 Bonnici opened up on why she still feels she is a mother even after both her sons passed away. And Schembri explains how every day she still feels and sees Andrew’s light.
 The artwork tackles the question of the future by means of a Tamarix bonsai tree. While other plants falter and wither in the presence of saltwater, the Tamarix stands resilient, distinguishing itself as a survivor.
 Zammit Lupi said: “I wanted to participate in this as a way to continue to share the story of my daughter.”
 The artwork forms part of the exhibition Shifting Contexts at Spazju Kreattiv which is showing until June 30. Entrance is free.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/maltese-film-uwijja-attracts-37000-online-viewers.1096358,"The Maltese film Uwijja attracted 37,000 international viewers after it was made available on popular international streaming websites in the beginning of 2023.
 Uwijja follows the tale of John (Kim Camenzuli), who is balancing school, work and his social life, and touches upon the dangers of drink driving.
 Directed by Keith Albert Tedesco, the film was screened locally in 2022 and was made available on numerous streaming channels such as Amazon Prime, Canal VOD, iTunes, Google, iNDEMAND and Vudu. It was seen by 37,000 viewers between 2023 and this June. Available on GO, the film has also gained popularity among local viewers.
 It had an average of 20,000 views per month last year, plus an additional 6,000 views every time it was broadcast, which happened six times in 2023.
 “Having a quarter of a million people watch such a small film is a big deal to me,” Tedesco said.
 “Initially, I was surprised and I am relieved that a €20k film did well. The €20k went a long way and I didn’t have to break the bank or spend unnecessary and exuberant amounts of taxpayers’ money to do something for our film culture and society.”
 
 Uwijja will be screened at the Gozo Film Festival on August 24.
 Following Uwijja, Tedesco dived into his third production, a mini-series ‒  The Home Straight ‒ about a retired Maltese athlete with a club foot who comes out of retirement and, against all odds, becomes one of Europe’s top 400 sprinters. The script was inspired by the childhood experiences of the lead actress, Sarah Naudi, who grew up with a club foot.
  Tedesco had launched a crowdfunding campaign to start working on the new production, which is at the post-production stage.
 “The Home Straight has been a most eye-opening experience as I haven’t filmed in Malta for some time and the climate and attitude towards local film-making has changed for the worse,” he said. “It’s more expensive now and there is less heart.”
 He said he struggled to find cast and crew who were willing to make themselves available for filming or to retain crew, who would prefer to work for a big name studio instead.
 “It was a lot of begging and, in the end, I was heartbroken. Thank God, I was surrounded by a few film lovers like Fabrizio Fenech and Sarah Naudi, who helped me cross the finish line.”
 But the experience also had its positive moments. Tedesco had teamed up with Athletics Malta and had a few strong athletes feature in the film playing themselves.
 “It was humbling, amazing and rewarding to have such a dedicated representation of this side of Malta give their all for the film,” he said.
 “It was beyond amazing. Their lives and passions are something to be celebrated, and spending just a few days with them was enough for me to feel like I’ve come up on top, even if it was the most challenging project I’ve ever had to do.”

 Artistic Director Antoine Farrugia said that one may also find an interactive map on the Festivals Malta website to help the audience find its way around during the event, though the public is encouraged to plan in advance to ensure a pleasant experience at Notte Bianca. He also explained how Festivals Malta took care to organize every performance in a particular artistic route to allow audiences to find the events that interest them easily.
 Minister for National Heritage Owen Bonnici expressed his satisfaction with the fact that this edition of Notte Bianca will have over 50 events involving over 250 artists. ""Notte Bianca is a vibrant festival full of colours, activities and art.

         The winners of the 2024 National Book Prize - for books published in 2023 -  were announced on Friday evening during a private ceremony held at the Maritime Museum in Birgu. The National Book Prize is presented annually by the National Book Council, with winning titles chosen by an independent board of adjudicators in line with a rigorous selection process.
 In his opening address, the National Book Council (NBC) Executive Chairperson Mark Camilleri highlighted the achievements of Maltese literature in 2023 and the continued efforts to raise local publishing standards to international levels. He emphasised the importance of collaboration between authors, editors, publishers, and the Council in enhancing the quality of Maltese literature. Camilleri also announced ongoing initiatives, including the launch of a Foreign Rights Catalogue and the Malta Book Centre, while reaffirming the Council's commitment to fostering local talent and promoting Maltese books on the global stage. He concluded by congratulating the winners and finalists for their contributions to Maltese literature.  The Minister for Education, Sport, Youth, Research and Innovation Clifton Grima emphasized the importance of literary excellence as a reflection of a nation's intellectual development. He highlighted that strong literature is a product of thoughtful writing and contributes to the advancement of society. The Minister encouraged more Maltese writers to create works in the Maltese language, aiming to elevate the status of the national language through a rich literary tradition. He commended the efforts of the NBC in promoting Maltese literature both locally and internationally, emphasising their role in ensuring that the nation remains dedicated to books and the written word. Grima concluded by congratulating all finalists, with special recognition for the winners celebrated at the event.
 The winning titles were selected from a shortlist of 61 titles, published in the preceding year, across 12 competitive categories: 49 books have been shortlisted across six National Book Prize categories, and 27 books for children and young adults have been shortlisted in the six Terramaxka Prize categories. As per regulations, the adjudicators were asked to select a maximum of five entries for each shortlisted category.
 Additionally, while two finalists were shortlisted in the Short Stories in Maltese and English category, ultimately no prize was awarded for this category as both titles fell short of the minimum score of 90 marks.
 The Terramaxka Prize this year celebrated several children's books for their outstanding quality in both content and production. The adjudicators praised the books for their engaging themes, contemporary illustrations, and the creative way authors and illustrators addressed new and important topics for young readers. The winning titles stood out for their ability to capture the imagination of children, with visual storytelling that enhanced the reading experience and made complex subjects accessible to a younger audience. The overall high standard of entries reflected the growing quality of children's literature in these categories.
 Two special prizes were also bestowed during the ceremony. The prestigious Lifetime Achievement Award was conferred to Giovanni Bonello.
 The award for Best Emergent Author was given to Ryan Falzon.
 The National Book Council would like to thank the members of the adjudication board of the 2024 National Book Prize and Terramaxka: Ruth Ancilleri, Robert Attard, Nicole Bugeja, Roderick Mallia, Omar 'N' Shea, Maria Theuma, Mario Thomas Vassallo, Sherise Zammit and William Zammit.

https://theshiftnews.com/2024/09/14/relief-at-pbs-as-ceo-is-shown-the-door/,"Aqra 
 News of the departure of PBS Executive Chairman Mark Sammut was celebrated by staff at the state broadcaster, as they were informed he would not be returning to his office after his long summer break in Florida.
 Multiple PBS employees told The Shift that many took a short break to celebrate the ‘good news’ as soon as the first reports started appearing on social media.
 Describing Sammut as “a dictator”, worse than those who ran PBS at the time of Xandir Malta in the 80s, they recounted Sammut’s reign of insults and intimidation, which led to some 30 veteran and experienced employees leaving the station during the past two years.
 “I have never experienced such an arrogant man,” a veteran technician told The Shift, recounting how Sammut once called him “dog’s shit” in front of his colleagues.
 Others recounted how the chairman, handpicked by Prime Minister Robert Abela, ordered his employees to call him Mr Chairman.
 He treated women disrespectfully and sent several employees home, leaving them nothing to do but still paid fully through PBS funds.
 “We have never seen some of the employees in the past two years, as the chairman told them not to report to their office anymore. Yet they remained on the payroll,” a senior manager said.
 A former adviser to former EU Commissioner John Dalli, Mark Sammut switched to Labour as soon as disgraced former prime minister Joseph Muscat became prime minister.
 Through a number of direct orders, his private IT companies started to receive government contracts, particularly from the health ministry. At the same time, he was appointed to various boards, including Transport Malta.
 Soon after Robert Abela became prime minister, Castille selected Sammut to run PBS, even though he had never stepped inside a TV studio and had no experience in broadcasting.
 Meanwhile, the government significantly increased its subsidies to PBS, reaching some €6 million annually. Still, this was not enough.
 According to the latest published accounts for 2023, PBS declared a loss of some €40,000. The previous year, PBS recorded a loss of over €1.5 million.
 A financial controller recruited by Sammut to try to put things in order left after six months. Sammut promoted a DJ to act as a financial controller instead.
 According to employees, clashes between Sammut and senior staff members were the order of the day.
 One spiralled publicly. Sammut clashed with Norma Saliba, the head of news, and ordered her relocation outside the company. Saliba was given a new position with a financial package of over €73,000 annually at the Centre for the Maltese Language, which was essentially created for her.
 At the time, Robert Abela had sided with Sammut, dumping Saliba.
 PBS sources said Sammut’s end started during the electoral campaign for the MEP elections when several staunch labour employees began sending messages to the prime minister that they would not be voting, citing Sammut as the reason.
 Some even put their voting document on social media to drive the message home.
 The Office of the Prime Minister took the hint soon after Abela’s unexpected result at the polls.
 The Shift has been informed that Abela asked Culture Minister Owen Bonnici to find a new PBS CEO. Bonnici didn’t deliver.
 Last week, an OPM official contacted Sammut, telling him not to return to his office and that his contract would come to an abrupt end this month.
 Sammut received the OPM’s go-ahead to renew his contract for another three years as recently as last March.
 So far, it is not known whether Sammut will also be paid a golden handshake to leave without a new dispute.
 Minister Owen Bonnici confirmed that Sammut will no longer be at PBS and that a search for a new CEO is ongoing.
 In recent years, PBS has been reduced to a government propaganda station, with lucrative contracts paid to friendly producers and journalists.

 When reporting on the government’s new appointment of Joseph Cuschieri as the new CEO of Project Green, state broadcaster TVM omitted any details relating to the fact he was found guilty of breaching Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA) rules while leading it until 2020.
 Cuschieri was handed the new government role by Environment Minister Miriam Dalli. While PBS reported he was the previous CEO of the MFSA and the Malta Gaming Authority, they did not mention his forced resignation and the various scandals on his watch.
 The Shift was informed that instructions to omit this information were issued to the newsroom from the Office of the Prime Minister. The broadcaster stuck to the official government press release and put the story in the “other news” section of the site.
 Last December, The Shift revealed how Dalli, a close friend of Cuschieri, asked Abela to appoint him as CEO of Project Green as Steve Ellul was expected to resign to make way for his European elections bid on the Labour Party ticket.
 Initially, Abela resisted Dalli’s demands, arguing that Cuschieri was not an ideal candidate for the post due to his track record in regulatory roles and his association with Yorgen Fenech, the man accused of masterminding the assassination of Daphne Caruana Galizia.
 Abela reportedly changed his mind, fearing a backlash in the wake of support for disgraced former prime minister Joseph Muscat among Labour Party supporters.
 After several controversial years of leading the MGA and the MFSA with little respect for recruitment and  procurement rules, Cuschieri was forced to resign after he went on a trip to Las Vegas with Edwina Licari – one of his recruits at the MFSA – paid for by Yorgen Fenech.
 An independent inquiry by former Chief Justice Joe Azzopardi (now standards commissioner) and lawyer (now judge) Mark Simiana  found that Cuschieri breached a number of rules and ethics.
 Many stories on his conduct later came to light, including the tens of thousands of euros in sponsorships and self-promotion he dished out spent without authorisation and how he was asked to repay thousands in extra remuneration he self-authorised for attending board meetings, which he was not entitled to.
 Cuschieri was also found to have breached all rules in recruiting his friend Edwina Licari, putting her on a €120,000 permanent salary as a general consul while  touring the world with her on government business.
 Miriam Dalli’s special relationship with Cuschieri goes back many years when he gave her a job at communications company Vodafone (now Epic) when she was still a Labour TV reporter.
 Just a few months ago, Dalli also gave a job to Cuschieri’s 23-year-old daughter, Katrina as a consultant shortly after she graduated and returned to Malta from London.

         The 13th edition of the Valletta Baroque Festival has been launched and will be taking place between the 9th and 25th of January 2025, the Minister for National Heritage Owen Bonnici said on Thursday.
 Bonnici stated that the Valletta Baroque Festival is of great importance for the country, both because it helps to preserve and promote Maltese cultural and artistic heritage, as well as because it brings together artists of international calibre to exhibit their best talent in Malta. He continued that this festival gives new life to many historical Maltese sites, and creates an environment where music and architecture come together to offer a unique cultural experience for local and foreign audiences.   He added that through this festival, Festivals Malta is not only succeeding in the cultural field but also economically by attracting tourists to Malta in this season. He also thanked the workers of Festivals Malta for their commitment in the preparations for this edition of the festival.
  “The Valletta Baroque Festival is an important step for us to continue strengthening the international recognition of Malta as a destination of quality culture and art,” Bonnici commented.
 The Chairman of Festivals Malta, Aaron Zahra, said that Festivals Malta is fully committed to promoting the country’s cultural heritage while also providing a platform for local and international artists. He continued that the festival is a perfect example of this commitment, which he said allows the talent of the musicians to be shown along with the wonder places that are an integral part of Malta’s heritage.
 Festivals Malta CEO Frans Agius said that Festivals Malta is proud to see Maltese artists on the main stage of international festivals like the Valletta Baroque Festival. He said that this year, Maltese violinist Carmine Lauri will be at the festival together with the Malta Philharmonic Orchestra under the direction of Michael Laus. He added that there will be the participation of Charlie Siem, the Abos Project & Consort under the direction of Bruno Brocorpio. He said that there will also be the Valletta Baroque Ensemble under the direction of Steven Devine.
 The Ministry for National Heritage said that this year’s festival will have a spectacular range of presentations by distinguished artists and ensembles under the artistic direction of Kenneth Zammit Tabona, which it added will be taking place in some of Malta's most majestic venues. 
 Zammit Tabona said that the year 2025 marks the tricentenary of Alessandro Scarlatti's death and therefore the festival will open with his oratorio La Giuditta. He continued that the following day, audiences can enjoy Lachrimae Lyrae, presented by Sokratis Sinopoulos at the National Museum of Archaeology. The program also includes Thomas Dunford and Théotime Langlois de Swartese The Mad Lover and SIGNUM Saxophone Quartet who will present South American music with Bachianas. He added that there is also a vocal concert entitled My Voyage to Italy by Samuel Mariño with Concerto de' Cavalieri.
 The Ministry stated that through this festival, the audiences can enjoy a range of styles and musical groups such as Musica Antiqua Latina with Combattimento 400, and the works of Monteverdi performed by Voces Sauve. The Malta Philharmonic Orchestra will also present Bach Violin Concertos with internationally renowned soloists Charlie Siem and Carmine Lauri. A special concert in this edition will be celebrating William Christie's 80th birthday with Les Arts Florissants on January 24th, celebrating one of the most influential figures of the baroque music scene.
 Kenneth Zammit Tabona went on to explain that the festival will also host a performance by KorMalta of Missa Papae Marcelli of Palestrina in honour of the 500th anniversary of his death. Zammit Tabona said that children can enjoy the Sound Explorers concert on January 19th, which will introduce the next generation to the beauty of baroque music. 
 The Ministry said that the festival is organised by Festivals Malta in collaboration with Teatru Manoel and with support by Visit Malta, and will take place around several historical places, including the Co-Cathedral of St John, the Lapsi Church, and the Verdala Palace.

https://theshiftnews.com/2024/08/28/pl-presidency-alex-vs-norma-is-joseph-vs-robert/,"Another critical test challenging Prime Minister Robert Abela’s hold on the Labour Party is emerging through the latest contest surrounding the party’s presidency.
 While historically, the role does not carry the weight of its nomenclature, occupied by the likes of Manuel Cuschieri and Ramona Attard during the past few years, the ‘battle’ for Labour’s delegates is considered by party insiders as another test for Abela’s popularity and hold over its rank and file.
 According to PL sources, Alex Sciberras, a Labour militant who stopped his activism when disgraced former leader Joseph Muscat was forced to resign, is a proxy for Muscat’s faction.
 On the other hand, Norma Saliba, until a few months ago the Head of PBS News, is Prime Minister Robert Abela’s choice.
 Insiders said that while Abela wanted and found a candidate to deflate Sciberras’s challenge, it is very unclear who the winner will be. While Sciberras is considered “superior quality” to Saliba, the latter has the leader’s full backing and endorsement.
 The son of the late Judge Philip Sciberras, himself a former MP in the Mintoff era, Alex Sciberras started his activism at a young age, inside Labour’s youth movement and later as an elected Labour mayor of Msida.
 Once Labour swept to power in 2013, Sciberras made the most out of his relationship with the then-newly elected prime minister, raking in tens of thousands from many jobs handed to him by the Muscat administration.
 Considered one of Muscat’s kitchen cabinet members, Alex was closest to the disgraced former Chief of Staff Keith Schembri and former minister Konrad Mizzi.
 Alex Sciberras was singled out by the NAO for his go-between role in the controversial multi-million sale of the former ITS land in St Julian’s, playing a role which, according to the investigation, lacked transparency and accountability.
 His proximity to Muscat, Schembri and Mizzi catapulted him into many well-remunerated roles.
 Among the directorships handed to him were those on the boards of Air Malta, Enemed, Petromal, Malta Aviation Services Ltd., and One Productions—the company responsible for Labour’s TV station.
 He was also a full-time advisor to Muscat, with an office at Castille. Projects Malta, the government agency involved in all the shady deals conducted by the Muscat administration, gave him other paid briefs.
 Following Muscat’s political demise, Sciberras put his weight behind Chris Fearne, which led to his eventual sidelining by Robert Abela.
 Still, apart from starting a new role as a senior partner at LRS, a firm specialising in selling Maltese citizenship and residency, he was kept on the gravy train through consultancy roles at the Health, Agriculture and EU Funds Ministries.
 Norma Saliba is Abela’s candidate in the upcoming contest and is considered a much lighter weight than Sciberras.
 The daughter of another veteran Labour stalwart, Mario Saliba, a Labour councillor and long-time sports journalist, Saliba has always maintained close connections within the Party, even when she was Head of News of the supposedly impartial public broadcasting.
 Her former marriage to Manuel Micallef, a GWU man and, at the time, Labour TV’s Head of News, pushed her into closer proximity with Labour insiders. She then  propelled herself to Head of News at the state broadcaster on Robert Abela’s direct instructions.
 However, after falling out with PBS Chairman Mark Sammut, Abela dropped her as her open war with the state broadcaster’s chairman became public.
 A position was then created for by Culture Minister Owen Bonnici making her Head of the National Centre for the Maltese Language, an agency that was created to give her the role.
 As compensation for her ousting from her senior PBS position, Saliba was given a financial package of €73,000.
 At the same time, Saliba was kept on the books of the state broadcaster as a fallback position.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/maghtab-shooting-one-charged-damaging-property-threats-dangerous.1098677,"Updated 5pm
 A man was on Friday handed a suspended sentence after he rammed his car into a Magħtab residence gate on Wednesday.
 Michael Camilleri, 41, from Qormi was charged with wilful damage to third-party property, insults and threats beyond the limits of provocation, causing fear of violence, and negligent, reckless and dangerous driving. He was also charged with misuse of electronic equipment.
 Camilleri registered an admission to all the charges.
 The court warned him of the consequences of his guilty plea but the accused confirmed his admission.
 Prosecuting inspector Joseph Mallia told the court that police officers at the Naxxar police station were alerted to an incident on Triq St Klara on Wednesday evening.
 It transpired that the driver of a Mercedes car had rammed the vehicle into the gate of a farmhouse. Two shots rang out and the car backed away before more shots were fired.
 When asked by the court about the source of those shots, Mallia said that investigations were still ongoing but the shots ""were not fired by Camilleri"".
 Camilleri was arrested at 2am when he turned himself in at the Qormi police station. He cooperated all along, leading the police to the site at Baħar iċ-Ċagħaq where his black car was parked.
 The car bore visible gunshot damage: ""The front was riddled with gunshots,"" said the inspector.
 While Camilleri named two other people who were allegedly involved in the shooting, court was told investigations were still ongoing.
 Camilleri's arrest was not contested by his defence team, headed by lawyers Franco Debono and Jose' Herrera. 
 When making submissions on punishment, Herrera argued that although the incident appeared to be ""the greatest ever"" the charges were rather minimal and the damage was not excessive. 
 Debono stressed the importance of reform of the accused and restitution of damages. A suspended sentence would serve as deterrent too, he argued.
 Parte civile lawyer Magri pointed out that although the charges were minimal and the argument appeared to be a storm in a teacup, the incident was still fresh. A restraining order would be appropriate.
 After confirming his admission, the court condemned Camilleri to a one-year jail term suspended for three years, a €3,000 fine and a three-month driving ban.
 He was issued a restraining order not to approach the two men and three female relatives who were at the farmhouse at the time of the incident. He also had to reimburse €500 for the damage caused to their property.
 He was warned not to approach the alleged victims - two of whom, father and son - were also likely to face separate charges over the incident.
 Lawyers Jose Herrera, Franco Debono, Martina Herrera and Matthew Xuereb were defence counsel.
 Lawyers Arthur Azzopardi and Jacob Magri appeared parte civile.
 Inspector Joseph Mallia prosecuted.
 Magistrate Jean Paul Grech presided over the case.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/in-pictures-early-beach-fashions-malta.1096515,"I have been postponing, over and over again, my response to the request by a reader for pictorial spreads about beach fashions in early Malta because I believed it a difficult commitment to satisfy. 
 Differently from today, not a single one of the hundreds of pre-war postcards shows swimmers on beaches. Paying humble homage to Victorian prudery, card publishers banned that subject as entirely taboo, and public photographers too.
  Adults, especially women, in bathing costumes, may appear, but very exceptionally, in private family albums.
 One 1930s photograph, showing women in the most chaste of swimming gear, has a note handwritten on its back: “I don’t think this should be in the album.”
  Curiously, the only postcard I know of which shows a bathing scene was most likely meant as a morality warning. Published round 1905, it shows policemen arresting a boy swimming in the nude. Apart from that, absolutely nothing.
  Women in swimwear start appearing, timidly at first, aggressively later, with the explosion of the tourist boom that followed Independence. You can date post-war Maltese postcards rather accurately, by measuring how skimpy the bikinis are.
  In an island surrounded by vast expanses of sea and espoused to tropical heatwaves, one would assume sea bathing to have been ingrained in popular culture. 
  If it was, it left very faint records in history. Apart from Toni Bajjada, whose marathon swims during the 1565 Great Siege became the stuff of legend, almost no mention of sea leisure, games or sports appears anywhere in our annals before the 20th century. 
  Malta had to wait till 1928 to send its first water polo team to the Amsterdam Olympic Games which, coincidentally, featured my mother’s brother, Edoardo Magri, later judge.

 Soċjetà Filarmonika Santa Marija will now rent the property from the government without fear of eviction – something it and many other band clubs faced following court rulings about outdated pre-1995 rent laws.
 The government announced the €360,000 purchase in a statement on Saturday.
  Culture Minister Owen Bonnici said band clubs were hugely reliant on their premises, which served as community gathering spots and played essential roles in the organisation of village feasts.
 It is band club members who often drive community initiatives, Bonnici said.
 “It is crucial that we take proactive measures to protect band clubs,” the minister said.
 
 In total, the government is expected to spend €19 million to buy back all the band club properties that are privately owned.
 Other band clubs that have had their property purchased by the government are:
 In a separate statement, the Lands Ministry said that it has secured an arrangement for a Sliema-based band club to keep its leased premises for an additional 50 years.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/a-year-hope-10th-edition-caritas-christmas-day-lunch-launched.1102206,"Sylvia Pace has seen an increase in lonely people attending the annual Christmas Day lunch organised by Caritas for those in need - where she has been volunteering for nine years. 
 “Nine years ago, when I first volunteered, most people who attended could not afford food. But things have changed. Now there are more and more people who come because they are lonely,” said Sylvia who will be helping out again during the 10th edition of the meal which will be held at the Archbishop's Curia.
 “The first time I volunteered I wanted to see what it was all about and help. But now it would not be Christmas without it.  The atmosphere is lovely. It’s genuine Christmas joy,” she said.
  Francesca Abela has been helping ever since the first edition. “Helping and giving, especially at this time of year, is so rewarding,” she said as she encouraged people who will be alone on Christmas day to reach out and attend.
 Last year about 500 people turned up for the lunch – during which the large corridors of the Curia were transformed into a massive dining hall.
  Josef Pace, the psycho-social services coordinator at Caritas, said this year there would also be a Caritas representative on each table to take the contact details of anyone vulnerable who wants to be followed up during the year.
 “This is the year of hope,” he said.
 Caritas director Anthony Gatt said there were many people who were suffering from loneliness. A 2022 survey carried out by the Faculty of Social Wellbeing showed that loneliness remained a major social issue in the community,  with 55 per cent of Maltese saying they feel alone.
 “One woman who attended the lunch last year told me: ‘Eating a piece of bread with you is better than eating a turkey alone’. A former inmate who volunteered to help also told me he was touched to be told ‘thank you’ when he was serving food to people,” he said.
 He added that, when it came to volunteers, the lunch was oversubscribed. “Some of our volunteers came as guests in previous years and then returned as volunteers,” he said.
 The food will again be provided by The Alfred Mizzi Foundation and cooked and served by an army of volunteers, including chefs from the President's palace. Also involved will be the St Peter’s Foundation.
 Episcopal Vicar Martin Micallef said the Christmas Day lunch was “a tangible expression of love”. “It is a message that the Church welcomes everyone and has place for everyone.”

https://timesofmalta.com/article/stop-commercialising-freshers-week-organisations-urge-ksu.1098784,"For the third consecutive year, the organisers of Freshers' Week have come under fire for 'commercialising' campus activities that are meant to help new students familiarise themselves with the University of Malta.
 Moviment Graffitti, Pulse and S-Cubed slammed  Kunsill Studenti Universitarji (KSU) on Monday for choosing to ""serve the interests of private companies whose only purpose is profit"" instead of celebrating the work of students.
 In a statement, the three said the KSU Freshers’ Week should be a week during which new university students have the opportunity to meet other students,  speak to different organisations, meet fellow student activists and familiarise themselves with the university. 
 ""Instead, this week is going to be taken over completely by the many companies that sponsor KSU and which will occupy the central spaces at the university.""
 The central quadrangle in front of the Students’ House, Parking Number Four and the space leading to the Gateway Building are going to be dominated by private companies and commercial enterprises that have nothing to do with university students’ educational experience, they added.
 This year, organisations have once again been relegated to a restricted space in front of the main university library where there will be a lot of crowds and it will be hot. The three added that, as in previous years, the loud music will be a nuisance to students working in the library or attending lectures in the vicinity of these spaces.
 Studenti Graffitti has been calling for a change in the way Freshers’ Week is organised since 2022.
 ""We would like student organisations and academics to be at the core of this week’s activities, where they will occupy the majority of spaces with activities for students and academics within the University of Malta.
 ""Despite these calls, KSU did nothing. Therefore, we are joining two other organisations, Pulse and S-Cubed, to get our message across: We believe that activities organised by students should be at the centre of this special week.""
 They added that KSU should be financially assisted by the University of Malta itself.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/more-streets-named-priests-women.1092700,"There are more streets named after priests, friars, bishops, popes and other clergymen than there are named after women, a new study has found.
 The stark gender imbalance stretches all the way to the heavens, because male saints also largely outnumber female saints on the plaques of Malta’s 7,500 streets.
 There is some solace for women, however, as the saint with the most streets named after them is a woman – the Virgin Mary.
 This is part of what has been keeping Dr Yanika Borg very busy over the past few months.
  Through geospatial analysis, web scraping and data analysis, the 34-year-old Maltese data analytics expert based in the UK found there are over 7,500 streets in Malta with more than 6,500 different street names, and that over 3,000 of them are named after someone.
 She then pieced the data together from information gathered from the University of Malta library, Times of Malta and from the internet to uncover the patterns behind those plaque names.
 In the study, titled What’s in a name? A brief look at gender diversity in the street names of Malta, Borg highlights a stark gender imbalance.
 Of all the streets named after people, only 12 per cent are named after women.
 “More are named for male clergy (popes, archpriests, bishops but mostly priests ‒ ‘Dun’) than for women,” she said.
 There are a few women who have been notably celebrated in street names, such as in Vittoriosa, where there is a famous street named after soprano Hilda Tabone, who sang opera in Malta and in Paris in the 1960s, and a street in Sliema named after Russian princess and ballerina Nathalie Poutiatin Tabone, who found shelter in Malta after fleeing the uprising of the Bolsheviks in the late 1910s.
 But far more men are acknowledged and commemorated in street names.
  Moreover, more than a quarter (28%) of Maltese streets named after people are named after saints, Borg found. And again, male saints “still take the centre stage here”.
 It is a female saint, however, that appears on most plaques. Through her various religious titles – such as Santa Marija, l-Assunta, il-Bambina and il- Vitorja – the Madonna has the most streets named after her.
 “St Catherine follows at a very distant second (she is the second most popular lady saint, 12th most popular overall),” Borg said in her study.
 “St Paul is the most popular male saint, but even he doesn’t hold a candle to the Madonna’s mighty presence.”
 After the Virgin Mary, St Paul has the second highest number of streets named after him, followed by St Joseph and St John.
 “Jesus places in a distant 10th position,” Borg found.
  The study also found only seven per cent of streets are named after politicians.
 “Here, once again, it’s a whirlwind of men, with the few Maltese women involved in politics who are commemorated via street names being Agatha Barbara (first woman president), Evelyn Bonaci (a member of parliament in the 1960s and 1970s), Maggie Moran (president of the women’s group in the Labour Party) and Mabel Strickland (a member of parliament in the 1950s and 1960s and a founder of The Times of Malta).”
 Other women do feature in a handful of streets, the study found, but only by virtue of being related to a male politician. Among them, Dom Mintoff’s mother and wife – Ċetta Mintoff and Moyra Mintoff.
 “I find it uncomfortable that these women are being defined by their relation to a man, but in my research I wasn’t able to find anything else about them,” Borg noted.
  The study also found there are more streets named after painters, sculptors, actors, playwrights, poets, musicians, band conductors and statue-makers than there are streets named after politicians.
 Again, women barely feature here.
 “They make up less than 10 per cent of streets named after cultural figures.”
 Borg has a PhD in synthetic biology from University College London and was part of a team of women who sailed across the Atlantic Ocean in 2019 with the international, not-for-profit organisation eXXpedition to gather data on microplastics in the ocean.
 The details about the study on street names, as well as the raw data, can be found on her newly-launched website thedataknitters.com where she colourfully – and often comically – illustrates her findings cleverly, concisely and simply through pictures, maps, tables and graphs.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/pope-francis-responds-concerns-raised-maltese-parents-trans-doctrine.1091849,"Pope Francis has responded to concerns raised by a Maltese LGBTIQ parents' group over fears that a new Vatican document could be interpreted as condemnation of transgender people. 
 In early April, the Vatican released a document titled Dignita Infinita, which outlines contemporary threats to human dignity, including war, digital violence, gender theory and sex changes, amongst other topics. 
 Drachma - a Maltese group for parents of LGBTIQ people, felt the need to write to the Pope about this document as they feared it could further sour the relationship of queer Catholics to the Church. 
 Pope Francis, they said, has responded to their concerns with an ”open heart”.
 Even though the document maintained the Church’s long-standing position on gender theory and gender affirming surgery, Drachma, felt they had to push back against this position. 
 Drachma is an organization that provides a space for anyone who believes in God and is seeking sexual and spiritual integration within their life.
 Louise Grech, the coordinator of Drachma Parents said, “There were lots of good points in the Digita Infinita, but the message relating to trans people was abrasive and merited a response.”
 That is why, on April 23, the organisation sent a letter to Pope Francis outlining their concerns.
 “Almost immediately after we sent the letter, we received a response in which he said he received our message with an open heart and encouraged us to continue our work,” said Grech.
  The organisation fears that outlining gender theory and affirming care as a 'threat to human dignity' could further isolate Catholic trans people and their families from each other, their communities and their faith. 
 “We are already seeing Trans people being kicked out of their homes and an increase in suicidal ideation,” said Grech.
 Such drastic reactions often result from the parents of trans children feeling wary of society’s reaction to their children’s gender identity or because of their religious beliefs pushing them into a dangerous dogmatic direction, she said. 
 Grech also noted that it was clear to her that there was no consultation with the community or experts.
 “This needs to be collaborative, and the Church needs to be on board. We need them to listen, to learn, and to understand.”
 Nonetheless, the organisation maintained that they believe Pope Francis has helped change the culture positively.
 They outlined instances where the Pope met with trans women and when he met with Sister Jeannine Gramick, a nun who was shunned for working tirelessly with the LGBTIQ community.
 Grech hopes there will be more space for communication and collaboration on these matters in the future and maintains that her organisation will continue to move forward in a positive direction.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/in-pictures-women-toiling-early-malta.1098340,"I only realised how under-represented women remained in early Malta photography when I went through my accumulations to select illustrations for these features. In album after bulging album, I found hardy any images of women at work (a working woman was not a mara tax-xogħol). With perseverance, I eked out enough photos for what, I trust, has turned into an enlightening project.
  At a time when society assigned sharply distinct roles to men and women, not surprisingly women mostly figure in traditionally feminine ‘domestic’ functions, like parenting, nursing, spinning and weaving, lace-making, tailoring, cooking, washing and ironing.
  In agriculture, the heavier tasks, like ploughing, reaping, threshing, watering, transport, fell on men while women appear mostly engaged in marketing agricultural produce. Not to mention construction, metal work, carpentry, whitewashing, husbandry. Never a woman worker in sight.
  The only exception in the building trade were the ballata, those women who laid and battened waterproof roofing made of powdered terracotta (pozzolana). I do not have photos of these.
  One trend, very prominent and consistent in early image-making shows that women did not carry heavy loads in their hands or on their shoulders but precariously balanced on their heads, the African way. These counterpoising feats, so universal up to the war years, now belong to the past.
  Also noticeable, the almost total absence of obesity in mature women, who never left the house with heads uncovered.
  Relatively few early commercial photographers showed interest in women at work. Horatio Agius from Cottonera (1844-1910), could be an exception. In the late 19th century, he marketed a popular series of Maltese figurines, which included several women displaying their work attributes. Besides him, little else.
  I may follow this up with another feature about women in less fatiguing pursuits.

  Café Premier, the reincarnation of the historical Café de la Reine, catered mostly for passing trade but also for music lovers; and for chess devotees, morphing into their informal national club.
 Mutumallu, in Du Balli, open 24/7, became the haven for insomniacs.
  Gambrinus, Museum and the Central thrived almost exclusively on lawyers and their clients from the courts nearby.
 What united them?
 They all served pastizzi and  qassatat.
  Relatively few restaurants in Valletta then – the British, and, to buttress imperial loyalty, the Britannia, the Osborne, Frascati, Malata for ravioli, Dimitri’s, Alexandra’s, Bologna, Cadena and the fish and chips eateries in the Gut, mostly forgettable.
  ‘Puliti’ boozers rooted for Captain Caruana, Eddie’s, Charles Grech, Tikka, Ellul’s and, later, The Pub. To the Lantern gravitated tipplers and gays alike.
 Some of these Valletta protein and carbohydrate dispensers promoted business through publicity postcards.
 I am homing in on a few of the later ones, mostly from the 1970s to the 1990s, by specialised publishers like David Moore, Vulcan, Penprint, Sinet, Promotion Services and Artex.
 Mainstream producers, like Cathedral Library, Perfecta, ABC Library and Alfred Galea Zammit also reserved niches for business postcards.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/only-one-child-showed-daughter-party.1091628,"A mother has described her heartbreak after only one child turned up to her then seven-year-old daughter’s holy communion party.
 Eliza Demanuele, now 12, was looking forward to celebrating the next religious milestone with friends.
 Her mother, Marthese Camilleri, had invited all her classmates and ordered in food for the event.
 But in the end, only one child turned up, Eliza’s best friend.
 “I felt sad for Eliza, and she even saw me cry one time,” her mother said.
 “But I was still happy she had her best friend there”.
 Eliza has been diagnosed with non-speaking autism, which means she has difficulty with speech.
  The neurodevelopmental disorder means she also has challenges with socialising and is often left out of invitations to others’ parties.
 But Marthese says her daughter goes through life with a big smile and is described as the “sunshine” in their household.
 Recently she started music therapy and has begun humming along to the songs she likes.
 She is on the waiting list for Villa Bianca, the Malta Trust Foundation’s provider of music therapy for children who have little access to such artistic experiences.
 As she approaches her teenage years, her mother said she is determined that her daughter won’t spend her teen years without friends.
 She hopes that in the future, she will be able to access a device to help her communicate.
 “I wish to someday have a conversation with my daughter,” she said.
 
 With the Malta Trust Foundation, set up by former president Marie-Louise Coleiro Preca, Eliza is learning how to socialise and create friendships.
 The foundation seeks to support vulnerable communities through initiatives that are both educational and empowering.
 From noon to midnight on Saturday, The Malta Trust Foundation will be holding a televised marathon. Donations can also be made via the BOV mobile app on 79520040 or a cheque can be sent to The Malta Trust Foundation.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/second-phase-cottonera-lines-bastion-restoration-kicks-off.1096863,"A second phase of work to restore the St Nicholas bastions forming part of the Cottonera Lines has kicked off, with work expected to take until the end of the year.
 An initial phase of this restoration project saw workers restore the Polverista gate section of the bastions, which joins Cospicua and Fgura.
 Stonework in that section was in a bad state of disrepair and parts of it had to be rebuilt from scratch, the Culture Ministry said in a statement on Saturday.
 The Cottonera Lines date back to the period of the Knights of St John. They were designed by Antonio Maurizio Valperga.
  Workers are now cleaning the stone of dirt and dust and replacing any stonework that has lost its shape or structural integrity over time. Windows on the bastions are to get new galvanised steel protectors, to prevent pigeons from roosting in them.
 Works are being carried out by the Restoration and Preservation Department.
 Culture Minister Owen Bonnici and Local Councils parliamentary Secretary Alison Zerafa Civelli – a former mayor of Cospicua – visited the site this week. They were accompanied by Cospicua Mayor Marco Bonnici and Fondazzjoni Kottonera chairman Joe Mizzi.
 Bonnici said the second phase of works is expected to cost €650,000 and once completed will mean more than 4,500 square metres of bastions will have been restored.
 “The Cottonera lines are an important part of our national identity and restorng them not only improves the area’s historic value but also benefits future generations,” he said.
 He thanks Restoration Department workers for their contribution.
 Zerafa Civelli praised Cospicua’s local council for having pushed for the project to be carried out.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/lawyers-urge-identita-halt-policy-change-harming-tcns.1097009,"A group of immigration lawyers have flagged a change in policy and an ""alarming situation"" unfolding at Identità that they say is causing unnecessary hardship for third-country nationals seeking to work in Malta.
 The sudden change in policy undermines the integrity of Malta's migration process, they are claiming, urging Identità to recognise challenges faced by TCNs in meeting a 180-day deadline to get a visa.
 As things stand, TCNs are allowed to apply for work permits while residing outside of Malta. Upon the approval of their application, they receive what is known as an Approval in Principle letter, which grants them 180 days to present themselves before Identità in Malta.
 
 However, lawyers note that over the past years, this 180-day period has proven to be an unrealistic deadline for many applicants abroad, primarily due to the extended processing times of visa applications in their countries of residence.
 This creates a troubling scenario where once individuals finally receive their visa to enter Malta, their 'approval in principle' letter would have expired.
 Until recently, this situation was managed with a degree of understanding, with people who obtained a visa being allowed to enter Malta and proceed to Identità to finalise their work permit application, even if the letter has expired.
 However, a group of concerned lawyers and legal procurators on Wednesday said that over the past few days, people presenting themselves at Identità with a valid visa but an expired letter were told their visas were being revoked.
 For these lawyers, this is a ""drastic and troubling change"" that has caused significant distress and confusion.
 They believe the change in policy reflects a lack of compassion and common sense in addressing what is already a challenging and bureaucratically burdened process.
 ""These people have often waited for months to secure their visas and travel to Malta, only to be met with further unexpected and unnecessary obstacles upon arrival.
 ""The latest adopted position demonstrates an alarming disregard for the challenges these individuals face, many of whom have sacrificed much to come to Malta in search of work and a better life,"" they said, warning this change in policy also undermined the trust people placed in Maltese institutions.
 They categorically condemned ""the practice of bringing third-country nationals to Malta under false pretences or any form of exploitation"".
 They said such actions not only betrayed the trust of those who sought a better life but also tarnished Malta's reputation as a fair and just society.
 It was essential that the migration process remained transparent, humane, and free from abuse, they added.
 ""We are deeply concerned by these recent developments and call for an immediate review and remedy to this situation. It is imperative that Identità adopts a more compassionate and logical approach, recognising the practical challenges faced by TCNs in meeting the 180-day deadline due to visa processing delays.
 
 ""We demand that Identità halts this arbitrary revocation of visas in cases where the 'approval in principle' letter has expired due to circumstances beyond the applicants' control and are merely trying to comply with the process as best they can under the circumstances.""
 They urged for a more reasonable and humane solution that acknowledged the reality of visa processing timelines and respected the basic rights of those affected.
 ""We appeal to the relevant authorities to intervene and ensure that this shift in policy is promptly addressed. The current approach is unsustainable and runs counter to the principles of fairness and justice that should underpin our immigration system.""
 The lawyers and legal procurators are Jenilee Agius, Paul Borg Olivier, Joseph Calleja Parnis, Edward Camilleri, Katrine Camilleri, Michael Camilleri, Gianluca Cappitta, Veronique Caruana, Jeanise Dalli, Martin Farrugia, Robert Galea, Jason Grima, Tiziana Micallef, Ibtisam Sadegh, Adrian Sciberras, Mark Sultana, David Zammit and Peter Paul Zammit.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/young-athlete-jake-vella-dies-aged-15.1097257,"Updated 6.30pm
 Inspirational teenage athlete Jake Vella, who suffered from a rare condition, died on Friday, aged 15.
 For most of his life, Jake had been fighting an extremely rare condition that caused him to gain weight rapidly despite eating healthy and training continuously.
 His condition took a turn for the worse over the past few days and he died at Mater Dei Hospital, where he had recently been living and receiving treatment.
 His parents Josie and Maruska thanked their family, friends and medical staff, doctors and all nurses who were part of Jake's difficult journey, most especially the Disneyland ward, which was Jake's home for the last 22 months and the ITU ward, where Jake fought his last battles.
 ""Lastly, we would like to thank the public for the constant support that they have shown us. 
 ""Jake has taught us what life is all about, and he will forever live in the hearts of many. We have no words for the bravery he has shown throughout these years,"" they said.
 Inclusion Minister Julia Farrugia Portelli announced his death on Friday morning and paid tribute to Vella's aspirational attitude towards life. 
  ""We lost a boy who inspired a lot of people. You will remain in our hearts always,"" she said. 
 Vella became a beloved, renowned face when he went public with his condition and began documenting his constant fight with the disease while remaining positive and full of energy and determination.
 His neurological condition, known as Rapid-onset Obesity with Hypothalamic Dysfunction, Hypoventilation, and Autonomic Dysregulation (ROHHAD), affects mostly children and there are only around 100 confirmed cases of it worldwide.
 The exact cause of ROHHAD remains unknown and research on it is inconclusive.
  It could be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, but no specific gene has been definitively linked to the condition yet.
 Although immensely painful and uncomfortable, the condition did not dampen the young man’s spirits.
 Vella not only soldiered on but also turned into a philanthropist, organising swimming challenges and sports events with other athletes to raise funds and awareness for  abandoned animals and other causes.
 He worked especially closely with the wife of the Prime Minister, Lydia Abela. The two ran a Christmas campaign, called  Rigal bi mħabba b'differenza, urging hospital visitors to donate foodstuffs for abandoned animals.
  
 Vella had also started to learn boxing and playing the drums, guitar and the piano.
 His relentless efforts won him awards for being an  inspirational athlete and  animal rights activist, and last May he broke the national record for youngest person to swim 100 kilometres in a pool.
 His last public appearance was earlier this month during a live telethon that was raising funds for Inspire. Vella joined via video call from the hospital to urge people to donate funds for the organisation which helps people with disability.
 In a clip aired during that telethon, his parents, Josie and Maruska said there were no signs of the condition when he was born. He was cheerful and went to school normally.
 “Then all of a sudden he began to gain weight rapidly,” Maruska, said. “When he was just four or five, in a few months he went from weighing 17 kilograms to 27 kilograms, and multiple tests and MRIs would not explain what was going on.”
  Eventually, they were told he was diagnosed with ROHHAD, following which he spent years trying everything he could to lose weight, all the while struggling with the symptoms.
 The situation took a turn for the worse two years ago when Maruska was diagnosed with cancer.
 “There was a period when I was afraid I was going to lose them both,” Josie said.
  News of Vella’s death triggered an outpouring of grief and tributes to the teen and his inspiring outlook on life. 
 Both Prime Minister Robert Abela and his wife Lydia expressed sadness at the loss. 
 “Jake left an impact on many people. He always thought about others more than he sought out help for himself,” Robert said in a Facebook post. 
 “The dreams that he had and shared with Lydia, Giorgia and many other families led to beautiful initiatives and for this, we thank him from the bottom of our hearts.""
  Lydia meanwhile recalled how Jake never pitied himself despite the huge challenges he faced.
 Instead, he strived to improve the situation of others, including the voiceless, such as animals, she added.
 European Parliament President Roberta Metsola referred to Jake as a hero who inspired whole generations.
 ""Thank you, Jake. Despite the challenges you faced, you never gave up.
 ""As I told you the last time we met, Malta and Gozo are proud of your legacy.""
  Paying tribute, Opposition leader Bernard Grech said the teenager will be remembered for his bravery courage and beautiful laugh.
 ""Despite the several obstacles and challenges, you never gave up and always made sure to help others.
 ""Your love for swimming and sport inspired many. The whole country admired you and followed your accomplishments with love.""

https://timesofmalta.com/article/defence-observation-posts-wartime-aerodromes-airstrips.1096408,"Not much has been written about the defence and observation posts which were constructed or converted from farmhouses at the perimeter of the former wartime aerodromes and airstrips in Malta. The article by David Spiteri Staines on the Malta FlyPast Issue 6 gave me an impetus to start researching this particular topic.
 A document at the archives of the public works department sheds some light on the acquisition of land needed for the construction of defence posts at the Luqa airfield in 1941.
 A letter by the War Department (WD) sent to the Department of the Public Works (DPW) in April 1941 says that the former requested permission to construct two defence posts along Ta’ San Tumas Road, Luqa, in the vicinity of the Civil Government Division. The first defence post, which measured 15x20 feet, was to be located on a plot of wasteland along the road. The WD asked for permission to be granted encroachment terms on this post.
  The second post, which was still not constructed, was to be in a field. There was no objection to transfer the land − which was civil government property and formed part of lands adjoining the Luqa reservoir − to the WD. However, it seems a problem was encountered regarding this proposed post. Correspondence about it was still being exchanged in 1942.
  By 1942, there were five aerodromes and airstrips in Malta, which were at Ħal Far, Ta’ Qali, Luqa, Qrendi and Safi. The perimeter defence of an aerodrome was under the responsibility of the aerodrome station command. An army officer, known as the station defence officer, was appointed to each aerodrome as the station commander’s military adviser.
 The brigade commander, in whose section the aerodrome was situated, was responsible for coordinating the defence of the aerodrome with the aerodrome station command, station defence officer, command mobile forces and command supporting arms.
  The perimeter defence consisted at least of one infantry company and RAF personnel as detailed by RAF. Each aerodrome had an infantry battalion whose primary role was mobile defence of that aerodrome. One company of this battalion was located for immediate counter-attack purposes. The command mobile forces allotted to an aerodrome were responsible for taking action to prevent the enemy from capturing the aerodrome should they see that the perimeter defence could no longer deal with the situation.
 The aerodromes of Ħal Far, Ta’ Qali and Luqa were run by a battalion company each from the Devon Regiment, Manchester Regiment and the Royal West Kent Regiment.
  The best lines of approach onto the aerodrome for mobile troops in counter-attack role were to be carefully investigated and coordinated by brigade commands to ensure rapid action in emergency situations. Personnel of the perimeter defence also had to be aware of lines selected, so as to avoid any possibility of their fire being misdirected during action by mobile forces.
 In 1942, two 18-pounders manned by gunners of the 13th Battery, Royal Malta Artillery (RMA) covered Ħal Far; at Ta’ Qali were two 18-pounders by the 48/71 Battery, Royal Artillery (RA) and Safi had two 18-pounders manned by the 13th Battery, RMA. No mention of any field artillery defence of Luqa and Qrendi was made.
  The aerodromes were also defended by heavy anti-aircraft barrages and light anti-aircraft guns. Light machine gun protection against low-flying attacks was to be provided by troops allotted to the perimeter defence, augmented by brigades when the situation required.
 On the other hand, if it was not possible to use the Safi and Qrendi airstrips, the sunken mines already laid were to be detonated and so the strips would be rendered useless. The last action to be conducted in the defence of the aerodromes was to obstruct them by surface mines and tubular scaffolding.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/migrants-share-trials-triumphs-life-malta-archbishop.1092253,"Working migrants shared the highs and lows of their life in Malta with Archbishop Charles Scicluna last month, in an event commemorating the feast of St Joseph the Worker. 
 The group of people, who hail from sub-Saharan and West Africa and South and Southeast Asia, shared their stories with the Archbishop in an event organised by the Church’s Migrants Commission and Justice and Peace Commission. 
 In a statement, the Curia said that during the event, migrants said that while Malta has become their home, where they feel safe and are able to form meaningful relationships, they also face abuse and exploitation at work and struggle with xenophobia and bureaucratic delays. 
 “Those present reported experiences of deep suffering when facing asylum procedures, or when attempting to obtain or renew the single work permit. One issue that deeply impacted all workers’ quality of life - of whatever nationality - was the exorbitant increase in housing costs witnessed over the last few years,” the statement said. 
 The participants also talked about wanting to find more stability and security for their children born in Malta as, despite living and working in the country for many years, they still lack proper and secure documentation and live in constant fear of being deported.
 The group discussed the need for there to be more transparency on pathways to long-term residency and citizenship. 
 Sciculuna said that the experience underscored the importance of honouring human dignity in all spheres of life.
 “We need to listen to one another and we need to be able to give hope to each and every one of us,” he said.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/malta-chamber-slams-decision-pardon-benefit-fraudsters.1091636,"The presidential pardon granted to social benefit fraudsters further reinforces a culture of impunity and has also undermined Malta’s new president, the Malta Chamber said on Saturday.
 “Government needs to be on the side of what is right and send clear signals that it will not come to the rescue of abusers or restrain those who want to set things straight,” the Chamber said.
 “This is what good governance is about. Anything short of this will come across as pandering to the masses and playing for time, which is running out.”
 The Chamber’s statement comes two days after Times of Malta revealed that hundreds of people who have admitted to claiming severe disability benefits they were not entitled to will receive a presidential pardon.
 The decision prompted outrage among some quarters, with some criticising President Myriam Spiteri Debono for it. In reality, despite its name, a presidential pardon is recommended by the prime minister, with the president formally signing it.  
 Speaking on Friday, the prime minister defended the decision to issue the pardons by saying many of the fraudsters did not know they were breaking the law and had gone through “trauma” when they found out.
  The fraud is believed to have lasted years and cost taxpayers upwards of €5 million. Beneficiaries have told police that they were helped to register for the benefits by Labour Party officials, including former MP Silvio Grixti and ministerial driver Roger Agius.
 Agius’ lawyer has claimed in court that a top official at Michael Falzon’s social policy ministry, Mark Calleja, played a key role in the fraud.
 Falzon has insisted he knew nothing about the scheme but stopped short of defending Calleja.
 In its statement on Saturday, the Chamber expressed incredulity that the scheme could operate for years “without anyone batting an eyelid”.
 That, it said, “indicates that there is no accountability, as well as  no internal auditing systems to detect and deter abuse, and that people are either actively involved in fraudulent activities and profiting from them, or they have grown accustomed to seeing them occur.
 “Like the three monkeys, they see no evil, hear no evil, and say nothing about it,” the Chamber said.  
 The integrity of everyone involved in the payments – including Falzon’s ministry – has been put into “considerable question”, it said.
 The Chamber fears many of the fraudsters given a presidential pardon are now being lined up for jobs in the public sector.
 Bearing in mind that the public service is the largest employer, one hopes that this urgency to cleanse the conduct of people who abused from social benefits is not intended to facilitate a quick transition from dependency on benefits to recruitment with the public service, whether directly or through agencies,” it said.
 
 It also expressed concern about the growing habit of turning top jobs at government authorities and agencies into a game of musical chairs, with occupants moving from one entity to the other after a few months.
 “The practice of leveraging resignations to give the impression that action is being done, discourages capable people from taking on these crucial roles and executing the significant reforms required to shift course,” it said, noting that people who only occupy these key roles for a few months do not have enough time to take charge and identify systematic abusive practices.

 A well-known Tunisian social media influencer died in Malta on Monday morning of a suspected heart attack.
 Sources told Times of Malta that Farah El Kadhi died at Mater Dei Hospital. 
 Details are still scant but sources said the 36-year-old architect was rushed to hospital suffering from a cardiac arrest at around 6.30am. 
  She was in Malta on holiday, while also promoting a series of companies and services through Instagram posts.  
 Her profile featured posts of her in St Julian's and aboard a boat docked at the Vittoriosa marina, among others. 
 Farah had no signs of any visible injuries though sources said an autopsy will be carried out and a magisterial inquiry has been opened to establish the exact cause of death.
 Tunisian influencer Soulayma Hneynia, who resides in Malta and took part in the first season of Love Island Malta described Farah as a ""truly wonderful person, known for her kindness, generosity, and warmth.""
 ""Her positive spirit touched everyone who had the privilege of knowing her.""
 In another story, she said El Kadhi died 'peacefully in her sleep' following a heart attack.
 
 According to El Kadhi's Instagram, she was an architect with Key Concept company.
 Known as one of Tunisia's most popular social media influencers, Farah had more than one million followers on Instagram. She used her following to promote her fashion brand bazarbyfaf and various other brands that paid to feature on her profile.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/ambulance-valletta-kept-waiting-tables-chairs-obstruct-path.1097094,"Another ambulance was delayed in attending to a patient by tables and chairs obstructing its route in Valletta, witnesses said on Thursday. 
 The incident occurred at around 1.15pm in St Lucia Street, just past the law courts and parallel to St John's Co-Cathedral in Valletta, where several wine bars and eateries are known to have outdoor furniture installed. 
 A picture snapped by a passer-by shows the ambulance waiting to squeeze past the tables, chairs and umbrellas that littered the street, as staff tried to usher their patrons and allow the vehicle to pass unobstructed. 
 The issue was flagged by PN deputy whip Paula Mifsud Bonnici. 
 ""Despite all of this government's promises, the security and safety of people, especially Valletta residents, are not a priority,"" she said. 
 One woman who was in the area at the time told Times of Malta that the ambulance was on its way to a patient and that she felt compelled to help clear the street furniture away.
 ""Unfortunately, in case of an emergency, an ambulance or fire engine is absolutely impossible to pass through,"" she said. 
 ""I was helping myself to move the tables, chairs, umbrellas and large coffee cups out of the way. Then once the ambulance managed to pass through St Lucia and collected the patient I guided the driver to pass back from the same street."" 
 This is at least the second time this year that an emergency vehicle has been documented encountering difficulty while navigating through Valletta's table and chair-congested streets. 
 Back in March, local residents group Residenti Beltin published footage of an ambulance struggling to squeeze through a throng of outdoor catering furniture in Republic Street, reigniting a heated ongoing debate about the take up of public spaces by businesses. 
 Last year, the University of Malta, which has a second campus in Valletta, was pushed to file a judicial protest against the local council, as it said the situation of tables and chairs outside its own front door had descended into ""chaos"". 
 In 2023, Valletta's traditional Holy Week activities were marred as faithful participants had to wade through tables and chairs and contend with loud music being played during the solemn Good Friday procession. 
 Residents took to the streets to protest the saturation of tables and chairs in their locality, while in Mellieħa, demonstrators  occupied the furniture put out by a db group-run establishment in the village square, despite having no permit to do so at the time. 
 In Victoria, Gozo, a similar situation unravelled earlier this year in St George's Square, where NGOs gathered to protest the takeover of the square's limited space by cafes and restaurants. 
 This came after the Archpriest of St Geroge's Basilica went public with his grievances with the square's ""landgrabbers"" whom he said refused to compromise while rubbishing authorities' claims that they had no remit to intervene.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/teatru-malta-announces-malta-first-fulltime-theatre-troupe.1093024,"Teatru Malta, the national theatre company has issued a call for auditions for four performers to join its theatre troupe. They will be able to work a 40-hour week.
 The troupe is designed to blend performance with behind-the-scenes roles to create a team that can perform on-stage as well as operational tasks, but its primary role will be creative.
 Teatru Malta artistic director Sean Buhagiar said: “The idea came from observing the versatility and adaptability of local artists who also perform and manage various logistical tasks or have other jobs in the creative or non-creative sphere, which they still enjoy and help them to make a living.”
 Teatru Malta was inspired by the concept of the circus to structure the troupe’s roles and tasks. The performers would be on stage but also help with other tasks behind the stage. Buhagiar said the troupe could expect to perform roles such as acting, directing, dramaturgy, content creation, project management, dancing, writing, translating, proofreading, web management, social media management, or videography.
  “We want the opportunity to be flexible to produce an avant-garde classical piece with only some members of this ensemble, to produce a festival, translate scripts, create shows for or with the communities and more,” said Buhagiar.
 The performers must have significant experience in theatrical quality-led performances and possess all-round performance skills, including acting, dancing and singing. They must be 18 years or older, and proficient in Maltese and English.
 The system of full-time ensemble actors is routine practice throughout theatres in Europe. In fact, ŻfinMalta has had a full-time dancer company since its formation. Theatre practitioners who spoke to Times of Malta praised  Teatru Malta’s efforts for the initiative, with many saying it was about time.
 The initial contract will be for 12 months, starting in September but, beforehand, there will be an initial research and development phase throughout the summer. Buhagiar also said the potential exists for a medium- to long-term relationship after that. Those engaged will have a 40-hour flexible working week and remote working. The annual salary is €25,000 excluding VAT.
 The application closing date is June 17.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/historic-birkirkara-mill-turns-300.1094077,"The historic building in Birkirkara known as Il-Mitħna tal-Maħlut, now the Mill – Art, Culture and Crafts Centre, is celebrating its 300th anniversary since it was built in 1724.
 Built under Grandmaster Manoel de Vilhena, the windmill was used to produce flour to help feed the growing population at the time. The grandmaster had set up Fondazione Vilhena, through which five windmills were built in Birkirkara, Żejtun, Żurrieq, Naxxar and Rabat.
  By 1929, the Birkirkara mill was no longer needed and, by time, it became a residential space and even a shelter used by many people in World War II. It remained a residential space until a blacksmith took it over in the 1970s.
 Throughout the 1980s, the Works Department sought to renovate the structure. Coincidentally, at the same time, one of the fathers of modern Maltese art, Gabriel Caruana, began looking for a space to convert into an art and culture centre. By 1990, together with his wife, Mary Rose Caruana, he took over the building and opened the arts and culture centre that is still running today.
 So, this is not only the 300th anniversary of the building but also the 34th anniversary since the Caruanas opened the cultural centre.
 Caruana’s daughter, Raffaella Zammit, who is also the Gabriel Caruana Foundation’s executive director, said: “It was always my father’s dream to create an arts and community space. He always wanted a space for people to create together.
 “My earliest memory, in fact, was him at the mill inviting people to paint together. And we hope to maintain that communal spirit.”
 Zammit said that part of the reason the building and art space has survived for so long is because it has always held an important role in the community.
  Even today, besides running an artistic programme, which helps foster a community of creatives, the Gabriel Caruana Foundation also organises initiatives for other communities to engage with the space. These range from Ktieb tal-Istaġun, a project created for kindergartners to learn more about the weather, to  Layers of Being, a project created to help fight loneliness in the elderly community.
 “We want to take this opportunity to celebrate all our different communities and projects,” Zammit said.
 The foundation will celebrate this milestone on June 21 and 22 with the event Mawra sal-Mitħna, featuring a series of activities for people of all ages.
 The programme includes collaboration between no.site.studio and the Gabriel Caruana Foundation to reimagine the public space around The Mill and a walking workshop around Birkirkara and Balzan where the public is invited to explore concepts of care in public space, which is part of an artistic project by Zammit.
 When asked where she hopes to see the mill in 300 years, she said: “Well, firstly, I hope it’s still standing [laughing]. I hope it remains a sustainable building that continues to be a space for creatives, artists and the community of that time.”

https://timesofmalta.com/article/police-investigating-no-pakis-rental-advert.1096864,"The police have said they are investigating a rental property advert that warned against applications from “Pakis, Indians, Arabs and Philippines”.
 The advert hit the headlines earlier this month when the company responsible, Alliance Real Estate, blamed the incident on human error, adding it was obligated to follow landlord “restrictions” on tenants. 
 But prominent human rights lawyer, Neil Falzon, said restricting housing based on skin colour or nationality was illegal, calling Maltese law “crystal clear” on the matter.
 A police spokesperson confirmed an investigation into the incident was “underway” but did not provide further details.
 
 Meanwhile, sources said the investigation was looking into the incident itself – as well as the company responsible.
 A listing for a three-bedroom apartment in Żebbuġ appeared on the Alliance Real Estate website earlier this month before later appearing on property aggregate website propertymarket.com.mt.
 Alongside a note explaining the property could be turned into a five-bedroom terraced house, the description also read: “no Pakis, Indians, Arabs and Philippines” (sic).
 The term ‘Paki’ is a derogatory term for a person from Pakistan that has also been used to contemptuously describe people of other South Asian nationalities.
  Alliance Real Estate said the words appeared online after an “internal comment” was published by mistake instead of the intended property description.
 The listing has since been removed from propertymarket. com.mt – which distanced itself from the advert when contacted by Times of Malta – and edited on the Alliance website to remove the reference.
 Alliance CEO Michael Bonello subsequently penned a Times of Malta opinion piece acknowledged the ""unfortunate incident"" and  calling for reforms to address ""legitimate concerns"" landlords had.
 
 Commenting on the case, Falzon said “anyone refusing to offer a service to a person simply on the basis of their skin colour, nationality or origin is breaking the law... the law requires you to treat people with decency and respect”.
 But according to the Malta Malayalee Association, which represents members of the Indian community, such discrimination is commonplace.
 A spokesperson for the organisation said South Asians were “more often than not” turned down for properties because of their nationality.
 “Apartment owners often reject Indians from renting their apartment just because of where we are from,” he said, adding the community had not been surprised by the incident.
 Real estate agents told Times of Malta they normally tell prospective tenants a property isn’t available if faced with restrictive landlords.
"
https://timesofmalta.com/article/real-estate-ceo-calls-tenant-screening-following-no-pakis-listing.1096510,"Landlords should be able to screen potential tenants before signing a lease agreement to avoid rental discrimination, Michael Bonello, CEO of Alliance Real Estate says in an opinion article in today’s Times of Malta.  
 The article comes shortly after Alliance advertised a property with the warning “no Pakis, Indians, Arabs, and Filipinos” after accidentally publishing an “internal comment” instead of the property description. 
 The term ‘Paki’ is a derogatory term for a person from Pakistan and has also been used to contemptuously describe persons of other South Asian nationalities. 
 Bonello says the “discriminatory language was mistakenly published” and was a one-off incident made by a “junior employee”. However, the incident highlights issues within the rental market, he points out. 
 Online platforms where landlords and tenants can review each other is another proposal Bonello makes. 
 In his article Bonello calls for the introduction of a set of standards to be upheld by tenants, adding that greater protection should be given to landlords. 
 Stronger protections for landlords would allow them to rent their property with peace of mind while adhering to anti-discrimination laws, he says. 
 “Implementing a new national framework on lease agreements with clear terms regarding tenant behaviour, maintenance responsibilities, and eviction procedures can minimise disputes – protecting both landlords and tenants alike,” Bonello says. 
 He also says landlords should have access to rental history reviews and credit checks, pointing out at such systems exist abroad. 
 Similarly, tenants should be able to access databases where landlords are reviewed. 
 Bonello also calls for allowing higher security rental deposits for “higher-risk tenants” to provide financial protection against potential damages and unpaid rent. 
 Property owners often trust tenants with their life savings, so it is not uncommon for landlords to have concerns about the type of tenants that will rent out their property, he says. 
 “Will they respect the building and its other residents? Will they honour their contract and payments? Or will they trash the property, leaving me with a hefty cleaning bill, or worse?” he asks. 
 “Although people may come from different cultures, everyone must abide by local laws and cultural norms.” 
 Bonello says this is not a racial issue; it is a business matter and requires adequate policies to address it. 
 “Landlords are not racists. They simply want to protect and maximise their investment, just as any other investor would with any other asset,” he says.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/watch-the-web-designer-cloistered-nun.1095970,"Malta’s only prospective nun was “disgusted” at the thought of a cloistered existence when she felt a calling to a religious life in her early 20s.
 Now, at 36, Roberta Huber has joined St Margaret’s Monastery in Cospicua as a postulant nun. And beaming from ear to ear, the bubbly former IT programmer is the happiest and most fulfilled she has ever been.
  “When I was younger, I used to observe nuns and think theirs was a terrible choice. I was repelled by the idea,” Huber says from behind a grille.
 But today, her excitement to embark on this “adventure” is palpable. Even though she is moving from a web-designer world to restricted internet access and will never tick off her bucket list a trip to the US, or see the sea again, Huber feels “really free”.
 She may be speaking from behind bars – the Teresian community of eight nuns leads a traditional cloistered life – but she does not feel imprisoned as, she acknowledges, others may believe, having shed the shackles of material needs and ego.
  Huber understands people could find all this incomprehensible; and think she is ‘wasting her life’ when she could be putting her skills to a worthier cause, rather than confining herself; and possibly escaping her problems.
 Her life choice may seem “odd” given the “many opportunities and distractions out there, so much media to consume, so much more to detach from nowadays, easy travel…
 “But my vocation was not something I conjured up myself… It was a ray of light.”
 ‘I was actually praying for a boyfriend’
 From a young age, Huber stopped going to Mass and receiving the sacraments. Then, in her 20s, because she felt so “uncomfortable” in life, she decided to “give God a try”.
 Always uneasy, she felt awkward about everything, she admits. “I felt something was not right.”
 In hindsight, she already knew God existed. “I felt I was talking to someone and not an imaginary friend when I asked him to give me a sign.” That sign came, and Huber “fell in love” with God, describing it as “amazing”. She started attending prayer groups and took it seriously.
 But while she was getting closer to what she wanted, she still could not find a community she really belonged to.
 “In that moment, as I was praying before the Blessed Sacrament, I understood that God was calling me for a religious life. How did that happen? I just understood it.”
 Huber was happy and excited, but she was also shocked. “I did not like the idea at all. I thought it was terrible”, she admits.
  Huber had a boyfriend at the time, and she resisted the calling. Eventually, they broke up and she started praying for another. “I was actually praying for a boyfriend, but it seemed it was not God’s will, so I got upset and abandoned everything again.”
 Things just went from bad to worse after that: “I knew it was something I would keep feeling. The thought did not go away. “This was an invitation. It is my path to my final destination. Anything outside that would make my life doubly hard and, in fact, it was doubly hard. Things that seemed so easy for others were much harder for me.
 “I knew it was the right thing to do, but I was not happy with the idea at all.”
 Burying the thought, Huber worked with an investment management company… until again, she started to seek something she could not put her finger on. “At 30, something was still missing. What it was, I had absolutely no idea.” So, Huber decided to move to Poland for a couple of months to figure out what to do with her life.
 The next step was a boot camp computer programming course “because I like problem solving” – and she really enjoyed it. She found a job as a web developer with a video game company in the Czech Republic for over two years. But although she had just started a career in programming and loved the job, she still felt incomplete, and the anxiety persisted. “Four years older, life was still the same, so I decided to surrender myself to God.”
 It was a short process. Huber stopped going out and meeting people. She was working from home and her life was about prayer. “This was it! I had prayed for a couple of months about it, and I felt it was the right and most obvious thing to do.”
 Confident about her decision, Huber resigned her job. But still resisting the cloister idea, she got in touch with the Dominican Sisters, with a plan to “start lightly”. She was invited to the UK for three months and the idea kept maturing to the point that she felt a need for more silence, more prayer and more time with God.
 Huber got in touch with St Margaret’s community almost a year ago, spending the first three months visiting every weekend until she entered officially as a postulant in February. It will take her eight years for her solemn profession, with the first five being temporary vows, and the rest, her novitiate.
 From now on, she will only go outdoors for health reasons and anyone visiting will do so from behind iron bars, she says matter-of-factly.
 One of four siblings, everyone has supported her, and her parents were “very happy” about her decision.
  Huber is the youngest of her new family. Madre Paulina Xuereb is 58 and the next nun is in her 70s. The oldest is 96; one is in a wheelchair and another blind. But Huber does not feel the age gap, she says as she points out that one sister has watched the grand total of three films in her life. The young nun feels her own presence among the community has brought hope and joy. “They can pass on the life.”
 St Margaret’s Monastery went from 21 nuns down to nine in the last 50 years, and vocations are on a sharp decline in Malta’s five cloistered communities.
  Huber, however, never really gave much thought to the fact that she is the only woman to choose this path. “I suppose it is exciting for me. It feels like God is up to something; that he is leading us into a new season; some new age.” Neither does she have any specific project to entice others through her own enlightening experience.
 “We are open to guiding, helping and putting in a good word. We do not shut the doors as opportunities arise. But our vocation is about prayer, and we must preserve time for that.
 “The cloistered life is also important because the less distractions and the more silence, the more open you are to God.
 “I am not keeping my schedule busy with appointments. We are here for that interior solitude, alone with God and no other thoughts.”
 But if she had to send a message to the girl she was in her 20s, engulfed in turmoil and holding back, what would she say?
 “Trust God. Take the leap. It is exciting,” Huber says about a life of intense prayer, and about loving God. “If you do his will, even in the smallest of ways, you will be a channel of grace for the rest of the world,” she says about her role. “This is an adventure – experiencing heavenly joy. You are spending your time with the source of life. Can you be doing anything greater than that?”
 Finding freedom
 Huber will miss the sea but prays for those enjoying their summer and the views she will never set eyes on.
 In the outside world, the young woman was obsessed with make-up and loved perfume. But giving up brands – and her favourite fragrance, Viva Voce by Valentino, starring Lady Gaga – has been so liberating.
 “I did not find it that easy to shed them. But while I was discerning a vocation, this was the first thing the spirit led me to do. I started wearing different clothes and I stopped using perfume. That is the spirit of God working.”
 Huber also stopped looking in the mirror as much, and realises it was in preparation for her time in the convent.
 “There aren’t many mirrors here; just one in the elevator and I have my own small one,” she giggles, admitting she did check it before the interview “to see if I had any aerials sticking out of my head”.
 On the topic of chastity, Huber says this is a grace. It could sound like nonsense to others, she admits. But Christ says: ‘Let anyone accept this who can.’
 “We are called to be intimate with God,” she continues, adding it is hard to explain, and that the physical aspect just does not enter the picture.
 “I had a boyfriend at the time and recall saying to myself that I seemed to love this guy like a mother and that I really wanted to love everybody else like that too. I did not feel like I want to be fully committed to one person.
 “Later, it occurred to me that I wanted to be a spiritual mother really. These things are buried in the soul and find ways to manifest themselves.”
 For Huber, the biggest sacrifice of cloistered life is living in a community, which means having to sacrifice your ego.
  “It is all about purging yourself of your ego and filling up that space with God… I lived a very independent life, doing things my way; what I wanted, how I wanted,” she says. “Now, I’m in the process of learning to surrender my ego and sacrifice my will. When you are free from your ego, that is true freedom. I feel really free.”
 People question whether being a cloistered nun is a form of escape from the big, bad, outside world. But Huber insists that “unless it is your vocation, you would not survive it in here”.
 She was psychologically screened before entering. “They check for this kind of thing,” she points out. “You have to be here for the right reasons; otherwise, you will make everyone miserable. It has to be genuine. It is really about picking up your Cross every day.”
 About facing the outside world, Huber believes people need to discover God, insisting they need him, whether they resist it or not. “In so doing, you will start to find him more interesting than anything else, including the self.”
 Huber has a different perspective on life: “It is not about this one, but about eternity.” For others, again, this may be nonsense, but for her, being in communication with God is “so real – even more real than anything out there, which will just fade away”.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/marsaxlokk-public-toilet-inauguration-draws-royal-flush-politicians.1098444,"Updated 1.50pm
 A minister, junior minister and Opposition MP were all on hand to inaugurate a new public toilet block in Marsaxlokk on Sunday.
 Owen Bonnici, Alison Zerafa Civelli and Janice Chetcuti were among a nine-person group of dignitaries who smiled for the camera as they posed for photos inside and outside the seaside restroom facility.
  Marsaxlokk’s local council spared no expense in unveiling the latrine, with a promotional video clip featuring drone footage taking viewers on a tour of the block.
 The block features a nappy changing stand, a toilet stall for users with a disability and two showers with squat toilet fixtures, the video clip shows.
  Photos published on the local council’s Facebook page showed that councillors and mayor Stephen Grech also joined the minister, junior minister and MP for the inauguration.
 The toilet block's inauguration was timed to coincide with Jum Marsaxlokk, a council-organised event that celebrated the southern fishing village. 
 Owen Bonnici is Malta’s culture minister. Alison Zerafa Civelli is the parliamentary secretary for local councils, working within Bonnici’s ministry. Chetcuti is the Opposition’s spokesperson for animal welfare and consumer affairs.
 Bonnici said he was in Marsaxlokk to tour the town and attend events organised by the parish and local council during Jum Marsaxlokk and was shown the new toilet block during the visit. The latrine was funded through money provided by the local councils directorate, he noted.
 The inauguration recalls a similar event back in 2016, when then-Gozo Minister Anton Refalo was the guest of honour as a public toilet was inaugurated at Ħondoq ir-Rummien. On that occasion, the government had taken things one step further by issuing a press release about the inauguration through the Department of Information.
 Marsaxlokk's public toilets have proven to be remarkably newsworthy in recent years. In 2016 CCTV cameras in a public toilet block's common area. 
 The issue resurfaced last year, when photos of the cameras prompted outrage on social media. Mayor Stephen Grech subsequently reassured people that the cameras were switched off and effectively served as decoys to deter would-be vandals.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/sick-syrian-children-put-detention-denied-entry.1102509,"Children as young as three were detained for days at the Safi detention centre while awaiting deportation after being refused entry into Malta along with a Syrian woman.
 The children and the woman, who hold humanitarian protection in Greece, flew to Malta but were denied entry.
 In such cases, passengers are usually returned immediately on the flight they arrived on, human rights lawyer Neil Falzon explained.
 However, several of the children had chickenpox and could not return immediately due to health concerns. Instead, they were placed in the women’s detention centre in Safi, he said.
 Times of Malta independently confirmed the claim and reported that they were returned to Greece on Wednesday.
 “Instead of providing the woman and children with the necessary support, care and attention in an appropriate accommodation setting, the government decided to lock them up,” said Falzon, director of human rights NGO Aditus Foundation.
 “Furthermore, Malta chose to detain them in a detention centre that has been repeatedly condemned as exposing children and vulnerable persons to inhuman and degrading treatment,” Falzon said.
 Children should at least be kept in an open centre, he said, adding that if a child is sick, they should be cared for in an appropriate environment.
 “The detention centre is definitely not appropriate,” he said.
  Government sources said the sick children were cared for and given treatment while in detention.
 Falzon asked whether the health of those detained at the centre was considered.
 “If health concerns prevented their placement on a flight, what about the health concerns of exposing others at the Safi detention centre to chickenpox?” he asked.
 Falzon said that a woman travelling alone with a group of children, some of whom were sick, should have raised the alarm about issues such as trafficking and abuse.
 He alleged that the government did not ensure the safety of the woman and children was safeguarded.
 “Malta denied them access to any form of independent information or support. From information available to us, it looks like their apprehension was immediately and automatically followed by their detention at Safi Barracks,” he said.
 Falzon called for more transparency in Malta’s migration system.
 “Malta’s policy deprives detained people of access to lawyers and other forms of support,” he said.
 In this case, for example, Aditus only learned of the woman and children’s detention by “sheer chance”.
 “As it stands, the system places vulnerable people in an invisible zone, cutting them off from assistance,” he said.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/lija-sant-andrija-band-club-bought-36m-10th-government-purchase.1092134,"Lija's Sant Andrija band club has had its premises bought by the government in a €3.6 million deal to save it from eviction. 
 The purchase was announced by the culture ministry in a statement on Wednesday. 
 It is the tenth band club property to be bought by the government, which plans to invest €19 million in similar premises across the country.
 The clubs all faced eviction from their premises, which they occupied at artificially low rental prices thanks to rent laws dating back 30 years. 
 But following court judgements which ruled that those laws went against owners' right to enjoy their property, such clubs faced eviction. 
 The other properties the government has bought are: Marsa's Marija Regina, Attard's Stella Levantina, Kalkara's San Giuseppe Filarmonika Sagra Familja, Birkirkara's Duke of Connaught's Own, Paola's Antoine de Paule, Sliema's Stella Maris, Birżebbuġa's San Pietru fil-Ktajjen, Qormi's Anici and Mosta's Soċjetà Filarmonika Santa Marija.
 Agreement has been reached on a further two properties but the final contract has not been signed.
 Culture Minister Owen Bonnici said that band clubs play a crucial role in fostering cultural development and that it is often the people in these clubs who promote art and education in their communities. 
 ""These organisations depend a lot on the spaces they occupy to carry out their work effectively in the heart of the communities and therefore an eviction would not only seriously endanger their operation but also threaten their existence,"" he said.
 He said it was ""esssential"" that the government take measures to protect and safeguard the clubs.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/dun-ang-seychell-dies-aged-91.1097476,"The founder of Fondazzjoni Nazareth, Dun Anġ Seychell, died on Saturday, aged 91.
 Born in 1933 in Żejtun, Seychell was ordained a priest at the age of 23.
 In addition to Fondazzjoni Nazareth, he also co-founded Caritas and was instrumental in establishing the house for retired and elderly clergy in Birkirkara.
 In 2016 he also famously opposed an agritourism development that was set to engulf the Munxar cliffs in Marsascala. Twenty years earlier he had also fronted the building of a hotel in the same area.
 Affectionately known as Dun Anġ, his lifelong mission statement was to remove vulnerable persons from institutionalised care and place them in homes offering them an alternative family structure.
 Fondazzjoni Nazareth’s mission was inspired by this objective. It provides alternative family to persons with physical or mental disabilities who have no family or are unable to live with their natural family..
 In early September 1995, Dun Anġ Seychell opened a first residence to cater for four people with physical or mental disability.
 A second home, named after Fr Lawrence Degabriele, was opened in 2002; a third, the Jean Vanier home, was opened in 2009.
 Dar San Ġużepp Ħaddiem was closed down in 2023 because the foundation could not keep up with the rental costs.
 Throughout his life, Dun Anġ was also a regular contributor on newspapers and religious and social broadcasts on TV and radio.
 As his death was announced on the Facebook page of the NGO he set up, tributes poured in to honour his memory.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/homeless-child-undergo-lifechanging-spinal-surgery-uk.1098557,"Four-year-old Nina* is homeless. She loves playing with the bare doll house at the YMCA shelter where she lives – but whenever she needs to reach the upper level of the wooden toy house she has to ask for help – because she cannot stand up.
 Nina has cerebral palsy – a condition that affects movement and coordination. It is caused by damage to the developing brain, most often before birth.
 She needs to undergo spinal surgery in the UK in November to address her muscle stiffness. This will be followed by therapy, and she will then need a wheelchair and standing frame to be able to support her as she learns how to walk.
 But the wheelchair and standing frame will cost about €10,000 – and her mother, Anna*, does not have the money.
 YMCA Malta – an NGO that supports the poor and homeless – has now stepped in to help Anna and Nina raise funds for the equipment.
 Anna timidly shares parts of her story and asks not to be named because Nina is about to start school.
 “I have nothing to hide but I don’t want people recognising her at school and knowing so much about her life,” her mother says.
  Some parts of their story are too painful to talk about. Anna looks into the eyes of her social support mentor – Marie-Claire Dimech – for encouragement as she explains that her husband left her and her daughter, and they ended up without a home after facing financial problems.
 She has other relatives but they have their own problems and cannot take them in. So, two months ago, she moved into one of the YMCA shelters with her daughter.
 Nicola Falzon, community services manager, explains that the shelter staff are helping Anna slowly pick up the pieces.
 “It’s easy to say that she should go work. But, at the moment, Anna cannot work since her time is dedicated to Nina 24/7. She carries her around everywhere she goes as the child cannot walk due to her condition,” Nicola says.
  Anna nods and adds: “But now she is starting to question. Now she wants to walk.”
 Staff at YMCA are supporting Anna to applying for school and Nina is set to start soon – freeing some time for Anna to be able to work.
 But, right now, the priority is the operation and making sure Nina has the wheelchair, that costs €6,000, and standing frame, which costs €3,200.
 Whoever may help Anna and Nina may donate through the YMCA official channels and write ‘Support for Nina’. https://ymcamalta.org/donate/.
 Aġenzija Sapport, a government agency said on Thursday afternoon that it was stepping in to fund Nina's needs.
 Fundraising by the YMCA for this and similar causes will continue, however. 
 The Malta Community Chest Fund will also be assisting with the equipment and expenses the mother will incur when travelling abroad for medical treatment with her daughter.

 Tommy Wallbank, 19, will be leading the yearly run to commemorate his friend, Rebecca Zammit Lupi who died of cancer three years ago.
 This is the second such run he is organising on her 19th birthday (August 3), and anyone is free to join.
 
 19km Run for Rebecca's 19 will kick off at 6.15am from Surfside in Sliema. Wallbank will run to Qui Si Sana, loop back to Surfside, up to the Love Sign in St Julian's and back to Surfside.
 Runners, walkers, or supporters are encouraged to join at any point along the way.
 Wallbank's athletic career began in 2021 at the age of 15, when he pledged to run 1km for every €5 donated to Puttinu Cares, in honour of Zammit Lupi.
 His initial goal was to raise €500 and run 100km but, in the end, he completed a 1,000km run challenge and raised €10,000 for Puttinu Cares.
 He had told Times of Malta: “I know that I would never have started running if it weren’t for her, so, every time I’m successful with my running, I know I owe it to Rebecca.”
 Rebecca, known to many as Becs, was only 15 years old when she passed away on January 3, 2021, after months of battling cancer.
 She suffered from Ewing’s Sarcoma, a rare and extremely aggressive form of bone cancer.
 Donations will be collected for Nature Trust Malta and RMJ Horse Rescue Malta.
 Donations can be collected in person on the day or via Revolut to 7730 0305.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/st-paul-church-facade-restoration-project-halted-valletta-mayor.1098147,"The Valletta mayor “illegally” annulled a contract for the restoration of the façade of the locality’s St Paul’s Shipwreck Parish Church, PN councillors have claimed.
 In a statement on Monday morning, the PN slammed Olaf McKay, the locality’s new mayor, for his “unacceptable” behaviour during a local council meeting earlier this month, when he unilaterally decided to annul a contract previously approved by all members of the local council.
 The statement, signed by PN Valletta councillors Ylenia Montfort, Roberta Bonello Felice and Vince Fabri, referred to a contract which was approved and granted for restoration works on the church’s facade during a meeting held last month.
 The Church of St Paul's Shipwreck is one of Valletta's oldest churches, dating back to the 1570s. Last year, the former Valletta mayor, Alfred Zammit, announced the restoration project for the church's façade and works were to include a new lighting system.
 According to the statement, the contract was approved unanimously by the Local Council which was then “duty-bound” to proceed by informing all tenderers of the Council’s decision and opening the appeal period.
 “It seems that without the knowledge of some Local Council members, this process was not triggered, and the small contract was brought back for discussion at the next meeting, held on 3 September,” the statement read. 
 Before that meeting, councillors had requested an urgent meeting, but the request was ignored by McKay, they said.
 According to the PN councillors, the local council’s lawyer was also present at the September 3 meeting. The statement said the majority of the local council had disagreed with the lawyer’s advice, and the Nationalist Party had asked for several clarifications which remained unanswered. 
 “At this stage, the mayor declared that he alone had the right to annul the contract on the basis that he is the mayor,” the statement read. 
 “Amid many disputes between the councillors, the mayor stated that he would cancel the contract because he had the authority to do so as mayor. He also made allegations against one of the PN councillors, which he did not substantiate.”
 The mayor went on to declare the contract would be annulled, despite the majority of the councillors disagreeing with his decision, the statement read.
 “The cancellation of this contract was entirely in breach of the law, as decisions within the Council must be made by the majority of councillors, not by one person,” it said.
 “Furthermore, the Local Council administration should only act on the decisions made by the majority of councillors.”
 In a Facebook post, St Paul’s Parish Archpriest, David Cilia and the Collegiate Chapter, said they had been informed through third parties that the local council had dropped the tender for the restoration of the church’s facade. 
 The statement was published days after the local council meeting.
 The Archpriest slammed McKay’s decision which, without any discussions with the Chapter, had once again halted the tender for the project, he said, adding it was the second time the tender had been stopped.
 “The Chapter expresses its displeasure that the local council is discriminating against parishioners of the St Paul’s Shipwreck parish with a persistence the likes of which we have never seen.”
 The statement concluded it would be in contact with government authorities to ensure the abusive council does not have ""the last word"".
 The PN councillors said further action will take place in the coming days in response to the mayor’s “illegal” actions.
 Contacted by Times of Malta, McKay said he had evidence that showed the council had been left with ""no option but to cancel the tender, which was not yet awarded to any bidder.""
 He said the evidence would be submitted to the public contracts review board which had been asked to look into the matter, but that he was unable to comment further while the case was under review.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/in-pictures-fireworks-early-malta.1094196,"Fireworks have been recorded as an indispensable part of Maltese festivities at least since the time of the Knights.
 What evidence survives indicates that on particularly joyous celebrations, skilled artificers were imported from Italy. 
  More particularly from Sicily – some Maltese terms are giveaways of their Sicilian, rather than Italian, origins, like maskli from Sicilian  masculi,  giggifogu, Sicilian  jocu di focu,  trikkitrakki, Sicilian  tricchi tracchi,  porvli,  fjakkli,  murtali,  musketterija,  razzi,  suffarelli,  girandla,  serpentelli,  stoppìn,  kruċetti.
  Not to mention the tour de force of all fireworks displays – the kaxxa nfernali, which shares nothing with Satan and the underworld but just reflects an illiterate misreading of  cassa finale.
 Any joyful occasion provided a good excuse – mostly religious festas and important civilian celebrations, like visits by royalty, military victories, political milestones.
 In Malta, new money is now sneaking fireworks into baptisms, weddings and graduations.
 Still one step behind Palermo, where well-wishers celebrate the release of long-time murderers from prison by letting off murtali, little realising how aptly the word describes their victims.
  Postcard publishers and photographers have long realised the spectacular potential of fireworks, even before colour made that more obvious still.
 The German Geo Fürst, monarch of image-making in Malta in the interwar years, had a heyday during the 1935 George V jubilee celebrations, for which the authorities voted £600 to be spent on fireworks. Richard Ellis would not be outdone.
 He too had earlier recorded some amazing images.
  Fireworks continue to divide the people – some hate the shattering noise, the pollution, the inconveniences, the dangers ever lurking in the kmamar tan-nar and the unexploded petards which maim the unwary.
 Others find that a fair price to pay to keep alive an old and frankly astonishing tradition.
 The military authorities banned fireworks during World War II.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/ngos-call-sch-transparent-steps-safeguard-heritage.1097225,"A coalition of conservation NGOs have called on the Superintendence of Cultural Heritage (SCH) to provide “clear information” about steps being taken to safeguard archeological finds at the Santa Verna site in Gozo while works are ongoing in the area.
 Għal Għawdex said the megalithic site in Xagħra had “significant historical and archaeological importance,” home to prehistoric temples it said were “essential” to the country’s heritage.
 The coalition said that while an SCH investigation in 2012 had concluded there were no findings of enough importance to exclude it from a building zone created in the area some six years earlier, recent findings suggested otherwise.
 Last year, residents reported finding bones and shards of pottery in exposed soil as excavation work got underway at a construction site close to Santa Verna.
  “Upon further investigation by SCH, these bones were confirmed to be prehistoric remains, likely within a secondary burial context,” Għal Għawdex said in a statement on Sunday.
 “This discovery underscores the importance of continuous and effective monitoring in this archaeologically sensitive area.”
 The group of NGOs said that in light of ongoing works in the area, particularly new road Triq George McAdam, it was “seeking greater transparency” from the superintendence.
 “Specifically, we request that SCH provide clear information on the interventions currently being undertaken, any discoveries that have been made, and the future plans for developments in this area.”
 The NGOs called for “transparency and accountability in how archaeological investigations and monitoring are conducted,” stressing it was the public’s right to be informed about such developments.
 In 2022, the Planning Authority (PA) halted building works in Xagħra after “potential cultural features” were discovered at a development site just 50 metres away from Santa Verna.
 In that case, investigations into the discovery of a cave at the site were initially hampered when it transpired the cave was on private property. Two years earlier, the SCH had raised concerns about the development, pointing out the area was “archaeologically sensitive”.
 This is not the first time development works in sensitive areas have hit the headlines, in some cases internationally; in November, London-based newspaper The Times  reported local reactions to the PA’s decision to allow a 22-apartment block of flats to be built less than 200 metres away from the Ġgantija temples as one of “horror”.
 The news outlet noted that at 5,600 years old, the temples are the world's oldest remains of a free-standing building and the world's second oldest religious building.
 Six architects were subsequently investigated by the Chamber of Architects (KTP) for their work on projects in the area surrounding the Ġgantija temples.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/factcheck-can-property-owner-rent-property-want.1096500,"Claim: A property owner can rent their property to whoever they want.
 Verdict: A property owner cannot legally preclude certain people from renting their property based on their race or ethnicity. But they have a little more flexibility when barring children and pets.
 An advert for a Żebbuġ rental apartment warning that several ethnic minorities need not apply, caused outrage earlier this week.
 “No Pakis, Indians, Arabs and Philippines,” the notice said, lest anyone think the property was available to all.
 When the news broke, Alliance Real Estate, the agency advertising the property, quietly deleted the advert, admitting that the notice had accidentally let slip a request from the property’s owner.
 “Some owners decide to restrict certain cultures, nationalities or ages of tenants, others may decide to restrict all pets or certain types of pets,” the agency said, adding that it registers these requests through an internal comments section in its database.
  Some fumed at the discriminatory nature of this practice, others argued that a property owner has every right to choose their prospective tenants.
 Others still wrote to Times of Malta, asking whether law really does bar tenants from setting the terms of their rental properties to exclude some people.
 It’s not that simple, and with good reason.
 Modern history is rife with tales of people being denied access to housing because of their religion, skin colour, nationality or sexual orientation.
 There’s no need to look too far from home for examples of this.
 In the early 20described as “ignorant of all sanitary precautions”.
 A century later, the tables have turned, with migrants in Malta frequently bearing the brunt of discriminatory housing practices.
 This week’s incident is far from new.
 In 2011, another estate agency, Simon Estates advertised a rental property in Qawra, adding the phrase “no arabs, blacks or young boys (sic)” to the tail-end of the advert. Although it was told off, the agency ultimately  escaped punishment.
  A study commissioned by Malta’s equality commission just a few months later found that several property owners  “are not interested in renting their properties to categories generally referred to as ‘Arabs’, ‘Blacks’ or specific nationalities, including ‘Libyans’ and ‘Chinese’”.
 The equality commission told Times of Malta that it intends to “repeat this study so that it provides an updated picture of the situation”.
 In any case, it’s clear that the problem has persisted throughout the past decade.
 In 2022, one Bangladeshi businessman described how he was left mulling a move away from Malta, his home for almost two decades, after he was repeatedly turned away by property owners because he is “a Muslim man and a third country national”.
 Unsurprisingly, the law has stepped in to stop this sort of discrimination, at least on paper.
 A 2007 law, known as the Equal Treatment of Persons Order, prohibits direct or indirect discrimination against people based on their racial or ethnic origin, effectively making it illegal to deny a service (“including housing,” the law says) because of a person’s ethnicity.
 The same law also makes it illegal to advertise a service in a way that “promotes discrimination or which is discriminatory”.
 What’s more, if there is enough prima facie evidence to suggest that a prospective tenant has been discriminated against, the burden of proof lies upon the property owner, so it is ultimately up to them to convince the courts that they haven’t acted unfairly.
 The penalty for breaking this law? A fine of up to 1,000 Maltese Liri (roughly €2,330) and a six-month stint in prison. It is unclear whether any of these punishments have ever been imposed.
 But breaking this law won’t land you with a criminal record since it constitutes a civil, not criminal, offence.
  While this law, based on the EU’s race equality directive, speaks specifically of race and ethnicity, other tweaks to Malta’s laws – and its constitution - over the years have ensured that discrimination on other grounds, including gender, sexual orientation, and religion, amongst others.
 A landmark equality bill, meant to enshrine these protections under a single cap, was brought before parliament several years ago, but appears to have stalled after objections raised by church schools and some medical associations.
 Still, even without the updated equality bill, advertising a property to prohibit people of certain race or ethnicity remains illegal.
 In its response to the news, the equality commission said that the agency’s explanation that the comment was intended for internal use is “a blatant admission that discriminatory and illegal criteria are used and normalised in their services”.
 “Furthermore, the claim that they are bound to follow their clients’ discriminatory requests is both illegal and ethically wrong,” the commission said.
 But, lawyers say, although Malta's laws are clear in prohibiting discrimination, things are a little less clearcut in practice, with people finding ways to select their tenants without falling foul of the law.
 ""In reality, these anti-discrimination laws only really come into play in cases that are blatant,"" one lawyer told Times of Malta.
 No, property lawyers say that the law doesn’t explicitly speak about this, effectively giving landlords a free hand over whether they are willing to rent out their property to families with children or pets.
  In practice, many landlords opt to bar pets from their properties, putting pet owners in a sticky situation when moving from one rental property to another.
 This prompted animal welfare commissioner Alison Bezzina to call for the introduction of tax incentives for landlords who rent out pet-friendly properties.
 Malta’s anti-discrimination laws, like those in other EU member states, make it illegal for a property owner to bar people from certain groups (including ethnic or racial groups) from renting their properties.
 If a person feels that they have been unfairly discriminated against, it is up to the property owner to show that they have not acted in a discriminatory manner.
 But property owners are free to set their own terms when it comes to deciding whether to allow people with children or pets to rent their properties.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/one-every-six-people-maltese-households-risk-poverty-2023.1093860,"One out of every six people in Maltese households were at risk of poverty last year, according to data released on Wednesday by the National Statistics Office.
 Figures from the European Statistics on Income and Living Conditions survey show that 88,462 people were under the poverty line in 2023 - meaning that 16.6% of the local population was at risk of poverty.
 This translates to a drop of 0.1% over 2022.
 A fifth (22%) of those at risk of poverty were aged under 18 - up by 2.7 percentage points from the previous year.
 A decrease of 0.2 percentage points was meanwhile observed among people aged 18 to 64, bringing the ARP rate for this age cohort down to 12.1% in 2023.
 The rate for those aged 65 or more went down to 29%, equivalent to a decrease of 1 percentage point.
 Material and social deprivation 
 Material and social deprivation indicators are based on 13 items, of which seven relate to the person’s household and six relate to the person. 
 These are when a household faces unexpected expenses; affording a one-week annual holiday; avoiding arrears (in mortgage, rent, utility bills and/or hire purchase instalments); affording a meal with meat, chicken or fish or vegetarian equivalent every second day; affording to keep the house appropriately warm; having access to a car/van for personal use and replacing worn-out furniture.
 They also include whether a person affords to replace worn-out clothes with new ones; have two pairs of properly fitting shoes; spends a small amount of money each week on him/herself; has regular leisure activities; gets together with friends/family for a drink/meal at least once a month and have an internet connection.
 When compared to 2022, the highest increases in 2023 were recorded in the group of respondents who said that their household was unable to afford a meal with meat, chicken, fish, or vegetarian equivalent every second day, and those whose household found it difficult to face unexpected financial expenses. 
 Wellbeing
 On a scale from zero to 10, where zero represents not satisfied at all, and 10 represents completely satisfied, respondents at risk of poverty or social exclusion reported lower average scores when it comes to their satisfaction with overall life, financial situation, current job, and personal relationships when compared to those not at-risk-of-poverty or social exclusion.
 Average scores for overall satisfaction about at-risk-of-poverty or social exclusion were slightly higher in 2023 when compared to 2022.
 Particularly, in 2023 respondents at risk of poverty or social exclusion reported a mean score of seven for satisfaction with their overall life - an increase of 0.2 points from 2022 and a mean score of 6.2 for satisfaction with their financial situation, translating into an increase of 0.4 points.
 They also reported a mean score of 7.4 for satisfaction with their current job - an increase of 0.1 points from 2022, and a mean score of 8.5 for satisfaction with personal relationships, representing an increase of 0.3 points.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/in-pictures-king-george-v-silver-jubilee-1935.1102484,"On May 6, 1935, good King George V and his consort, Queen Mary of Teck, celebrated the 25th anniversary of their reign. It was an auspicious day for the monarchy and the empire.
 Much less for Malta. The island’s cherished self-governing constitution had been revoked and Malta was being ruled by a military governor’s one-man diktat.
 In no uncertain words, London had told the humiliated Maltese in the name of the king: you are not capable of governing yourselves.
  And, yet, when the empire-builders organised spectacular activities to celebrate the king’s jubilee, the mortified populace swarmed to cheer and applaud. Slap the people in the face, demean them – they will still find your free bread and circuses irresistible.
   The festivities reached the highest loyalist pitch – lavish street decorations enlivened with kilometres of bunting, life-size mock-ups of the monarchs, band marches, fireworks, a water carnival, concerts, floats decorated with imperialist symbols, banquets, floodlighting of historical landmarks, school children on holiday.
  The facades of many shops and clubs competed to advertise devotion to the colonial power. Sales of jubilee souvenirs rocketed.
  Not one single manifestation of dissent is on record at the outrage of having your political autonomy and democracy smothered in the name of benevolent despotism. Business as usual.
  The Church organised a most solemn Te Deum in St John’s Co-Cathedral, no doubt to thank providence that our distant rulers did not trust us to take care of ourselves. King George died shortly later.
  Postcard publishers rode the bandwagon too. Besides the usual images of decorations and festive events, special high-quality composite souvenir postcards were put on sale. The Malta postal authorities also issued a set of handsome commemorative stamps.

 The fundraising event, to raise money for the Malta Community Chest Fund, kicked off at 8.30am from San Anton Palace, Balzan. 
 This was the first charity walk under President Myriam Spiteri Debono.
 Participants passed through Birkirkara, Santa Venera, Ħamrun and Floriana. 
  Among those participating in the ‘Mixja mal-President’ were President Myriam Spiteri Debono, Prime Minister Robert Abela, Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech, and several other politicians from both sides of the House. 
 The walk ended in at St. George’s Square, in front of the Grandmaster’s Palace in Valletta. 
 There Spiteri Debono spoke about a new agreement between MCCF and the government, where the government will take over responsibility for the funding of medicines for cancer patients. During her speech she emphasised that the foundation will continue to support those in need. 
 She said MCCF provides support not just to those in need of oncological care, but also provides support for a wide range of other social needs. 
 She said there will be other fundraising efforts this year, including L-Istrina. Earlier this week, Spiteri Debono confirmed the Boxing Day fund-raiser for MCCF will proceed as usual. 
 She encouraged everyone present to show the same spirit of solidarity shown during the walk in the coming weeks, during other fundraising events, particularly during L-Istrina.
 Following the speeches, Abela presented a donation of €20,000 to the MCCF from the Just Causes Fund.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/25-irregular-tcn-employers-hospitality.1093144,"A quarter of businesses irregularly employing workers from outside the EU last year were from the hospitality sector, according to government figures.
 Of the 1,695 employers found to have irregularly engaged workers from outside the EU – persons known as third country nationals (TCNs) – 436 were active in accommodation and food services, home affairs ministry figures show.
 These accounted for 26% of the total, with the sector by far the most represented among the 20 listed.
 The next most represented sector was wholesale and retail trade including the repair of vehicles and motorcycles (267 employers), followed by administration (179) and construction (168).
 Times of Malta requested the breakdown after Home Affairs Minister Byron Camilleri revealed the number of employers found to have employed non-EU workers irregularly last year in response to a parliamentary question by Nationalist MP Graziella Attard Previ.
 Figures tabled in parliament show the number of such irregular employers increased year-on-year from 2021 to 2023, albeit at a slowing pace; while 1,060 employers were caught in 2021, by the next year this had jumped 36% to 1,446.
 The following year, this number increased by less than half the previous rate, rising by 17% to 1,695 employers.
 Responding to questions, a home affairs ministry spokesperson said almost nine out of 10 businesses (88%) caught employing third country nationals irregularly had regularised their position, with the rest either fined or sent to court.
 “The remaining 12% were either given a fine... or referred to the Courts of Justice,” the spokesperson said, noting more than a quarter of offending employers (29%) were referred to court.
 Employers were referred to the courts if their workers were without an employment record and work permit or had a permit with another employer, she explained.
 Businesses whose workers had no employment record but a valid permit with that same employer were issued a fine instead, she said.
 The spokesperson added the country’s employment agency, Jobsplus undertakes “regular monitoring mechanisms, including physical inspections and administrative checks to ensure that employers abide by the local labour market regulations”.
 She did not respond to questions about what actions, if any, had been taken against those workers found to have been employed irregularly and if any had been deported from the country.
 Hospitality workers, especially food couriers, have been linked to irregular employment and working conditions in the past, with one study from the Department for Industrial and Employment Relations (DIER) finding such workers were not getting enough time to rest.
 The study also found employers had deducted money from their workers’ first salary to pay for their uniforms and work equipment.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/valletta-music-legend-maestro-vinny-vella-dies-aged-96.1094481,"Updated 4.25pm with minister's reaction
 Valletta's Maestro Vinny Vella Senior died on Wednesday aged 96.
 Vella played the clarinet and saxophone, with his career spanning from the 1940s to the 1990s.
 
 He was the leading musician and director of the band Vinny’s Blue Jackets and performed alongside several local and foreign performers including Albano Carrisi, Bobby Solo and Wilma De Angelis.
 His name was synonymous with venues such as The Premier, Phoenicia, Strait Street and Chalet. 
 His grandson Jamie told Times of Malta Vella was also among the musicians at a ball in Malta attended by then-Princess Elizabeth during her stay on the island. 
  On Facebook, Jamie recalled Vella as ""a true legend by every measure"".
 ""To many he will be remembered as the larger-than-life Meastro. To us he was simply ‘nannu Vinny’ - the centre of our family. Thank you  nannu for the love, wisdom, memories and - thank you for the music.""
 As news spread of his death on Wednesday, several took to social media to bid farewell to the ""legend"".
 Fellow musician Mark Spiteri Lucas said that Vella, together with other musicians, many of whom were from Valletta, had helped shape the local musical scene during the second half of the twentieth century.
 ""Rest in peace maestro and thank you for how many people you have blessed with your music,"" he said.
  Valletta councillor Ray Azzopardi said the locality had lost an ""icon"".
 ""There is no need to describe Vinny because everyone knows who he was and what he did in his life. Vinny certainly left beautiful memories and he thrilled everyone with his music.""
 Culture Minister Owen Bonnici described Vella as a ""legend"". 
  ""Vinny Vella will always be remembered for his leading and outstanding role in the live music industry, particularly in post-war Valletta,"" said Owen Bonnici. ""As his grandson Jamie aptly stated, the Maestro was a true legend by every measure.""
 Vella is survived by his three children, Tania, Carmen and Vinny Jr - who followed in his father's footsteps and forged his own musical career.

 Vella died aged 15 earlier this month as a result of complications caused by a rare disease he suffered, ROHHAD (Rapid-onset Obesity with Hypothalamic Dysfunction, Hypoventilation, and Autonomic Dysregulation). 
 Despite his medical condition, he took part in triathlons and actively encouraged people to exercise and stay healthy, inspiring thousands.  Vella was also an animal rights activist.
 The Xirka Gieħ ir-Repubblika is Malta's highest honour, awarded to those who demonstrate exceptional merit in the service of Malta or of humanity. 
 Abela, who is the wife of Prime Minister Robert Abela, announced her intention to nominate Vella for the prize during a visit she paid to his parents in Birżebbuġa, having first discussed the idea with them.
 She described Vella as a hero.
 “He was an extraordinary altruist who always sought to spread joy, despite his personal struggles. He transmitted love and brought people together,” she said.
  Abela said Vella was an example of the value of never giving up.
 She said she was sure that many people would back her decision to nominate him for the Ġieħ ir-Repubblika award.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/watch-a-different-kind-theatre-open-sliema.1091949,"A 116-year-old theatre in the heart of Sliema has been completely refurbished and is about to revolutionise the concept of a community theatre.
 The Salesians Theatre plans to host all kinds of events, from traditional drama to jazz nights to stand-up comedy, even doubling up as a day care centre for the elderly.
 “We want to get people together beyond the theatre and what is happening on stage. Theatre belongs to the people, and their engagement with the arts can help their general well-being,” said artistic consultant Rosetta Debattista.
 She believes the theatre experience should be much more than merely buying a ticket, watching a performance and going back home. For Debattista, a renowned musician and tutor, it is all about engagement, people and socialisation.
  Teatru Salesjan intends to work with children, youths, persons with disability, migrant and foreign communities, for which Sliema is a catchment area.
 Even the 480 banquet chairs – not your standard theatre seating – were chosen to enhance the versatility of the space, offering a cabaret-style set-up; while large round tables have been purchased so the auditorium can host a variety of events, including gala dinners.
 The project involved demolishing the balcony, gutting the stage and its ceiling, and creating the space for a hydraulic stage in the future – although that would cost a further €150,000. The second phase is the regeneration of the theatre’s annex, which would serve as a cultural centre, but that will not be happening anytime soon because of a shortage of funds.
  The theatre will transcend the actual building since there are plans for part of Ġuże Howard Street, where the theatre is located, to be pedestrianised and lined with trees. Works on the car-free road are scheduled to start in September, paving the way for the breathing space in line with the community theatre’s role.
 Debattista listed the many dormant community theatres and the importance of “decentralising” from Valletta to bring the arts into society’s day-to-day life.
 Starting tomorrow, the Golden Years Festival will kick off its community goal in a big way. Held over a series of Monday mornings, it is welcoming the elderly, 18 per cent of whom live in Sliema, to listen to live jazz music from the 1930s through to the 1950s and socialise in the theatre.
 “The elderly can feel lonely, and this would be an environment in which they can enjoy themselves and feel comfortable,” said Debattista, the theatre’s creative lead.
  Beyond the programme of events, which will bring to life the concept of community theatre at the heart of the project, lie two problems.
 The theatre has racked up a huge debt of around €500,000, which it fears will eat into the arts sector if it is forced to charge high rental fees for its use.
 The project cost €1 million and the strain of that debt on a theatre risks falling on the arts, Debattista feared.
 “We need to keep rates reasonable for artists; not to alienate them,” she continued.
 If it is not affordable to artists, the box office would feel the pinch of “ridiculous” prices, Debattista said, pointing out how arts events were becoming so costly for audiences, which means excluding a large chunk of society.
 But a community theatre was about building a relationship with its audience and not a once-a-year activity, Debattista insisted.
  Debattista also feels that running a theatre strictly on a voluntary basis was a thing of the past, with the cost of living meaning people needed to get paid for their work.
 “We need more financial assistance and volunteering has become a bite-size approach. A theatre cannot be run on this,” said James Spiteri Tanti, a member of the executive committee made up of three volunteers.
 Spiteri Tanti, who has been involved since 2011, would not have it any other way: “I believe in what this place can do for society because I am not too happy with where society is going.”
 While there is enough passion, drive and commitment to keep the project going, the dry coffers are a headache, and the committee is scratching its head to see how to raise funds to cover the shortfall that keeps “ballooning”.
 They are appealing to the business community to recognise the potential of organising events in the upgraded space.
  “Once it starts being used, the wheels will start turning,” they believe. “But we need help in the next five years to get going,” they maintained, appealing to benefactors.
 Spiteri Tanti would like to reawaken an interest in the arts in the country and garner patrons’ support, as is the case overseas, where long lists of families fund the arts.
 A membership scheme will soon be launched, allowing subscribers to “feel part of the theatre and benefit from this”.
 But the end goal is for Teatru Salesjan to transition to independence and become self-sustainable.
 The team is grateful for funding to the tune of around €500,000 from the Arts Council and Teatru Malta, the Planning Authority and the Social Causes Fund over the years.
 The large Calì painting and proscenium arch décor on top of the stage were also restored through BOV’s €60,000 sponsorship, while the BOV Joseph Calleja Foundation and ADRC Trust have both been considered a “lifeline”, helping with the budding theatre’s education and community programme.
 Even the contractors engaged on the project have been helpful, with their flexible payment terms, Spiteri Tanti said.
 “Why don’t we give up? We cannot,” he continued.
 “Because although society is disconnected today, we still believe in it and in what the arts can bring to it. This is what we can do, rather than just be armchair critics on social media.”

https://timesofmalta.com/article/when-law-suspending-planning-applications-appeal-come-force.1097594,"Some 20 organisations are calling on the government to set a timeframe for the implementation of a new law set to suspend planning applications until the entire appeals process has been concluded. 
 Earlier this week, the planning ministry promised new legislation ensuring that when a planning application is disputed at the planning appeals tribunal or even the Court of Appeal, construction will not be allowed to go forward until these appeals are concluded. 
 On Wednesday, the NGOs called for the immediate implementation of such a measure.
 They said despite the promised changes, there has been no commitment to any timeframes.
 Furthermore, there were no guarantees that the new legislation would solve the problems Malta and its citizens were facing, the activists added.
 The NGOs are protesting a recent decision by the PA to overturn a court of appeal judgement presided by Chief Justice Mark Chetcuti. That decision, they said, was ""flagrantly abusive"".
 The sanctioning is linked to the development of apartment blocks with pools in rural Gozo which was proposed in two different applications in 2020 and 2021.
 Activists had insisted the applications could not be judged singularly and in a vacuum, as they formed part of an attempt to fragment a mega-development to avoid the scrutiny such a large project would require. 
 In one of the applications (PA2035/21), Mark Agius, a developer and business partner of Portelli, applied to excavate a site and construct 29 apartments, 20 basement garages and a pool. The proposal was approved in 2021.
 Heritage NGO Din L-Art Ħelwa had filed an appeal against the PA’s approval. When the  Environment and Planning Tribunal also approved the development, it took the issue to the law courts.
 In March, Chief Justice Mark Chetcuti noted that the EPRT had incorrectly applied policies when it approved the development.
 The court noted that the approved pool and penthouse floor level should not have been approved, and the permit for this part was revoked.
 However, by then both the pool and the penthouses had been constructed and an application (PA/03869/24) to sanction two of the illegal penthouses was filed by Tarlochan Singh.
 In the application, Singh declared he is not an owner of the entire site, but is authorised to carry out the proposed development through an agreement with the owner.
 Flimkien għal Ambjent Aħjar and DLĦ protested the sanctioning with the latter applying for the revocation of the sanctioning permit.
 Arnold Cassola has meanwhile asked the Commissioner for Environment and Planning within the Office of the Ombudsman to look into the matter.
 On Wednesday, the group of NGOs said the fact the PA ""feels it can disregard the Court of Appeal’s declaration and final judgment and subsequently sanction this property is not acceptable and accentuates the urgency with which the planning laws need to be amended"".
 The rule of law should apply across the entire legislation including that of planning and environmental issues.
 They are calling for an urgent meeting with the Prime Minister and the planning minister to discuss the proposed amendments and set a timeframe.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/overnight-power-cut-hits-senglea.1097743,"Updated with Enemalta statement.
 Senglea residents were left without power on Friday night after a fault developed on a high voltage cable in the area. 
 The first outage hit at around 9pm on Friday. While power was restored for some residents less than an hour later, many others would spend the rest of the night without electricity. 
 Power started being restored to affected areas on Saturday morning. By around 9:45am power had been fully restored to Senglea, which this weekend celebrates the feast of The Nativity of Our Lady. 
 The outage occurred due to a fault developing on a high-tension cable, according to Enemalta's website.
 In comments posted to a Cottonera residents' Facebook group, one person said they had been left without power for 12 hours while others reported losing power around midnight. 
 Other residents in the area told Times of Malta they woke up in the middle of the night due to the heat, as air conditioners and fans were left without power. 
 Enemalta told Times of Malta that two high voltage cables suffered two separate faults affecting Cospicua and Senglea.
 ""Our teams were immediately dispatched and several substations were reconnected to the grid within minutes. However, three substation could not be connected until the faults were located and fixed. As a result, Enemalta’s teams worked on two fronts: on one hand, by using alternative sources of power, to power up the substations and on the other, dedicated teams kicked off on the fault location. Once the fault was identified, the laborious works started immediately. We are working round the clock so that these repair works as completed as soon as is technically possible.""
  This latest outage comes after a summer of sporadic power cuts across the country which, while not as bad as last year, left many residents and businesses fuming.
 Iklin and parts of Birkirkara and San Gwann suffered long power cuts on Friday night and Saturday. 
 Last week, Marsaxlokk residents and business owners told TImes of Malta they were becoming  increasingly frustrated after suffering repeated power cuts this summer. A week before that, Enemalta completed the  installation of a new 60-megawatt diesel-powered emergency power station.
 Enemalta says Malta has enough electricity to power the country and that the emergency facility will serve as backup should a main source of power fail. The company has however acknowledged problems with its distribution network, following years of chronic underinvestment

https://timesofmalta.com/article/identita-delays-mean-i-cannot-marry-church-legally-work-man.1101474,"A Ghanaian man and his Maltese partner, who have been together for seven years and entered a cohabitation agreement last year, have accused Identità of dragging its feet to issue a residence permit, which would allow him to work and them to get married in Church.
 Prince Kwadwo Asomah and Josephine Portelli filed a judicial protest, in the First Hall of the Civil Court, against state identity management agency Identità. They are calling on the authority to issue the residence and work permits according to law.
 “My partner deserves to work with dignity like other people who are married to a Maltese citizen. The same rules should apply to everyone equally,” Portelli said.
 Speaking to Times of Malta, Portelli explained that she met Asomah through social media when he was living in Italy. In 2019, he flew to Malta and continued their relationship.
 He was claiming refugee status – first in Italy and then in Malta. During that time, he was given a temporary work permit which he had to renew regularly. However, his refugee application was rejected and his work permit was revoked.
 In the meantime, the couple made plans to get married but could not get married in Church, as they wished to, as he did not have the necessary documents. Asomah even got baptised while living in Malta.
 So they entered a cohabitation agreement, under the Cohabitation Act, in July 2023.
 In the judicial protest, they noted that their cohabitation was recognised by Identità. According to cohabitation law, a cohabitant has the “same rights granted to a person who is married or in a civil union in terms of rights related to labour and family”.
 Last March, he applied for a residence permit and provided all the necessary documents. But still, the authority is dragging its feet and, as a result, he cannot exercise his right to work legally.
 They called on Identità to issue the documents or face further legal action.
 “What is causing the delay in issuing a residence permit card to a person in a stable and durable relationship when Identità had already recognised the relationship by issuing a cohabitation certificate? Is there something beyond? Perhaps a hidden policy to make it difficult for TCNs to get what is entitled to them by law as the Cohabitation Act does not make any distinction between who can enter into a cohabitation?” she said.
 Lawyer Analise Magri and legal procurator Mark Sultana signed the protest.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/byron-camilleri-welcomes-more-scrutiny-identita-racket-inquiry.1096694,"Home Affairs Minister Byron Camilleri said he is ""looking forward to more scrutiny"" after a magistrate upheld a request to hold an inquiry into an alleged scam involving the government's identity agency.
 The allegations revolve around Identità issuing Maltese ID cards to foreigners based on forged documents.
 On Tuesday afternoon, Camilleri - who is politically responsible for Identità - said the agency has always acted correctly by reporting illegalities to the police.
  ""When Identità, through its internal processes, found that something was done wrongly, it was the agency itself that reported the issue to the police,"" Camilleri said.
 Those reports led to court prosecutions and sentences, he added.
 ""People who say Identità did not take reports seriously are wrong because it was the entity itself that flagged and reported the cases to the police,"" he said.
 ""This does not mean we don't want more scrutiny; I am the first one to say that I look forward to more scrutiny. This is what is right, and anything that someone did wrongly should be investigated,"" Camilleri said.
 The Home Affairs Minister further stressed: ""For as long as I've been a minister, I have always made sure that justice was done; no one can say that I ever tried to hide anything.""
 Anyone against whom evidence of wrongdoing was found would have to answer to the courts, he added. 
 Lawyer Jason Azzopardi requested a magisterial inquiry two weeks ago in a sworn court application. 
 Azzopardi bases his claims on statements made by an anonymous man who attended VIP parties where the party's organiser bragged about how easy it was for her to get work permits for her workers through contacts at Identitá.
 She claimed these public officials were paid “large sums of money” or offered free invites to her parties where cocaine flowed “abundantly” and prostitutes mingled with distinguished guests.
 The parties were attended by politicians from both parliamentary parties, Azzopardi said. 
 Azzopardi claimed that since 2015, some 18,000 identity cards have been issued based on fake marriage certificates and that Identità officials have fabricated other documents.
 When asked about the 18,000 figure, Camilleri responded that the numbers given to him by Identità are ""completely different.""
 Asked to elaborate, Camilleri said more details will come from the investigation.
 When questioned about his silence on the issue when it first surfaced at the end of July, Camilleri maintained that he has always given comments when asked.
 Identità also released a statement following news of the inquiry, emphasizing its full cooperation with investigations. 
 The agency said it initiated an internal probe, which led to individuals being charged in court after passing all of its evidence to the police. 
 Identità said it maintains zero tolerance for abuse, committing to ongoing collaboration, including in the Magisterial Inquiry, to uphold public trust.
 Rule of law NGO Repubblika said in reaction that this saga has once again highlighted police inaction despite the public evidence that Azzopardi brought forward.
 This led him to seek a magisterial inquiry instead, they said. 
 They also said that the racket has put Malta's national security under threat as it means that authorities cannot know if the information displayed on ID documents is genuine or not. 
 Repubblika said the government has been systematically lying as fake ID cards have all been issued with false addresses.
"
https://timesofmalta.com/article/notaries-ordered-sign-identita-lease-form-verification-concerns.1097642,"The Notarial Council has ordered notaries not to sign a new Identità lease agreement form because the document does not guarantee that the signatures on a rental contract are genuine.
 As of this week, third-country nationals applying for residence need an attested lease agreement as part of their application process.
 The new measure, announced last week was designed to fight abuse of the system amid claims that thousands of ID cards were issued on the basis of forged documents. 
 Notaries, lawyers, and legal procurators are authorized to sign the Lease Agreement Attestation Form.
 But notaries are objecting because a form for the registration of the leases allows the possibility to attest the signatures without witnessing the signing, a spokesperson for the Notarial Council said.
  “Without witnessing the signature and assuring that the person signing the document is who they say they are, through an identification document there is no legal certainty,” the spokesperson said.
 The Notarial Council spokesperson said notaries can still attest lease agreements, but they should not sign the accompanying Identità form.
 It issued a directive on Wednesday saying: ""With immediate effect, the Notarial Council directs the Notarial College that the new form for the registration of leases, as issued by Identity Malta, should neither be signed nor filled out by the Notary until further notice,” the directive issued by the council to all of Malta’s notaries said.
 “The Notarial Council emphasizes that the legal certainty, which notaries are responsible for guaranteeing, must always be upheld,” the statement said.
 Notaries “should only sign a rental agreement if all parties have signed in their presence and provided identification via an identity card, driver’s license, or passport,” the council said in a statement.
 “The Notarial Council does not agree that notaries should sign documents presented to them already signed because, naturally, the notary cannot confirm the identity of the signatory, nor can they ensure that the document was truly signed by that person,” they said.
 They added that notaries cannot guarantee the title of a property without doing the related research.
 Tenants union Solidarjetà has also criticised the new measure, saying it is “rash and misguided” and further financial pressure on tenants because of the costs associated with verifying documents.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/how-malta-changed-five-trends-revealing-malta-changing-face.1095856,"A wide-ranging report published by Malta’s national statistics office gives a glimpse into Malta’s changing face, revealing how the country’s social and economic fabric has undergone a drastic transformation in just a few years.
 The report, the 2024 edition of Malta’s regional statistics, sheds light on a wide range of issues, from demographics to tourism, construction and poverty.
 We pored through the report’s endless tables to pick out five trends that show the extent of this transformation. 
 This is hardly surprising, given the government’s well-documented policy of attracting foreign workers to supplement Malta’s economy and plug gaps in the workforce.
 By the end of 2022, people between 30 and 49 made up roughly a third of the country’s total population.
 In Gozo alone, the number of people aged 30 to 39 shot up by 40% since 2017, going from just over 4,000 to more than 6,000. Meanwhile, Malta saw an increase of more than 20,000 people in this age group, an increase of almost a third since 2017.
 Other age groups – between 20 and 29, and from 40 to 49 – also saw dramatic, albeit lesser, increases.
 But so did the number of elderly people in the country, with the number of people between ages 70 and 79 up by over a quarter in both Malta and Gozo. Meanwhile, the number of youths and children has remained virtually unchanged.
 
 In practice, Malta’s migration patterns appear to be disguising the country’s ageing population.
 The same report reveals that Malta’s old-age dependency ratio (the number of persons over 65 or under 14 years old compared to those of working age between 15 and 64) has remained steady at around 27 since 2017, despite the huge boost in Malta’s working-age population.
 Even if we take migration out of the equation, Malta’s population is on the rise, albeit to a far lesser degree.
 Almost all towns across Malta and Gozo are seeing a natural increase in their population, even though this has slowed in recent years.
 The big exceptions? The southern harbour area, which includes the three cities, Żabbar, Paola and Valletta, amongst others. Gozo and Comino had negative natural population growth in 2021 and 2022.
 Here, the number of people dying far outnumbers those being born. While 634 people were born in the region in 2022, 1,109 died during the same year, meaning that there were almost 500 fewer people in these towns, excluding people who moved there.
 
 The region has been seeing a gradual decline in its native population for years, but this has ramped up drastically since 2020.
 Households’ disposable income has crept up steadily throughout the years, rising from an average of €27,500 in 2017 to nearly €35,000 in 2022.
 But income inequality across Malta’s different regions has risen even more sharply.
 Back in 2017, people across Malta’s six regions all had roughly similar amounts of disposable income, ranging from around €23,000 in Gozo to €29,500, with only households in Malta’s western towns (including Rabat, Siġġiewi and Żebbuġ) having over €30,000 in disposable income.
 Seven years on, things look markedly different. By 2017, households across all regions had seen their disposable income swell by at least €8,000, with households in southeastern towns (including Marsascala, Marsaxlokk, Żejtun and Birżebbuġa) seeing an even bigger €13,000 bump in their disposable income.
 But northern harbour towns (which include Sliema, Gżira, Msida, Ħamrun, Birkirkara and Qormi) have only seen a meagre €2,700 increase in disposable income.
 This inequality is reflected in the number of people at risk of poverty. While this has either dropped or only increased marginally across all regions, the number of people living below the poverty line in northern harbour towns has shot up.
 
 By 2022, over 36,000 people living in these towns, almost one in every four persons, was considered to be at risk of poverty. This figure was 22,500 (or 16%) in 2017.
 Malta’s construction boom could be slowing, if the number of building permits is an indication.
 At the height of the boom, in 2019, a little under 2,800 building permits were issued across Malta and Gozo. This effectively meant that almost 12,500 new dwellings were approved.
 By 2023 this had dipped by more than a third to 1,700 permits and 8,100 dwellings.
 These numbers first dropped during the pandemic year of 2020 but have remained relatively unchanged since, suggesting that this is more than just a Covid-related blip.
 
 But, while fewer buildings are being built, the number of dwellings in each building is inching upwards, suggesting that either the buildings are getting larger, or dwellings smaller.
 Back in 2017, each building permit housed four and a half dwellings, on average. By 2022 this had gone up to a little over five, before settling at a little under the five mark last year.
 The pandemic appears to have turned Gozo into a holiday destination for many Maltese, with the number of Maltese people travelling to their sister island shooting up when lockdowns were imposed in 2020 and remaining high ever since.
 While the 331,500 Maltese residents who holidayed in Gozo in 2022 is lower than both 2020 and 2021 (which topped 361,000), it is far higher than the 215,000 who visited the island in 2019, before the pandemic hit.
 Maltese visitors now make up some 72% of all tourists to Gozo and a little over half of the 1.8m bed nights spent on the island.
 
 But relatively fewer people are now choosing to stay in rented accommodation during their stay (whether it’s a hotel or a self-catering rental), with more and more people opting for “non-rented accommodation”.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/no-pakis-estate-agent-accidentally-publishes-internal-restriction.1096356,"A leading estate agent advertised a property with the warning “no Pakis, Indians, Arabs and Philippines” after accidentally publishing an “internal comment” instead of the property description, it has admitted.
 The comment described the landlord’s “restrictions” in respect to prospective tenants, a spokesperson for Alliance Real Estate said, stressing the company was obliged to enforce such restrictions.
 But restricting housing or any other goods or services based on nationality or skin colour is illegal, according to a prominent human rights lawyer.
 Apologising for the incident, the spokesperson said Alliance would change the wording of its internal comments to “kinder language”, adding no offence had been intended by its “colloquial tone”.
 A listing for a three-bedroom apartment in Żebbuġ appeared on the Alliance Real Estate website on Friday afternoon, later appearing on property aggregate website propertymarket.com.mt.
 Alongside a note explaining the property could be turned into a five-bedroom terraced house, the description also said: “no Pakis, Indians, Arabs and Philippines” (sic).
 The term ‘Paki’ is a derogatory term for a person from Pakistan that has also been used to contemptuously describe persons of other South Asian nationalities.
 The listing had been removed from propertymarket.com.mt by Sunday afternoon and the listing on the Alliance website was edited yesterday morning to remove the reference.
 A spokesperson for Alliance said the description had appeared when an “internal comment” by the company had been published by mistake.
  “Unfortunately, the reality is that it is not uncommon for landlords to impose restrictions on the types of tenants they would accept living in their properties and we, obviously, have to abide by these specifications,” she said.
 “Some owners decide to restrict certain cultures, nationalities or ages of tenants, others may decide to restrict all pets or certain types of pets.”
 The spokesperson said that, in Alliance’s database, “we have an internal comments section where these specifications are listed so that property advisers do not need to check with the landlord every time.
 “Unfortunately, what happened in this case was that the internal comments were incorrectly entered in the wrong place, and these were published on the advert instead of the actual description.”
 She said the company had implemented a “stronger internal approval process” and changed the wording it used internally to “kinder language when it comes to this kind of restriction, even though this is not intended to be public”.
 Neil Falzon, director of human rights NGO Aditus, said restricting access to housing based on nationality is against the law.
 “Maltese law is crystal clear: anyone refusing to offer a service to a person simply on the basis of their skin colour, nationality or origin is breaking the law... the law requires you to treat people with decency and respect,” he said.
 “Anyone seeing these ads should report them at once and the property owners should be punished and shamed,” he said, calling for more enforcement of equality legislation.
 Propertymarket.com.mt distanced itself from the listing, saying the listings on its website reflected those on the websites of estate agents.
 “Whatever is on their website appears on our site... we take these things seriously, but our website just replicates listings,” a spokesperson for the company said.
 “We do review listings, but this one slipped through the net,” he said, stressing the property had been removed from the company’s website “within an hour” of appearing online.
 Tenants of a Sliema apartment shared by around 40 foreign workers said in June last year that, though while they wanted to find alternative accommodation, “most people don’t rent to an Indian or someone from Bangladesh”.
 They said such attitude restricted their choice of housing, often forcing them to rent cramped accommodation similar to the property in Sliema.
 “Everywhere we go, we get shown apartments that look like this… lots of places like Qormi and Buġibba, the situation is the same.”
"
https://timesofmalta.com/article/cab-fleets-skirting-new-hire-ban-temporary-permits.1098423,"Cab fleets have found a way to temporarily hire new third-country national drivers despite a government policy that rejects new work permit applications in the industry.
 The fleets do this by acquiring a temporary work permit, commonly known as a “blue paper,” for their new hired personnel who are already based in Malta. Third-country nationals (TCNs) are from outside the EU.
 Among the fleets actively employing new drivers is a company partly owned by former economy minister Chris Cardona and another company owned by Gozitan businessman Mark Agius.
 In July, the government said new applications by third-country nationals for cab driving and food courier work permits were being turned down because the market had “reached saturation”.
 The Home Affairs Ministry had said this applied to people abroad seeking a job here and those already in Malta who were changing their employer. Those applying to renew their permit with the same employer are being accepted.
 But while waiting for a decision on whether to approve or reject a new work permit application, Identità’s policy is to issue the “blue paper” when a third-country national is already working in Malta and is applying to either renew their permit with their current employer or changing their employer.
 Therefore, employees engaged with a new employer are allowed to legally work at their new job until a final decision is taken or the temporary permit expires after two months.
 A joint statement by Identità and JobsPlus said authorities have not issued any work permits for new applications in the cab industry, adding that it was the agency’s practice to issue the “blue paper”.
 “As with any other workers, TCNs applying for a change of employer application are provided with an interim receipt, commonly known as the ‘blue paper’, a procedure that has been in place for many years. This document is revoked once a final decision regarding their application is made.”
 The policy was introduced to allow workers already based in Malta to continue working and earning a salary while waiting for Identità’s decision.
 “Agius Trading” is one fleet that has been actively employing drivers since the government announced the policy change. The company is owned by Mark Agius, known by many as ‘Ta’ Dirjanu’, and his siblings Joseph and Maria.
 Agius is a close business partner of Gozitan mega-developer Joseph Portelli. 
 Replying to questions, a spokesperson for Agius Trading said the company has been forced to employ workers using temporary work permits to keep operations going.
 “Agius Trading owns 200 cabs and, like other cab companies, is facing serious challenges in the industry due to an overnight change in regulations,” the spokesperson said.
 They said the company’s policy has always been to employ drivers already in Malta who may wish to change employers for better rates.
 “However, the government has even stopped allowing ‘change of employer’ applications in this industry, which effectively puts us in the same dilemma as those who bring foreign workers from abroad for this industry,” the spokesperson said.
 “The only thing the government is allowing at the moment is for Identità to give two-month temporary work permits until it concludes its labour study and charts a way forward for the industry.
 ""Therefore, yes, cab drivers who are being employed with Agius Trading and other cab companies today are doing so on this ‘blue paper’, a temporary work permit that expires after two months.
 “This is obviously not an ideal way to plan your career or business, but this is the situation facing cab drivers and employers in Malta today.”
 IWS Global Limited, a company jointly owned by Chris Cardona and his business partner Matthias Vidergold, have also been actively hiring new employees.
 Times of Malta listened to phone calls between IWS representatives and TCNs who expressed interest in joining the company as drivers.
 IWS representatives confirmed they are actively hiring drivers in the calls.
 The caller asked if he should worry about the new government policy and if he would be impacted by the policy on the cab industry, but the IWS representative said he would not.
 IWS told the caller to tell any of his friends to apply with the company as well, either as cab drivers or food couriers.
 “Feel free to share my email with your colleagues,” the representative said, adding that the company “does not have a limit on the number of people they will hire”.
 In another call Times of Malta listened to, IWS confirmed that the company is hiring cab drivers, adding that Identità is likely to approve the application.
 “If you are eligible and you fulfil the criteria for the vacancy, ID Malta will not fail to give it to you,” another IWS representative told another caller.
 “If you have everything according to law, I don’t see why they will refuse your file or have any rejection.”
 The IWS representative said that the government is accepting applications for drivers who are changing their employers but remain in the industry.
 Identità sources confirmed this is not the case.
 Replying to questions specifically about IWS, Identità and JobsPlus confirmed that no work permits for cab drivers or food couriers were issued to IWS.
 “Like many other companies, IWS applied to employ workers in this sector; however, as with other fleet operators, no permit was granted. Identità and JobsPlus have issued various refusals, while other applications are still under review.”

https://timesofmalta.com/article/dog-owners-take-part-charity-walk-around-mater-dei-memory-jake-vella.1102491,"Dog owners and their furry friends took part in a charity walk around Mater Dei hospital on Sunday morning in honour of the late Jake Vella.
 Jake was just 15 when he died in August after a long battle with an extremely rare condition that caused him to gain weight rapidly despite eating healthily and training regularly.
 The teenager was an animal lover and received full-time care at Mater Dei during the last two years of his life, one marked by continued charity work.
 Sunday's walk in aid of the Association of Abandoned Animals (AAA) was the third annual 'Paw Walk' but the first to take place without Jake.
  Despite the cloudy and rainy weather, the entrance to Mater Dei Hospital was alive with the sound of excited dogs as the group prepared to get underway.
 Shortly before the walk began, an officer from the 'K-9' police dog unit marched to stand to attention in front of a banner of Jake before performing a salute – along with his dog. The officer later presented a Christmas card including a picture of Jake to his parents, Josie and Maruska Vella.
 Following words from Jake’s parents, Winter Moods singer Ivan Grech led a performance of Maltese favourite Xemx joined by those present.
 Speaking to Times of Malta, Jake’s mother Marouska said the pair were “very happy that despite the bad weather people came to join us” while thanking those in attendance for their “continuous support.”
  Commenting on Jake’s posthumous honour at Friday's 50th anniversary Republic Day celebrations, Jake’s father Josie said it was a surprise for the family, but that Jake deserved the award.
 ""We are very proud that our son, after his death, was honoured for Gieħ Ir-Repubblika... we think Jake was the youngest person to get the award in the past 10 years,” he said.
 Speaking about her son’s absence, Jake's mother said it was “not easy that Jake is not with us during these moments, but we are proud that what Jake started, we will continue.”
 Describing the event as Jake’s “dream”, she added the family intended to continue holding the walk every year.
 “We wish a good Christmas and New Year to the public. And we thank Malta and Gozo for all their support for our son.""
  Like last year, Sunday’s walk was in aid of the Organisation for Abandoned Animals (AAA), an NGO dog shelter in Birżebbuġa.
 AAA sanctuary manager Rosalind Agius said the walk “means a lot to us and is very helpful,” explaining the funds raised would go towards the upkeep of the centre.
 Paying tribute to the late teenager, she said ""Jake collected thousands for us every year and that’s a lot for anyone, let alone a young boy.""
 Walkers were joined by culture minister Owen Bonnici and fisheries junior minister Alicia Bugeja Said, with well-known animal activist and TV presenter Moira Delia and athlete Fabio Spiteri also in attendance.
 Describing Jake’s death as “heartbreaking,” attendee Laetitia Agius – a friend of the Vella family – said she joined the walk alongside her husband and son to honour Jake’s memory and to encourage others to join in.
 Dog owner Alison Caruana said she joined the walk to help contribute to animal causes, adding it was her second time joining the annual event.
 Organiser Joanna Mallia said, ""Jake loved animals, that's why we're doing this; We try to keep his memory alive.""
  Jake's neurological condition, known as Rapid-onset Obesity with Hypothalamic Dysfunction, Hypoventilation and Autonomic Dysregulation (ROHHAD), affects mostly children and there are only around 100 confirmed cases of it worldwide.
 The exact cause of ROHHAD remains unknown and research on it is inconclusive, though it is suspected to be linked to a combination of environmental and genetic factors.
 No specific gene has yet been identified as causing the condition, however.
 His death earlier this year provoked an outpouring of grief, with public figures including Prime Minister Robert Abela, his wife Lydia and European President Roberta Metsola among those to pay tribute to the late teenager.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/families-migrant-children-regularised-children-commissioner.1097240,"The children’s commissioner has urged the government and its authorities to exercise caution when considering the deportation of migrant children and their families.
 In a statement on Monday, the Office of the Commissioner for Children said was “closely following” media reports of families facing deportation after living in Malta for years.
 On Saturday, Times of Malta reported the Ethiopian community was “ living in fear” after dozens of Ethopian nationals had been rounded up by police and sent back to Ethopia, despite living and working legally in Malta for up to 19 years.
 Calling for caution in the treatment of migrant children and their families, the commissioner said migrants who had settled in Malta and integrated into Maltese society “should be given a more definite and permanent status”.
 This was important to allow children to access their rights as prescribed by the United Nations (UN), including the right to education, the commissioner said.
 “Children who are born here, irrespective of their status, only know Malta as their home and therefore we believe that it is in the best interest of these migrant children for the status of the entire family unit to be regularised,” the commissioner said.
 It said such protection ""safeguards the children’s fundamental right to a family life.""
 The commissioner called for such regularisation to be extended to ""migrant children born in other countries but who have settled and integrated here whether or not they enjoy international protection.”
 ""No child should be made to live in fear of deportation; they have a right to live in a safe and secure environment”, the commissioner said.
 One Ethopian national told Times of Malta his community was being ""treated like criminals, like animals” and said he feared authorities knocking at his door.
 He said he was left scared after five of his friends were arrested at work and taken into detention following their application for refugee status being rejected.
 Until recently, they had temporary protection status and had a yellow book that allowed them to work legally. Some even had their own businesses.
 Responding to questions last week, the home affairs ministry said persons arriving in Malta irregularly who do not qualify for international protection are offered a voluntary return package.
 “If they refuse the voluntary return scheme, they are then subject to forced return, depending on the level of cooperation by the country of origin”, a ministry spokesperson said.
 The spokesperson added that actions taken affecting the Ethiopian community were in line with an EU decision to step up readmission efforts with the country following an assessment carried out by the European Commission.
 In January, migrants and activists took to the streets of Ħamrun and Valletta calling for policy changes that would grant migrants and their children born in Malta residency, social rights and stability.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/footballer-hugh-caruana-dies-aged-78.1097174,"Renowned former footballer, veteran broadcaster and local councillor Hugh Caruana died on Friday. He was 78 years old. 
 Caruana is best known for playing for Ġżira and Floriana during the 1960s and 1970s, later transitioning to coaching and presenting sports television programmes. 
 Caruana was born on April 22, 1946, in Ġżira and made his debut with Ġżira United in the second division when he was 16 years old, in a match against Mosta. 
  Several clubs expressed interest in Caruana at the start of his career, with rumours that he was going to be snatched up by Sliema Wanderers FC.
 However, in a surprising twist, Caruana ended signing with Floriana FC instead. Caruana was an immediate star with Floriana and played there for six seasons, winning two championships and two FA Trophies. 
 He would later leave Floriana and join Sliema in 1970. Despite only being with the club for a short time, Caruana saw the club win another two championships in his three seasons there. 
 He retired from playing professional football in 1974. 
 News of Caruana's death sparked several tributes, including from the Nationalist Party, for which he served as a local councillor.
 Last June, Caruana was once again elected to the Ġżira local council on the PN's ticket. 
 ""Hugh Caruana, aside from his illustrious sports career was a local councillor for the PN and until last June continued to work with a lot of love for Ġżira and the Nationalist Party"" the party said in a statement. 
 Christian Micallef, one of Caruana's former colleagues on the sports show Replay, said Caruana was a ""jokester with a heart of gold"". 
 ""My mind wanders back to the pleasant memories Hugh and I shared, particularly on the programme Replay,"" he said. 
  In a tribute post, Floriana FC said Caruana was one of the club's ""icons"". 
 ""Hugh Caruana left an indelible mark on our club's rich history both as a player and as a coach as his legacy will last forever in our hearts,"" they said. 
  Sliema Wanderers added that Caurana would always be remembered for the role he played in winning the club three consecutive Premier League titles in the early 2000s while serving as an assistant coach.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/activists-demonstrate-cycle-exploitation-dairy-industry.1094337,"Animal rights activists took to the streets of Valletta on Saturday in a theatrical demonstration against commercial dairy production.  
 Three female activists from Animal Liberation Malta could be seen wearing pumps attached to their breasts and holding up placards with slogans including “dairy is scary”, ”milk is not human(e)” and ""not your mother, not your milk”. 
 The protest took place at the Triton Fountain just outside the city gates, where activists demonstrated wearing chains, numbered ear tags and were smeared in fake blood. 
 The pumps worn by the female activists were connected by pipes to containers of what appeared to be milk, in symbolic reference to the commercial milking of cows and other animals used to produce dairy products.
 In a statement, Animal Liberation Malta said the “entire dairy industry is based on the exploitation of the reproduction system,” describing the collection of semen from bulls and subsequent artificial insemination of female cows “sexual abuse” and “rape”.
 Activists pointed to the slaughter of male calves and repeated impregnation of female cows as evidence of the “cycle of exploitation” they said defined the dairy industry.
  Attacking the tactics of the industry, Animal Liberation Malta said that while milk consumption was in “sharp decline globally, the dairy industry keeps growing by constantly pushing subsidised milk to be included in more and more products, even those that traditionally did not include any dairy.”
 Noting that “humans are the only animals that continuously consume milk from other animals and continue to consume milk throughout their lives,” the group urged the public to consider dairy-free alternatives.
 “Animal Liberation Malta highlights the fact that there is a compassionate, cruelty-free alternative to animal milk that is plant-based. Furthermore, plant-based milk is more environmentally friendly and natural to drink than milk from other species.”
 Activists from fellow animal rights group Anonymous for the Voiceless also took part in the protest.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/maltapost-introduces-card-payments-branches.1093061,"Card payments are finally being accepted for certain services in MaltaPost branches, the country’s national postal service has confirmed.
 Customers can now pay for stamps, stationery and postal fees by credit or debit card in branches across the country. 
 The change will be welcomed by customers who have long complained about being forced to pay with cash. 
 However, while certain services can now be paid for by card, bill payments, Western Union transfers, mobile phone top-ups and ‘One-4-All’ gift vouchers will remain cash-only. 
 When Times of Malta visited MaltaPost branches in St Julian’s and Birżebbuġa on Saturday, both confirmed they had started offering card payments recently. 
 When contacted, a spokesperson for the company said the roll-out of card payments had started late last year and had been completed in the last week.
 Asked why card payments had not been introduced sooner, the spokesperson said there had been “valid commercial reasons” for the delay, stressing it did not make business sense to do so earlier.
  Describing criticism of the company for not offering card payments sooner as “unfair”, the spokesperson said the company had eventually decided to “take the plunge”, however.
 He added that unlike other organisations such as banks, MaltaPost had retained all of its branches after the COVID-19 pandemic and was committed to “retaining a presence in the heart of the community.”
 
 He said the company operated around 40 post offices and an additional 20 sub-post offices across Malta and employed around 300 postal delivery workers nationwide.
 A report published last month found most MaltaPost users are satisfied with the services provided by the postal company and would even be willing to pay extra for stamps if the company used that money for green initiatives.
 A survey carried out by the communications regulator late last year showed that 72% of respondents said they were satisfied or very satisfied with the country’s postal service.
 Meanwhile, just 15% of respondents said they had lodged complaints with MaltaPost, compared to the high 34% complaint rate registered in a similar survey in 2021.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/broadcasting-authority-tells-critics-didn-t-read-law-rtk-decision.1097167,"The Broadcasting Authority has hit back at critics lambasting it for fining a radio station that refused to give a platform to a far-right group, saying that its detractors ""haven't read the law"". 
 On Wednesday the BA fined RTK 103 €4,660 for refusing to give a platform to the far-right party Imperium Europa on Andrew Azzopardi's Saturday morning radio show. 
 The party was founded by and is led by Norman Lowell, who has been convicted by Maltese courts of inciting racial hatred. 
 RTK 103 has said it will be appealing the decision, while groups such as PEN Malta and the IĠM have come out in support of the radio station and criticised the BA's decision. 
 PEN Malta said that through its decision the BA had ""legitimised racism as a political view"" while the IĠM called the decision ""nonsensical"" and that racism ought not to be protected by state authorities. 
 However, in reply to the backlash, the BA said on Friday that it ""follows the law, interprets the law as it is and enacts what is in the law"". 
 ""It is clear that what was broadcast across several media platforms shows that those reporting and criticising did not read the law in the context of the decision and didn’t read the decision in its entirety,"" they said. 
 The authority said that its decision never spoke about giving space to any candidates of any party, including those from Imperium Europa, as the law speaks about ""viewpoints"" and not about candidates. 
 ""Therefore every observation and criticism should be oriented towards this context,"" they said. 
 The BA added that the board's secretary has no decision-making role within the board and that it is not true that the secretary refused to recuse himself. 
 The board secretary, Adriano Spiteri, was until recently an active member of Imperium Europa. 
 ""The authority denies that the secretary did not want to recuse himself but it was the board which decided about the request for his recusal, a fact which is also listed in the decision,"" they said.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/in-pictures-how-geo-fuerst-saw-early-sailing-vessels-malta.1097487,"I must, at the outset, disclose my partiality for Geo Fürst, the German camera artist and painter who made Malta his home in the inter-war years and who raised photography to unprecedented heights. I published a book about him and his work, and I cherish his personal album in which he pasted a copy of every postcard he marketed. Or thought he did – I found a few he missed placing in it.
 Fürst (1888-1964) came to Malta to work as secretary in the German consulate and married a Maltese lady. During World War I, the British interned him as an enemy alien and he picked up painting and photography in the Verdala prisoner-of-war camps. After the hostilities, he came back to Malta as a professional photographer, artist and postcard publisher, until the eve of WWII, when he was denied permission to return to the island.
  As an artist, he mostly painted sailing ships – clippers, cutters, galleons, schooners. In photography, he widened his interests, though the sea remained his consuming love. Fürst scoured the harbours, shooting sailing vessels and warships with his Agfa camera, to the point that he raised alarming suspicion of being a Nazi spy. Though he admired Hitler openly, it is unlikely he worked for German espionage – after the war, Lord Mountbatten warmly encouraged his return to Malta.
  Fürst’s affinity to sails translated into a vast output of postcards in which sailing vessels strike a lyrical note. I have, very randomly, chosen a few from the many. No other camera artist, before or after him, had captured the wedding of the winds and the waters with such poetry as Fürst did in the 1930s.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/moas-marks-10-years-saving-lives.1097187,"An NGO that launched the first privately-funded migrant search and rescue operation in the Mediterrnean turns 10 this month.
 MOAS, or the Migrant Offshore Aid Station, says it has rescued over 200,000 people around the world since it first began operations in August 2014.
 Having initially focused on aid missions in the Mediterranean, MOAS has since expanded to provide support in the Aegean Sea, Bangladesh and now Ukraine, where it medically evacuates severely wounded patients from the war’s frontline.
 Ten years since MOAS’ inception I look back with admiration at all we have achieved, but I also know that we still have much to do, and we need to continue to forge ahead if we are to have the greatest impact possible in the field,” said founder Christopher Catrambone.“On this our 10
 MOAS began operating in the Mediterranean with its flagship vessel the Phoenix. It would rescue over 40,000 people from the sea in the ensuing three years. Before long, other NGO-led sea rescue operations were following its lead.
 In 2017, the organisation shifted its focus to Bangladesh, where Rohingya refugees were making their way after fleeing Myanmar. MOAS established field clinics in refugee camps and delivered food aid. The NGO says it aided over 90,000 people there and has trained over 12,000 volunteers in Bangladesh to respond to weather emergencies and fire hazards.
 The NGO has also delivered food aid and medical supplies to Yemen, Somalia and Sudan.
 During the COVID-19 pandemic, it shifted to producing and distributing face masks: almost 900,000 masks were distributed in Bangladesh and around 10,000 in Malta.
  The NGO maintains a Malta link through various education and integration projects it runs for migrants and asylum seekers.
 Since the Ukraine conflict outbreak in 2022, MOAS has worked with 150 medical professionals and a fleet of 50 ambulances to rescue and treat the war wounded. It says it has saved 45,000 lives and treated over 30,000 patients through its Mobile Medical Unit, in collaboration with Ronald McDonald House Charities Latvia.
 The NGO has also launched a book, “Sirens of Hope”, that delves deeper into its Ukraine work as part of a series of activities to commemorate its 10th year in operation.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/church-organisations-call-detained-ethiopians-released-immediately.1097370,"Updated 4pm 
 The Ethiopian nationals who are being detained and facing deportation after having lived and worked legally in Malta for years should be released immediately, the Migrants Commission, the Justice and Peace Commission and JRS Malta urged the authorities.
 The two commissions, which form part of the Archdiocese of Malta, and JRS Malta issued a joint statement in which they “wholeheartedly condemned” the recent arrest of several Ethiopian nationals, who were rounded up, detained and told they would be sent back to Ethiopia.
 
 They called on all Members of Parliament, especially the Social Affairs Committee, to convene and discuss this matter with urgency so that, in collaboration with civil society organisations, they could find a solution that respected individual rights and safeguarded every member of our society.
 In a separate call, 38 civil society organisations urged the government to regularise the position of people whom it had allowed to make Malta their home. 
 Last week Times of Malta reported how the  Ethiopian community is “in shock” and “living in fear” as a number of people who have been living and working legally in Malta for up to 19 years, were being arrested at their place of work.
 At least five were arrested and sent to detention and told they would be sent back to Ethiopia. 
 They were told that their application for refugee status had been rejected. Until now, they had temporary protection status and had a yellow book that allowed them to work legally. Some even had their own businesses and started a family.
 The children’s commissioner has urged the government and its authorities to exercise caution when considering the deportation of migrant children and their families.
 Lawyers who work with migrants said that, whenever people of a particular nationality are rounded up, it typically means that a delegation from that country is on the way to Malta.
 The delegation would typically include government officials who would facilitate deportation by providing travel documents after verifying the origin of the people in detention.
 The Home Affairs Ministry said persons arriving in Malta irregularly who do not qualify for international protection are offered a voluntary return package.
 “If they refuse the voluntary return scheme, are then subject to forced return, depending on the level of cooperation by the country of origin. The Ethiopian nationals you are referring to have been detained in order to safeguard their return to Ethiopia, following positive signals from the Ethiopian authorities related to cooperation on the safe readmission of their own nationals,” the ministry said, adding that this course of action follows a decision at EU level to step up readmission efforts with Ethiopia following an assessment carried out by the European Commission.
 But many criticised the method used. Katrine Camilleri, from JRS Malta, said: ""Picking up people from their homes and workplaces, or from the streets, without notice, and locking them up, often for weeks, until they can meet a visiting delegation who will interview them, determine whether they are nationals, and decide whether to issue the documents required to send them back, is a horribly painful and humiliating process for the people involved.”
  She said that these people have not committed any crime - on the contrary many worked legally and paid tax and social security contributions.
 “They are treated like criminals, handcuffed every time they need to leave the facility where they are being held, and deprived of all control over their lives. Even if they are not sent back, they risk losing their job, or having their rent contract revoked, because they cannot work or pay rent while they are in detention. If they are sent, they are deprived of the opportunity to sort out their affairs with dignity, because it is impossible to do that from the confines of a detention centre…
 ""Given the harm that detention causes, and the inherent harshness and violence of this course of action, even where it is in accordance with the law, it is impossible not to ask whether there is a more humane way of dealing with people, using deprivation of liberty only as a measure of last resort where there is truly no other option,” she said.
 In the joint statement, the Church in Malta urged the authorities to create realistic pathways to regularisation for these Ethiopians and other individuals. 
 “We consider these recent actions to be unjust, indiscriminate and cruel and call upon the government to immediately release these individuals and to regularise their position,” the entities said.
 The three entities said these Ethiopians were being targeted under the pretext of having come to Malta irregularly to seek asylum, which at the time was not granted. Despite this, most spent years living and working with the knowledge and authorisation of the authorities, who granted them employment licences, and residence permits.  
  Over the years they have contributed to society and become an integral part of the community, paying their taxes and social solidarity contributions.
 “They are valued and trained employees, whose experience will be hard to replace. They are our neighbours, our colleagues, our friends, the people who greet us in the street, who care for our elderly relatives, and cleaned our hospital wards during the COVID-19 pandemic,” the entities said.
 These incidents are the latest in a series of raids, which saw the lives of tens of migrants who had made Malta their home upended without warning and locked up so that preparations could be made to send them to their country of origin, they said.
 Beyond the impact such actions had on these persons, it created a climate of fear and insecurity for members of society who over the past years contributed to everyone’s well-being.
 ""These actions are constant reminders by the State of how easily it can arbitrarily and indiscriminately trample over all the accomplishments these members of society achieved through their hard work and sacrifices,"" they said.
 In a statement on Thursday afternoon, 38 civil society groups, university faculties and writers urged the government to regularise people whom the government allowed to make Malta their home.
 ""The five arrested men have had their lives uprooted without any warning. They were forced to leave their jobs, homes, friendships, and belongings behind.
 ""Within minutes, their lives were rewound as they were taken away to the same place where they had first encountered Malta so many years ago: a detention centre. There, procedures are underway to send them back to a country they barely know, where their support system may be non-existent, and where they may be at risk of harm.""
 This has had a ""devastating impact"" not only on the arrested people but on whole communities, including neighbours, colleagues, partners, schoolmates and friends.
 ""They are one of us and Malta is also their home. We appeal to the government to create a pathway to regularisation for these and other rejected asylum-seekers who have lived and worked in Malta for years with the authorisation of the competent authorities.""
 They said something similar had been done in other EU states.
 They urged the government to release the Ethiopian detainees, and people of good will to stand against the inhumane practice of rounding up people who have built their lives here and have become, in more ways than one, part of who we are.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/in-pictures-landmarks-outside-valletta-no.1096311,"These weekly pictorial essays have so far only covered prominent landmarks in Valletta and Gozo that no longer grace cityscapes and panoramas. But the rest of the island has not been spared time’s erosion of its history. A number of its foremost structures had to pay the ultimate price to real or perceived progress.
  The unrelenting blitz of World War II, besides Valletta, targeted mercilessly the three antique harbour cities and their surroundings, like Marsa and Kalkara, and the exigencies of defence sacrificed other outstanding edifices, like Gourgion palace, in Gozo, and Chateau Bertrand, in Ta’ Qali.
  Genuine progress in transport and communications found no way of saving the narrow baroque entrances to fortified cities. Not one single decorated gate of Valletta of the knights has survived – all demolished.
  Same for Floriana. Porte des Bombes has suffered modifications at least five times, to render it unrecognisable. 
  And the massive Notre Dame and St Anne’s gates had to be obliterated, to facilitate the flow of traffic.
 And we must mercifully overlook the ‘accidental’ collision by a service truck that destroyed the original Fleur-de-Lys gate that was slowing down heavy military vehicles.
  Malta never took on board with genuine passion art nouveau architecture, like Vienna, Prague, Turin or Budapest had done, becoming world shrines for the new aesthetic. But Sliema did put in some effort to catch up in the first quarter of the 20th century. Creditable landmarks stood out, with refined art nouveau detailing, like Casa Said, the Chalet and the Meadowbank Hotel, among others. 
  Apart from Balluta Buildings, in St Julian’s and the Lombard Bank branch, in Tower Road, virtually all the others have been razed to the ground, to make way for fletsijiet u penthowsis with a sea view.
  This is the fifth feature about prominent landmarks that somehow define Malta and that, for a variety of reasons, have now gone missing.
 My final two-part series documents instances, outside Valletta and Gozo, of what Malta has lost. Some vanished in World War II but the robust contributions of insensitive reconstruction and of ‘development by metastasis’, should never be underestimated. It’s only fair to credit where credit is due.
  This, to some, may sound like nostalgia for fuddy duddies. But Malta was never another of the hundreds of odd islands dotting the Mediterranean. 
 The neolithic people and the Order of St John had imprinted on it a unique, unrepeatable and spectacular cultural profile, which made it outshine every other small detached land mass in Europe. Without them, Malta would have been another forgettable Pantelleria or Lampedusa.
  So why this hysterical rush to inter our main claims to civility? Several neolithic sites, like Corradino, were destroyed by deliberate vandalism or institutional neglect.
 The systems of fortifications left by the Order (like the impressive Valletta lines outside city gate), which are absolutely unique in Europe for might and elegance, have frequently and joyfully been flattened out, a lust that failed to spare even British fortifications like the Victoria Lines and the forts excavated in the bowels of cliff masses.
  The Vandals ravaged the rest of Europe in the fifth century AD. They postponed their conquest of Malta to a later date. 
 Are these vanished landmarks just the tip of the iceberg? That would be an exaggeration. But I only illustrated losses of which I had photographs in my collections.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/in-pictures-everyday-life-malta-world-war-ii.1093627,"Our islands claim to have been the most intensely bombed country during World War II. Military Malta was probably also one of the most photographed.
  Compatibly with security defence regulations, which banned camera use in public spaces, authorised photographers recor­ded thousands of images of warfare – armed personnel, dogfights, maritime convoys, demolition units, anti-aircraft gunnery, military sports. You name it. These have, justly, found their place in many published war memoirs.
  The same cannot be said of images of everyday life in wartime. Very few photographs seem to have been taken or to have survived – a rarity indeed. 
 We know that, more or less, life of the inhabitants went on, notwithstanding the daily bombings, the dangers, destructions, racketeers, famines, terrors, underground shelters, epidemics and black markets. But we know this mostly through written and oral tradition, not through visual representations. 
  I thought it my duty to put together as many images as possible of civilian life in Malta under the blitz and to break my rule of limiting any one subject to just one self-contained feature. In this special case, I intend to spread my collection over two or three instalments. I trust readers will agree that it would be unsociable to hide rare historic treasures, many never published before.
  The quality of the images will vary. Some come from scans of pristine real photographs while others are copies I had lifted from rare printed publications. Most of the people who appear in them have passed, with possible exceptions of some of the youngest children.
  I salute the ‘natives’ and celebrate their memories, their endurance, resilience and stoicism. Without them, Malta’s survival against murderous Nazism and fanatical Fascism would have been unthinkable.
   I have already commented on the abundance of wartime photographs of military activities and on the scarcity of images of the everyday life of the people besieged. The same imbalance scars most of the written memoirs of Malta’s battles for survival. Countless narratives, the majority by British authors, record the terrible war years, with candour, with vainglory, with chilling humour, with defiance.
  But most of the storytellers leave the impression of having won the war in a country virtually devoid of any indigenous population. The Maltese, if at all, feature only as background noise, unsuitable for the loud festival of British self-congratulation.
  To learn how we natives lived the second world war, narratives by local authors have to be tapped; to mention some who come to mind: Philip Vella, Charles J. Boffa, Michael Galea, Joseph Micallef and Charles B. Grech. Their testimonies remains invaluable. Ernle Bradford too has an excellent and sympathetic account but not as an eyewitness. 
  The only outstanding British narrative of Malta in the second world conflict in which the Maltese figure as major players remains the one by Stewart Perowne, author, historian and diplomat. What a breath of honest fresh air to find a member of the British intelligence services, no less, paying a grovelling tribute to the faultless Maltese wartime internees and deportees to Uganda and castigating the colonialist abuses they suffered, already amply denounced by His Majesty’s judges before him.
  I am today publishing a second batch of photographs of ‘ordinary’ life during an extraordinarily cruel siege. Nothing boldly heroic, nothing epic – just images of struggles for survival, of the ability to adjust to adversity, to meet death as routine and the exceptional as normality.
   More images of beleaguered Malta struggling for survival against lethal odds during the Fascist and Nazi blitz. Torrents of bombs conspired with famine and malnutrition, with dearth of fuel and nasty epidemics to cheat life, not of glamour but of hope.
  Some memories stick out more than others – the ubiquitous rationing of virtually everything, from foodstuffs to clothing, from toys to cosmetics, from petrol to cigarettes, from overseas postal services to radios.
  The precious ‘ration book’, the exorbitant black market, hand-me-down clothing, the town and village Victory kitchens that doled out inedible gruel that claimed some remote acquaintance with goats’ meat, over which interminable queues squabbled, and the governor proudly on air to announce a handful of beans as a Christmas bonus.
  And then the epidemics; some the results of chronic malnutrition. Waves of scabies, scarlet fever, rickets, bubonic plague, scurvy, infestations of lice, infantile paralysis, substitute medicines and the first mentions of mysterious antibiotics.
  New crimes appeared on the official statute book – listening to enemy radio, hoarding edibles, unauthorised photography, black marketeering, harbouring draft dodgers and visible lights at nighttime. And the unofficial ones too, like speaking Italian, defeatist propaganda, humming Italian opera or driving German cars. Other laws seem to have been suspended: Italian and German pilots parachuting from stricken enemy planes routinely lynched on landing; no prosecutions are recorded.
  Any life that could shifted underground. At first, huge communal shelters like disused railway tunnels or basements of large public buildings turned into makeshift dormitories, before private rock dugouts became widespread.
 
 Daily and nightly, the besieged cooked, gossiped, played, slept, prayed and made love in the bowels of the earth, while the Macchis and the Junkers pranced overhead.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/former-paralympian-praises-stranger-act-kindness-car-breakdown.1097923,"A former Paralympian has taken to social media to underline how a small act of kindness can go a long way after a stranger went out of his way to help him change his tyre.
 On Tuesday evening, Thomas Borg was driving home when he hit a pothole, which tore his tyre in the Ta’ Kandja area of Siġġiewi.
 The 22-year-old sales representative and former Paralympian, who participated in the Tokyo 2020 Games, pulled over and began fixing the tyre.
 It was a slow process for Borg, who was born without a right forearm.
 In the 30 minutes it took him to lift the car, hundreds of cars drove past.
 “All of a sudden a food delivery man pulled up next to me on a motorcycle,” he told Times of Malta.
 The driver was Hajat from Pakistan, who had just finished his shift and told Borg he wanted to help him. Hajat lifted the car, replaced the tyre and packed everything back once he was done. 
 “While he was working, we began chatting, and he told me about his life, how life is difficult back in Pakistan, and how he tries to help his family by sending money back to them,” he said. 
 The pair spoke about life in Malta, different cultures and what unites them.
  Borg was moved by Hajat's kindness and willingness to help a stranger. 
 “Just like me, Hajat had a long day at work, and he could have continued driving home to rest, but instead he stopped to help me, a stranger,” Borg said.
 At a point, Borg tried to pay Hajat for his kind gesture, but he refused. Instead, they posed for a picture. 
 Borg said he feels society fears the unknown and people have stopped trying to learn about those who are different from them.
 “We have stopped being kind to one another, we have stopped going out of our way to help others,” he said.
 “But today I was reminded that kindness knows no boundaries. Hajat didn’t help me because of where he’s from, he helped me because that’s simply who he is - a kind and generous person.”
 He said he decided to share his experience on the popular Facebook page Are you being Served? to remind others to be a little kinder to one another.
 “Smile at someone, lend a hand if you see someone in need, and remember that we’re all neighbours here,"" he wrote.
 The post received hundreds of comments and was flooded with praise for both Borg and Haya. Some people said it was the best post they had seen all day.
 “What a beautiful lesson! This should make us think deeper, judge people less hastily, respect everybody and be kinder whenever and wherever necessary,” one person commented. 
 Others commented that they knew Hayat and described him as a man with a “golden heart” and a “top guy”.
 “Thank you for reminding us that kindness goes a long long way,” another said.
 Borg said he hopes the post will inspire others to do something kind.
 ""If one person reads the post and does one nice thing to another person, I'll be very happy.""

https://timesofmalta.com/article/i-fled-malta-assad-army-killed-village-now-i-dream-home.1102464,"A Syrian refugee who was forced into military service under Bashar al-Assad’s regime dreams of returning home to Syria after more than a decade of building a life in Malta.
 Since arriving in Malta in 2013, Maher Ibrahim has built a family and a successful business, Ta’ Vera Paints and Building Materials, in Tarxien. 
 “I have been here for 11 years. At this point, I feel Maltese,” Ibrahim said.
 Raised in Al-Sukhnah, a small town about 70 kilometres from the ancient city of Palmyra, Ibrahim once aspired to become a computer engineer. However, those dreams were shattered when he was conscripted into the Syrian army after finishing secondary school. 
 “If I said I didn’t want to be in the army, I would have been sent to prison, and this is nothing like a Maltese prison; it is much, much worse,” he said.
  Ibrahim recounted stories he had heard about the brutal conditions in Sednaya prison, infamous for its reports of torture, starvation and rape. The tipping point for Ibrahim and his family came after his return from military service when Assad’s soldiers entered his village. 
 “As they arrived, people went to welcome them, but they ended up killing them all. I thought, if you’re willing to kill those who welcomed you, what would stop you from killing me?” he said.
 Thousands of people from Al-Sukhnah left the town after that to find safety nearby, including Ibrahim and his family. However, his family knew they would not remain safe for long and slowly, one by one, each member of Ibrahim’s family fled towards the Turkish border without passports or identification.
 From Turkey, he took a boat to Greece where eventually he boarded a plane to Malta, where he has lived ever since.
 “Maltese people have opened their hearts to me and my community, and I am incredibly grateful,” Ibrahim said, expressing profound appreciation for the island’s hospitality.
 As well as setting up a business, he and his Syrian wife married in Malta and their two daughters were born in the country.
  With the fall of Assad’s regime, Ibrahim’s thoughts have turned to reuniting with his family, who are now scattered across the globe – cousins in Malta, a brother in Saudi Arabia and a sister in Qatar. 
 “I felt like a bird finally being released from a cage on Sunday,” he said.
 “I woke up scared every day for me and my family. Now I feel free.”
 However, despite his elation, Ibrahim remains cautious about the future. His dream is to return to a safe and rebuilt Syria, where his young daughters can thrive. 
 “I don’t want a country run by soldiers or the sons of soldiers. I want to see Syria as a democracy, led by professionals and businessmen who can rebuild the country positively,” he said.
 But while Syrians are planning a cautious return home, some of the local reaction to the regime downfall has been dispiriting. 
 Omar Rababah, a Maltese-Syrian human rights activist, took to social media to express his joy about the future. But his post was littered with racist comments saying the Syrian community should now go back to their own country. 
 “The reaction didn’t totally surprise me,” Rababah, who was raised in Malta, said. 
 He said they are told to go back to their country or similar cruel comments every year when there’s traffic because of people heading to the Mosque for Eid prayers.
 “Sometimes it feels like we’re their favourite punching bag,” he said.
 “Judgmental people make sure to leave their two cents, and that’s what it is more than anything: judgement and a lack of understanding.”

https://timesofmalta.com/article/floriana-largest-wartime-shelter-rediscovered.1093052,"When freelance researcher Steve Mallia was approached by the Floriana local council to work on a project on a school well, the last thing he thought he would find was the locality’s largest shelter.
 Spanning from the Floriana primary school to the end of the granaries, the shelter had not been accessed for six to seven decades.
 “We found it by pure chance and coincidence,” said Mallia, who specialises in Maltese reservoirs.
 Working underground on the project a few weeks ago, he first noticed markings on a wall that looked like the entrance to a shelter.  After asking permission from the council, he reopened the entrance and was amazed at the discovery. 
 “Thousands of people pass through Floriana every day, and no one has any idea about the world that exists below them,” he said of what the Department of Public Works calls the largest shelter in Floriana. 
 A few days later, he was joined by Conrad Neil Gatt, a photographer and amateur historian, who filmed their experience traversing the shelter for his YouTube channel.
 As they entered the shelter, they found stairs and a long, narrow passageway with a series of small wall shrines, stalagmites and stalactites. 
 They came across multiple wall carvings dating to World War II, old Portanier Trufruit bottles and a room painted black. 
   “It was painted with black tar to help lower the humidity because this room was used by the church to store some of their most precious items during the war because St Publius church was heavily bombed,” Mallia explained.
 The shelter also has a rarely seen feature – it is split into two levels. 
 Mallia said: “I have been inside hundreds of shelters, but I have never seen one like this.” 
  As they traversed the lower level, which would also have been used to shelter people in the war, they found around 70-80cm of water in some sections.
 “Because of special confined spaces like that, you always need to bring a gas detector and, most importantly, a friend. When I enter a shelter, I want to keep going until I reach the end and hit a wall. It can be dangerous, but I will take that risk.”
 The shelter has 30 rooms and can accommodate around 400 people. However, Mallia believes it could hold another 400 in the lower level as well. 
 Mallia and Gatt hope the shelter will be cleaned and restored so people can access it at least once a year, an ambition endorsed by Floriana mayor Vince Borg. 
 Borg said the shelter still needs to be cleaned and safety checks carried out. Still, if everything goes according to plan, he would like to see it open for the public this coming October in time for the council event Ġenna ta’ Ġonna, a yearly open day in Floriana for people to enjoy and appreciate their public gardens and cultural heritage.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/watch-chicken-nugget-recordbreaking-team-bite-off-chew.1101166,"An attempt to break the Maltese record for the most chicken nuggets eaten in 20 minutes ended in disappointment on Sunday after a team of seven fell short by 24 nuggets.
 Overseen by national records organisation The Malta Records, Sunday’s challenge saw seven men face off against 350 chicken nuggets in a garage in Siġġiewi, cheered on by family and friends.
 However, despite giving it everything they had, the team only managed 215 nuggets – not a poultry effort, but, alas, not enough to beat the existing record of 238 set by an Mġarr team in 2019.
 The endeavor was instigated by Tyrone Debono, who suggested to his friends they attempt the feat as a fun team activity in honour of his upcoming thirtieth birthday and to raise funds for animal shelters.
 So, after a trial run a few weeks ago, when the team claimed to have managed 250 nuggets, they contacted Jeffrey Saliba at The Malta Records and set a date for the attempt.
  On Sunday afternoon the table was set, equipped with condiments, napkins, water and seven trays of 50 recently air-fried chicken nuggets, one for each contestant.
 “One of the main rules is that during the 20 minutes, they cannot stand up... within that, they can do whatever they want; add salt, pepper, mayonnaise, ketchup – but they cannot stand up,” explained Saliba before the attempt.
 Before the event started, Saliba counted all the chicken nuggets and made sure they each measured 6cm by 4cm in line with competition rules.
 Speaking before the attempt, team captain Daniel Debattista said the team was “excited and a little bit hungry,” adding that while they had not followed any kind of training regimen, they had decided not to eat anything that day.
 Meanwhile, standing supportively on the sidelines, Debono’s mother-in-law said her son-in-law and his teammates were “very brave.”
  After a quick countdown, the attempt got underway to cheers and applause from the watching group of around 20 family members and friends, who kept up a barrage of encouragement – and some teasing: ""You’re going too slowly!”
 Towards the end of the attempt, members of the team could be seen breathing heavily, staring down at their tray of defiant nuggets as they battled to complete the challenge.
 
 But it was not to be.
 After 20 minutes of competitive eating, time was called and the remaining nuggets counted; with 125 remaining, the team had missed beating the record by 24, equivalent to less than four nuggets each.
 Reflecting on the failed attempt, Debattista said ""it was tough... far more difficult than you'd expect,” adding that the nuggets used in the record-breaking attempt were of a firmer consistency than those the group had used for the practice attempt.
  Stressing the activity had been a fun one, however, the 30-year-old said, “it’s an experience we will remember forever, maybe we’ll try it again in a year’s time.”
 Debattista and Debono were joined by 30-year-old Christian Gafa, 34-year-old Norbert Galea, 29-year-old Luke Vella and Gareth Azzopardi and Duane Azzopardi, both 31 years old.
 Will the team members ever be able to eat another chicken nugget after Sunday?
 “Yes, for sure, but not this week,” said Galea.
 And while the group’s failed attempt must have been a bitter nugget to swallow, it will have come as good news to others. Saliba said three band clubs were eyeing the group's bid with a view to beating their score should they have managed to break the record. 
 Should the team attempt the feat again, they may be well placed to expand their personnel; in 2013, Roberto Rizzo consumed two metres of raw Maltese sausage before finishing off an 18-inch pizza in 30 minutes the following day, according to The Malta Records.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/olympics-controversy-judge-according-appearance-french-embassy.1096055,"The French embassy has reacted to dismay in some quarters over a scene in the Olympics opening ceremony seen as mocking the Last Supper, quoting the artistic producer saying that was not what was being depicted.
 The conference of French bishops, as well as Malta's Archbishop Charles Scicluna were among those who condemned the scene.
 The archbishop even urged the public to write to the French ambassador in Malta to raise their objections. 
 In a statement, the French embassy said it was sorry that Christians felt offended by the dinner scene where some believed they detected a parody of the Last Supper.
 The embassy added a quote from St John saying: “Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment”.
  The embassy then quoted the ceremony's artistic director explaining how the scene did not depict the Last Supper at all.
 ""So no, it wasn't my inspiration. In fact, I think it was quite clear that Dionysus was coming to the table. Why Dionysus? Because he is first and foremost the god of celebration in Greek mythology, and the painting is called ""Les Festivités"". He is the god of wine, an important symbol in France, and the father of Sequana, the goddess linked to the river Seine. (...) You will never find in me any desire to mock or denigrate. I wanted to organise a ceremony that would repair and reconcile, and that would reaffirm the values of our Republic: liberty, equality and fraternity"".
 The embassy said France was proud of its heritage and patrimony: it watched in horror as the cathedral of Notre-Dame in Paris burned down, and is following with emotion the stages of its reconstruction.
 France, it said, was also the country of free thought, secularism, the freedom to believe and the freedom not to believe. As such, the country cherished the freedom of creation, the freedom that guided the opening ceremony of the Paris 2024 Olympic Games.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/luqa-local-council-opposes-crematorium-close-addolorata-cemetery.1100336,"The Luqa local council has added its voice to that of the Paola council and is objecting to a proposal to build a crematorium on private land close to the Addolorata cemetery.
 Earlier this month, the Paola local council filed its objections to PA/05280/21 after holding an urgent council meeting to discuss the latest developments with its architect, Jesmond Mugliett. Mugliett had originally filed the council’s representation to the project in 2021.
 The council’s objection comes after Times of Malta reported how the island’s first crematorium could be up and running within two years. Johann Camilleri, whose company is behind the application to develop the first crematorium, said his team was revising plans submitted three years ago.
 Now, the team is downsizing its original plans for a 700-square metre site to one of 500 square metres, the maximum allowed by the new policy. 
 The changes were discussed by the Luqa local council this week.
 In a statement issued on Thursday, the local council said it opposed the project as the pollution caused by the crematorium was detrimental to the locality's residents.
 ""The local council is calling for an Environmental Impact Assessment because Luqa cannot take any more air pollution and soot.
 ""Luqa is already surrounded by industrial areas and hosts the Malta International Airport. The existing aeroplanes' noise pollution and vehicle pollution are substantial, and something that residents are still suffering from.""

https://timesofmalta.com/article/genuine-refugees-protected-camilleri-says-migrants-face-deportation.1101304,"There are several safeguards in Malta’s asylum system to ensure that those who are denied refugee status really do not merit asylum, Home Affairs Minister Byron Camilleri has insisted.  
 He was speaking following a Times of Malta interview with Yosuf Ahmed Adam, one of several  Ethiopian migrants who have been detained since August and told they will be deported to their home country as they cannot be granted refugee status. 
 Adam, who has lived in Malta for 13 years, told Times of Malta that returning him to Ethiopia in a region plagued by conflict could mean he would be killed or imprisoned.   
 Camilleri said the procedures followed by the International Protection Agency, including an appeals process and recourse to the courts, ensured that genuine refugees were not deported.  
 “The decision on refugee status is based on whether one would have left a country because of war or other factors - such as being gay or following a religion that will lead to consequences,” Camilleri said.  
  And once the agency takes its decision, it is subject to an appeal and the courts, he said.  
 Anyone who qualifies as a refugee will be helped, Camilleri said, but anyone who does not should be sent back. Not doing so would encourage more people to make the perilous crossing across the Mediterranean, the home affairs minister said. 
 “Should we have policies that incentivise irregular sea crossings via smugglers that lead to a large proportion of deaths? Should we have policies that turn the Mediterranean into more of a cemetery?” he asked.  
 Ensuring that people who did not qualify as refugees were returned meant that fewer people crossed the Mediterranean and there were fewer deaths.  
 He stressed that this was a policy followed across Europe and home affairs ministers of the 27 EU member states were constantly pushing the European Commission to focus more on irregular migration returns.  
 
 This group of Ethiopians are being returned to their country through an EU initiative, Camilleri said.  
 Over 900 asylum seekers have been returned to their country in the last four years after their asylum applications were rejected.  
 Some returned voluntarily, and others were forced to do so, he added. 
 Asked about Adam’s case, in the context that he had learnt Maltese and contributed to the labour market for 13 years, Camilleri said it was not a shortcoming of the state when a long time elapsed before migrants were returned.
 When a person refused to cooperate and return voluntarily, there were delays from some countries for the forced repatriation,” Camilleri said.  
 “The fact that you did not cooperate, in my opinion, should not lead to other decisions,” he said.  
 Camilleri said that the Ethiopians have been kept in detention since August because of court proceedings from their end.  
 “They can leave tomorrow if they want to, but because there are proceedings in court, there is some delay. Everything revolves around cooperation; you can keep forcing delays, but eventually, there will be the same decision”.  
 Home Affairs shadow minister Darren Carabott said asylum proceedings should not take this long.  
 ""We stand firm with the fact that the law is clear on who is to be granted international protection, and those laws must be enforced - our country needs to show that our laws are respected and no one is at liberty to enter our country illegally,” he said.
 “However, the law also states that asylum applicants should be granted a decision in a 'reasonable' time, both during the initial proceedings with the protection agency but also in the subsequent appeals. The latter part - the 'reasonable' time for adjudication is where the government is falling short"". 
 The government had to ensure an expedited process and not allow asylum proceedings to take 13 years, Carabott said.  
 “Due to the government's failure to ensure such an efficient process, it has created a victim status,” Carabott said when reacting to Adams’s situation.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/the-show-meant-everything-us.1097538,"Daniel and Ylenia, Malta's most popular breakfast radio hosts, have announced the end of their programme after an eight-year run - and it was not their decision.
 Their good-humoured banter from dawn right through rush hour on Bay Radio helped thousands of people start their day or hold on to their senses as they were stuck in traffic jams.
 Yet, on Sunday, the duo, who recently became husband and wife, announced that their show had reached the end of its run.
 Their last show was actually at the beginning of August, shortly after their wedding.  
 But for the two presenters, the show was much more than just an average job.
 They journeyed within it from being complete strangers to colleagues, friends, and eventually, husband and wife. 
 “The show meant everything to us, it’s our baby so to speak. I started working on the show at 17, and now, I am married to my co-host,"" Ylenia told Times of Malta . 
 ""We joke now about how we never imagined that we would get together and marry. This programme saw us grow up together and was with us through different parts of our lives. It means so much to us.”
  The newlyweds said the decision to end the breakfast radio show was not their own. 
 “Radio management decided to change the schedule, and we were offered to host the afternoon show,” Daniel said.
 “But we felt it did not make sense to start a brand new afternoon show after we had such a good eight-year run on our morning show.”
 The decision came at the same time as a Broadcasting Authority survey, not for the first time, showed Bay Breakfast was the country’s most popular radio programme. 
 No farewell show was announced because the station wanted to keep the new schedule under wraps. A new breakfast show started on Monday.
  “We stopped hosting the show back in August, and many listeners thought we were just on a long honeymoon,” Daniel said. 
 “But once people saw we were back in Malta, Ylenia started to receive messages asking when we would return to the radio.”
 Ylenia said it was “bittersweet” to not host a farewell show, but said the couple ended on good terms with 89.7 Bay.
 The ending of their show coincided with the popular radio trio of Vibe FM Jonathan Abel, JD Patrick and Martina Zammit bidding farewell to The Morning Vibe programme after a decade of entertaining listeners. 
 Ylenia started to work with Daniel on the breakfast show after they hosted a New Year’s special show together. At the time, she had already worked for two years on the breakfast show, and Daniel was general manager at 89.7 Bay. 
 “They (the station) liked how we sounded together and decided to put us [together] on one show,” she recalled. 
 “It is very cute to think we shared our lives on this show,” she said. 
  She said the couple received thousands of messages from listeners when they announced they would no longer host the show.
 “Some even suggested we start a petition to host the show once again, imagine that,” she laughed. 
 She said her fondest memories were of charitable events the duo hosted, particularly a radio show that was on air for 33 hours. 
 For Daniel, one of his most cherished moments was when the duo were to announce they were an official couple in 2021.
 “It was a week when many people were speculating on social media whether we were a couple or not. Some people were also sharing pictures of us holding hands in Valletta,” he recalled. 
  “It was exciting to finally announce our relationship,"" he said
 “We were nervous because we didn’t know how the station would react,” Ylenia added. 
 Two years later, Daniel proposed to Ylenia during a Jonas Brothers concert, her favourite band. This July, the couple said 'I do'. 
 Both thanked their listeners for their support and love. 
 ""Every moment of the show was a great memory, and we couldn't have done it without the listeners,"" he said.
 Will the couple return on air? 
 ""We do plan to be back on air,"" Daniel said, with Ylenia asking listeners to keep an eye on their social media for updates.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/hundreds-bid-farewell-jake-vella-triathlete-inspired-hope.1097750,"Hundreds of mourners gathered at Birzebbuġa parish church on Saturday morning to bid a final farewell to Jake Vella, the 15-year-old athlete who touched the hearts of a nation.
 Jake battled a rare condition called ROHHAD (Rapid-onset Obesity with Hypothalamic Dysfunction, Hypoventilation, and Autonomic Dysregulation), and was known for his gratitude and kindness throughout his life.
 He died last week.
 His Saturday morning funeral began with a cortege of cyclists following his hearse from Mater Dei Hospital to Birzebbuġa in a commemorative ride, a tribute to the young athlete who defied his condition by competing in triathlons.
 Once there, friends and family carried his white coffin – inscribed with his last words ""Thank you Ma, thank you Dad"" – into the church, where dignitaries including Prime Minister Robert Abela and his wife Lydia, Opposition leader Bernard Grech, former President Marie-Louise Coleiro Preca, and other public figures were in attendance.
 Vella used the publicity he attracted to raise awareness for various causes, including charities that helped abandoned animals. His love for animals was evident in the final gesture at his funeral, where attendees were given small bags filled with treats for stray animals.
  In his memory, mourners wore white and bright colours.
 The poignant moment when Jake’s coffin was carried out of the church to the song You Raise Me Up left few dry eyes as mourners stood to applaud Vella, celebrating his life of courage and perseverance.
  Archbishop Charles Scicluna, who presided over the funeral service, described Jake as an extraordinary example of love and resilience.
  “We thank God for giving us such a kind-hearted Maltese youth who gives us courage, a sense of hope, and who makes us very proud,” the archbishop said.  "" For all of this, we thank you, Jake.""
 Carmen Mangion, Jake's nurse, encouraged attendees to be like Jake, ""who despite his own suffering worked tirelessly to help those in need.""
 A visibly emotional Lydia Abela said, ""Jesus watch over Josie and Maruska who were by Jake's side till his very last breath. Let them continue to hear Jake's last words and also look over other parents who lost their children.""
 President Emeritus Coleiro Preca used her speech to remind mourners about Jake's repeated pleas for peace.

https://timesofmalta.com/article/jobsplus-raids-courier-cab-firms-amid-employee-abuse-claims.1095984,"Jobsplus officials raided three courier and cab fleet companies as the government agency investigates claims of employee abuse.
 WT Global, Ferrugia Fleet and Mela Cleaning, which employ cab drivers and food delivery couriers, got the unannounced visits in recent days, sources close to the operation said. The officials were looking for pay slips, work contracts and any documentary evidence that may point to illegal labour practices.
 The raids followed a meeting Jobsplus held with third-country national couriers who took industrial action over exploitative working conditions earlier this month. “The names of those three companies featured heavily in that meeting,” one source said.
 Times of Malta reached out to all three for comment. Only Ferrugia replied.
 “We gave all the requested documents when Jobsplus came to our offices. We are willing to cooperate with the authorities because we have nothing to hide,” the company’s owner, Fabrizio Ferrugia, said.
 
 WT Global, Ferrugia and Mela are among the companies that have recently been shunned by Jobsplus.
 Employment and Home Affairs Minister Byron Camilleri said in parliament earlier this month that companies accused of exploiting food couriers will be barred from hiring workers until investigations into the claims are carried out.
 Following the statement, it was revealed that hundreds of TCNs applying to work as cab drivers and food app couriers are having their work permit applications refused in what government sources described as part of a crackdown on abusive employers.
  The home affairs ministry said on Friday that cab driving and food courier work permits were being turned down because the market had “reached saturation”. Applications were being rejected for people abroad seeking a job here as well as those already in Malta who needed to change their employer. Workers renewing their permit with the same employer would not be affected, they said.
 Most third-country nationals who live in Malta need a work permit to reside in the country because they come from non-EU countries. That permit, which must usually be renewed every year, is directly tied to an employer.
 In the last two weeks, 409 work permit applications in the courier and ride-hailing industry were refused, sources told Times of Malta. Over half of them were change-of-employer applications that originated from Malta and the consisted of applications coming from abroad. Of the 235 refused change-of-employer applications, 116 refusals originated from WT Global.
 WT Global employs hundreds of workers. The company has Malta’s largest cab fleet, with over 300 vehicles registered. It is also known to have a large number of motorcycles operating on food delivery apps.
 Several workers who had applied at Identitá to change their employer reported receiving their work permit refusals from the agency responsible for issuing work permits in recent days. The refusal letters included a warning that, unless they have alternative authorisation to stay in Malta legally, they may be violating the Immigration Act.
 The letters shocked many TCNs who have been through logistical nightmares to get a job in Malta. “I was shocked. I did nothing wrong but, still, I was being told to leave the country,” said one man who had applied to work as a cab driver.
 Government sources said change-of-employer applications at these companies needed to be refused to avoid “abuse”. “Had we left that option open, we risked that the fleets could use another company to bring workers to Malta and then change their registered employer once here.”
 Still, the government, via Jobsplus, is willing to find alternative employment for those caught in the crossfire, sources said, emphasising that deporting such workers is not the government’s intention.
 In an opinion piece published on Sunday, Camillieri condemned employers who neglect workers’ rights, saying the government was conducting thorough investigations into the working conditions of food delivery couriers. He said the government would not tolerate exploitation.
