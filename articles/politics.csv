Watch: Former MEP Cyrus Engerer joins leadership of NGO planning a new party,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/watch-former-mep-cyrus-engerer-joins-leadership.1094700,07-01-2024,"000004.png,000005.png","Former Labour MEP Cyrus Engerer has joined the leadership of a recently formed activist NGO that has promised to set up a new political party by the next general election.
 In an interview with Times of Malta, Wayne Flask and Matthew Borg – co-founders of  Il-Kollettiv – confirmed Engerer had joined the NGO as its vice-secretary a few weeks ago but said it was too early to tell whether he, or anyone else, would contest on the new party’s ticket come next election.
 “Our priority right now is to set up internal structures that would allow members to join. We’d rather strengthen our activism before we move on to discussing the political party. But we have a vision and we have a strategy to get there,” Flask said.
 “It’s a pleasure to have a [former] MEP join us, because he chose us knowing we cannot pay, when he could have maybe taken up some lucrative job or posting elsewhere.”
 Il-Kollettiv (which literally translates to ‘The Collective’) was unveiled last April as a new activist group that will help residents across Maltese localities organise themselves to fight excessive development, social injustices and inequality, among other issues.
  Along with Borg and Flask is also Jeanette Borg, the NGO’s president and one of its co-founders.
 Engerer had publicly expressed support for the group on the day it launched. At the time he was still an MEP and it was not yet clear whether he was going seek re-election, and he eventually did not.
 ‘No conflict of interest’
 Times of Malta contacted Engerer, asking him whether he has resigned from the PL now that he holds a leadership role in an NGO that plans to create its own political party.
 “Technically, I remain a member of Partit Laburista because my membership is paid,” he said, adding that he did resign from the party last year over the government’s stance on the Jean Paul Sofia public inquiry, after he was prevented from attending a parliamentary group meeting that discussed the issue.
 “Since I was not allowed to join online (as I had done for all other meetings while being abroad on parliamentary duties), I decided to resign because I could not agree with an internal system that does not even allow for the airing of views – let alone be in a position to help change them.
 “Although my resignation was not accepted and I continued to receive invitations to parliamentary group meetings and other events, I chose not to attend any of them – apart from the following one that had then discussed the terms of reference of the public inquiry.”
 So, does he think he will have a conflict of interest now? Not really.
 “Since Il-Kollettiv is an NGO, there is no conflict of interest since the principles and beliefs defined in Partit Laburista’s statute are in line with those of  Il-Kollettiv,” he told  Times of Malta.
 “In the same way that my membership in MGRM [Malta Gay Rights Movement] was never in conflict with my membership in Partit Laburista.”
 Asked to say whether he has plans to contest the next general election on the new party’s ticket, Engerer simply said “Il-Kollettiv is an NGO, not a political party”.
 A party will emerge 
 In the interview earlier this week, Borg and Flask explained that Il-Kollettiv will not itself be turned into a party, as the NGO must continue the necessary activism in several localities.
 Rather, the new party will emerge out of it and will be up and running and have candidates contesting on its ticket by the next general election.
 Engerer hopes his knowledge and experience in policy, decision-making and campaigning in Malta and the EU could be an asset to the NGO.
  Not a third party
 Borg, the NGO’s treasurer, insisted it is unfair to dub it as another “third party”. Third parties have been doomed to live in the shadows of the big parties because referring to them as ‘third parties’ implies they are third best.
 “It’s like there are two big parties and the rest are fighting it out at the bottom to see who gets to slide in between the two big ones,” he said.
 “We’re not attempting to create a third party, but another party. Our aim is to build a strong relationship with the residents. We don’t just go to the locality and tell them they can object to some application. We help them spearhead their own fight themselves.”
 If they are activists, then why didn’t they join the many other existent activist groups, like Moviment Graffiti?
 Il-Kollettiv is different, they said, because unlike the others, it aims to produce and push forward political candidates to run for office.
 “We wanted to go a step further, because you never see activists run for office,” Borg said.
  Borg and Flask are aware, however, that the smaller parties have so far failed to break the electoral glass ceiling time and time again. They are trying to crack it by proposing drastic electoral reform days after election results were published last month, and by staying as close to the people as possible – “unlike the many politicians who say they are close to the people but in fact are out of touch with voters’ realities”.
 The 135,000 voters who did not vote for the big parties in the MEP election are a testament to that, they believe, and Il-Kollettiv is tapping into that potential.
 A coalition with whom?
 Even if their candidates were to be elected in the next general election, in the absence of a majority they would likely need to form a coalition with one of the big parties.
 Asked which party they might feel comfortable with, Borg and Flask said that decision lay way into the future. They must first develop their electoral manifesto and see what the big parties would come up with in theirs.
 For now, they are sticking to empowering residents to take up fights for the common good. They say they have already scored a few significant victories in Żurrieq, Qrendi and Safi, where development applications were frozen or refused after residents set up associations, organised press conferences and took to the streets in protest.
 “When residents work together they grow closer together and feel part of the fight,” Borg said.
 Flask added: “We’d also like to see this process work in other localities without the need for our intervention. One group which already works really well autonomously is the Marsascala Residents Network. These examples give us great courage.”
 The left too fragmented?
 Voters significantly switched to small parties and independent candidates in the MEP election, but there were not nearly enough of them to hit a quota. Furthermore, their topmost preferences were spread across too many different candidates. Consequently, no candidate garnered enough switchers’ votes to make it through the electoral system and get elected.
 Do Borg and Flask feel like their new party will eventually add even more to the fragmentation which ultimately made it harder for everyone to get elected?
 They do not think so and insist that the values of several independent candidates clash with theirs. One of those is Conrad Borg Manché, with whom Flask said he does not agree in principle.
 Flask is a long-time critic of the big political parties, but he managed to identify some good things that Robert Abela and Bernard Grech did during their tenure.
 Rent reform was one of Abela’s best decisions, he said, and Grech impressed him the most with the latest electoral result, not so much the MEP election result as the local councils one.
 “The PN regained the majority in Gozo despite the fact that the PL made Clint Camilleri the government’s planning minister,” he said.
 “However, both parties now need to decide whether they will govern for the people or for the developers, because so far, neither party has concretely and consistently come out against excessive development.”
 Meanwhile, asked what pushed him away from the PL, Engerer said “the party stopped being the catalyst of change” and instead of embracing diversity and encouraged critical thinking, it took on a narrative and made policies aimed at the party hardcore.
 “Fortress mentalities in parties lead to the ‘everyone is against us’ idea which is dangerous and which builds walls rather than bridges,” he said.
 “It also gives the impression that some are superior to others, leading to arrogance and the ridicule of the rest.”

Bernard Grech challenges Labour to back Metsola for EP President,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/bernard-grech-challenges-labour-back-metsola-ep-president.1094184,20-06-2024,"000017.png,000018.png","Bernard Grech has challenged Labour to back Roberta Metsola’s candidacy for European Parliament president.
 “I hope that Robert Abela will, for once, set aside partisan interests and back a person who has brought recognition and respect to Malta’s name internationally,” Grech said as he entered parliament on Wednesday.
 “Abela ran a campaign of fear in which he continuously attacked Metsola as a warmonger. Now I hope he will change that narrative and give her the backing she needs.”
  Metsola is the frontrunner to be named EP President after she secured the unanimous backing of MEPs within her political grouping, the European People’s Party, to be its candidate for the post.
 The EPP is the largest grouping within the European Parliament. But it does not have an absolute majority of seats, and Metsola’s nomination must be approved by a majority of MEPs for her to be reelected to the presidency.
 If successful, she will be the second MEP and first woman to serve as EP president for two terms, after Germany’s Martin Schulz.
 Metsola is only the third woman to hold the post of European Parliament president and was the youngest-ever person to serve in that role when she was first appointed in January 2022.
 Labour MEPs form part of the EPP’s rival group, the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D).
 The S&D has not yet said whether it intends to back Metsola’s bid or push for another candidate to assume the parliament presidency.
 Abela has yet to comment on Metsola’s candidacy or say whether he will instruct Labour’s three MEPs, who form part of the S&D grouping, to vote in her favour.
 When Metsola was first elected in 2022, the S&D had backed her. Metsola was elected with an overwhelming majority of 458 out of 690 votes on that occasion.
 The European Parliament president is elected for two-and-a-half years and represents the parliament in its relations with other EU institutions and the outside world.
 The president also signs the EU’s budget and any laws passed by MEPs.
 Speaking later in the day during an interview on NET, Grech reiterated his challenge to Abela.
 “I hope Robert Abela and the Labour Party place the national interest before partisan interests and back Metsola’s candidacy,” he said. 
 Grech used that interview to express concern about news that the EU Commission will seek to open excessive deficit procedures against Malta for its budget overruns. 
  The Labour government was financing corruption and paying millions to its insiders while allowing public finances to fall into debt, he said. 
 A Nationalist government would cut excessive spending, he said, adding that he hoped the government would not try and fix this issue by resorting to austerity and reducing aid given to vitizens. 
 “This problem was caused by Robert Abela and (finance minister) Clyde Caruana, not by the Maltese people. They are paying the price for the government’s poor policies,” Grech said.

"Public Service Expo costs exceeded €1.5 million, MP claims",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/public-service-expo-costs-exceeded-15-million-mp-claims.1101553,25-11-2024,000028.png,"The Public Service Expo held earlier this year cost over €1.5 million, well above the €680,840.38 initially reported by the Prime Minister in reply to a parliamentary question, Nationalist MP Claudette Buttiġieġ said on Monday.
 Speaking in Parliament,  Buttiġieġ detailed how it took 31 parliamentary questions to reveal the total expenditure of €1,531,051.78.
 She criticised the prime minister for providing incomplete information, saying details about direct orders and tenders remained undisclosed. 
 The expo, held from May 15 to 17 at Ta’ Qali, showcased work by various entities within the public service. 
 In June, Buttiġieġ had asked the prime minister in parliament how much the event cost. The reply cited only €680,840.38.  
 Buttiġieġ pointed out that her question was not how much the Office of the Prime Minister spent at the expo but rather how much the expo cost.
 According to  Buttiġieġ, 18 ministries contributed to the funding. The Economy Ministry spent the most, with €70,926.00, followed by the Environment Ministry at €62,490.00. The Lands Ministry recorded the lowest expenditure at €30,925.00.
 The substantial discrepancy in reported figures raises concerns about transparency in government spending and the accessibility of financial data related to public events, the Nationalist MP said.

"Malta High Commission in London owes £722,000 in congestion charges",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/malta-high-commission-london-owes-722000-congestion-charges.1092996,25-05-2024,000029.png,"London is claiming the Maltese High Commission owes it £722,915 (€848,000) in unpaid congestion charges accumulated over the last two decades.
 This was published in a list of unpaid fees and fines amassed by some 160 diplomatic missions based in the UK capital over the last 20 years – totalling £143.5m (€168.3m).
 The figures were published by Transport for London, the UK government body responsible for transport.
 When asked about this, a spokesperson for Malta’s foreign affairs ministry said: “As the document published by Transport for London indicates, this long-standing matter relates to many diplomatic missions based in London. In this regard, Malta is addressing this request in the same way as other missions and in line with applicable international conventions.”
 The issue has been going on since 2020, when the UK foreign secretary issued a written ministerial statement revealing his officials have written to “a number of diplomatic missions and international organisations” to “press for payment” of money owed relating to the congestion charge.
 The congestion charge scheme involves a £15 (€17.60) daily fee for driving within an area of central London between 7am and 6pm on weekdays and between noon and 6pm on weekends and bank holidays.
  Various diplomatic missions, including Malta’s, are arguing they are exempt from paying the charges in accordance with international law. They are quoting the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and stressing that the congestion charge is a tax from which diplomatic missions are exempt.
 But Transport for London is insisting it is not a tax and should be paid.
 In the document listing the overdue fines, Transport for London wrote: “We and the UK government are clear that the congestion charge is a charge for a service and not a tax. This means that diplomats are not exempt from paying it. The majority of embassies in London do pay the charge but there remains a stubborn minority who refuse to do so, despite our representations through diplomatic channels. We will continue to pursue all unpaid congestion charge fees and related penalty charge notices and are pushing for the matter to be taken up at the International Court of Justice.”
 In the document, it goes on to list the total unpaid fees accrued by diplomats between the launch of the congestion charge in London in 2003 and the end of last year.
 The American Embassy tops the list with charges amounting to £14.5m (€17m) and is followed by the Embassy of Japan with £10.1m (€11.8m) and the High Commission for India at £8.5m (€9.9m).
 The lowest bills were accrued by the Embassy of Finland and the High Commission for the Commonwealth of Dominica, with £120 (€140) each, and the Embassy of the Republic of Togo, with a £40 (€47) bill.

PN calls fresh protest on Monday over the Bartolo-Camilleri scandal,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/pn-calls-fresh-protest-monday-bartolocamilleri-scandal.1101603,26-11-2024,000033.png,"The Nationalist Party is to hold another protest outside parliament next Monday over the Clint Camilleri-Clayton Bartolo scandal, Bernard Grech said on Tuesday as he lashed out at the prime minister for not demanding Camilleri's resignation.
 The PN held a protest over the issue last week and Bartolo was forced to resign from the Cabinet and the Labour parliamentary group on Tuesday, although the prime minister said that was over a different matter.
 Camilleri and Bartolo have been under pressure since a Standards Commissioner report found they abused their position by granting consultancy jobs to the former's partner.
 When people take to the streets in protest they become unbeatable, Grech said in parliament as it discussed the budget estimates of the Ministry of Justice.
 He said that while Bartolo buckled under pressure and resigned, Clint Camilleri had yet to acknowledge that his position, too, had become untenable.
 ""The prime minister is weak. He knows he has huge internal problems and he is trying to hide them.  We are here to remind him that when you put the lid on the pot, the water boils quicker,"" he said.
 ""This prime minister is betraying the people because he keeps defending fraud.""
 Earlier on Tuesday, Abela announced that Bartolo was stepping down as tourism minister and as Labour MP. The prime minister said he had taken decisions after he learnt of  new claims involving Bartolo's wife.  
 Grech observed that since the scandal was revealed three weeks ago, the government attempted to make a joke of the people's protests and Bartolo was only willing to apologise, thinking it was enough.
 ""He has no shame, and the prime minister defended him, saying that the apology was enough,"" Grech said.  
 ""Today the people won against those who thought the people's money is theirs.""
 Grech went on to list some of the most recent allegations of ""fraud"" within the government, including the scam which saw benefits handed to people who falsely claimed severe disability, the racket in the granting of driving licences,  Rosianne Cutajar's ITS consultancy contract and the hospitals deal.
 Justice, Grech said, wasn't simply the courts or the judiciary, but a need for the people to live in a country that treated everyone fairly.
 ""On the contrary, the people feel the government has stolen their money and pigged out on it,"" he said.

'No choice but to love him': Parliament pays tribute to late Karl Gouder,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/parliament-pays-tribute-late-former-mp-karl-gouder.1099183,10-08-2024,000056.png,"Robert Abela and Bernard Grech delivered heartfelt tributes to former MP Karl Gouder on Tuesday, urging fellow MPs to emulate the late politician's unwavering kindness, honesty, and patriotism.
 The government and opposition leaders were speaking during a special, 30-minute parliamentary session honouring the 45-year-old who shocked the country when he died suddenly last month.
 Gouder, a former PN mayor and MP, was touted as the party's next general secretary. 
 Gouder's family was present in parliament's strangers' gallery on Tuesday, and parliament published and distributed his first parliamentary speech, as is tradition.
 Speaker Anġlu Farrugia said the speech, which dates back to May 2010, shows Gouder was always ready to learn and seek the truth in all that he said.
 Abela said he first got to know Gouder as a fellow schoolboy. Both went to St Aloysius College but Gouder was a year younger.
 Abela said that even as a young man, Gouder had ""a sense of joy"" and as a member of parliament would debate arguments but never resorted to personal attacks.
 ""It's hard for me to speak about someone with whom I was in school. Karl never changed, and I confirmed that when we met in parliament years later,"" he said.
 ""Karl left us, but he also left many living memories. He has bestowed on us a sense of duty and responsibility, to behave like he did in this house - to seek reconciliation.""
 Abela said Gouder's funeral evoked a sense of unity that he only felt in one other funeral - that of young athlete Jake Vella, who also died last month after battling a long, gruelling illness.
 ""There was the feeling of a country that united behind one person,"" he said.
 ""Karl was a fellow student, a personal friend, and a man who gave his all for his country.""
 Gouder's party leader, Bernard Grech, said his death hit him almost as hard as that of both his parents, who also died in his four years as Opposition leader.
 He praised Gouder for his work on the PN's 2024 MEP election campaign, saying he was the ""backbone"" of that effort. 
 Gouder was there for all those who needed him, the PN leader said, noting how, in the days after his death, many people had shared screenshots of his words of encouragement and support to them.  
 ""Karl had a sense of unity - he sought to bring people together, not divide them and he knew how to do it gently without compromising his values,"" Grech recalled. 
 He had taken the Jesuit teaching of being a man for others to heart and lived that way. 
 ""He would find time for everyone and listen to everyone,"" Grech said. ""Karl took care of everyone. Let's be more sensitive and take care of each other like he used to.""
 Speaker Anġlu Farrugia also spoke in Gouder's memory, describing him as an upstanding gentleman.
 ""You had no choice but to love Karl,"" Farrugia said. 
 He also shared an anecdote.
 ""In 2023, I was going through a tough time, health-wise. He would text me every week, to ask how I was and whether I needed anything. And he would text me every year on my birthday,"" Farrugia recalled.

Watch:Abela says ‘let the institutions work’ when asked about the Vitals inquiry,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/abela-says-let-institutions-work-asked-vitals-inquiry.1093093,27-05-2024,000063.png,"Prime Minister Robert Abela returned to the “let the institutions work” mantra on Monday when asked whether he was concerned by the details that emerged from the magisterial inquiry into the hospitals concession.
 He echoed a call by President Myriam Spiteri Debono on Saturday to allow the courts to decide the case with serenity.
  “Now is the time to let the judges evaluate the evidence. These halls behind me rely on evidence and this is what they will be examining…the magisterial inquiry is not evidence but just a collection of facts…now the court will have to decide whether there is enough to convict anyone of a crime. This is the exercise that will start from tomorrow,” Abela said while speaking to journalists outside the law courts.
 In a clear reference to Steward Healthcare, Abela said he had taken political decisions back in 2020 without commenting on the guilt or otherwise of persons, which was a responsibility entrusted to the courts. “It is not up to me to declare whether anyone is innocent or guilty,” he said.
  Last Saturday, President Spiteri Debono called for “normality” to prevail in the coming days and insisted that nobody should provoke or fall for provocation, amid heightened political tensions ahead of the arraignment of former Prime Minister Joseph Muscat on Tuesday. 
 Although she did not mention it directly, the president was ostensibly referring to a show of support planned outside the courts during the arraignment.
 Prime Minister Robert Abela has warned PL supporters not to fall for a ""trap"" or be provoked though he did not specify what he was referring to. A Strong police presence is expected for tomorrow's protest.
 “Every citizen is free to act within the parameters of the rights given to him by the constitution. However, common sense and prudence dictate that in order not to fall for provocation, you should not seek provocation or, worse still, make or render yourself its agent,” Spiteri Debono said in her statement.

"Recognise Palestine now, envoy tells Malta, as US rejects claims of meddling",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/recognise-palestine-now-envoy-says-us-rejects-claims-meddling.1093700,06-11-2024,"000064.png,000065.png","Palestine’s Ambassador to Malta believes this is “the best time” for Malta to formally recognise a Palestinian state, while the United States has dismissed claims it was putting pressure on the island on the issue.
 “We truly believe it is the best time and the perfect circumstances to make a positive impact on Israel to withdraw from the occupied Palestinian lands to establish a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital,” Ambassador Fadi Hanania told Times of Malta.
 He was reacting to a Times of Malta story last week reporting that Malta stopped short of officially recognising Palestinian statehood after coming under intense pressure from the US and Israel.
 But the US has insisted it is not interfering in the process.
 The controversy stems from a declaration by Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez last March that Malta would be joining Spain in working towards Palestinian state recognition.
 Spain, Ireland and Norway announced last month that they were formally recognising Palestine, but Malta remained conspicuously silent.
 Senior diplomatic sources said top US and Israeli officials leaned heavily on Malta to distance itself from that group of countries, but the Maltese government strongly denied the claim.
 Ambassador Hanania would not comment on the allegations but stressed that Malta and Palestine already have “a long history of mutual cooperation and collaboration”.
 “Malta’s commitment is further highlighted by the presence of the Palestinian embassy in Malta. Under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, only sovereign states can establish embassies,” Hanania said.
 “Palestinian ambassadors are accredited to the president of the republic who recognises them as ambassadors of the state of Palestine, and all official correspondents with the official Maltese entities are addressed to the ambassador of the state of Palestine since 1988.”
  In 1988, Malta had sent the United Nations a letter in which it said it welcomed a Palestinian declaration of independence and said that declaration was “a true and genuine expression of the right of the Palestinian people to a state of their own”.
 Since then, Malta and Palestine have exchanged ambassadors and Palestine includes Malta in a list of countries it says formally recognise it.
 In 2012 Malta  voted in favour of a UN resolution which recognised Palestine as a non-member observer and last April at the UN Security Council it voted in favour of full UN membership for Palestine.
 Malta has also emphasised the need for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza and Ambassador Hanania thanked the government for welcoming wounded children from Gaza for medical treatment in Malta.
 He also called on the government to take the step to formally recognise the Palestinian state, saying he has no doubts about Robert Abela’s commitment to justice and to the announcement of last March.
 Malta played a major moderating role between Europe, the Arab world and Africa, he said, and showed it can keep security and stability, and through “wise leadership has managed to keep its own sovereign decision without being pressured by any other state but aligning with their neutrality approach advocating for justice, the rule of law and humanity”.
 But in a reply to questions, the US Embassy in Malta denied pressuring Malta.
 The US and Malta engage in discussions to advance peace in the Mediterranean region and the US respects “Malta’s sovereignty, constitutional neutrality, and its commitment to peace”, it said.
 “Malta’s position on the Norway-led declaration and recognition of a Palestinian state is a decision for Malta alone to make,” a US Embassy spokesperson said.
 “No other country, including the US, can or should dictate Malta’s position on the matter.”
  The US said it also wants a secure, free, democratic and stable Palestinian society and governance, and it supports the two-state solution, but the Palestinian state should be realised through direct negotiations between parties, not through unilateral recognition.
 The spokesperson added: “However, we are now focused on the most urgent issues at hand given the dire humanitarian situation on the ground – negotiating an enduring ceasefire and durable end to the war that ensures that all hostages return to their homes and families, alleviates the humanitarian crisis, ensures Israel’s security, creates a better “day after” in Gaza without Hamas in power, and sets the stage for a political settlement that provides a better future for Israelis and Palestinians alike.”
 Last week diplomats told Times of Malta the situation surrounding Palestinian recognition has put Malta’s relationship with the US into sharp relief, and they trace that shift in dynamics to Malta’s relegation to the FATF grey list of countries requiring enhanced monitoring of anti-money laundering measures.
 While the FATF is an independent multilateral entity, government sources privately acknowledge that the US – along with the UK and Germany – played a key role in that decision.
 Malta was taken off the grey list in mid-2022, and that decision was also made with Washington’s blessing.
 But the US Embassy said, “the Palestinian issue and FATF are two completely unrelated matters and should not be conflated”.
 “Malta’s high-level political commitment to working with FATF to accomplish the goals of its action plan led to the country being removed from the grey list in record time,” the US embassy spokesperson said.
 “We continue to work with our Maltese partners to strengthen its anti-money laundering and counterterrorist financing regimes to sustain its progress.”

"'This is not the Eurovision', Metsola tells MEPs singing 'Bella Ciao' to Orban",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/this-eurovision-metsola-tells-meps-singing-bella-ciao-orban.1099214,10-09-2024,000073.png,"European Parliament President Roberta Metsola struggled to keep a group of left-leaning MEPs in check on Wednesday morning as they protested Viktor Orban’s presence with a rendition of the anti-fascist anthem Bella Ciao.
 “This is not the Eurovision,” Metsola told the plenary as singing rang out following Orban’s speech.
 The Hungarian prime minister was in Strasbourg to present the country’s priorities halfway through its EU Council presidency.
 As President Vladimir Putin's closest ally within the European Union, Orban's government is at loggerheads with its partners on a host of issues -- from stalling aid for Kyiv, to what the bloc sees as weakening the rule of law at home.
  Orban depicted a continent in crisis, with the Ukraine war on its doorstep and an acute ""migration crisis"" - declaring that ""the European Union needs to change.""
 Lawmakers listened respectfully - with occasional applause from sympathetic members – but the floodgates of criticism were burst open by the Bella Ciao rendition that tail-ended his appearance.
 Orban critics then took the floor and one by one let fly at the Hungarian leader with a message summed up by Green co-leader Terry Reintke who told him: ""You are not welcome here"".
 Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen, speaking right after Orban, pushed back hard - taking aim at Budapest's hampering of EU support for Kyiv and refusal to join Western efforts to arm Ukraine to fight off Moscow.
 ""There is only one path to achieve a just peace for Ukraine and for Europe, we must continue to empower Ukraine's resistance with political, financial and military support,"" von der Leyen said.
 When Hungary assumed the EU's rotating six-month presidency in July, Orban went off script: embarking on an uncoordinated Ukraine ""peace mission"" to Kyiv, Moscow and Beijing that sparked fury in Brussels.
 In her forceful address von der Leyen targeted Orban's eagerness to push for an early peace deal with Putin over the Ukraine invasion - assailing those ""who blame this war not on the invader but the invaded, not on Putin's lust for power, but on Ukraine's thirst for freedom.""
 Speaking next, the leader of the conservative European People's Party Manfred Weber likewise slammed his rogue diplomacy under the EU banner as ""a big propaganda show for the autocrats.""
 Orban's uncoordinated trips prompted von der Leyen to order top officials to skip a series of meetings organised by Hungary's presidency - a de facto boycott - and his parliament address was twice delayed.
 The commission chief skewered Orban's tough talk on migration - accusing his government of ""throwing problems over your neighbour's fence"" with the early release of convicted people-traffickers.
 And she took aim at a Hungarian visa scheme for Russian nationals - calling it ""a back door for foreign interference."" 
 One speaker, Dutch MEP Gerben-Jan Gerbrandy of the centrist Renew party, depicted Orban as a character in a ""bad movie"" - a ""Mini-Me"" to Putin, or former US president Donald Trump - ""who looks, talks and acts exactly like Dr Evil, but just sits on his lap.""
 Hungarian opposition-leader-turned-MEP Peter Magyar lamented that Hungary under Orban's rule ""has gone from a bright star to what is officially the poorest and most corrupt country in the European Union.""
 Given a right of reply, Orban accused the EU chief of using the commission's power as a ""political weapon"" to attack Budapest, and complained that a Hungarian-led new group in the EU parliament, the Patriots for Europe, was being unfairly denied positions of authority. 
 ""We are never going to accept that European unity means that you tell us what to do and that we should keep quiet,"" he said.
 Patriots member Jorge Buxade Villalba was one of several lawmakers who rallied to Orban's defence, calling his speech ""a breath of fresh air in this parliament.""
 ""Women are safer in Budapest streets than in Brussels,"" he said. ""And if you were not so sectarian, we would see Hungary's government has a way of making a better life.""
 Ahead of Orban's speech, various political groups staged photo-op protests outside the hemicycle, with one banner reading ""No cash for corrupt"" - in a reference to the billions of euros on EU funds for Hungary currently frozen over rule-of-law concerns.
 Since returning to lead his country in 2010, Orban has moved to curb civil rights and tighten his grip on power, repeatedly clashing with Brussels over rule-of-law issues.
 But Orban has pointed at hard-right electoral gains from Italy to the Netherlands and Austria - and the rising influence of his Patriots for Europe - as evidence the political climate in Europe is slowly but surely shifting in his favour.

"Plans for Mqabba asphalt plant scrapped, Robert Abela announces",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/plans-mqabba-asphalt-plant-scrapped-robert-abela-announces.1092690,19-05-2024,"000082.png,000083.png","Plans for an asphalt plant just 500 metres away from people's homes in Mqabba have been scrapped, Prime Minister Robert Abela announced on Sunday.
 ""We cannot have the asphalt and tarmac industry inching any closer to residents, and so today I can proudly announce that the proposed plant in Mqabba will not be built,"" he told supporters at an election campaign rally in Żurrieq.
 ""Thanks to the work of Minister Silvio Schembri and INDIS we have found a solution that means the plant will not be built next door to the residents of Mqabba,"" he said.
  The issue concerns plans submitted to the Planning Authority last year for the relocation of the BIP Ltd tarmac plant from Ħal Far to a disused quarry in Mqabba, relatively close to residential areas.
 The issue had sparked controversy last November, when residents of Qrendi, Mqabba, Żurrieq, Kirkop and Siġġiewi took to the streets in protest, saying the relocation was ""madness"" and expressing concern over the impact the plant would have on their long-term health.
 The local councils of Qrendi, Mqabba, Safi, Rabat, Żurrieq, Kirkop and Siġġiewi had also declared they were against the plant’s relocation, and so did ADPD, describing the move as ""ill-placed"", along with the PN.
 
 On Sunday Abela did not say much else about the plans for the plant, but it is understood that the private operator has dropped his relocation plans.
  Abela said this was not the first time the government had closed down plants that were negatively impacting people's health in the south of Malta and he also vowed to never allow untouched public land to be given up for speculation.
 ""Untouched public land within development zones will not be given up for speculation and if it is to be developed, it will only be developed as is necessary for the needs of the community,"" he said.
 He said the government also intends to create new, public open spaces through Project Green. One of them is Pjazza Karmelitani in Żurrieq, which is within the development zone and will be transformed into a new open space.
 This was just one of many other greening projects lined up for the area, he added.
 It was the government that truly gave these projects the importance they deserved, and not the ""establishment"", he said.
 Abela spent most of the first part of his speech listing the government's projects in the economy, infrastructure and the environment, before telling his supporters that on the contrary, Bernard Grech and Roberta Metsola had ""not even one proposal"" to improve people's lives.
 They do not have a plan for you or the country, and neither for their work in Europe, he said. Rather, their only plan was to divide and destroy the country.
 ""They have a cruel plan to destroy the good that we're creating together. They're doing everything to divide us, to instigate, provoke and dishearten. While we were launching our manifesto, they were going about with two protests, not one,"" he said.
  ""Again this week, they went abroad, to the European Central Bank, to harm our country. How vile do you have to be to go to the ECB and ridicule one of our Maltese brothers?""
 He was speaking about former finance minister and current Central Bank governor Edward Scicluna, who faces criminal charges linked to the Vitals hospitals deal. MEP David Casa has written to the ECB about the case. 
 ""They will not succeed. They will not manage to stop our economy - the machine that has been producing so much good, that has been raising pensions, the minimum wage, children's allowance and so many other social benefits,"" he continued.
 ""Join me against those who want to wage a holy war against you and your beliefs. If you believe in a united Malta where there is true justice, more rights and unwavering work towards peace, June 8 is your best opportunity to send a clear message.""
 He then delivered a warning. The people needed to fight back ""in absolute calm"", in ""a positive way"", he said.
 ""Do not ever seek confrontation, because we are different than them. We love our country.""

"A need to discuss abortion is one major decision ahead, says Abela",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/a-need-discuss-abortion-one-major-decision-ahead-says-abela.1093788,06-11-2024,000103.png,"The introduction of abortion is among the discussions that the country needs to have even if it could be unpopular, Prime Minister Robert Abela said on Monday.
 Speaking after a three-hour meeting of the Labour Party's executive and parliamentary group, Abela said:  ""The discussion on abortion is one of the topics we need to talk about,""  while adding that he was not saying that abortion should be introduced.  
 He said the country had for too long been afraid to discuss the topic in a mature way even when hundreds were criminalised for having an abortion.
 ""Even if the discussion does not result in the introduction of this right, we would have had an informed discussion instead of keeping people in fear,"" he said.
 This, he said, was not a matter of winning votes but of responsibility. 
 
 Earlier on Monday Abela said that the electorate expected courageous decisions from the government in the wake of Saturday's elections.
 ""The PL needs to take necessary decisions for the country, even if they are not immediately popular but will be appreciated in the long term,"" he said. 
 Four years ago, on becoming prime minister, Abela had said that he was opposed to the introduction of abortion, warning that if former prime minister Joseph Muscat proposed it, he would oppose him.
 On Monday evening, Abela said that other topics that needed to be discussed were euthanasia and reforms in the family court.
 Abela insisted that the decision a few months ago to revise a law that would allow terminations when a woman's life was in grave danger was not a mistake. It had achieved its purpose by allowing doctors to intervene when a pregnant woman's life was in danger, and thus women were now better protected, he said.

Bernard Grech hits out at Labour ‘vote stealing’,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/bernard-grech-hits-labour-vote-stealing.1091668,28-04-2024,000115.png,"Bernard Grech on Sunday slammed the government for engaging in ""various vote stealing” exercises.
 The Opposition leader hit out at Prime Minister Robert Abela's government for targeting vulnerable people as part of a ""vote stealing"" exercise linked to disability benefits.
 On Thursday, Times of Malta revealed how Abela’s cabinet approved a  presidential pardon for disability applicants who had benefitted from fraudulent payments.
 In justifying the pardon, Abela said that the applicants - many of whom have been hauled to court - had been put through “trauma.”
 For Grech however, the “trauma” was one of the government’s own making.
 “Prime Minister, you are the one who put them through this trauma. It was a vote-stealing exercise, targeting the vulnerable, for votes.
 “For the prime minister, power is more important than people’s dignity. You and your ministers put them through this trauma,” Grech said.
 The Opposition leader said the government was just recently caught engaging in another vote-stealing scheme during the run-up to the June European Parliament and local council elections.
 Ninety-nine people were found to have switched their address to that of a yet uninhabited government housing block in Siġġiewi, in what the PN says is an attempt to influence the council elections in the locality.
 Grech said Labour was fearful of the PN’s strong lineup for the Siġġiewi local council election, and was therefore trying to steal votes through gerrymandering.
 “We caught them and we took them to court. We will now await justice. We are not saying these 99 people should not vote, but they should vote where they are currently living,” Grech said.
 The Opposition leader also pointed out the government was once again set to send cheques to people before an election.
 In 2022, an international election monitoring body said the government’s practice of sending out election cheques violated international standards.
 Grech urged people to use the June election as an opportunity to send a “clear message” that better leadership is needed in Malta.
 The PN is set to launch its election campaign during an event on May 1.

Glenn Micallef leaves 'convincing impression' in MEP grilling for commission job,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/glenn-micallef-convincing-impression-mep-grilling-commission-job.1101611,27-11-2024,000125.png,"Updated 12.25pm
 Glenn Micallef left a good impression on the committee that grilled Malta's nominee for the EU Commission.
 Micallef – who at 35 is the youngest of the 27-person proposed college – will be responsible for finding ways of involving young people in EU policymaking.
 In its evaluation letter following the November 4 grilling, the Committee on Culture and Education (CULT) said Micallef ""gave a convincing impression of his aptitude to be a member of the College of Commissioners and to carry out the specific tasks assigned to him"". 
 The evaluation letter was made public on Wednesday morning, hours before the European Parliament approved the new commission for the next five years. 
 To be confirmed, the College of Commissioners need the endorsement, en bloc, of a majority of the votes cast. Of the 688 votes cast by MEPs, 370 gave the go ahead, while 282 voted against.
 In it, CULT chair Nela Riehl noted that Micallef showed a clear commitment to key values of diversity, fairness, solidarity, democracy, gender equality and social inclusion.
 ""Overall, he demonstrated a very positive attitude to engaging with the members, notably through future participation in structured dialogues with the EP"". 
 Throughout the grilling, Riehl added, the commissioner-designate was able to answer members' questions with openness and clarity. In general, he showed a good grasp of the different policy areas.
 However, ""on occasions, his replies focused on headline policy priorities and lacked some details on future budgetary aspects within his portfolio,"" Riehl noted on the committee's behalf.
 The committee added that some specificities, such as on the future culture compass could have been better explained and a detailed overview of the explicit cooperation between the directorate-general for education and that for communications was equally absent.
 ""Coordinators were expecting a comprehensive overview on the future of the European Solidarity Corps programme as well as a stronger commitment in engaging with young people with fewer opportunities,"" the chair said in the letter, adding that coordinators expect a thorough follow-up by Micallef on these issues in the near future.  
 The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, which were also present at the grilling, greenlighted Micallef's nomination, saying he was ""qualified"".
 According to data published by Politico, Micallef seems to have also left an impression on all major political groupings in the European Parliament except for two right-wing groups. 
 Apart from the go-ahead from the European People’s Party - the parliament's biggest grouping - he even got a nod of approval from the Eurosceptic right-wing European Conservatives and Reformists Group.
 Before the vote on Wednesday, MEPs debated the new commission's programme with its President Ursula von der Leyen.
 Ahead of the vote, most parliamentarians from the EPP, S&D and Renew were expected to vote in favour. 
 PN MEPs Peter Agius and David Casa both told Times of Malta they will be backing up Micallef's nomination. Metsola, as parliament president, could technically vote in favour as a majority of leaders of the parliament's various groupings have officially decided to back the commission. 
 But some - most notably Spanish members of the EPP - expressed outrage that Spain's former civil defence minister Teresa Ribera has been made a commission vice-president. They said Ribera is responsible for massive failings that exacerbated the destruction of floods in Valencia last month. 
 Rebels were also expected within the S&D, as some of its MEPs are angered by the nomination to executive vice president of Italy’s nominee Raffaele Fitto, who forms part of Giorgia Meloni's coalition. 
 Maltese S&D MEPs Alex Agius Saliba, Daniel Attard and Thomas Bajada all backed the commission's nomination. 
 The greens were split, Politico reported on Tuesday, while the parliament's more fringe groupings - the Patriots, Sovereigntists and Left were expected to vote against.

"Malta rises up press freedom index, but there's a catch",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/malta-climbs-press-freedom-index-countries-got-worse.1091851,21-06-2024,000140.png,"Malta climbed 11 places on the World Press Freedom Index in 2024 - largely because the situation in other countries deteriorated.
 The index, compiled by Reporters Without Borders (RSF) and published on Friday, ranked Malta in 73rd place - up from 84th place out of 180 countries. 
 When comparing how EU member states fared on the index, Malta scored second to last.
 
 Greece was the only European country that ranked worse than Malta in 88th place, while Hungary - which the report singled out as a place where politicians are actively trying to shrink the media landscape for independent journalism - scored the third worst among the member states in 67th place.
 “Given the insignificant improvement of its score, [Malta's] progress by 11 places in the World Press Freedom Index can be attributed mainly to the deterioration of the situation in other countries,” Pavol Szalai, Head of the EU-Balkans Desk at RSF said.
 “The recommendations resulting from the public inquiry into the assassination of Daphne Caruana Galizia have not been implemented, while full justice has still not been served in this key case for the fight against impunity in Europe.”
 Szalai added that the Maltese government also failed to resolve issues related to the independence and sustainability of the media, provide more robust access to freedom of information or adequately protect journalists from SLAPP suits. 
 “The media landscape continues to be deeply polarised. However, the recently adopted European Media Freedom Act brings hope for improvement even in Malta,” he concluded. 
 According to the RSF ranking, press freedom in Malta was found to be in a “problematic” situation, sitting in the middle of the scale that runs from a “good” situation to a “very serious” situation. 
 From the 180 countries ranked by the index, only eight countries were found to currently have a “good situation” for press freedom. 
 Norway retained its top spot on the list, followed by Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands.
 Ireland, which last year was ranked the second-best country for press freedom, slipped six places and was ranked eight on this year’s list.
 Meanwhile, on the other end of the spectrum, the report found that Eritrea was the worst place in the world at maintaining a free press within its borders, followed by Syria, Afghanistan and North Korea. 
 Explaining the bottom ranking, RSF said that since being completely taken over by the Taliban, Afghanistan has incessantly persecuted journalists and slid down 44 places in the ranking.
 It also described both Syria and Eritrea as a “lawless zone” for the media, with both countries seeing a record number of journalists being detained, disappearing or being held hostage.
 RSF found that around the world press freedom is being threatened by political authorities, despite them being the supposed guarantors who are supposed to ensure its longevity. 
 Never has this been more evident than in this year’s political indicator - one of five used to score countries for the ranking - registering a global average fall of 7.6 points. 
 Governments are failing in their role to provide a safe environment for journalism to flourish and safeguard the public’s right to access independent and reliable information, the report’s authors said. 
 ""As more than half the world's population goes to the polls in 2024, RSF is warning of a worrying trend revealed by the 2024 World Press Freedom Index: a decline in the political indicator, one of five indicators detailed in the Index,” Anne Bocandé, RSF editorial director said.
 “States and other political forces are playing a decreasing role in protecting press freedom. This disempowerment sometimes goes hand in hand with more hostile actions that undermine the role of journalists, or even instrumentalise the media through campaigns of harassment or disinformation.
 ""Journalism worthy of that name is, on the contrary, a necessary condition for any democratic system and the exercise of political freedoms.”

 ""We're 30 days from an important election for the European Parliament and local councils and I want to talk about the PL's proposals,"" he told Times of Malta outside Parliament. 
  Abela was asked why Fearne was not being treated like any civil service employee facing criminal charges who would be automatically suspended on half pay until they cleared their name. 
 But Abela refused to entertain the direct question, saying he would rather focus on the EP and local council election which was just a month away.
 ""I replied to every possible question on the inquiry. We had two full days of questions with detailed replies. The case is now in court and we need to talk about how we're going to improve our country,"" he said. 
 Abela said that during the next 30 days, he wanted to explain to people how the Labour Party was proposing to improve various localities.
 He was speaking to Times of Malta moments after  he told parliament that Fearne would remain as deputy prime minister unless the inquiry clearly linked him to a crime.
 Fearne, who serves as deputy prime minister and EU Funds minister, is set to be charged with fraud and misappropriation in connection with the €400m deal to privatise three state hospitals.
 As health minister, he oversaw the deal between 2019 and last year, taking over that role from Konrad Mizzi.
 He is among dozens of people to be prosecuted, though he said earlier on Wednesday he has not yet been formally notified of the charges against him.
 The prosecutions come as a result of a years-long magisterial probe into the deal.
 The Nationalist Party said everyone cited in the inquiry and who holds a public post should resign, singling out Fearne and Central Bank Governor Edward Scicluna, who will also be charged.

 The explosive device was found inside a waste bin outside of the building. 
 It is understood that police zeroed in on the teen at a garage in Ħamrun, where he had been living. 
 Police later clarified that the suspect had been picked up from a site in Triq Guze Pace in Sta Venera. 
 Explosive material was found in that garage and the residents of the apartment block on top of it were evacuated from their homes as a precaution. 
 The material found in the garage is known as TATP,  a volatile explosive that is also called 'mother of Satan'. It is often used in terrorist attacks as it is potent and can be made out of household supplies.
  Residents who spent the night out of their homes are expected to be able to return there later this morning.
 The suspect was identified through CCTV footage, with sources saying that police had received reports of the man ""acting oddly"" in various other places on Thursday.
 He was wearing the same clothes as the person spotted on CCTV outside Labour HQ. 
 An explosives team was called to Mile End on Thursday after the building's security officials spotted what was described as a ""small device"" outside the Labour Party's headquarters. 
 Neighbours also reported hearing a ""small explosion"" coming from a dust bin very early on Thursday morning.

 Party leader Sandra Gauci said at a press conference that there was no doubt that former prime minister Joseph Muscat, his chief of staff Keith Schembri and former minister Konrad Mizzi had to be held to account for their actions.  
 But in the meantime, the health service could not keep up with demand and waiting lists were growing longer. That was what the consequences of fraud and corruption were about.
 Indeed, action should have been taken earlier, with the scandal already evident in a 2020 report by the Audit Office which made clear that this was an arranged concession designed for public funds to be used for private gain.
 Jack Tolu, ADPD treasurer and election candidate, said the health sector in general had suffered while the Vitals fraud was underway, but none more than the mental health sector, with the mental health hospital reduced to a disgrace.
 As a consequence of the scandal, some of society's most vulnerable people found a lack of support and care and were placed at greater risk.

 He also commended Bernard Grech for the Nationalist Party’s strides in the polls.
 “Halfway through the mandate, three seats – that is your success,” he remarked, highlighting the party’s progress in last June’s European Elections and recent polls which put the PN ahead of the PL by a slight margin.
 The assembly kicked off on Thursday afternoon at the PN headquarters in Tal-Pietà and will continue on Friday.  
 It meets three to five times a year and brings together the EPP leadership and the international secretaries of its member parties.vIt defines the political positions of the EPP between each congress, deciding on membership applications and political guidelines.
 The two-day meeting gathers key figures including European Parliament President Roberta Metsola and European Commission Vice-President Dubravka Šuica to discuss pressing European challenges.
 Former prime minister Lawrence Gonzi, former PN leader Simon Busuttil, and nationalist MEPs David Casa and Peter Agius were among the attendees.
 In his opening address, PN leader Bernard Grech expressed pride in hosting the event in Malta, highlighting the nation’s commitment to European values. 
 He reaffirmed the PN's dedication to democracy, human rights, and the rule of law, underlining Malta’s role despite its small size.
 Grech called for bold action to address pressing challenges, including rising living costs, climate change, migration, and digital transformation.
  He emphasised the need for sustainable economic policies, a just green transition, shared responsibility in migration, and technological innovation that safeguards human rights. He also stressed the importance of European solidarity and inclusivity.
 Grech wrapped up his speech with a call for unity and collaboration, urging EPP members to ensure Europe remains a beacon of democracy and progress, with Malta contributing as a strong and integral voice within the European project.
 Weber meanwhile acknowledged Malta’s intensive political culture and stressed the need for change under the socialist-led Labour government, which he criticised for doubling the national debt, and neglecting middle-class living conditions and the rule of law.
 He pledged the EPP’s unwavering support for the Nationalist Party, emphasising the shared goals of competitiveness, controlled migration, and sustainable implementation of the Green Deal.
 Reflecting on the EPP’s broader achievements, Weber noted the increase in EPP-led governments across Europe. He championed leaders like Metsola and Ursula von der Leyen, praising their stewardship of key European institutions.
 ""For the EPP, there is no small or big country. We have the EP President from the smallest country and the EC President from the biggest country. We are the pro-European party of Europe, and we will only work with parties that are pro-Ukraine and pro-rule of law.""
 Addressing pressing global issues, Weber called the war in Ukraine a defining moment, condemning Iranian-made drones killing civilians.
 He affirmed the EPP’s commitment to EU enlargement in the Western Balkans and advancing Mediterranean priorities.
 “The EPP is strong, united, and ready to lead Europe forward,” Weber concluded.
 Earlier Weber also fielded questions on allegations of investigations into his 2019 political campaign and replied that “so far only journalists are writing about this but judicial state authorities have not called an investigation”.
 “Campaigns are audited by the EP ten times and over.  There is no reason to be concerned,” he said.
  Former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko also addressed the EPP’s assembly.
 Observing a minute’s silence for Ukraine’s fallen heroes, Poroshenko declared optimism in the face of prolonged conflict, saying ""Putin will be defeated because we stand together"".
 He urged the West not to fear escalation, asserting that a third world war is already underway, citing Iranian drones, North Korean soldiers in Russia, and Chinese missile components used by Putin’s arsenal.
 Poroshenko stressed NATO membership for Ukraine as vital for peace in Europe, calling for full military support and enhanced air defences for his country.

OSCE to scrutinise pre-election cheques,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/osce-scrutinise-preelection-cheques.1092183,05-10-2024,000185.png,"The OSCE will be looking into pre-election cheques “and other issues key to the election” when their election observation kicks off later this month, the organisation told Times of Malta.
 In 2022, the OSCE, which is the the world’s largest regional security organisation, said that the government’s decision to hand out tax refund cheques in the run-up to that year’s election did “not conform to international standards and good practice” as it could blur the line between party and State.
 Asked whether it held the same views two years on, with the voters once again receiving cheques just weeks before polling day, an OSCE spokesperson said that their “assessment of the 2022 election certainly stands, but it is not necessarily directly applicable for a different case at a different time”.
 “We will be sending analysts to Malta as part of our election observation of the forthcoming elections to the European Parliament and will look into this and other issues key to the election,” the spokesperson added.
 Malta took the helm of OSCE this year, after a diplomatic tug-of-war which saw Estonia’s bid to chair the organisation vetoed by Russia.
  The OSCE's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) specialises in observing elections and is widely considered to be the gold standard for ensuring free and fair elections the world over.
 The cheques are handed out every year but their timing has raised suspicion, frequently landing on voters’ doorsteps amid an electoral campaign.
 In 2022, a police spokesperson told Times of Malta that the police do not consider the cheques to be a form of  corrupt practice.
 While previous cheques were accompanied by a letter signed by Prime Minister Robert Abela and Finance Minister Clyde Caruana, this year’s accompanying letter bears no signature.
 The letter describes the cheque as “recognition of you as a worker contributing to the success of our country”, saying that Malta has “the lowest unemployment rate” and has registered strong economic growth “despite international challenges”, going on to list several government initiatives and schemes.
 The letter also says that the cost of the cheques has risen from €11.6m in 2018 to €27m this year, with over 268,000 people expected to receive a payout this year alone.
 Abela has brushed off criticism of the timing, saying that “election or not, you received that cheque every year”.

 On Libya, Abela said that Malta has long advocated for stability in the country, explaining the importance of drawing Libya's factions closer for Libyans to have a legitimate process to keep progressing in its own best interests. 
 The prime minister also expressed concern about the escalation of war in the Middle East, particularly in Lebanon. 
 On Gaza, Abela said that Malta welcomed the International Court of Justice's decision to protect the interests of civilians in the Gaza Strip and demand humanitarian access corridors, particularly in Rafah. 
 The Maltese Government has also repeated its pleas for Hamas to release Israeli hostage taken on October 7, he added. 
 Abela said that dialogue remains our strongest tool and that other parties, including the EU, should work together towards peace and stability in the Middle East and the Mediterranean. 
 Malta remains firm in its position towards finding a two-state solution where the people of both Israel and Palestine can live beside each other in peace and security. 
 Guterres thanked Malta for its role in securing peace thanks to its important work chairing the Security Council. 
 He also commended Malta's efforts at putting other important issues on the council's agenda, including climate change, equality, female emancipation and the protection of children in zones of armed conflict. 
  In New York on Friday, Foreign Minister Ian Borg called for an immediate ceasefire in Lebanon and Gaza during a UN Security Council dialogue with the League of Arab States. 
 “The escalation of the Israel-Hamas conflict into the wider region is no longer a looming spectre but has now become a reality. The deeply alarming developments across the Blue Line and into Lebanon are increasing civilian deaths and mass displacement on both sides. A ceasefire is now more crucial than ever before,” he said. 
 Borg encouraged promoting dialogue and de-escalation and welcomed ongoing efforts at brokering a ceasefire.
 “The harrowing plight of civilians in Gaza and the Palestinian territories cannot be ignored any longer. The humanitarian situation is catastrophic, and women and children continue to suffer in a disproportionate manner. Humanitarians are working in desperate conditions, and too many have paid the ultimate price,” Borg continued. 
 He said that Malta will continue to advocate for a “credible and irreversible” realisation of a two-state solution. 
 During the General Assembly, Borg also co-hosted a Leaders’ Meeting of the Coalition for Addressing Sea-level Rise and its Existential Threat (C-SET) and participated at the Annual Meeting of the Informal Ministerial Network for the International Criminal Court. 
 He also had meetings with Secretary-General of the United Nations Antonio Guterres and with Foreign Ministers Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan of the United Arab Emirates, Hakan Fidan of Türkiye, and Rashid Meredov of Turkmenistan.
  In a plenary session of the UN General Assembly, Health Minister Jo Etienne Abela stressed the importance of revising processes in the global fight against antimicrobial resistance. 
 He emphasised the importance of keeping up political momentum to push evidence-based actions among all the member countries. 
 Having sustainable, efficient and responsible national, regional and global governance structures is crucial to having an effective response, Abela said. 
 The minister also spoke about the UN finding the way forward towards achieving universal health care, to also be able to address antimicrobial resistance and save more lives.

Fact-check: Was Ryan Spagnol’s conviction hidden from sight?,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/factcheck-was-ryan-spagnol-conviction-hidden-sight.1097178,26-08-2024,"000284.png,000285.png,000286.png","Claim: Ryan Spagnol’s sentence was not immediately published on the courts’ online database, as always happens.
 Verdict: In cases like Spagnol’s, sentences are rarely, if ever, published online. One exception is if a party appeals the judgement, as Spagnol is doing in this case.
 News that Ryan Spagnol, Robert Abela’s cabinet secretary, had been caught drink-driving filtered through on Thursday, after former PN MP Jason Azzopardi posted screenshots taken from the court’s sentence to his Facebook page.
 The screenshots revealed how Spagnol had been caught driving with almost twice the legal limit in the days leading up to last Christmas.
 Spagnol was later charged and found guilty of three of the four charges he faced by magistrate Jean Paul Grech on May 24. He was ordered to pay a €1,800 fine and had his driving licence confiscated for six months.
 The news remained out of public view until the judgment was published on the court’s online system in mid-August, almost three months later.
 Writing on Facebook, Azzopardi claimed that the fact that the sentence wasn't immediately uploaded ""as always happens"", was deliberate and could only have taken place upon the orders of Robert Abela (""there's no other way"").
 Azzopardi argued that the publication was timed to coincide with last week’s public holiday, in the hope that it would go unnoticed.
  But lawyers and court officials who spoke to Times of Malta say that things are a little more complicated and that judgments in cases like Spagnol’s are rarely published online in the first place.
 Malta’s courts allow the public to look up details of past and present court cases through an online platform called eCourts, administered by the Court Services Agency, an agency that falls under the justice ministry.
 When searching for a court case, users are presented with some basic details, including who is involved in the case, the name of the magistrate or judge presiding over the case, and what type of case it happens to be (whether it’s a civil or criminal case, if it’s a constitutional matter, whether it’s an appeal to a previous sentence, and so forth).
 Once a case is decided, users can also download a transcript of the court’s decree, laying out the magistrate’s verdict, their reasoning behind it, as well as the punishment that is being meted out.
 Not quite, according to several lawyers and court officials who spoke to Times of Malta.
 While many sentences do make their way to the online system, several other minor cases do not. In most cases, judgments are published online on the same day they are handed down, though days-long delays are not unusual.   
 Lawyers say that in cases of summary proceedings which carry a potential sentence of under two years’ imprisonment, sentences are rarely logged on the online system.
 They point to several examples of this – minor collisions, district cases, minor tax fraud, hunting infringements, minor disputes and so on. All of these tend to be left off the system and their sentences are seldom even typed out, let alone uploaded online.
 Instead, the magistrate’s decree tends to simply be written down on the charge sheet.
 Minor traffic-related cases, such as the one involving Spagnol, almost always face the same fate.
 The reasons behind this are a matter of practicality, sources say. With Malta’s courts being notoriously understaffed and slow, wasting precious time on transcribing sentences of minor cases is deemed not to be a priority.
  While it is not customary for sentences of summary proceedings to be automatically uploaded online, there may be some cases in which they are typed out and eventually uploaded, court sources say.
 This could happen for several reasons.
 One is if one of the parties chooses to file an appeal against the original judgment - though some lawyers who spoke to Times of Malta recounted cases in which judgments were not uploaded online even after an appeal was lodged. 
 Such sentences also end up online if somebody (either one of the two parties involved in the case or anybody else, including members of the public) requests a copy of the sentence.
 But, according to lawyers who spoke to Times of Malta, even in cases where the sentence is typed out, it is rarely, if ever, uploaded to the online system.
 Ultimately, court sources say, a magistrate can choose to instruct court clerks to type out a sentence and upload it, but this is far from common practice when it comes to minor cases.
 When contacted by Times of Malta, Spagnol confirmed that he has filed an appeal against the conviction. Spagnol said he lodged the appeal in June. It has yet to be heard.  
 Replying to questions, a justice ministry spokesperson said that “cases of ordinary competence (such as traffic offences which carry the penalty of less than two years prison) are only typed if requested by the parties or in case of appeal”.
 In the case of Magistrate Jean Paul Grech - the magistrate who heard Spagnol's case - only 12 of the 189 sentences he handed down between April (when he started hearing cases) and July were uploaded.
 “These would be cases where a formal copy has been prepared on request,” the spokesperson said.
 Although many sentences are published on the courts’ searchable online database, the majority of minor cases involving a potential sentence of less than two years’ imprisonment – such as the case involving Spagnol – remain unpublished.
 The justice ministry, as well as court sources, say that the only instances in which these types of sentences are eventually typed and published are when somebody has requested a copy, either as part of an appeals process, by one of the parties to the case, or even by a member of the public.
 Lawyers who spoke to Times of Malta say that even in those cases, the sentences are often not necessarily uploaded, but may simply be typed out and handed to whoever is requesting a copy.
 The reasons why Spagnol's sentence was eventually published remain unclear, although it may well have been spurred by the appeal he filed in June. It is also not known whether there were any efforts to hide matters under the carpet. But the fact that the sentence did not immediately make it onto the online system is not unusual.
 The claim is therefore misleading as although the claim may, in itself, be partly or entirely true, it is presented in a manner that is not representative of the facts within a broader context.

Ministry silent on Norma Saliba role if she is elected PL president,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/ministry-silent-norma-saliba-role-elected-pl-president.1097295,28-08-2024,000290.png,"The culture ministry is refusing to be drawn into whether Norma Saliba, the former PBS head of news who is contesting the role of Labour Party president, will be stepping down from her role at the helm of the Centre for Maltese Language if elected.
 Replying to questions, a spokesperson for the culture ministry said that “the ministry does not comment on scenarios” and will only comment on Saliba’s role “after internal PL elections are over and the results made public”.
 The spokesperson confirmed that Saliba is still a PBS employee – albeit seconded to the Centre the Maltese Language – saying that the well-documented facts about her employment “remain unchanged” since they were first reported.
 PBS also declined to comment, saying that Saliba’s employment had been the subject of an investigation by the standards commissioner and that it “has no further comments to make”.
 When asked whether she would be stepping down from the role once elected, Saliba told Times of Malta that she would wait for the election’s outcome and “take the necessary decisions at that point”.
 Asked when she became a Labour Party member, Saliba simply said that she was “not a member of any party when I was PBS head of news”.
 “I always respected the duties and responsibilities of my role throughout my time at PBS, both as a journalist and as head of news,” she said.
 Saliba’s formal affiliation with the Labour Party’s administration would seemingly preclude her from holding a role at the public broadcaster, with PBS ethics guidelines saying that “all PBS (news) staff should refrain from publicly associating themselves with a political party”.
 The guidelines also instruct employees to refrain from endorsing political parties, participating in any campaign, express support for a political party or cause, or act in any way that “that damages PBS’s reputation for strict neutrality in reporting on politics and government”.
 Saliba will be pitted against lawyer and former Msida mayor Alex Sciberras, who announced that he would be running for the role of party president shortly after fellow lawyer Ramona Attard said that she would not be recontesting.
 
 She has a long history at the public broadcaster, which she joined after a stint as a sports reporter at the Labour Party’s TV station ONE.
 She was named PBS head of news and editor in 2020, eventually stepping down as editor in 2021 amidst an internal power struggle. She eventually resigned as head of news two years later, saying that she had been the victim of a “character assassination” campaign.
 A month later, Saliba was controversially appointed to head the newly-formed Centre for Maltese Language in a move that spurred a row between the National Council of the Maltese Language and the culture ministry.

"Independent Steve Zammit Lupi storms into Żebbuġ council, along with his mum",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/independent-steve-zammit-lupi-storms-zebbug-council-along-mum.1093879,06-12-2024,000319.png,"When Steve Zammit Lupi was first elected to the Żebbuġ (Malta) local council in 2019, he was overwhelmed by the 947 first-count votes he received. 
 On Wednesday, he more than doubled that tally as he stormed to the top of the rankings in Żebbuġ's 2024 local council election. 
 The independent candidate will now need to form a coalition with either Labour or Nationalist blocs within the town's council. But he will have a valuable and loyal ally at the council table - his own mother. 
 Zammit Lupi's popularity - he obtained 2,342 first count votes - rubbed off on his mother Lillibeth, who also ran for a council seat as an independent.
  She received 98 first-count votes but secured a seat as a councillor thanks to the 1,045 votes she inherited from her son. 
 ""I stand with Steve and am very proud of him,"" Lillibeth Zammit Lupi told Times of Malta after the result. 
 ""Yes, he's now my boss,"" she acknowledged. ""But at home I'm still in charge."" 
 Steve Zammit Lupi said the result had left him speechless.
 ""I have no words,"" Steve Zammit Lupi said. ""I will need to negotiate with the other two sides, to find a way forward. But every decision I will take will be for Żebbuġ's benefit,"" he said.
 Zammit Lupi made environmental and sustainable initiatives a key cornerstone of his first term as councillor, championing cycling initiatives, car-free days, tree planting and litter cleaning in the town. 
 That resonated with Żebbuġ residents, who spurned candidates from the traditional big parties and instead cast their votes his way. 
 Although Zammit Lupi dominated voting in the town's election, he is not assured of the mayorship: under Malta's local council rules, he (and Lillibeth Zammit Lupi) will need to form a coalition with the Nationalist Party (which won three seats) or get the backing of Labour (which won four) to lead the council as its mayor.

EU wants pharma sector to pay for wastewater treatment. Will that impact prices?,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/eu-directive-raise-medicine-prices-peter-agius-fears.1101161,22-11-2024,000321.png,"Nationalist MEP Peter Agius has accused the government of backing a European directive that, he argues, will lead to higher prices for medicines in Malta.
 Agius criticised the government’s recent vote in the Council of Ministers on the EU’s Wastewater Treatment Directive, alleging it contradicts assurances made to protect consumers from rising medicinal costs.
 The directive introduces an Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) on medicines and cosmetics, making pharmaceutical companies responsible for 80% of water treatment costs across member states.
 A government spokesperson, however, dismissed Agius’s claim and highlighted several safeguards introduced during Council discussions as a result of the concerns raised by Malta and other Member States.
 The directive includes updated provisions under the EU’s Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive (UWWTD). 
 Critics include Medicines Europe and the Association of Pharmaceutical Producers but also patients’ organisations, who argue that these costs are likely to be passed on to consumers.
 Agius further highlighted the compounded effect this measure will have on Maltese patients, “who already face high medicine costs and limited access to innovative treatments compared to their European counterparts”.
 “According to data from the European Federation of Pharmaceuticals Industries, Malta ranks lowest in Europe for the number of medicines covered by public health insurance, with only six per cent coverage compared to an EU average of 45%,” he said.
 However, the Ministry for Environment, Energy and Enterprise said that during discussions “Malta reiterated its concerns about the socio-economic impact of such provisions, particularly on patients needing access to medicines as part of their treatment”.
 In reply to questions, MEEE said that “flexibilities were introduced to provide member states with more opportunities to protect vulnerable consumers and the accessibility, availability and affordability of medicinal products.”
 These safeguards include the possibility of member states financing part of the costs for quaternary treatment where the application of EPR could affect medicine accessibility, availability and affordability, it said.
 Malta argued in Council that the directive would impose a disproportional social cost on Maltese patients and inserted a formal statement in the Council minutes emphasising the importance of protecting patients and ensuring that the directive does not jeopardize access to medicines.
 Agius points out that despite these declarations, government voted in favour of the directive on Tuesday, November 5, without incorporating any safeguard against potential medicine price hikes.
 “Malta’s situation points to a clear national imperative to take all measures to protect the Maltese consumer from additional price increases on medicines,” said Agius.
 “What does the government do instead? It supports an EU Directive which will lead to price increases and greater challenges with medicines availability!”
 Agius described the government’s stance as “inconsistent” with the needs of Maltese consumers.
 “You can’t keep treating people like fools on what you do in Europe! In Malta, they say they will protect Maltese consumers from higher medicine prices, then they vote for the directive which will do the exact opposite in Brussels,” Agius stated.
 A spokesperson for the ministry insisted that the national implementation of the directive will require extensive public consultation.
 “This will allow everyone to provide their input into the eventual transposition of the directive, with a view to ascertaining that the practical organization of the EPR framework in Malta takes full consideration of the need to protect access to medicines, particularly for vulnerable patients,” the ministry explained.

Watch: Message in a ballot - PL MPs comment on Saturday's election results,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/watch-message-ballot-pl-mps-comment-saturday-election-results.1093787,06-11-2024,000356.png,"Ministers and Labour Party MPs had their say following Saturday’s election as they walked into parliament on Monday. 
 Most stuck to Prime Minister Robert Abela’s stance that Sunday’s election results were an expression of trust in the government but also a message that they needed to work harder.
 Others added their two cents. 
 “It (the election) was an expression of confidence in the government but there is a message that must be taken on board. The prime minister was clear yesterday that the message will be taken up,” Justice Minister Jonathan Attard said. 
 The Labour Party saw a majority of around 40,000 votes drop to 8,500 on Sunday, with the PN now seemingly within striking distance. 
 Transport Minister Chris Bonett said that the government’s politicians need to rull up their sleeves and work harder. Still, the people said that it is the Labour Party that should lead the country, he said
  Energy minister Miriam Dalli said that the Labour Party had hoped for a far better result, especially when considering the work done by the government. 
 “The result is what it is, and we are all analysing it. There is a message, and we will address that,” she said. 
 Her cabinet colleague, Finance Minister Clyde Caruana, said that the people had their say on Saturday. 
 “They sent a message and that message was very clear, you don’t need my interpretation,” he said.
 Asked if he saw Sunday’s result as a win for Labour, Caruana reiterated that “on Saturday people spoke out, and spoke very clearly”. 
 Youth junior minister Keith Azzopardi Tanti said that the election result meant there was a need to work harder and do more good. 
 “The general election is in two-and-a-half years, and there are more results to be achieved that will benefit the people,” he said.
 Fisheries parliamentary secretary Alicia Bugeja said that “a post mortem” was necessary to see the best way to serve the people. 
 Housing minister Roderick Galdes was asked whether the Siġġiewi Housing controversy hurt the Labour Party in the polls. 
 “People live there now. I can’t understand why the PN did not want those people to have the right to vote,” he said. (They were not denied the right to vote, but a court said they should vote at their proper place of residence)  
 Galdes said he respected the court’s decision but that did not mean he agreed with it. 
 Backbench MP Edward Zammit Lewis said the election was a victory, but the reduced gap must be taken into account. 
 “I am convinced that the prime minister will take the necessary decisions,” he said. 
 He said the impact that Joseph Muscat had on the campaign, particularly his participation at candidates' events, needed to be analysed. 
 Tourism minister Clayton Bartolo made a similar point. 
 “I think when it comes to Joseph Muscat and all the analysis that needs to be made, it's not about just answering a question on the spot and taking it out of context. One needs to sit down, analyse things seriously, and if decisions need to be taken, they will be”. 
 He warned against “shooting from the hip decisions”.

ADPD salutes public transport workers: 'You provide an essential service',timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/adpd-salutes-public-transport-workers-you-provide-essential-service.1091797,05-01-2024,000366.png,"Public transport workers deserve a special thank you this workers’ day, the Green Party said on Wednesday.
 ADPD representatives met with various drivers at the Valletta bus terminus on Wednesday morning, which marks International Labour Day.
 “These workers provide an essential service for a country, a service that offers solutions to one of the biggest problems that has plagued our country: traffic. Through their work, these workers keep thousands of cars from our roads every day, having a positive impact not only on the volume of traffic but also on the quality of the air and the health of our children,” the party’s Deputy Secretary General Mario Mallia said.
 There have been various reports of physical and verbal attacks against bus drivers in recent weeks. 
 The prime minister has said that he is open to revising laws to better protect such workers, and in its statement on Wednesday ADPD said it would “fully support” any such amendments.  https://timesofmalta.com/article/prime-minister-open-changing-laws-protect-bus-drivers.1091517
 ADPD also urged the transport regulator and Malta Public Transport, the private operator responsible for Malta’s bus service,  to offer drivers and passengers “peace of mind” about buses being roadworthy. The company was targeted by a former employee in a judicial protest filed last month, which alleged that buses deemed not safe to drive were being rushed into service.
 Green Party chairperson Sandra Gauci said it was no coincidence that many violent incidents targeted non-Maltese workers, and described that as an “ugly symptom of racism that sometimes rears its head.”
 “Workers remain workers, regardless of nationality, skin colour, and belief,” Gauci said.
 She also took a dig at the May 1 rallies being organised by Malta’s two major parties, saying Workers’ Day “is a time for reflection on workers' rights, particularly those of the most vulnerable among them, rather than for the triumphalism of large-scale gatherings.” 
 The party paid tribute to vulnerable workers across the country, noting that many were exploited and ended up victims of industries like the construction sector.
 “A modern democratic country cannot boast of an increase in wealth if this wealth is being generated off the backs of exploited workers,” Gauci said.
 After the press conference, Gauci and other ADPD officials distributed ftiras to public transport workers and keychain produced sustainably as a sign of gratitude for their work, especially on this day.

'Bulebel industrial area fields to be protected through amended local plans': PM,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/bulebel-industrial-area-fields-protected-amended-local-plans-pm.1092202,05-09-2024,000367.png,"Robert Abela promised on Thursday the government would amend 2006 local plans to protect agricultural land around the Bulebel Industrial Estate from future development.
 Addressing party supporters in Marsaxlokk, the Prime Minister said that just like the government was amending local plans to protect Ħondoq ir-Rummien Bay and Marsascala, it was similarly planning to protect rural land in the Żejtun industrial area.
 Abela's promise comes two months after community activist group Wirt iż-Żejtun asked the government to amend the local plans for the area.
 Land around the industrial estate had been earmarked for expansion in the 1980s. It retained that designation when planners updated local plans in 2006.
 In 2010 the land was placed under the responsibility of Malta Industrial Parks (now INDIS) and in late 2015 farmers in the Wied iż-Żrinġ area received eviction notices, giving them one month to vacate their land.
 The notices sparked public uproar and a years-long battle by Żejtun residents and activists to drop the plan.
 In 2018, the government dropped plans to vacate the land and a meeting of parliament’s environment and planning committee called for the amendment of the area’s local plan.
 However, that recommendation was never followed through.
 On Thursday Abela recalled ""the controversy a few years ago"" when the government wanted to extend the industrial area.
 ""Back then, Wirt iż-Żejtun had spoken up and kicked off a discussion on whether the country wanted to favour the industry over the environment.
 ""For us the environment is a priority... and I can today confirm that the local plan for the Bulebel area will be modified to ensure once and for all that no development will happen to the detriment of agricultural land,"" he said.

 Karl Gouder’s relatives and friends are still trying to come to terms with his death, saying everything seemed ""so normal"" and that he was excited about his bid to become the Nationalist Party's next general secretary. 
 Gouder was found dead in Valletta on Tuesday morning, close to the former Customs House.
 Police sources say the death is not being treated as suspicious, but the family's puzzlement - along with allegations that Gouder had received threats in the days before his death - have sparked many rumours about his final hours. 
 Maxine Gouder, his sister-in-law, has now gone public with a request for information.
 ‘If anyone has information about Karl during the days leading to his death please reach out [to] Nicky Gouder [his brother],’ she wrote on Facebook.
  Their call was later backed by both the PN and Labour Party. The PN called on authorities to ""uncover what led to the tragic death"" of the 45-year-old, while Labour said it wanted the truth and justice to emerge. 
 ""At such a moment, maturity and national unity should prevail,"" it said.
 Former PN MP Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando told Times of Malta he had filed a police report about ""reliable information"" that Gouder was threatened, though he acknowledged he had no proof. 
 ""I would not have been a good citizen had I received this information and decided to keep it to myself. I don’t have tangible proof. But it was my duty to inform the police"", he said.
 Pullicino Orlando declined to name the person who he believes threatened Gouder, and who he described as ""vile and filthy"" [aħdar u żibel] in a Facebook post. 
 He told Times of Malta that after he published that post, a different source ""just as reliable"" as the first had given him similar information.  
  Blogger and author Mark Camilleri has also claimed that Gouder was being threatened, saying former OPM official-turned-blogger Neville Gafà was behind those threats. 
 Gafà told Times of Malta  that was untrue and that he had never met, spoken or texted Gouder. 
 Meanwhile, sources within the Nationalist Party told Times of Malta that the party has formally asked the police to investigate comments about Gouder uploaded to social media.
 Times of Malta also spoke to a PN insider who last spoke to Karl Gouder on Monday at 8pm, the night before his death. 
 ""I called Karl to wish him well on his next step in politics and the call lasted a couple of minutes.  Karl was in a public place, because I could hear a lot of noise in the background.  But he sounded as normal as ever.""
 Last Sunday, Times of Malta broke the news about Gouder’s intention to stand for secretary general of the Nationalist Party. He has was hief operations officer of the PN’s media arm, previously mayor of St Julian’s and also served as a PN MP for six years across three legislatures. 
 A handful of PN MPs told Times of Malta that Gouder had contacted them one by one last Friday, to inform them personally that he had decided to run for the post vacated by Michael Piccinino.  
 ""He said he wanted to inform us directly before the story was out in the media.  That’s how things are done and shows what Karl was made of,"" one PN MP said.
 Another source said that Gouder sounded ""jovial and eager to get to work"" in the past days. 
 ""His last message to me over the phone was simple: 'together we can do this', "" said another MP.  
 ""Usually I would tell that if someone is going through a rough patch but Karl certainly wasn’t, or was he?""
 On Sunday, Gouder took centre stage at the Mediterranean Conference Centre in Valletta, handing out trophies to the winners at the end of the Konkors Kanzunetta Indipendenza.
  On Monday, he participated in PN internal meetings both in the morning and late into the afternoon. Then in the early hours of the evening, he received a phone call in a public place. The next morning, he was found dead. 
 A police investigation and a magisterial inquiry into the death are currently ongoing.
 ""It is not prudent to divulge further information at this stage,"" a spokesman said.

 Last month Times of Malta reported on how Michael Debono, Giorgio Grigolo, and Luke Bjorn Scerri were  barred from competing in a European cybersecurity challenge they qualified for last month. 
 This is because there is still an ongoing police investigation against them after they were arrested for exposing a security weakness in the student application FreeHour. 
 The students had e-mailed FreeHour to inform the company of the security flaw and requested a reward – or ‘bug bounty’ – a common practice in ethical or ‘white hat’ hacking. But instead of a payoff, the University of Malta students were arrested, strip-searched and had their computer equipment seized.
 To date, no charges have been filed against them. 
 In a statement on Tuesday, PN shadow ministers Ivan J Bartolo and Bernice Bonello said the situation is evidence of just how much the government has neglected the talents of local youth and failed to capitalise on the opportunity for Malta to participate in the European Cybersecurity Challenges. 
 Even though these students showed talent and dedication to their craft, they were being denied the opportunity to represent their country, on top of being punished for discovering a security flaw and reporting it. 
 Bartolo and Bonello said the way the government acted indicated huge shortcomings. 
 The students were informed way too late that they were being disqualified after they had already triumphed in national trials, they said. 
 The prolonged investigation had also left them in limbo and undoubtedly left them doubting their enthusiasm for cybersecurity, the MPs added. 
 ""The lack of a national strategy for cybersecurity means that we have no framework to support and raise digital innovation in our country,"" they said. 
 ""As a result of this bitter experience, many students have been discouraged from involving themselves in the digital sphere and this puts the potential of such an essential sector for our economic future at risk. We cannot allow fear to shred innovation."" 
 They appealed to the government to put an end to this saga as quickly as possible and ensure that Malta's politics on cybersecurity create an environment where cybersecurity can flourish. 
 Youth must be encouraged to adapt to the digital future in order to succeed in a rapidly changing environment. 
 ""Malta's future depends on this. Let us not lose this opportunity to support our students and showcase Maltese talent on an international platform.""

Former Mater Dei chief Celia Falzon appointed JobsPlus CEO,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/former-mater-dei-chief-celia-falzon-appointed-jobsplus-ceo.1097112,23-08-2024,000534.png,"Celia Falzon, the former boss of Mater Dei Hospital, has been appointed CEO of state jobs agency JobsPlus.
 Falzon resigned from her top hospital job in May, citing personal reasons. Her resignation followed that of  Carmen Ciantar from her role as head of the Foundation for Medical Services.
 She will now lead Jobsplus, the government said in a statement on Friday morning. Falzon takes over that job from Leonid McKay, who only served as agency CEO for a few months before being appointed  Labour Party's new CEO last week.  McKay takes over that job from Randolph Debattista, who  quit for unspecified reasons. 
 Falzon, who holds a Master's degree in Business Administration and is specialised in strategic planning, spent four years as CEO of Mater Dei Hospital, the country's largest public hospital. 
 She took on that job February 2020, just weeks before COVID-19 hit Malta.
 As Mater Dei CEO, she led the hospital through the tense and stressful period of the pandemic, when all eyes were on the health system.
 Prior to that role, Falzon was CEO of the Pharmacy of Your Choice (POYC) scheme and chief of Regulatory Affairs at the Malta Communications Authority.

Former TVM head of news Norma Saliba to run for Labour Party president,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/norma-saliba-run-labour-party-president.1097186,24-08-2024,000538.png,"Updated 4.20pm with PN statement
 Former TVM head of news Norma Saliba announced she is to run for the post of Labour Party president.
 On Saturday, Saliba said she was urged to contest the post by Labour leader Robert Abela and had the backing of Ian Borg and Alex Agius Saliba, the two confirmed candidates for the party’s two deputy leadership posts.
 “New impetus and fresh ideas are needed for the party to renew itself,” she wrote on Facebook on Saturday. “I will work with all my strength to fulfil party delegates’  wish of ensuring Labour remains Malta’s biggest political force.”
 Saliba announced her candidacy on Saturday morning, confirming what lawyer and former PN MP Jason Azzopardi wrote on Facebook hours earlier. 
 Azzopardi linked Saliba's bid to a scandal surrounding the prime's minister's cabinet secretary Ryan Spagnol.   
 Saliba’s decision to run for the presidency means Labour delegates are poised for a competitive contest when internal party elections are held on September 13 and 14.
  Lawyer Alex Sciberras, the son of the late judge Philip Sciberras, said on Friday that he would be contesting the post.
 The party’s two deputy leadership posts, on the other hand, appear likely to be uncontested affairs. Foreign Affairs Minister Ian Borg will run for deputy leader of parliamentary affairs and is rumoured to have the backing of Labour’s MPs to do so. If elected, he will become deputy prime minister.
 Labour MEP Alex Agius Saliba has also said he intends to run for the other deputy leadership post, for party affairs. So far, no other candidate has said they will contest him.
 Until last summer, Saliba led the newsroom of Malta’s national broadcaster, TVM. She was edged out of that post in July 2023, saying obliquely that she had been targeted through a “character assassination campaign”.
 Within weeks, she was given a new €72,000-a-year job as the head of a newly-created Centre for the Maltese Language.
  That appointment prompted criticism and even legal action by the National Council of the Maltese Language, whose board said it was not consulted before Minister Owen Bonnici created the new role and appointed Saliba to it.
 Officially, Saliba remains on TVM's books while being loaned out to the Centre for the Maltese Language.
 Saliba did not respond to a request for comment from Times of Malta when questioned about her continued employment at PBS.
 In a statement, the Nationalist Party accused the prime minister of rewarding Saliba for turning Malta’s public broadcaster into a government propaganda machine.  
 Abela “is rewarding the person who turned the public station into Super One Two,” said the statement signed by PN general secretary Michael Piccinino and broadcasting shadow minister Claudette Buttigieg.  
 By asking Saliba to contest the role of PL president, Abela had proven how she only served his interests during her time as TVM’s head of news, the PN said. 
 The opposition recalled how the public broadcaster’s newsroom was found guilty three times for breaking the fundamental rights of the Nationalist Party.

"Shut down party stations, says PN's Radio 101 founder Lou Bondi",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/shut-party-stations-says-pn-radio-101-founder-lou-bondi.1094213,20-06-2024,000543.png,"Political parties should shut down their TV and radio stations to strengthen Malta’s democratic credentials and contain partisanship, veteran TV presenter Lou Bondi told a conference audience on Thursday.
 Bondi, one of the coordinators of the annual State of the Nation survey, and also one of the founders of the PN's Radio 101 in 1991, was speaking at the presentation of the findings from the survey's fourth edition.
 He argued that Malta’s hyper-partisanship means that “political debate is only taking place between parties”, with many other people who would want to contribute to the political arena shying away for fear of being labelled or sidelined.
 What’s worse, Bondi said, in a veiled reference to criticism of the judiciary over the past weeks, is that partisanship is increasingly spilling over into state institutions, such as the courts.
 A former PN strategist and chair of the party’s radio station, Bondi said closing down the parties’ broadcast stations would be a first step towards reining in Malta’s hyper-partisanship.
 But rather than happening in isolation, this needs to be accompanied by a transformation of TVM into a state broadcaster, rather than remaining under the control of the government of the day, he said.
 In return, Bondi suggested, each party could be given a few slots throughout the week during which they can air their content.
 Party stations came under the spotlight in recent years after a constitutional case launched by former Lovin Malta CEO Christian Peregin in 2021 asked the courts to scrap a law bypassing impartiality rules. Both party stations have  vowed to fight the ongoing case,
 Closing party stations alone won’t solve Malta's partisan divide and democratic shortcomings, Bondi admitted, pointing to several other measures that he believes can play a part.
 MPs’ salaries need to be bumped upwards to bring them in line with wages offered across the private sector, Bondi said. This would help parliament attract more skilled candidates, he argued.
 “But we also need to debate whether MPs should be able to stay in office for more than two or three legislatures,” Bondi said.
 There should also be more public roles appointed through a two-thirds parliamentary majority, Bondi argued, stopping short of saying which roles these should be.
 “This would encourage continuity in policy-making, rather than working in electoral cycles,” he said.

"Malta’s finch trapping derogation breaks EU law, court of justice told",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/malta-finch-trapping-derogation-break-eu-law-expert.1093204,30-05-2024,000553.png,"Updated 5.55pm with Minister Clint Camilleri's comments below.
 The European Court of Justice has been advised that Malta failed to observe its obligations under EU law when it adopted a derogation scheme allowing the live capturing of seven species of wild finches.
 In an expert opinion, one of its advocate generals, Tamara Ćapeta, concluded that the Finches Project, both in regards to its design and implementation is “flawed”, to the extent that the court should find that it does not establish a genuine research purpose and therefore cannot be considered as being justified under the derogation of the Directive.  
 She said that the Finches Project adopted by Malta was not a genuine research project since the current capture and disturbance of wild finches was disproportionate to the scientific benefit of the project, hence unjustifiable under EU law.
 The expert opinion is not binding, and the European Court of Justice will still eventually deliver its final judgement. 
 In an initial reaction, the government said it was ""disappointed"" by the conclusions.
 It said it remained ""committed to the cause"" and was willing to re-open proceedings before the Court of Justice to continue defending the research derogation and the interests of hunters and trappers.
 In a Facebook post later, Camilleri listed positives he had found in the Advocate General's recommendations to the court.
 He said the Advocate General had refuted the European Commission's argument that Malta could not apply a derogation for research for reasons which were not linked to conservation.
 She had acknowledged that a research derogation was allowed under the Birds Directive and did not exclude such derogations even for recreational purposes once sufficient information was available on the species.
  Another 'important victory' Camilleri said, was that the Advocate General confirmed that the use of a clap-net system was acceptable in the application of a derogation, contrary to what the European Commission had argued. 
 The Advocate General had said there were grounds for improving the application of such a derogation but never said that research projects such as this were unacceptable.
 Camilleri said the government would continue to see what improvement could be made to the implementation of the derogation. 
 Ćapeta's opinion was requested as the European Court hears the case filed against Malta by the European Commission over alleged breaches of the Birds Directive. 
 The controversial practice of trapping protected finches using cages and nets was effectively banned by the European Court of Justice in 2018.
 But in 2020, the government went ahead and opened the season anyway, claiming it was for a scientific study to ring birds and release them. For some years now trappers have been participating in this catch-and-release ‘ study’.
 Activists have slammed the so-called research, with the Committee Against Bird Slaughter calling it ""poaching under the cover of pseudo-science"".
 Proceedings against Malta on finch trapping were initiated in December 2020 with a Letter of Formal Notice sent by the European Commission, followed up by a reasoned opinion and finally a fully-fledged court case which was filed in January last year.
 AG Ćapeta stated that large-scale capturing of birds, as envisaged under the Finches Project, simply to collect data from birds already ringed, cannot justify the project, irrespective of the objective, be it to reintroduce the recreational derogation envisaged under the original Framework Regulation 2020 or, as Malta claimed, to pursue wider conservation objectives.
 She agreed with Malta’s arguments on the inclusion of people who previously participated in the recreational derogation project, since it can even have an education component.
 However, despite claiming that the project is based upon the concept of citizen science, she concluded that Malta failed to explain the reasons why the project was not open to all citizens who may wish to participate.
 She said there were clear indications that the project was designed and implemented to allow a particular group of citizens to continue the recreational trapping of finches.
 Additionally, the fact that the project is not involved in the cooperation with any other research project, makes it even more difficult for Malta to defend it through the lens of citizen science, she said.
 Additionally, she noted that the derogation may only be resorted to “where there is no other satisfactory solution”, meaning it must be proven that other methods - that are either accepted by the directive or involve a derogation and which are less intrusive - are not available.
 In this regard, she observed that the Commission had proposed the involvement of expert ornithologists, something that was originally envisaged by Malta but was subsequently neglected after the involvement of bird ringers at the point of data gathering failed.
 Despite these efforts, she found that Malta failed to explain why such methods would not be able to answer the research question at issue.
 She therefore suggested the court should declare that Malta failed to observe its obligations under EU law when it adopted a derogation scheme allowing the live capturing of seven species of wild finches.
 If the Court of Justice finds there has been a failure to fulfil obligations, the member state must comply with the court’s judgment without delay.
 Where the commission considers that the member state has not complied with the judgment, it may bring further action seeking financial penalties.
 In March Birdlife had said it had collected evidence from finch trapping sites showing ""rampant abuse of a smokescreen scientific research derogation"".
 The NGO said that with over 2,600 registered trapping sites for finches last autumn, fieldwork carried out by its members had revealed that an even greater number of trapping sites were operating illegally, with some becoming registered with the Wild Birds Regulation Unit (WBRU) after reports were filed with police.
 BirdLife Malta's Head of Conservation, Nicholas Barbara, estimated a minimum of 51,400 finches have been trapped from permitted sites and taken into captivity without being released.
 ""From what we witnessed, trappers managed to catch around 65% of the birds that landed on a trapping site, with the remainder managing to escape. In all cases of caught birds, however, these were never released. This is a far cry from any scientific research activity which the derogation is supposedly aimed for,"" Barbara noted.
 BirdLife Malta welcomed the ECJ AG Opinion and now looks forward to the court ruling against the ""smokescreen"" finch 'scientific research' trapping derogation once and for all.
 ""Today's AG opinion sends a clear message that Malta should put an end to this cruel practice that allows songbirds to be trapped until they perish. In view of today’s developments, we call on the government not to open another trapping season this year, before the ECJ delivers its final ruling since it is now clear that applying this derogation in the past years was in breach of European law.""
 The hunters' association Kaċċaturi San Ubertu in a statement said it was very clear that the EU Advocate General, who never laid a foot in Malta, and the European Commission did not have first hand factual information but relied entirely on reports sent by Birdlife Malta and its partners who for years had been seeking a total ban on trappers.
 This, the association said, was an injustice towards a sector that has a lot to offer in terms of ornithological science but has only suffered a bad name and a hindrance from Birdlife Malta.
 It referred to years of correspondence, which is said was ignored by (hunting) minister Clint Camilleri and his predecessors emphasizing the need for a national ringing scheme which, contrary to the current scheme run by Birdlife Malta, would involve the trapping sector, ornithologists and others who, it said, are shunned by Birdlife Malta.

The legal loophole that made Malta a Republic,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/the-legal-loophole-made-malta-republic.1102465,15-12-2024,"000590.png,000591.png,000592.png,000593.png,000594.png,000595.png","Fifty years ago, Malta transitioned from monarchy to republic, replacing the Queen of the United Kingdom with its first Maltese president. What many may not realise is that the transition was rooted in legal ingenuity and political strategy.
 It was a move that did away with the need for a referendum, as was being requested by the then Nationalist opposition. They argued that, according to the 1964 Independence constitution that was still in force, the amendments to the constitution – that were needed for Malta to become a Republic – required a referendum.
 But there was a loophole. 
 At the time, former Labour minister Alex Sceberras Trigona was a freshly graduated lawyer who was very much aware of the loophole – which was taught to law students by Prof. Edwin Busuttil. But he took this a step further when he delved deeper into the subject for his LLD dissertation, which was brought to the attention of Prime Minister Dom Mintoff.
  The loophole came in the form of Section 6, known as the supremacy clause, which states that the constitution is supreme above other laws. However, unlike other sections of the constitution, it was not entrenched. This meant the section that made the constitution supreme could be changed by a simple majority of one vote. Entrenched sections needed a two-thirds majority. 
 In simple terms, a legal loophole allowed the Labour government, led by Mintoff, to temporarily delete Section 6 of the 1964 constitution that rendered the constitution supreme and make the necessary amendments without any obstacles by making parliament supreme over the constitution.
 The majority of MPs – 49 out of 55 – voted in favour of the changes that would make Malta a Republic. Once that was done, Section 6 was voted back in – and this time it was entrenched. 
 “It was especially remarkable as this consensus was achieved to change so many constitutional clauses entrenched with a two-third majority – with a majority of only one parliamentary seat,” Sceberras Trigona told Times of Malta.
  The former Labour minister added that the manoeuvre contributed to sustaining the new republic’s birth based on “an extraordinary bipartisan national consensus” which the 1964 constitution lacked.“
 This was the very first constitution ‘made by the Maltese for the Maltese’ as so aptly described by Mintoff,” he said.
 Former Nationalist Minister and European Commissioner Tonio Borg, who was a teenager back then, explains that this manoeuvre also allowed for more leverage in negotiations. He explained that while there was political agreement on the changes to the constitution, the bone of contention was the mechanism used. 
  On December 13, 1974, Sir Antony Mamo became Malta’s first president. His son John recalls the day and the events leading up to it. 
 “Discussions were held between a small number of leading members of both parties. These discussions were held at San Anton Palace. My father was then governor general…. although he was not officially a party to the discussion, he acted as facilitator, mentor or adviser to the party delegates when they felt the need for his guidance,” he told Times of Malta. 
 He said Republic Day should serve as a reminder that on major issues of national importance, the two political parties can rise to the occasion, put their heads together and come up with optimal solutions. 
 “Most of all they should put aside partisan pique in the greater interest of the nation. This is what happened in the run-up to December 13, 1974,” he said.
  The creation of the Republic of Malta was a source of pride to all Maltese citizens and had special significance for his family.
 “My father’s appointment as the first Maltese president was a tremendous source of pride and love. Since my boyhood, my father had occupied important public positions… At a young age, I did not grasp the importance of that post.  I do remember very clearly though that we saw very little of daddy at home as he would return from work late at night, as the office also involved being an adviser to the prime minister and the government of the day.”
 He recalls his father being an early riser and used to lecture criminal law to university students by 8am.
 “The legendary Mamo Notes on criminal law written around 1946 have remained untouched till the present day and are the standard text for all students who followed the law course. The notes are also consistently referred to in cases before the Criminal Court.”
 His father served as attorney general and was then elevated to the office of Chief Justice and president of the Constitutional Court. He also served as acting governor general when the incumbent was unable to perform his functions.
 In 1971, he was unanimously appointed by the House of Representatives as first Maltese governor general, which served as further preparation when he became president of the Republic until his retirement in 1976.
  “I do not remember any major constitutional issues arising during my father’s tenure of office as governor general or president, although his regular meetings with the political leaders would often involve advising and acting as an honest broker.
 “One source of disappointment for my father is that in certain cases, where there was strong public sentiment, people expected him to intervene when the constitution did not permit him to do so, or literally precluded the president from intervening. I am not sure if there is a remedy to this very unjust criticism of the president which happens from time to time except further education of the public at large,” he said.
 This subject was touched upon by Judge Giovanni Bonello, a constitutional expert, who back then was a 38-year-old lawyer specialising in human rights and constitutional law litigation. He believes that not much changed with the 1974 constitution.  
 “In reality, virtually nothing really changed from the 1964 Independence constitution. The 1974 retouches were possible exclusively because of Independence. What ‘changed’ was that Elizabeth the First, Queen of Malta, who had absolutely zero powers, was replaced by presidents, who also act as if they have zero powers… All the small or large changes in governance were only the consequence of the revolutionary 1964 Independence. No independence, no republic.”

Private school fee increases to be capped at 12% annually,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/government-inject-27-million-independent-schools-five-years.1097897,09-10-2024,000621.png,"Private schools will cap fee increases at a maximum of 12% annually for the next five years under a deal announced on Tuesday. 
 The government will inject €27 million into independent schools between this year and 2029 as part of the agreement, with funds going towards improving their educators’ salaries and working conditions without having to dramatically raise fees for parents.
 Education Minister Clifton Grima announced the agreement with the Independent Schools Association (ISA) on Tuesday, a few hours after the financial package was approved in cabinet.
 “After we reached a historic deal for state school educators some weeks back, parents of students who attend independent schools reached out to us, explaining they were worried their schools will raise the fees to unaffordable amounts to match those conditions for their educators,” he told a press conference.
 “When we looked into it we found fees could truly soar by up to 24 per cent unless we intervened.
 ""We needed to address the situation immediately because we’re the ministry for these children as well, and we want to offer stability to the sector and peace of mind to parents who should not face abnormally higher bills.”
 The news of the financial package was also announced by Prime Minister Robert Abela on social media Tuesday afternoon.
  In July this year the government and the teachers’ union shook hands on the educators’ sectoral agreement after a year and a half of negotiations to improve the salaries and working conditions of more than 11,000 educators in state schools.
 Malta’s independent schools are not bound with the agreement but they have historically kept the working conditions for their educators more or less at par with public and church schools.
 On Tuesday Grima said more than 8,000 students and almost 1,000 educators in independent schools would benefit from the financial package.
 The aid will ensure their families will not face fees that are higher than 12 per cent each year, he said.
 The aid will be handed out according to projected student populations in each school, good governance and the improvement of working conditions for educators for the next five years.
 Among others, the government will have injected €793,000 to cover a one-time, €1,000 allowance for each educator and €4.6 million in arrears by 2029.
 “We calculated that independent schools would have been forced to charge parents over €1,000 extra per student this year, just to cover arrears,” Grima said. “And many families cannot afford that. This way, we have given independent schools a vision and stability.”
 The schools will inform parents of the new fees in the coming days, he added.
 The Labour Party had promised teachers a substantial raise and better conditions before the last general election.

 However, it urged the government to be more ambitious and lay down the blueprint for mandatory workplace pensions with a voluntary opt-out, while introducing a transitory framework for employers to contribute to such schemes.
 ""On Monday, Finance Minister Clyde Caruana said employees, or those who changed jobs, should be allowed to invest in an occupational pension plan,"" it said in a statement.
 ""Although this is a step in the right direction, it is still unclear from the wording used whether the workplace pensions will apply to existing or new employees and in the case of the latter, whether such schemes would apply across the board or certain segments, such as by age.
 [The minister] did, nonetheless, urge private and public sector workers to take part where schemes were available and insisted that while employers were not obliged to match employees’ contributions, they were encouraged to do so and top-up employees’ contributions.""
 The association warned that Malta had lost 20 ""precious years"" with very little progress showing for the time lost.
 Now that more and more trade bodies and unions are in agreement and would favour the introduction of such auto-enrolment workplace pensions with a voluntary opt-out, the authorities should be bold enough to introduce such measures without further ado, it added.
 “Since the budget speech understandably lacks any detail, we encourage the authorities to consult the relevant stakeholders to ensure a successful roll-out of mandatory workplace pensions with a voluntary opt-out.”
 IAM said it looked forward to learning more about the government’s mechanisms to roll out the schemes announced in the budget and hoped it would be able to contribute around the discussion table with proposals.
 “In a country, which was so far, is totally dependent on the safety net provided through state pensions, understanding the pros and cons of pension products helps people make an informed decision,” the association added.

 Prime Minister Robert Abela needed to acknowledge the new situation and immediately remove all the co-accused from any role they may have in the government and the Labour Party.
 No prime minister who respected his office and his country could ever treat somebody such as Joseph Muscat as his political ally. Muscat should be viewed for what he truly was - an accused person facing very serious charges of corruption, money laundering and criminal association to defraud the Maltese people. 
 Abela should therefore also stop Muscat from continuing to hold a diplomatic passport and using government offices for personal purposes. 
 Aquilina said the PN was renewing its confidence in the the judiciary and also acknowledging the commitment of prosecutors who were facing huge obstacles by those who, like Joseph Muscat, were doing everything possible for justice not to be served.

Political deadlock leaves Birkirkara without mayor,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/political-deadlock-leaves-birkirkara-mayor.1099192,10-08-2024,000703.png,"Birkirkara is left, once again,  without a mayor after its councillors could not agree on who should take up the role during a meeting on Tuesday afternoon. 
 Birkirkara was one of several localities that in June found itself with a hung council after independent councillor Kaylocke Buhagiar was elected, with the remaining seats going evenly between the PL and PN. The PN won the biggest number of votes. 
 During Tuesday's meeting, councillors met to vote on who should lead the local council and become mayor, yet an agreement was not reached. 
 Now the councillors will meet once again on Tuesday 15 October to try and agree on who should be the locality's mayor. 
 PN councillor Desirei Grech, who served as the council’s interim mayor for the past three months took to Facebook to express how Birkirkara deserves stability. 
 “Birkirkara deserves five years during which the will of the residents is respected,” she said.
  The vote comes a day after Buhagiar had turned down the proposal by the Labour Party to hold the locality's mayorship for two and a half years before passing on the baton to a PL mayor for the rest of the term. 
 The PL's deputy leader for party affairs Alex Agius Saliba convened a meeting between the Labour candidates and Buhagiar.
 Yet, Buhagiar turned down the proposal and said he wanted to lead the council for five years.
 Buhagiar, a former Labour councillor, has been unwilling to endorse a candidate from either party.
 Malta’s electoral law says that the candidate who obtains the most votes from the party that wins the most seats becomes mayor but, in cases such as this where no one party wins a majority of seats, the matter is taken to a vote among councillors.

Anger as new rule allows fireworks to be let off close to protected trees,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/anger-new-rule-allows-fireworks-let-off-close-protected-trees.1096013,29-07-2024,000722.png,"Updated at 7.00 pm with L-Għaqda Piroteknika Maltija comment
 New rules which allow fireworks to be let off near protected trees, as long as adequate protective measures are taken, sparked anger from NGOs on Monday. 
 ""Despite the recurring issue of tree destruction making headlines across the country, the government's solution has been to amend the law to legitimise what was previously illegal,"" the NGOs said.
 The legal notice, published on July 2, modifies a previous prohibition on lighting fireworks near protected trees.
 The original regulation said that: ""No person shall let off fireworks within 20 metres from a tree covered by the First Schedule"" whereas the amendment now provides that: ""No person shall let off fireworks within 20 metres from a protected tree unless adequate measures are put in place to safeguard the trees.""
 Those measures are undefined, the NGOs said, creating ambiguity and a significant loophole, placing the burden of enforcement on ERA.
 The regulations also do not establish the fines which offenders would be liable to if no adequate measures are in place and if the illegality leads to trees being burnt.
 ""With ERA already struggling to enforce existing regulations and rarely penalising events where trees are damaged, including incidents involving fireworks, the new amendments to this legislation risk endangering even well-known wooded areas such as Buskett, where festivities are often held,"" the NGOs said.
 The legal notice was issued after being presented to the Cabinet by the Ministry for the National Heritage, the Arts, and Local Government on behalf of the Environment Ministry. No public consultation was held despite its significant impact on the country's natural heritage.
 ""The absence of input from NGOs and the general public on this critical issue is alarming, particularly given the public concern for tree conservation, as seen in past incidents such as the pruning and subsequent vandalism of trees in Mosta.""
 The NGOs called for the immediate repeal of the legal notice and a proper public consultation process. They urged the government to strengthen environmental laws and not to 'appease' the agendas of individual ministries or lobby groups
 The statement was signed by BirdLife Malta, Moviment Graffitti, Malta Ranger Unit, Flimkien għal Ambjent Aħjar, Din l-Art Ħelwa, Friends of the Earth Malta, Nature Trust-FEE, the Malta Ramblers’ Association and Malta Ranger Unit.
 In a statement published on Monday afternoon, ERA explained the decision to amend the Trees and Woodland regulation. 
 It said before the amendment, that launching fireworks within 20 metres of trees was strictly prohibited.
 ""This provision proved to be impractical in particular for ground fireworks which often happens to be carried out in village squares which also host protected trees,"" the statement explained. 
 ""The updated regulation continues to prioritise tree safety while accommodating cultural traditions by allowing firework displays under specific conditions and with strict mitigation measures to the satisfaction of ERA, including wetting the trees prior to launching fireworks, provision of additional fire trucks specifically to take care of trees and using firework-resistant materials to shield them.""
 ERA said it remains illegal to set off fireworks within 20 metres of trees unless ""adequate safety measures are implemented"".
 The authority said the legal update addresses practical realities and strikes a balance between safeguarding the environment and respecting cultural practices. 
 ""It remains ERA's priority to ensure tree protection,"" the statement concluded.
 L-Għaqda Piroteknika Maltija (Maltese Pyrotechnic Association) also backed up the amendment to the regulation.
 The Association said it already imposed a regulation of keeping a 15-metre distance between the ‘gigifoku’ and people. 
 “When shooting aerial fire from cannons, many of the licensees take precaution not only to protect the health and safety of the pyrotechnics, but also the protection of trees and bushes in the vicinity. This means being provided permission to clean, remove bad grass and soak the grass and surround trees with water before letting off the firework.”

‘I am not afraid of their holy war’ - Abela on ‘establishment’ attack,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/i-afraid-holy-war-abela-establishment-attack.1092869,22-05-2024,000732.png,"Robert Abela called for the public to vote for the Labour Party in the June 8 elections, and claimed the ""establishment"" will attack if people decided not to vote. 
 “If the establishment sees a slight sense of hesitation, they will attack you,” the Prime Minister told supporters on Wednesday at a political activity in Ħamrun.
 “You heard what they declared, they declared a war against you, but do not let them. I am not scared of their holy war, I will remain calm and strong, so be by my side.”
 His comments come after he said the Opposition wants to ""stoke tensions"" on the day a ""solidarity meeting"" is being organised as Joseph Muscat is charged in court over the hospitals scandal. 
  During his speech, Abela recalled all the different measures and benefits the government provided to the people, noting the €10,000 first-time buyers scheme, increase in children’s allowance, pensions and the minimum wage.
 ""This is not enough though, we are ready to give you more,"" he said, to cheers of the crowd.
 “Teachers will also be given the biggest raise that the country has ever seen,” Abela said, a reference to the ongoing teachers' union and government discussions on the revised teachers collective agreement. 
  The Malta Union of Teachers gave the education minister until May 24 to wrap up the negotiations over the new collective agreement for teachers. 
 Abela gave no further details on how big the raise will be.
 He said despite a pandemic and two global wars, the Maltese economy “was, still is and will remain” the first and strongest in the European Union.
 He said the government plans to incentivise businesses operating from certain localities to prioritise the regeneration of such areas. No further details on the plan were provided.
 ""I am proud to be the Prime Minister because I know that with you behind me, our country will continue to be successful, he said.
 MEP candidate Thomas Bajada and Finance Minister Clyde Caruana also addressed the crowd.

"Four roles in six months: Who is Mark Mallia, the PM's new Head of Secretariat?",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/four-roles-six-months-who-mark-mallia-pm-new-head-secretariat.1094480,26-06-2024,000745.png,"When Colonel Mark Mallia takes up on his new job as the prime minister's right-hand man it will be his fourth government appointment in the space of just six months. 
 Mallia, who was announced as the successor to Glenn Micallef on Wednesday, has a storied, and occasionally controversial, history within government circles.
 Earlier this year, he was announced as the new CEO of the Foundation for Medical Services, replacing Carmen Ciantar, who had stepped down after a cabinet reshuffle.
 That plan turned out to be short-lived.
 Just days later, news emerged that Mallia would instead be taking the helm at an entirely different government agency, the behemoth that is Transport Malta.
 At the time, Transport Malta was dealing with the fallout from the driving licence racket, which saw officials from the agency irregularly fast-tracking candidates hoping to obtain a driving licence. Mallia was Transport Malta’s third CEO in the space of a year.
 Mallia had previously spent two years heading Identity Malta, last year telling Times of Malta of the agency’s  plans to combat abusive employment of third-country nationals.
 Mallia's new role as the prime minister's Head of Secretariat won’t be his first stint working closely with the Abela family.
 He served as aide-de-camp to Robert Abela’s father, George, between 2009 and 2013.
 At the time, George Abela was Malta’s President, with a fresh-faced Robert making his name as an up-and-coming lawyer in the family’s law firm.
 Mallia was described by George Abela as the “decision-maker” within his team, telling an inquiry into the fateful Paqpali Għall-Istrina incident that Mallia was responsible for chairing a central committee which would oversee several sub-committees working on various fundraising events.
 Mallia is also believed to be close to the family of Robert Abela’s predecessor, Joseph Muscat, indicating that he could act as a bridge-builder between the two camps who are believed to not always see eye-to-eye.
 In 2015, Mallia helped to rope in Muscat’s wife Michelle to mediate in a conflict between the army’s top brass and a disgruntled gunner.
 Mallia's name first hit the news over a decade ago, when he was named AFM's Deputy Commander in December 2013.
 That promotion, along with others within AFM at the time, proved to be controversial, with the Ombudsman describing the process as ""intended to produce a desired outcome"".
 The Ombudsman found that Mallia, who was made a Major in 2011, had received three promotions in the space of three months. He was first appointed Lieutenant Colonel in September 2013, then given the rank of Colonel just a fortnight later, and finally named AFM’s Deputy Commander in December of the same year.
 Mallia has a background in business administration, having obtained a Masters degree in the subject from the University of Malta in 2009.

How likely is a second term for Metsola as EP president?,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/how-likely-second-term-metsola-ep-president.1094033,17-06-2024,000783.png,"Roberta Metsola has a good chance of winning a second term as European Parliament president but could be sidelined in the larger political games being played in Brussels, according to two experts.
 On Saturday, Metsola confirmed she would run for the post and planned to submit her nomination papers today. She told Times of Malta she has enough support from the EU’s political groups to seek a second term.
 She was elected European Parliament (EP) president in a landslide victory in 2022, with her tenure set to expire now – at which point the prestigious post will be up for grabs.
 With complex power games at play in the upper echelons of the EU and second terms in the role far from the norm, her future as EP president remains uncertain.
 Metsola’s continued place in European politics was assured last weekend after she was re-elected to the European Parliament with more votes than any other MEP candidate in Malta’s history.
 But with speculation rife about her continuing as EP president ahead of a European leaders’ meeting today to discuss the EU’s top jobs, Times of Malta set out to find out just how likely a scenario it was.
 
 “Overall, she has a good chance of staying on,” said one informed source when asked how likely it was Metsola would remain in office for a second term.
 Stressing she was credited with raising the profile of the position by “carving out a more important role for the presidency”, he said Metsola’s presence was “appreciated” by the European Parliament, which he said had grown stronger under her leadership.
 However, with power dynamics between the European People’s Party (EPP) – of which Metsola is a member – the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D) and Renew Europe at play, past success was not the only determining factor, the source said.
 Following the last round of European elections in 2019, the role of EP president was divided up between the EPP and S&D groups which, along with Renew, controlled a parliamentary majority in a ‘grand coalition’.
 With Renew taking the post of European Council president for the last five years – a position that went to former Belgian prime minister Charles Michel – EPP and S&D split the post of EP president, with each occupying the role for one term of two-and-a-half years.
  But with Renew decimated in the recent elections, S&D remaining largely stable and the EPP seeing their share of seats increase according to the latest results, the balance of power has shifted.
 “An important question is whether the liberals [Renew] will be able to justify holding on to a top job after not doing so well,” the source said, speculating that should the leadership of the European Council leave the hands of Renew, it could affect the balance of power for the EP president role.
 “Metsola’s job might get caught up in a bigger game being played with the top jobs,” he said, a practice known as ‘horse-trading’.
 He noted that prominent Renew figure and French President Emmanuel Macron “likes” Metsola, which could work in her favour. Macron’s influence could be waning however, after his party lost badly in the French MEP elections, prompting him to call a snap election.
 The source added it was likely the EP groups would want to find people who “reflect the geographic balance,” noting that none of the top jobs had so far gone to someone from Eastern or Central Europe: “It’s very likely one of the top jobs will go to someone from the Baltic states.”
 However, another source Times of Malta spoke to said that while the balance of power had shifted and horse-trading could play a part, it wasn’t guaranteed to be the deciding factor.
 “It could happen, but MEPs vote on it [the EP president role]... it’s not just a question of ‘dividing up the cake’,” the EU source said.
 The two sources also disagreed on the extent to which Metsola’s anti-abortion stance could affect her chances.
 While the first said it could damage her chances at a second term, calling it “impressive” she had managed to gain the support of S&D the first time around despite being at odds with the group over the issue, the latter seemed less concerned: “It wasn’t an issue the first time; I don’t know why it would be now.”
 Despite Metsola’s personal stance on abortion, she has vowed to follow the position taken by the European Parliament, which in April voted to include access to abortion in the EU’s Charter of Fundamental Rights.
 The two also disagreed on the role of Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who has been viewed by some analysts as a ‘kingmaker’ after her Brothers of Italy party won big at home, swelling the ranks of the right-wing European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) group in Europe.
 Could Meloni’s support prove to be important?
 “It’s correct to say she’s a kingmaker; she has a good number of MEPs and is pragmatic at an EU level,” said the European source, adding she “hadn’t turned out to be the bogeyman everyone expected”.
 But his counterpart said that while the Italian premier was in a “good position,” the dust was still settling and he “wouldn’t overstate her importance”.
 However, the two agreed it would be “significant” if
 Metsola was to win a second term, noting it was rare for a parliament president to retain the role for more than one term with only German Socialist Martin Schulz having  managed the feat.

MCAST students plead with PM to intervene as marks remain in limbo,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/mcast-students-plead-pm-intervene-marks-remain-limbo.1094219,20-06-2024,000821.png,"MCAST students have asked Prime Minister Robert Abela to intervene as some exams are cancelled and their marks remain in limbo, due to ongoing union directives. 
 In the online petition, students are asking for Abela to help them get access to their marks and reschedule their exams. 
 At the time of writing, the petition had already reached over 200 signatures. 
  Last month, the Malta Union of Teachers ordered staff at MCAST not to disclose exam and assessment results to students after talks over the new collective agreement failed.
 The students are concerned about how this situation could continue to negatively impact them, as they have nothing in hand to show to any other educational institutions they wish to apply to or future employers. 
 “This situation has left third-year students unable to apply for jobs or master's programs, while others face delays in graduation and academic progression. Additionally, current directives have halted VIVA examinations for dissertations, contributing to significant stress and anxiety among the student body,” student representative Jordan Galea Pace said. 
 He added that before creating the petition, the students had already tried everything else, including protesting and contacting the Education Ministry and Castille, but to no avail.
 A spokesperson for the MCAST student council said: ""We would like to emphasise that while it is essential to respect the rights of lecturers for fair pay, it is equally important to remember that students' futures are at stake."" 
 The MUT directives have impacted not only the current student body and staff but also potentially new MCAST students, whose open days have also been rescheduled.
 The MCAST open day events planned for June 21 and 23 at the Paola and Mosta campuses were moved from June 27 to July 12 at the MCAST Campus in Paola.
 This change results from union directives that have impacted staff participation in outreach activities.

Third time lucky? MUT again calls for talks on teachers' pay to resume,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/mut-makes-third-call-resumption-pay-talks-government.1094156,19-06-2024,000842.png,"The Malta Union of Teachers has made a third request for a formal meeting to discuss stalled pay talks for educators. 
 The talks, on renewal of a sectoral agreement, have been dragging since December 2022, despite the government having promised substantial pay rises to educators before the 2022 general election.
 A breakthrough appeared to have been reached last month, when the two sides announced a deal, which was subject to approval by the teachers.
 But the deal raised a storm of protest, particularly by teachers who have been in service for over 20 years, who observed that allowances they were being offered in the new proposed agreement were only a minor improvement on what they received now.
 Teachers also complained about being given allowances instead of an increase in their pay.
 As a result, the union froze all negotiations and said it would go back to the negotiating table.
 The MUT said on its website that there may have been reasons for no meetings to be held during the weeks prior to and following the EP and local council elections but there were now no valid reasons for any procrastination.
 ""Unless a meeting is called, it will be evident that the government is not willing to conclude the sectoral agreement for educators in a timely manner, despite its communication to educators about the benefits of the agreement,"" it said.
 It said it would take any actions as required. 
 The union held a successful one-day strike last November and had been on the verge of calling further industrial action in May.
 However more industrial action is unlikely at this point, with the end of the scholastic year only days away.

 As tensions flared on Tuesday evening after Prime Minister Robert Abela claimed the PN was setting a ""trap"" for those who intended to show up to the meeting, Muscat appeared to discourage people from attending on the day. 
 “The greatest solidarity you can show with me, my friends, is not to take leave from work to come to Valletta,” Muscat told a crowd in Żabbar. 
 “The biggest show of solidarity that I can ask of you is to go and vote for all the candidates of the Labour Party on June 8”.
 Muscat was speaking at an event organised by PL MEP candidate Clint Azzopardi Flores on the day that some of the former prime minister’s biggest allies announced a “solidarity meeting” outside the courts. 
 The meeting is set for around the same time when Muscat is set to formally face a raft of financial crime charges related to the deal that saw the privatisation of three state hospitals.
 Echoing similar calls from Abela, Muscat encouraged Labour supporters not to “fall to provocation”.
 Speaking to the crowd, Muscat said: “No one should dare to succumb to provocation. You will be pleasing those who are about to get a massive boo-boo”. 
 Only a few hours earlier, Abela alleged that the Nationalist Party is setting a ""trap"" for Labour supporters by “stoking tensions” on the day they plan to gather in support of Joseph Muscat. 
 In response, PN leader Bernard Grech slammed Abela for speaking dangerously and inflaming people's emotions, telling him to go to the police with the information if the claims were true. 
  Muscat also told the crowd that gathered to see him that they must respect journalists. 
 “If we like them, if we don’t like them - we must respect their work and opinion because they are doing their jobs,” Muscat said referring to journalists. 
 “There are even journalists here tonight, and we respect what they do,” he said. 
 Urging his supporters to take the high road, he told the crowd they can simply ignore any news that they disagree  with. 
 “Now if you don’t like what they write - don’t read it, and if you don’t like what they say don’t listen,” he said. 
 Muscat was given a hero’s welcome as he stepped on the small stage, built right next to the Żabbar Labour Party club. 
 As crowds cheered “Joseph, Joseph” someone from the crowd presented Muscat with a large bouquet of red and white flowers. 
 The speakers who preceded Muscat including, Labour MPs Michael Falzon and Chris Agius, and former European Commissioner Karmenu Vella all praised the former prime minister before giving their endorsement of Azzopardi Flores. 
 The MEP candidate also praised Muscat while repeating calls for calm. 
 “That's what they want, for us to succumb to provocation. Then they can go abroad and claim there is a crisis in Malta,” he said.

Can Fearne and Scicluna hold on to their European posts?,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/can-fearne-scicluna-hold-european-posts.1092080,05-08-2024,000920.png,"The political futures of European commissioner nominee-in-waiting Chris Fearne and central bank governor Edward Scicluna are hanging by a thread after they were served criminal charges on Monday, in the wake of the Vitals inquiry. They are to face charges of fraud, misappropriation and fraudulent gain in connection with the hospitals' deal.
 Fearne, Malta’s deputy prime minister and EU funds minister, was earmarked to succeed Helena Dalli as Malta’s next European commissioner.
 Meanwhile, Scicluna, a former finance minister, has been at the helm of Malta’s central bank since early 2021, automatically giving him a seat on the European Central Bank’s governing council, alongside central bank governors from around Europe.
 But the tumultuous events over the past week could change all that, despite Robert Abela’s assurances to the contrary.
 Scicluna’s seat on the ECB’s governing council means that he has “a special responsibility to maintain the integrity and reputation of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) and the European Central Bank (ECB)”, according to the ECB’s code of conduct.
 The code of conduct makes no mention of what should happen to members facing criminal charges, although having a charge hanging over his head may appear to run counter to Scicluna’s special responsibility to uphold the institution’s reputation.
 But, much to the ECB’s embarrassment, Scicluna wouldn’t be the only member of its governing council to be in legal hot water.
 Peter Kazimir, governor of Slovakia’s central bank, vowed to remain in office when faced with bribery and corruption charges back in 2021. The charges related to crimes allegedly committed when Kazimir was the country’s finance minister. Kazimir denies any wrongdoing.
 Three years on, Kazimir remains in charge of Slovakia’s central bank and has held on to his spot on the ECB’s governing council, despite currently standing trial and facing a potential five-year prison sentence.
 This week’s developments mean that two out of the 26-strong ECB governing council are fighting criminal charges.
 Kazimir’s story pales in comparison to that of Latvian central bank head, Ilmārs Rimšēvičs who was caught trying to solicit a €250,000 bribe in 2018. Rimšēvičs was barred from office by the Latvian government, effectively leaving the country without a representative on the ECB’s governing council, in a move that was later deemed unlawful by the European Court of Justice.
 Rimšēvičs’s joy was short-lived. Late last year, he was found guilty of bribery by the Latvian courts and sentenced to a six-year jail term.
 Questions sent to the Central Bank of Malta asking whether Scicluna plans to step down from his post remain unanswered at the time of publication.
 Meanwhile, Nationalist MEP David Casa called for Scicluna’s resignation yesterday, saying that his continued tenure “will irreparably damage the reputation of our country as a financial centre”.
 Like Scicluna, Fearne’s eventual post as a European commissioner would mean that he is bound by the commission’s code of conduct.
 The prospect of criminal charges doesn’t feature in the code but members are instructed not to act in a way “which adversely affects the public perception of their independence, their integrity or the dignity of their office”.
 Fearne’s nomination would feature the added complication of having to be approved by EU heads of government in the European Council, before facing a grilling first by an EP committee responsible for their portfolio and later by the European Parliament itself.
 The prospect of a nominee facing criminal charges overcoming these hurdles appears to be slim.
 France’s nominee during the current legislature, Sylvie Goulard, was turned down by a EP committee, partly over suspicions that she misused EU funds by using parliamentary assistants for her domestic political work.
 Although she was not facing formal charges at the time, the allegations were enough for the EP to reject Goulard’s nomination citing ethical concerns, with the European People’s Party particularly vocal in their criticism.
 Goulard was later placed under formal investigation but the case was eventually dropped. By then, it was too late for Goulard, whose place was taken by European Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton.
 Like Goulard, Romanian nominee Rovana Plumb was rejected by an EP committee over a series of problematic loans that raised suspicions of corruption.
 Plumb had failed to declare two loans amounting to almost €1m, leading MEPs to question Plumb’s suitability for the role.
 At the same time, Hungarian nominee Laszlo Trocsanyi was also rejected over concerns about contracts won by a law firm he co-founded, among other things.
 Although Fearne is believed to have garnered widespread respect, particularly over his handling of the pandemic, history suggests that he would face an uphill struggle to have his nomination confirmed while under the cloud of criminal proceedings.

Public debt reaches €9.77 billion in July,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/government-debt-rises-9-77-billion-july.1097474,31-08-2024,000949.png,"The country's public debt stood at almost €9.77 billion in July this year – an increase of €374 million compared to last year – while interest on the debt reached almost €148 million, an increase of €29 million, the National Statistics Office (NSO) said.
 It said higher debt was attributed to foreign loans (€72 million) and Euro coins issued by the treasury (€4 million), but noted the increase was “partially offset” by drops in treasury bills (€307 million) and the ‘62+’ government savings bond (€26 million).
 ""Moreover, higher holdings by government funds in Malta Government Stocks resulted in a decrease in debt of €66 million,"" it said.
 The NSO said the government’s consolidated fund reported a surplus of just over €60 million by the end of July.
 The government’s consolidated fund essentially functions as its bank account, with the taxes collected deposited into it and being used for the government’s general spending.
 The NSO said that by the end of the second quarter of this year, recurrent revenue – continuous forms of revenue – amounted to more than €4.09 billion, up €658 million compared to the same period the year before.
 Total expenditure was also up on last year, however, standing at €4.03 billion – an increase of over €295 million.
 “The difference between total revenue and expenditure resulted in a surplus of €60.3 million... whereas a year earlier a deficit of €302.4 million was registered”, the NSO said.
 Spending on ‘programmes and initiatives’ rose by almost €212 million, while personal emoluments – salaries – increased by €60 million.
 Spending on the former consisted of higher social security benefits (€107 million), the EU (€44 million) and restructuring Malta’s national airline (€17 million).
 Operational and maintenance expenses rose by almost €15 million and contributions to government entities by just under €8 million.
 The largest continuous revenue increases were income tax (€356 million), VAT (almost €164 million) and social security (€87 million).
 Income tax accounted for 41% of revenue while VAT and social security accounted for around 20% each.
 At the same time, customs and excise duties revenues dropped by over €17 million, while ‘sales – others’ reduced by €7 million, and rents brought in €2 million less than the same time last year.

Malta prepares to host its biggest-ever international conference of ministers,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/malta-prepares-host-osce-international-conference-ministers.1101736,29-11-2024,"000999.png,001000.png","Final preparations are under way for what is shaping up to be the largest international government conference ever held in Malta.
 More than 2,000 public servants and service providers are coming together to organise next week’s OSCE Ministerial Council, which will be held at the Malta Fairs and Conventions Centre in Ta’ Qali.
 Foreign Affairs Minister Ian Borg, who is also chairing the OSCE, visited the area on Thursday afternoon and met with the task force responsible for coordinating organisation of the conference.
 The OSCE conference, its 31
  Over 800 delegates will be hosted in the 12,000 square metre complex, which will feature a plenary hall where foreign ministers will discuss regional security challenges as well as pressing organisational decisions.
 Russia’s war against Ukraine will be high on the meeting’s agenda, with the two nations among the participating states at the table.
 Country representatives will also have bilateral meeting rooms at their disposal, with halls for press conferences and side events, interpretation facilities, a media centre for more than 200 journalists, catering areas, and other facilities.
 Multiple state agencies are involved in preparations, from the police force to Armed Forces, Civil Protection Department, Transport Malta, LESA, Infrastructure Malta, the Department of Public Works, Ambjent Malta, the Health Services, the Cleansing and Maintenance Division, MITA, the Department of Information, Public Broadcasting Services, and many others.
 Deputy Prime Minister and OSCE Chairperson Ian Borg thanked all the teams involved for their commitment and dedication in the run-up to the conference.
 “A year ago, during the 30
 “The Ministerial Conference is the culmination of a year of relentless efforts to strengthen the resilience of this organisation and to continue advocating for unity among nations in addressing the OSCE region’s challenges, from wars to the climate crisis, from media freedom and cybersecurity to gender equality and the safeguarding of human rights. No country can tackle these challenges alone, but together, through decisive actions, we can build a better future for over one billion people in the OSCE region,” he concluded.
 Malta began its 12-month Chairpersonship of the OSCE in January, under the theme “Strengthening Resilience, Enhancing Security”, after it was unanimously elected to head this organisation for the first time in its history, in November 2023.

Opposition wants Vitals charges included in its civil case about hospitals' deal,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/opposition-wants-vitals-charges-included-civil-case-hospitals-deal.1092129,05-08-2024,000766.png,"The Opposition wants criminal charges recently filed against people targeted by the Vitals inquiry to be included - as evidence - in  its civil case over the state’s inaction to recover funds defrauded in the annulled hospitals’ deal.
 PN leader Bernard Grech filed an application on Wednesday in proceedings wherein the Opposition is claiming the State Advocate - as “the last man standing in our constitutional system” - is empowered and duty-bound to take action against present and past government officials involved in the deal.
 During the previous sitting, the government - as an intervenor in the suit - was granted six days to indicate any witnesses it intended to summon after requesting more time to produce evidence. 
 But the Opposition is now seeking the court’s permission to produce even more evidence. 
 News that the Vitals inquiry has been concluded emerged last week during constitutional proceedings in which former Prime Minister Joseph Muscat is claiming his fundamental rights were breached through the handling of that inquiry by Magistrate Gabriella Vella. 
 The Registrar of the Criminal Courts testified that 78 boxes of evidence had been deposited at the court registry and handed over to the Attorney General. 
 Since then, prosecutors have filed criminal charges against a number of top politicians, including Muscat and others allegedly linked to the fraudulent deal. 
 The Opposition is now claiming that those charges - as well as an attachment and investigation order allegedly issued against a number of suspects linked to the deal - would be “useful” to the judge presiding over its case concerning the state’s inaction in recovering the defrauded funds. 
 Those criminal court documents were “intimately connected” to the merits of their case and not only were to be acknowledged by the judge but were also to be exhibited in evidence.
 Since recent developments took place after the Opposition wrapped up its evidence, the court’s authorisation was necessary for that documentation to be allowed in evidence.
 The Opposition therefore asked Mr Justice Toni Abela to grant it permission to summon the Registrar of the Criminal Courts to present the relative criminal charges,attachment and investigation order. 
 Lawyers Edward Debono and Nicholas Debono signed the application.

Robert Abela calls for cool heads in the face of 'provocation',timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/robert-abela-calls-cool-heads-face-provocation.1091805,21-06-2024,"000782.png,000783.png","Robert Abela on Wednesday appealed to the party faithful to remain calm and not react to ""provocation"", one day after the confirmation that a damning hospitals' inquiry had been concluded.
 “No one, not even one person should fall to their provocation. Let us keep calm and respond strongly by not letting them take over the country and making it their own,” Abela said. 
 The prime minister was addressing a Labour Party mass meeting in Valletta to launch the party's June 8 European Parliament and local council election campaign.
 His predecessor Joseph Muscat is known to be at the centre of the hospitals' inquiry, with the former prime minister himself admitting he will likely face criminal charges. 
 Addressing a crowd that filled Valletta’s St George’s Square, Abela made veiled references, saying forces of the “establishment” were working behind the scenes against the government.
 ""I will not allow anyone to destabilise the country,"" he warned sternly. 
 The magisterial inquiry into the deal was concluded last week and is now at the attorney general's office, a court heard on Tuesday.
 In reaction, Abela hit out repeatedly at the magistrate for concluding her inquiry weeks before MEP and local council elections in June. 
  He claimed parts of the judiciary were part of the establishment and that the timing of the inquiry “was not a coincidence"", describing the actions as ""political terrorism"". 
 On Wednesday, Abela appealed to people to support the Labour Party to keep the Nationalist Party at bay. He insisted that what had been achieved by the government could not be taken for granted in the face of “the forces of the establishment”. 
 “They have not stopped hampering us and they have become arrogant. They have resorted to disgusting tactics and are ready to do whatever they could to get power,” he said to applause.
 He said the country needed people in the European Parliament who worked for the people and the country, and not against them, even trying to stop EU funding. The same applied to local councils, he said. 
 PL MEPs will fight for Malta’s interests while the “others” have shown interest in furthering their careers, he said. 
 “Others bow down in fear when questioned on the energy subsidies the government is providing. We do not and I promise that this assistance will continue, despite pressure from the EU to stop it,” he said. 
 Abela said Labour councils will focus on improving the environment in Malta localities through open spaces and increasing the services provided by councils. He cited day centres that “keep solitude at bay” for the elderly as an example.
 Abela mentioned pay increases resulting from new collective agreements that were being signed, including for public sector workers, as well as a raft of budget measures such as pension and children's allowance increases. 
 Parents whose children continue post-secondary education will also receive €500 for three years, Abela said. 
 To mark the start of the electoral campaign, the Labour Party also unveiled its campaign song Is-saħħa lil-Maltin. (Strength to the Maltese).

Grech: All accused in the Vitals case must resign if they still hold office,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/grech-all-accused-vitals-case-resign-still-hold-office.1092052,21-06-2024,000811.png,"Public officers against whom criminal charges had been levelled over the Vitals hospitals deal must step aside until proceedings are concluded, Opposition leader Bernard Grech insisted on Tuesday.
 That, he said, was what happened to ordinary people and these people should not be granted special preference.
 On Monday, Prime Minister Robert Abela said the charges did not constitute guilt and he would respect the presumption of innocence and not suspend anyone until he saw the evidence.
 ""There should be no special preference for the people who really are the establishment and expect to stay in their posts despite charges having been pressed against them,"" Grech retorted on Tuesday.
  This was no longer the stage where one could argue that no evidence had been presented. The evidence was there and charges had been filed he said. 
 Grech was reacting to a press conference Robert Abela held on Monday afternoon, shortly after  criminal charges were filed against former prime minister Joseph Muscat and other senior figures of his administration.
 Grech said the prime minister had shown himself to be on the side of those accused of crime rather than on the side of the Maltese people.
 The prime minister on Monday raised doubts about the way a magisterial inquiry was conducted before the charges were filed.
 ""We saw a prime minister who chose to stand alongside those accused of alleged crime instead of on the side of the people. He chose to stand alongside the aggressor instead of the victims...he chose his colleagues instead of Malta and the Maltese,"" Grech said.
 Abela was being held hostage after millions had been stolen from the Maltese people, he added.
 Grech said Abela used the word ""establishment"" 47 times, during the press conference, reflecting his state of panic. He even accused some journalists of having their questions prepared by the establishment.
 The prime minister, Grech said, should apologise for the way he treated journalists and said that just like Daphne Caruana Galizia, journalists should stride forward fearlessly in their fight for democracy.
 ""Twenty student organisations came out criticising Abela's irresponsible behaviour on Monday. Are they also part of the establishment?,"" he asked.  
 ""Does this mean that everyone who disagrees with you now is part of the establishment?""
 Grech also called on the Attorney General to publish the inquiry report in its entirety and accused her of only giving a copyto Abela, who in turn shared its contents with the people he desired, despite his insistence that he has not yet seen it. 
 ""Robert Abela is being given the opportunity to choose what to do with the inquiry and control its conclusions.""
 ""How can you tell us you don't agree with the conclusions of the inquiry when you're also telling us you haven't seen it? Prime minister, you're being caught lying,"" Grech said.
 ""And now you have turned against the few institutions that still work in this country - the courts and the media. You're dangerously attacking two pillars of democracy."" 
 The prime minister's attitude, Grech said, was harmful to Malta's reputation. How low would the bring minister go to defend his predecessor?  
 Other ""leading figures"" in the PL were also inciting the people to take to the streets, he said.   
 ""Robert Abela is behaving dangerously and is fanning the flames that - God forbid - might end up in a bonfire.""  
 ""This is nothing but a call for people to take to the streets, which reminds us of a time when some Labourites broke into the courts and set fire to The Times.""
 He called on Abela to condemn the threats and said he was holding him responsible for anything that might happen as a result of rising tensions.

Three former MPs to run for local council seats,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/three-former-mps-run-local-council-seats.1091637,27-04-2024,000822.png,"The Nationalist Party has approved former minister Ċensu Galea and former Gozitan MP Kevin Cutajar to contest the local council elections in St Paul’s Bay and Xagħra, in its efforts to win majorities in the two localities.
 Sources close to the Nationalist Party said two former MPs are “vote magnets” and could help the party attract more votes that could swing the council in the PN’s favour.
 They are not the only former parliamentarians eyeing a position within local councils: former Labour parliamentary secretary Anthony Agius Decelis will also contest the local council elections in Mosta, his hometown.
 As revealed by Times of Malta earlier this month, PN is heading towards the June 8 elections with  two main targets: a third seat in the European Parliament and overturning majorities in at least five councils including include the councils in San Ġwann, Mosta, Valletta, Siġġiewi, St Paul’s Bay, Mellieħa and Birkirkara.
 In the last round in 2019, the PN achieved just short of 600 fewer first-preference votes than the Labour Party in St Paul’s Bay. Sources said residents are generally dissatisfied with the performance of the Labour-led council in the past five years so the PN is trying to regain the majority it had in the past.
 In Xagħra, Labour beat the PN by almost 1,000 first-count votes in the locality that was always a Labour stronghold. Cutajar served as a councillor in Xaghra and received almost 800 first-preference votes in the 2019 council election, almost 300 more than the Labour candidate who was eventually chosen as the mayor.
 Galea, 67, has strong roots in St Paul’s Bay and his daughter, now a PN MP, served as mayor of the locality before she was elected to parliament.
 He started his political career as secretary of the Nationalist Party Club in St Paul's Bay. Between 1978 and 1981 he served as secretary general and president of the Youth Section of the Nationalist Party.
 An architect by profession, he first contested the general elections in 1981 but failed to get elected. He was elected member of parliament in the general elections in 1987, 1992, 1996, 1998, 2003 and 2008 and 2013.
 He served as a parliamentary secretary, shadow minister and then minister in various administrations throughout that time, as well as deputy speaker. 
 For Cutajar, running as a Xagħra local council candidate represents a return to his political roots.
 The lawyer served on the Gozitan town's council uninterruptedly between 2007 and 2019, when he was co-opted into parliament as an Opposition MP, following the resignation of David Stellini.
 Cutajar then sought reelection in the 2022 general election. He placed third among his party's candidates, coming behind elected MPs Alex Borg and Chris Said. 
 Agius Decelis was among the biggest casualties of the 2022 general election, when he failed to get reelected after a 14-year career in parliament as a Labour MP. 
 In 2020, Prime Minister Robert Abela had left him out of his new cabinet but he had vouched to continue working for the party. Within two months, he was appointed non-executive chairman of the state-run Grand Harbour Regeneration Corporation.

 The prime minister has convened a meeting at the Labour headquarters in Ħamrun at 7pm, a day after a shock European election result, which saw the PL's electoral majority over the PN shrink to just over 8,400 votes. 
 Abela will seek a vote of approval through a show of hands from his party's 43 members of parliament as well as members of the executive. 
 ""It will be a show of hands so don't expect any surprises. I do not envisage anybody would dare stand up to challenge his leadership so publicly,"" said one Labour MP.
 
 Another said the anticipated vote of approval will not change anything. 
 ""The reality is that our party is facing a major crisis. Nobody envisaged the outcome of the MEP election and we are now anticipating a wipeout during the council elections.""
 Labour sources said it is the first time that Abela is seeking a vote of confidence among his group. 
 Abela was elected prime minister in January 2020, replacing Joseph Muscat, who stepped down in the wake of the Daphne Caruana Galizia murder investigation fallout.  
 He went on to win the 2022 general election with a majority of 39,400 over the Nationalists. 
 Sunday's election result was Labour’s narrowest European Parliament victory since 2004, when it won by some 21,000 votes.
 Labour’s popular support has now dipped below 50% for the first time since the general election of 2008, which was won narrowly by the PN. While this doesn’t make a difference to the outcome of a European Parliament election, it’s a hugely symbolic shift.
 The result has sent shockwaves through party structures, Labour sources told Times of Malta.
 The PL had been expecting the gap to shrink but nobody envisaged the haemorrhage of votes to be this big.
 One senior member of the party said: ""This is the start of what could be a very terrible week. There will be more embarrassing court cases and we are expecting the PN to overturn a number of councils.""
 As the reduced majority became clear throughout Sunday, Prime Minister Robert Abela, who initially declared a ""solid victory"" for the party, said he was not celebrating a victory and promised to heed the people’s message.
 He said he intended to work harder than ever and derided the PN for ""celebrating a defeat"".
 Addressing a short victory party outside Labour's headquarters in the afternoon, he said he would be responding with humility to the message sent by the electorate.
 People, he said, wanted a better version of Labour. ""As from tomorrow, I will be rolling up my sleeves to deliver on this"".

 Engerer, a Labour MEP who entered the European Parliament in 2020, said that many people with his values were currently feeling “orphaned” by Malta’s political system.
 He said he would remain active in public life, taking on a more activist role.
 “I believe Malta needs change,” he said, saying the country must rise to “the next level”. That meant ensuring a level playing field for all, transparent government and the full implementation of recommendations made by inquiries into the deaths of Daphne Caruana Galizia and Jean Paul Sofia, he added.
 Engerer however thanked Labour leader Robert Abela for the faith shown in him, and said Abela had pushed him to run in the June elections “right until yesterday”.
 Two other, unnamed European parties had also asked him to run on their ticket, he said.
  Engerer’s decision means Labour will have just one incumbent MEP – Alex Agius Saliba – among its candidates in June’s election.
 Rumours about Engerer not running for reelection have swirled for months and were lent greater credence on Friday, when he was not among  nine Labour candidates who jointly submitted their nomination as MEP electoral candidates.
 One day prior, on Thursday, Engerer had voiced his support for a newly-created activist group, Il-Kollettiv, which has acknowledged that it also has political ambitions.
 In a post published to his Facebook page on Saturday morning, Engerer said that he was proud to have served as a voice of socialist and progressive politics within the European Parliament.
 
 He highlighted his work focused on environmental protection, social justice and human rights as especially dear to him.
 “I am proud to have worked with (true) Socialists, the greens, left and liberals to push back against the far-right and populists who, backed by conservative forces, are raising their heads across Europe,” he said.
 “I am pleased that I was the Maltese representative who held strong and never voted in favour of any amendment made by the fascists, whose sole interest is to deceptively dismantle all that we have built. I never want to back them, they do not deserve a crumb of credibility.”
  He emphasised that he had consciously sought to “do things differently” as an MEP, inviting sex workers and activists to Brussels and organising an event which brought together representatives of society’s most excluded groups: from former prisoners to the homeless, refugees and sex workers, drug addicts and trans people.
 More than 100 young people interned at his office since 2020, Engerer added, learning about European Parliament work and helping to negotiate laws and present amendments.
 “I did all this transparently. Every meeting in my office was public and is available on my website,” he added.
 Engerer first entered politics as a Nationalist Party candidate, serving on Sliema's local council representing the PN. But his progressive stances on issues like gay rights and divorce left him at loggerheads with the party and in 2011 he switched allegiances, joining Joseph Muscat's Labour Party. 
  Engerer spearheaded Labour's push to reform LGBT laws in Malta and was employed by Ian Borg, at the time a junior minister for EU funds, as a person of trust.
 He then sought to return to public office and announced he would run as a Labour candidate in the 2014 European Parliament elections. He was forced to abandon that bid after facing criminal charges related to revenge porn. 
 After a five-year stint as Muscat's ""special envoy"" to the EU, Engerer again ran for MEP in the 2019 elections. He placed fifth among Labour candidates but succeeded in getting a seat when Miriam Dalli was coopted into Malta's parliament the following year.

 ""The Maltese government is once again being a catalyst of change in favour of the best interests of journalists through the transposition of the directive on protecting people who engage in public participation from manifestly unfounded claims or abusive court proceedings,"" the Justice Minister said in a statement.
 The transposed order is set to introduce remedies and safeguards for journalists and will apply to matters of a civil or commercial nature with cross-border implications, including procedures for interim and precautionary measures and counterclaims, the ministry added.
 The main safeguards and remedies are:
 Security for the estimated costs of the proceedings
 SLAPPs (strategic lawsuits against public participation) are court proceedings intended to harass and intimidate people involved in protecting the public interest, such as journalists.
 Justice Minister Jonathan Attard subsequently unveiled plans to pass three Bills concerning media reform into law and described the plan as a “historic” one. 
 But the proposals faced severe pushback from journalists and media analysts, who demanded that the plans be opened to public consultation and were even disowned by the committee of experts itself, which said that many of its most salient recommendations had been watered down. 
 As international scrutiny on the government’s plans cranked up, Prime Minister Robert Abela met with the Institute of Maltese Journalists to discuss their concerns and later announced that the Bills  would be frozen until the committee consulted further and provided updated recommendations. 
 The Media Experts Committee revisited the legislation following public consultation and submitted its final report in July last year.

 PN MEP candidate Peter Agius accused the ministry of removing the banners on Monday, saying that these had been put up ""according to the law"". 
 But a ministry spokesperson told Times of Malta that these had been removed earlier this month as part of a routine clean-up and ahead of President Myriam Spiteri Debono's first visit to Gozo. 
 On this occasion, the spokesperson said that all banners that had been affixed to public property without the necessary permissions had been removed irrespective of their content. 
 “I am informed that 24 banners were removed, regardless of their content, but which all did not have authorisation from the respective property owners,” the spokesperson said, adding that while there are exceptions to having to request planning permissions, the permission of the property owner is still required to put up such content.
 She added that there was no ulterior motive to their removal and any argument to the contrary of that is “political spin”.
 On Monday, Agius posted on Facebook that his banners were taken down on Minister Clint Camilleri's orders and that they had been considered ""filth that must be removed"".
  The candidate originally placed five posters in Gozo at the end of April, but only one remained by the end of the week. Agius said, “This is my legal right, and I ensured that all the banners were fixed according to the law.”
 Agius is not the only candidate who had his campaign banners removed at the beginning of this month in Gozo. Independent candidate Arnold Cassola also had two banners removed in Mgarr, and Xewkija encouraged voters to “cast a vote for integrity” by voting for Cassola.
 This is not the first time that Agius had his campaign banners removed; earlier this month, the candidate's Marsascala and Xemxija banners also mysteriously disappeared.

 Joe Brincat, the former Labour Party deputy leader and MP, has died at the age of 80.  
 A lawyer by profession, Brincat was a Labour activist since his youth and twice served as the PL's deputy leader for party affairs. He also enjoyed a long career as a member of parliament and briefly served as a minister.
 Brincat first contested for a parliamentary seat in 1971, later winning in a casual election. He was elected in 1976 but had to contest a causal election to retain his seat again in 1981. 
 In Labour's 1976 general conference, Brincat was elected to be the party's deputy leader for party affairs for the first time, a position he held until 1980. 
 He also served as a representative to the Council of Europe Assembly between 1971 and 1979, from 1982 to 1983 and 1986 to 1995. He was appointed the assembly's vice president in 1978. 
 From July 1979 to December 1981, he served as minister for justice, lands, housing and parliamentary affairs. 
 While Labour was in opposition in 1987, Brincat was made shadow minister for justice. 
 In 1992, Brincat made a bid for party leadership but was unsuccessful in the race ultimately won by former prime minister Alfred Sant. 
 In 1995 he quit Labour's parliamentary group but was soon back in the fray again, with Brincat being elected as the party's deputy leader for party affairs once again. 
 Brincat was successfully elected again in 2003 and served as the PL's spokesperson on the environment and national heritage. He later failed to get elected in the 2008 general election. 
 Born in Gżira in 1944, Brincat studied at the Seminary and the Lyceum, later joining the Friars Minor to study philosophy and graduating with a BA in Latin, Philosophy and English Literature. 
 He later left the order to become a teacher but subsequently departed to join the civil service in the customs and port department. In 1966, he was promoted to a higher clerical officer at the law courts, where he served as a deputy registrar. 
 During this time he pursued further education, earning a BSc in Economics in 1967 and later an LL.D in 1970. 
 That same year he married his wife Rose Buttigieg and they have two children, Antonella and Stefan. 
 Tributes flooded social media after news of Brincat's death, with Prime Minister Robert Abela praising his enormous contributions to the Labour Party. 
 ""His voice in favour of the carriage of justice and his strong socialist values shone through him,"" Abela said.
 ""I always admired Joe's honesty and tenacity in his profession, where he was a formidable opponent in the courtroom, but always loyal. You always learned from and you always knew where you stood."" 
  Former Times of Malta editor Ray Bugeja said he always admired Brincat.
 He recalls, especially, his dignified presence at the funeral of slain PN activist Raymond Caruana.
 ""He was there with his two young children, in what was a very, very hostile environment,"" Bugeja recalls.
 ""I wanted to show them what hate can do,"" Brincat told Bugeja and fellow reporter Michael Testa when approached for a comment. 
 Opposition leader Bernard Grech also paid tribute to Brincat, saying he was a politician who involved himself in everything with great determination.
 ""We did not agree on several matters, but we surely always agreed that we should be of service to everyone, both as lawyers and as politicians,"" Grech said. 
  Former prime minister Joseph Muscat shared several anecdotes about Brincat’s career, noting that despite being ill, his mind remained sharp and he continued to dispense advice. 
 Muscat recalled the challenges Brincat faced when he was arrested overseas in the 1990s.
 Brincat was arrested by Italian police on suspicion that he had helped a client smuggle valuables, but he was released due to a lack of evidence. 
 “Joe went through his own martyrdoms as well, the most well-known was when he was unjustly accused overseas. In the end, he won that battle after several years,” Muscat said.
 He also recounted a time when, as minister responsible for housing, Brincat had gathered together a group of people who had allsked to skip the queue for social housing. 
 Muscat also recalled how Brincat had been the person to convince him to remove the statute of limitation on prosecuting corrupt politicians. 
 “This way, no politician on whom evidence of corruption is uncovered can ever hide away,” he said. 
 “There were those on both sides who tried to convince me not to do it. I’ve never regretted listening to him and I did it. Because as he told me the last time we met, both of us sleep soundly at night.”

Disquiet in Labour’s ranks: why did Labour voters abandon the party?,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/disquiet-labour-ranks-labour-voters-abandon-party.1093830,06-12-2024,000883.png,"The unprecedented drop in Labour’s support in Saturday’s MEP elections is driven by arrogance, negligence and poor decisions, according to party insiders who spoke to Times of Malta and grassroots voters expressing themselves on social media.
 Labour experienced a nine-point drop in support, seeing their votes drop from 54% in 2019’s MEP elections, to just 45% this time around.
 
 While the sheer scale of the exodus came as a surprise, the disgruntlement within Labour ranks certainly wasn’t.
 Labour figures, including Prime Minister Robert Abela, have described the election result as one that sends “a message” but have been rather cryptic in elaborating on what this message may be.
 As is often the case in electoral post-mortems, insiders point to all manner of occasionally contradictory issues as the cause of the upset, from broad national concerns to the bread-and-butter issues they face each day.
 There’s no getting away from the elephant in the room – the arraignment of former prime minister Joseph Muscat days before people headed to the polls.
 Party insiders are split on what impact this had on the different factions within the party.
 “I think the government was seen not to support Joseph Muscat enough,” one cabinet minister said. 
 “The problem is that our traditional base did not vote for us. When the problems are in the second and third districts (Labour strongholds) that’s what it means.”
 Others are convinced the opposite is true.
 A different cabinet minister believes that the government spent much of its time defending Muscat instead of governing, to the detriment of its appeal among the broader electorate.
 “Many people at home are unhappy that the government is defending someone facing criminal charges,” they said.  
 “He has every right to defend himself, and I hope that he receives a fair hearing in court, but that shouldn’t spill into the public arena.”
 Saturday’s result is “an opportunity to break with the past” and move on, they said. “Those worrying about detaching ourselves from Joseph Muscat can see how that strategy did not help us.”
 This split also emerged in the public comments by several public figures associated with the party.
 Former party secretary general Jason Micallef, writing on Facebook, argued that the party adopted a “confusing strategy” on the matter, with most Labourites feeling that Muscat and other former ministers were abandoned, much to the chagrin of the party faithful.
 
 Academic and former Orizzont journalist Martin Debattista took the opposite stance, describing the outcome of the election as “a victory for moderate Labourites who are angry at how Joseph Muscat took them for a ride” and were dismayed to see the party react to news of his arraignment by attacking the judiciary.
 Calls for a public show of support towards Muscat and, especially, the fact that this sort of protest was not called by the party “did not help”, former Labour prime minister Alfred Sant told Times of Malta.
 “During campaigns, the Labour Party should be the only body to call for public protests by Labour. This served to undermine the party’s image, authority and backing among its ‘soft’, even not so soft supporters, as well as others,” he said.
 Two cabinet ministers who spoke to Times of Malta have diametrically opposed takes on the issue.
 “You can’t win a supermajority just by attracting your core; if you do everything for the base you push floaters away,” one minister said, arguing that middle-of-the-road voters were alienated by Labour’s attempts to appease their base.
 But, another argued, “the government needs to keep its feet closer to the ground” and look out for their core voters first and foremost.
 Election data seen by Times of Malta suggests that Labour lost swathes of voters from both groups, with sharp drops in support both in traditional Labour districts as well as more mixed areas of the country.
 Support for Labour dropped by some 9% in the second and third districts, both of them party strongholds, but fell just as much, if not more, in several other districts across the centre of Malta and in the north.
 But disquiet within the Labour ranks stretches far beyond its position on Muscat.
 Backbench MPs say they are kept on the fringes of the party, with Abela giving them scant opportunity to contribute to the party’s decision-making structures.
 “Right now, he is not involving us at all,” one backbench MP said.  
 But, another backbench argued, Abela is hardly spoilt for choice when it comes to his backbench. “People in the backbench either do not have the skills to run a ministry or are tainted by the past,” they said.
 Others point fingers at the cabinet, with one MP speaking to Times of Malta particularly blunt in their assessment of it.
 “There is too much incompetence up there,” they said. “One consequence of their inexperience is that they are becoming arrogant. People see that and it puts them off.”
 These complaints are certainly echoed among the many Labour supporters airing their grievances in the party’s Facebook groups.
 Many Labour voters say that they feel abandoned and sidelined by their own party, treated as “just a number” when they turn to government to air their grievances.
 Much of their anger is directed towards government customer care departments, which many describe as the epitome of the “arrogance” within the government’s ranks.
 Although mention of these departments is widely seen as a byword for a request for a handout, many core Labour voters say that even their legitimate grievances have been repeatedly ignored, despite having raised them with countless authorities, ministers and customer care departments over the months.
 One Labour voter wrote: “you try to report corruption in a government entity to the minister responsible and, instead of taking action, they shut the door in your face. Customer care? They take you for a ride, they don’t even reply to your emails.”
 Countless others had similar stories, with their complaints reading like shortlist of issues that frustrate residents across the land.
 One says he can’t get any sleep because the Labour band club on his street blares music into the night, another complains of dumped construction waste in their neighbourhood, a third says that roadworks in their street have come to a complete halt. In each case, they say, authorities have turned a blind eye to their complaints.
 Labourites’ grievances go beyond the purely local, spilling over into broader national issues.
 Unsurprisingly, one source of much unhappiness is unfettered construction, with the government seen to be at the whims of contractors at the cost of all else.
 
 Many Labourites bring up the case of (former PL mayor) Conrad Borg Manché. “We threw away one of our own and 5,000 votes, let’s thank the genius who decided to build a petrol station in Gżira for all the votes he brought us,” one voter said sarcastically.
 Unsurprisingly, Malta’s growing foreign population also comes under fire (“stop bringing in cheap labour and I’ll vote again,” one Labourite says), as does the rising cost of living, with some saying that they are struggling to make ends meet.

Forced repatriations a ‘traumatic’ experience for migrants – monitors,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/forced-repatriations-traumatic-experience-migrants-monitors.1094361,26-06-2024,000927.png,"Forcing migrants to return to their home countries is a “traumatic experience”, an independent watchdog has warned.
 In its annual report, the monitoring board for detained persons said migrants become extremely vulnerable throughout the period prior to the forced return, as well as during the return itself.
 The board said it is therefore of “utmost importance” that migrants are treated in a humane manner, regardless of the fact that their behaviour may be difficult during the return process.
 
 It further recommended that migrants facing a forced return should be assigned a case worker or social worker to help them discuss their difficulties and concerns prior to the return trip.
 The board has positive words about the running of the Safi detention centre where migrants are held, saying migrants’ rights were “generally respected”.
 In its 2022 report, the board slammed the “totally unhygienic” state of the block used to distribute food to migrants.  This time round, the board said a good number of measures suggested in its 2022 report had been implemented.
 However, 41% of the 27 complaints made by migrants in a complaint box were about the food at the centre, while another 41% of complaints highlighted “verbal abuse”.
 The board said this abuse was “mainly between detained persons”.
 A majority of detainees interviewed by members of the board made no allegations of ill-treatment and showed appreciation towards custodial staff, the report says.
 The board highlighted the need for sufficient staffing at the detention centre at all times, to ensure the rights of detained people.  It said administrative and custodial staff have been decreasing year after year, thus stressing the workforce and the service provided.
 There were 195 migrants residing at the detention centre by the end of 2023. Throughout the year, 1,705 people spent time in detention.

"Fearne insists he is innocent, says he has not been notified of Vitals charges",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/fearne-insists-innocent-says-notified-vitals-charges.1092113,21-06-2024,000961.png,"Deputy Prime Minister Chris Fearne said on Wednesday that he had not yet been formally notified of any court charges against him, and insisted that he never broke any law.
 The minister was reacting to remarks by Opposition leader Bernard Grech calling on him and others holding public office and facing charges in the Vitals hospitals scandal to resign.
 Fearne, who was parliamentary secretary of health when the Vitals deal was inked in 2015, is to be accused of fraud, misappropriation and fraudulent gain.
 He said he had not seen the inquiry report into the case and could not comment other than to say that he had always done his duty with the utmost integrity and had certainly never broken the law.
  That, he said, was also borne out by three Auditor-General reports which showed how he was ‘sidelined' from all significant involvement in the granting of the hospitals concession.
 Fearne also issued another Facebook statement four days ago, shortly before the charges were filed, saying he looked forward to the court proceedings to prove his integrity.
 The former health minister said he always acted in the interests of the patients and the country and he never broke the law or the ministerial code of conduct.
 “I have absolutely no doubt that the court will establish nothing other than my complete innocence"" he said, adding that he wanted to make it clear that he was only speaking about himself, and no one else.
 ""As a minister and a citizen of a democratic European country, I strongly believe in the fair justice that is done and seen to be done,” he said.
 Prime Minister Robert Abela stood by Fearne on Monday, praising his integrity at a press conference.

Transport minister to discuss Chamber of Architects' Msida junction proposal,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/transport-minister-discuss-chamber-architects-msida-junction-proposal.1094393,24-06-2024,001021.png,"Infrastructure Minister Chris Bonett will meet with the Chamber of Architects to discuss plans for Msida junction after the chamber at the weekend unveiled its proposal for an alternative to the flyovers planned for the area.
 On Sunday, Times of Malta  revealed a Kamra tal-Periti (KTP) proposal to transform the Msida junction into a tree-filled park, as an alternative to the two flyovers planned as part of Infrastructure Malta’s imminent  Msida Creek Project.
 The idea drew support from Msida’s mayor-elect and PN councillors, and was widely praised on social media.
 In a Facebook post on Monday, Bonett said he had noticed the reactions to the proposal and he said he would be meeting with the Chamber of Architects in the coming days to discuss this project in some detail.
 Bonett’s words come just days after an Infrastructure Ministry spokesperson said that while the ministry “appreciated” the KTP’s interest in the project, the tendering process had been completed and works would begin next month.
 Responding to the reactions, the minister wrote on Facebook that he couldn’t, and did not even want to ignore the Chamber's proposal.  
  Bonett said that while the designs for the proposal appeared to be “eye-catching,” they raised questions about traffic management. There was also an issue as to what extent he had the freedom to vary or change the project at this stage, and what legal and financial consequences there may be.
 “I promised I would listen... and I will,” he said, stressing he wanted the project to be “the best possible.”
 The minister reiterated a ministry spokesperson’s words over the weekend, however, that planning for the project started five years ago, and that a tender had been selected and a contract of works on the project signed.
  The chamber wants to ditch the planned flyovers and instead transform Msida into a 20,000-square metre park with more than 2,000 trees.
 It thinks it can help solve the traffic problems around Msida by instead adding just one slip road to the Regional Road and reorganising the existing road infrastructure to route traffic around the area.
 The chamber says its proposal could be completed in less time than the current plans, at no additional cost and with minimal impact on residents during construction, while providing a much-needed green lung in one of the worst-polluted areas of the country.
 Infrastructure Malta CEO Ivan Falzon questioned the timing of the move over the weekend, dismissing the proposal as a “desperate attempt to make the headlines.” But the idea drew praise from the public and Opposition upon its release.
 On Monday, shadow Transport Minister Mark Anthony Sammut said he welcomed the proposal, stressing it was “not too late to save Msida.”
  “This is the new way we want to see the planning of our roads and infrastructure done; in a sustainable way and one that puts the needs of the community at the centre,” he said.
 “With more open spaces, trees and clean air. And by taking traffic out of our town centres, not increasing it.”
 If Bonett does decide to change course on the project, this would not be the first time it has seen revisions in its five-year history.
 The first iteration of the project was announced in 2019 by then Infrastructure Minister Ian Borg.
 But a year later the plans were sent back to the drawing board by then Infrastructure Minister Aaron Farrugia after a group of NGOs urged him to ensure social and environmental impact assessments were carried out.
 A radical redesign of the project the following year, adding a piazza in front of the parish church, parking spaces, solar panels, a canal, pedestrian walkways and bridges, with a tender for the revised project issued in August last year and approved three months later.

PN ask Auditor General to investigate issuance of ID cards,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/pn-ask-auditor-general-investigate-issuance-id-cards.1097171,23-08-2024,001024.png,"The Nationalist Party has written to the Auditor General asking for an investigation into how the state agency Identità has been issuing identity cards. 
 This comes as Identità finds itself at the centre of yet another controversy after lawyer and former PN MP Jason Azzopardi claimed the agency has been issuing ID cards based on forged documents. 
 Azzopardi has said that some 18,000 ID cards were issued fraudulently. A magisterial inquiry has been opened to investigate these claims. 
 In a statement on Friday, PN MPs Darren Carabott, Graham Bencini and Claudette Buttigieg, all of whom sit on the Public Accounts Committee, said they wrote to Auditor General Charles Deguara to look into the process through which the agency issues ID cards. 
 In the request, the PN is asking the NAO to determine whether Identità used the diligence expected of it and observed the principles of good governance when it processes requests for the issuance of an ID card or a residence permit to people who are not Maltese citizens. 
 They also asked that the investigation determine where the agency adopted any scrutinisation procedures prior to the issuance of ID cards with ""false and deceptive"" information. 
 This, they said, will establish what procedures Identità adopted and whether there was any exercise to determine what benefit the country would be gaining from the issuance of every work and residence permit approved. 
 Deguara has also been asked to look into whether the agency is being just, coherent, operating on the principles of good governance, accountability and transparency in the spending of public funds in the course of its duties.
 Additionally, the PN has asked whether Home Affairs Minister Byron Camilleri, the Cabinet or any other government entity possibly involved acted responsibly throughout these processes.

Wanted Romanian prince claims extradition would breach his rights,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/wanted-romanian-prince-claims-extradition-breach-rights.1092010,05-06-2024,001147.png,"Lawyers for a Romanian prince battling extradition before the Maltese courts claimed on Monday the request by the Romanian authorities was based on a corrupt decision which, if executed, would result in a breach of fundamental rights. 
 Prince Paul-Philippe al Romaniei, the 75-year-old member of the Romanian royal family, fled Romania in 2020 following his conviction for corruption related to the illegal restitution of real estate near Bucharest, to which authorities said he falsely claimed ownership. 
 He was sentenced to a prison term of three years and four months. 
 The prince was taken into police custody just over a week ago while attending an event in Malta. 
 Upon arraignment last Monday, he did not consent to the extradition and was remanded in custody.
 A former French prosecutor and academic who was also actively involved in several EU anti-corruption missions testified via videoconference at the extradition proceedings.
 Describing the matter as “scandalous,” retired magistrate Serge Mackowiak said that he had met the prince a couple of times in the presence of his legal advisors.
 Following a detailed overview of the historical, political and legal saga surrounding the prince, the witness concluded that the European Arrest Warrant was null.
 The reasons were threefold. 
 That warrant was a result of political persecution, while the whole dispute stemmed from a Nazi edict dated 1941 which ordered the illegal confiscation of the royal family’s property.
 Moreover, the Romanian court that ordered the prince’s extradition was not lawfully constituted because two of the judges who ordered the extradition did not take the oath of allegiance. 
 A US attorney who assisted the prince for the past 12 years and who is also following the extradition case in Malta, also testified on Monday. 
 Besides seeking to overturn the prince’s 2020 conviction, lawyer Edward Griffin had also filed a case before the European Court of Human Rights. That case was still pending. 
 The prince’s conviction in Romania violated his right to a fair trial, due process and family rights, Griffin said.
 “They [Romanian authorities] say he is not the legitimate heir of Carol II. That’s ridiculous because so far all courts all over Europe held that he is the legitimate heir,” said Griffin.
 After the fall of the Communist regime, Prince Paul and his father returned to Romania to reclaim family property. 
 But they were met with the argument that even if entitled to the property, that property was not confiscated by the communist state but by the Nazis. 
 While the property feud continued, in 2022 Prince Paul was targeted by an EAW in Paris. 
 The Paris Court of Appeal turned down the request, citing “systematic deficiencies” in the Romanian judicial system. 
 That conclusion was reaffirmed by the Court of Cassation.
 The French courts refused to hand over the wanted person, pointing out a “real risk” that his fundamental rights would be violated. 
 The original official texts of those French judgments were presented in evidence by a lawyer from the Attorney General’s Office and a court expert was tasked to compare the originals to their English translation.
 When the hearing resumed after a few hours break, the expert reported that “on the whole, it [the translation] was very faithful, save for some typing mistakes, not semantic errors"".
 There was, however, one significant factor that was subsequently highlighted by the defence. 
 The judgment of the Romanian court stated the prince was “present” before that court on December 18, 2020. 
 “Do you remember where you were on that date,” asked defence lawyer Jason Azzopardi, as the prince briefly took the witness stand. 
 “I was in Portugal in front of a Portuguese judge to be declared administrator of my grandfather’s succession,” testified Prince Paul. 
 That meant that the Romantian court had “lied” when declaring that the prince was “present” and the EAW was then based on that lie, argued Azzopardi. 
 Moreover, the Romanian court was not lawfully constituted. 
 The French courts had refused to surrender the prince and a similar “diffusion” request channelled through Interpol, also failed. 
 Last year, retention of data about the prince was stated to be not legal because it did not comply with Interpol’s rules and was consequently to be “purged” from Interpol’s system. 
 A report by the Committee for the Prevention of Torture within the Council of Europe concluded that the situation in any Romanian prison “is definitely inhuman and degrading treatment”, added Azzopardi, citing a number of cases to support that argument.
 Defence lawyer Jose’ Herrera observed further that a court deciding an extradition request is endowed with “special powers” in terms of article 4 of the Framework Decision on European Arrest Warrants.
 Such a court has the power to go beyond ordinary legislation and also consider fundamental rights issues.
 The court, presided over by Magistrate Leonard Caruana, deferred the case for judgment next week. 
 Meanwhile, a separate application for bail was still pending. 
 The defence had filed a request at 9.15am on the day before the hearing. But their application reached the Magistrate’s chamber at 3.16pm. 
 That delay, attributed by the prince’s lawyers to the courts’ administrative system, was “unacceptable”. 
 It meant that the AG had not yet filed a reply about bail by the time the hearing got underway.
 The wanted person was “reliable and trustworthy”, had fully cooperated with investigators and could offer a fixed address for bail purposes. 
 “If need be he can sign [the bail book] every three hours,” argued Azzopardi, appealing to “justice and humanity”.
 “He has been hounded for many years” and was in preventive custody since his arrest last week. 
 The court directed the defence to indicate by means of a note a third party who could step in as surety for bail purposes, before deciding upon the matter.
 Inspector Roderick Spiteri prosecuted.
 Lawyers Jason Azzopardi, Jose’ Herrera, Kris Busietta and Martina Herrera were defence counsel.

Randolph De Battista’s appointment as Geneva ambassador approved by MPs,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/randolph-de-battista-appointment-geneva-ambassador-approved-mps.1097843,09-09-2024,001151.png,"Randolph De Battista’s nomination as Malta’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations in Geneva has been approved by parliament’s Public Appointments Committee by four votes to two.
 De Battista's appointment was announced by Robert Abela last August, one day after De Battista quit as Labour CEO.
 The appointment was formally approved during a parliamentary session on Monday. 
 All government MPs on the committee - Chris Agius, Andy Ellu, Clayton Bartolo and Katya De Giovanni - voted in favour of the appointment. 
 Opposition MPs Adrian Delia and Julie Zahra voted against.  
 Delia said the opposition did not question De Battista’s competencies but was concerned with the manner and timing of his appointment.
 “We believe that this appointment is purely political, motivated not so much by the competences but by the need to remove an outspoken member of parliament from the government benches,” Delia charged.
 “We cannot approve such a move,” he continued.
 De Battista is currently also an MP, having been coopted into parliament in March 2022. He will have to resign from parliament to assume the ambassadorial role.
 During a sitting that lasted approximately 30 minutes, De Battista faced scrutiny over his nomination which primarily focused on the opposition’s concerns about his sudden transition from being an MP to taking up a diplomatic role.
 Delia asked whether the appointment was purely intended to remove De Battista from his current role in parliament.  
 ""I am concerned with how such an appointment was made,” he said.
 Tourism Minister Clayton Bartolo defended De Battista, stating that his nomination should be judged based on competence, a point which Delia did not contest but raised concerns about the overall process and timing.
 De Battista responded by explaining that his nomination was based on his experience, as he has previously contributed to multilateral diplomacy.  
 He also said that the process for appointing non-career diplomats had become more transparent than ever.
 Opposition MP Julie Zahra pressed further, asking if De Battista saw himself as part of the ‘musical chairs’ currently taking place in government and party ranks.
 De Battista refrained from engaging in political debate but stressed that his role as an ambassador would require a different approach than his political duties.
 Delia concluded by questioning whether De Battista’s outspoken political stance would be silenced in his new diplomatic position, to which De Battista replied that his work would continue but in a new context, serving Malta on the international stage.
 During his presentation and in reply to the questions asked, De Battista highlighted his experience as part of former deputy prime minister Louis Grech’s team.  
 He underscored the contacts he made over the years at the World Health Organisation, World Bank and with the assistant to the Secretary General of the United Nations.
 He said he believed in multilateral diplomacy and expects to focus his attention on health and human rights, particularly children’s rights.
 Geneva serves as the United Nations' European base and also hosts the headquarters of several international organisations. 
 De Battista is a lawyer who also served in Malta’s Permanent Representation to the EU in Brussels.  
 In 2017 he also worked in Michel Barnier’s cabinet. Barnier, who is now France's prime minister, was at the time the EU’s top negotiator for Brexit.
 De Battista then shifted to a party role, serving as CEO of the Labour Party between 2017 and 2020. 
 He entered parliament in 2022 at started his second stint as Labour CEO at around the same time. 
 Following Monday’s sitting, parliament will inform the foreign affairs ministry about De Battista’s approval before his nomination is made official.

 His announcement follows other resignations from the hierarchy of the Labour Party including both deputy leaders and the head of communications.
 De Battista said he informed party leader Prime Minister Robert Abela of his intentions on Thursday. He will stay on until a 'smooth transition' can be made.
 He said that in his role he had focused on the party's finances and properties, and major, unprecedented decisions had been taken to put the party on a sound financial footing.
 De Battista did not say why he was stepping down of whether he would continue to work within the party.
 ""I look forward to continuing my work, or rather, working even harder in favour of human rights, for the underprivileged, and for the most vulnerable. That has always been my calling, and those are the principles I have always emphasised within the Party's structures,"" he said.

 Attard did not elaborate on her choice, simply saying she is “ready for a new challenge after four years in the party’s administration”.
 Posting on Facebook shortly afterwards, Robert Abela thanked her for her work, describing her as a “progressive and liberal voice” in the party.

Malta Enterprise's new CEO faces PN opposition due to Vitals links,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/new-malta-enterprise-ceo-role-questioned-pn-due-vitals-connections.1096962,20-08-2024,001179.png,"Updated with Labour Party's statement at 4.40 pm
 George Gregory’s role as the new CEO of Malta Enterprise is “untenable” after a report linked him to the controversial Vitals Global Healthcare deal, the Nationalist Party said on Tuesday.
 Previously a managing partner of RSM Malta, a global network of professional services firms, Gregory was appointed Malta Enterprise CEO earlier this month. He succeeded Kurt Farrugia, who now serves as  Transport Malta CEO.
 At a press conference, shadow ministers Adrian Delia and Jerome Caruana Cilia described Gregory's appointment as ""surreal"", as they referred to a report by the PN's publication Il-Mument that links Gregory to the controversial Vitals Global Healthcare deal.
 According to the report, Gregory was involved in ""several critical stages"" of the Vitals project, and his role included consultancy work and preparation of strategic assessment documents.
  Delia and Caruana Cilia slam Gregory's involvement in what they describe as the ""biggest fraud in Malta's history"". They also say the appointment of Gregory is just another part of the Prime Minister's game of ""musical chairs"".
 Delia said Gregory was involved in drafting a strategic assessment titled 'Strategic Assessment for Developing Best-in-Class Health Care Services and Medical Educational Facilities in Malta', which defined the project’s infrastructural and financial goals.
 He continued to say how Gregory served as a consultant for the project and was involved in an evaluation committee responsible for assessing bids for the hospital project. While not an evaluator, Delia claimed Gregory would advise the evaluators involved in the project.
 “Gregory was obliged to say if we want the best service, we definitely can’t select this company (Vitals), but that is not what he did,” said Delia.
 Delia quoted the report, stating Gregory's firm audited Vitals Global Healthcare's accounts from 2015 to 2017, during which time the accounts were neither prepared on schedule nor adequately monitored.
 ""Despite these concerns, Robert Abela and Silvio Schembri decided that George Gregory was the best choice as CEO of Malta Enterprise, as Abela continues to play 'musical chairs' "" Delia concluded. 
 Following the press conference, the Economy Ministry published a statement saying it was disappointed with the PN's ""partisan attack"" on Gregory. 
 In the statement, the ministry said Gregory was never active in politics, and said the PN is trying to confuse facts that can be verified from public information.
 The reality is that Gregory served as an accountant for 30 years, working for the finest organisations, and serving also as a partner in three international organisations. 
 The Labour Party said the PN’s hypocrisy has “no limit” and called out the party for “attacking professionals who choose to serve their country”.

"Miriam Dalli dismisses ‘speculation’, tells critics ‘nothing can humiliate me’",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/miriam-dalli-dismisses-speculation-tells-critics-nothing-humiliate-me.1092664,24-05-2024,001187.png,"Miriam Dalli has dismissed as “speculation” suggestions that she is being considered as Malta’s nominee for European Commissioner but has hit back at critics who said she would not survive a grilling by MEPs.
 Labour Party insiders have said the energy minister is “best placed” to replace Chris Fearne, who earlier this month withdrew his nomination in the wake of the hospitals inquiry fallout.
 But Dalli insisted she has “not even thought about it” and that her focus remains on her ministerial role and helping the party ahead of the June 8 elections.
 Reports have been swirling in Labour circles that her background as an MEP would put her in pole position for the Brussels post. 
 However, shadow foreign affairs minister Beppe Fenech Adami said Dalli would not survive a grilling from MEPs because of the Electrogas scandal. 
 “Just like Chris Fearne cannot be European Commissioner because he financed Vitals, Miriam Dalli cannot be [Commissioner] after financing Electrogas,” Fenech Adami wrote on Facebook. 
 His comments were echoed by former PN MP Jason Azzopardi. 
 When asked to clarify, Fenech Adami said that Dalli is the minister responsible in a government that is giving money to Electrogas, a company mired in scandal. 
 From 2013-2014, Dalli also worked as a communications and stakeholder management consultant to Konrad Mizzi, who was energy minister at the time.
 There is an ongoing magisterial inquiry into the government power station concession given to Electrogas shortly after the Labour Party came to power in 2013.
 “I assure you there is absolutely nothing that can humiliate me,” Dalli said when questioned by Times of Malta. 
 “No one can say anything about my integrity, least of all Beppe Fenech Adami or Jason Azzopardi,” she said. 
 When Fenech Adami was mentioned in an investigation on money laundering and drug trafficking, his name disappeared from files and the investigation closed, Dalli said. On Azzopardi, Dalli said the national auditor criticised him twice over a Fekruna Bay expropriation deal and a deal related to the Qormi Lowenbrau brewery site.
 Fearne resigned as deputy prime minister and minister days after prosecutors filed fraud charges against him related to the deal to privatise three state hospitals. 
 While he withdrew as Malta’s nominee to the next EU Commission, he will stay on as deputy leader of Labour and maintains his innocence.

State ordered to pay compensation to landlords over Lija Labour club rental,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/state-ordered-compensate-owners-labour-lijaclub-rental.1100307,30-10-2024,001211.png,"Updated 3.34pm with PN reaction below.
 The Constitutional Court has ordered the State to pay more than €150,000 in compensation to the owners of a Lija property that has been used as a Labour party club since the 1960s.
 Mr Justice Lawrence Mintoff found that the lease arrangements imposed an unfair financial burden on the Seychell family and breached their fundamental rights.
 The court said that responsibility for payment of compensation lay solely with the State Advocate, releasing the Labour Party’s Lija district committee from any financial obligation. 
 The court said that the Seychell family’s losses stemmed from the legal framework rather than any actions by the Labour Party committee itself.
 The case revolves around a property known as ""Dar il-Ħelsien,"" located on Vjal it-Trasfigurazzjoni in Lija, inherited by the Seychell family following the death of Joseph Seychell. 
 The Seychells became owners of the premises in 1989, with Joseph’s children inheriting the property as owners, with his widow, Carmen Seychell, holding usufructuary rights. 
 The Labour Party’s Lija district committee had leased the property since 1963 for use as a political club, with the annual rent initially set at Lm60.
 Despite incremental increases, the rent reached only €978.03 annually.
 Contesting the lease, the Seychell family argued that this rental income was meagre and disproportionate to the property’s true value. 
 The current rent did not reflect its potential rental worth in today’s market, and the family was legally restricted from adjusting it due to Malta’s rent laws, which imposed long-term restrictions on increases for leases established before 1995. 
 Following unsuccessful attempts to renegotiate the lease with the Labour Party, the family filed the constitutional case, asserting that the forced renewal of the rental agreement and minimal rental value violated itsrights to a fair return on its property.
 In its judgment, the court recognised that the legal provisions placed an undue financial burden on the Seychell family, who were legally bound to lease the property at below-market rates indefinitely. 
 The court acknowledged that, while the property had been let under the original agreement, the prevailing conditions no longer ensured a just balance between the interests of the landlords and the Labour Party’s use of the premises. 
 The judge ruled that the Seychells had the right to either reclaim the property or renegotiate the lease terms to reflect a market-adjusted rent.
 The amount of compensation was determined by calculating the difference between what the Seychells could have potentially earned at fair market rental value since 1987 - established at €281,131.98 - and the rent they had actually received, €12,569.78.
 The ruling emphasised that this compensation addressed the financial losses incurred due to the inadequacies of the current rent and included additional compensation for the strain caused by years of unfairly restricted rent.
 Mr Justice Mintoff also mandated that a copy of the judgment be sent to the Speaker of Parliament, urging a review of the rent laws. 
 In a reaction to the judgement, Karol Aquilina, the shadow minister for justice said this was the third court judgement of its kind involving Labour Party clubs, with the state having been ordered to pay a total compensation of €1.3 million.
 He insisted that it should be the Labour Party which coughed up the funds.  
 ""The Maltese workers should not be forced, through their taxes, to pay court-ordered damages for the Labour Party's abuses,"" Aquilina said in a statement issued by the PN.   
 He recalled that in October 2022, a court ordered nearly €1,000,000 in compensation in a case involving the rental of the Labour Party Club in Birżebbuġa.
 Then, in December 2022, the same court ordered the government to pay more than €160,000 to property owners after the Labour Party took private property to use as a political club in Santa Venera.
 ""In just one year, the court has ordered the government to pay over €1,300,000 in compensation for abuses committed by the Labour Party.
 ""The Nationalist Party expects the Labour Party, led by Robert Abela, to assume responsibility for the abuses it committed and declare that it will cover any court-ordered compensation from its own funds rather than take this money from the pockets of Maltese and Gozitan citizens,"" Aquilina said. 
 Taxpayer money should be used responsibly and not cover abuses carried out by Labour for decades.
 ""If the over €1,300,000 compensation is paid by the government, it would constitute yet another injustice, this time against Maltese and Gozitan taxpayers."" This would also amount to illegal funding of the Labour Party, he said.

 The meeting was called after Nicolette Ghirxi was found  stabbed to death in her Swatar apartment in the early hours of Monday morning.
 She was murdered by her former partner Edward Johnston who was shot dead hours later by police officers in St Julians after he brandished a weapon which turned out to be a replica gun.
 On Wednesday, PN leader Bernard Grech said he had met with the Opposition members on parliament's social and family committees and would be writing to the government proposing a convening of both committees to meet stakeholders.
 The PN hopes the meeting will discuss how to improve government systems that are in place to help avoid homicides and crime against women.

 In a press conference, shadow ministers Ivan Castillo and Albert Buttigieg said the Central Bank governor is being awarded a monthly prize by the Labour government which is more than a full year’s minimum wage.
 Scicluna stepped aside from his role this week after agreeing to a deal proposed to him by three cabinet ministers whereby he retains his position and full salary until he clears his name.  
 The former Labour finance minister faces charges of fraud and misappropriation of funds in connection with the Vitals hospitals’ case.
 “In 36 days, Scicluna will pocket what the average Maltese worker earns in 365 days”, Castillo said.
 
 He added Scicluna will be pocketing €2,600 a week or €582 a day for a whopping €195,000 if he stays on till the end of his term as Governor of the Central Bank of Malta.
 Apart from his salary, Scicluna will retain his responsibility allowance which amounts to €23,000, his car, mobile and wi-fi allowances, and will also keep his private health insurance.
 Castillo said this deal shows how Robert Abela has lost control of cabinet and is willing to submit to the will of his predecessor Joseph Muscat.
 Albert Buttigieg quoted NSO statistics which show that for the five years between 2017 and 2022, those at risk of poverty increased by 10,200 up to 85,797.
 He said that the average wage in Malta amounts to €19,000 a year, which Scicluna gets for doing nothing in less than two months.
 Buttigieg said that this is not what the Labour Party should be all about.

"'Give us full disclosure immediately,' Keith Schembri and Konrad Mizzi demand",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/give-us-full-disclosure-immediately-keith-schembri-konrad-mizzi.1092778,21-05-2024,001322.png,"Keith Schembri and Konrad Mizzi claimed on Tuesday that the Attorney General and the Police Commissioner were refusing to hand them “important documents” from the Vitals inquiry, thus breaching their rights as suspects to full disclosure and a fair trial.
 The former prime minister’s chief of staff, and former minister made the claims in two judicial protests against the Attorney General and the Police Commissioner.
 They said that they were notified about the criminal charges against them upon the conclusions of the years-long magisterial inquiry into the Vitals hospitals concession. 
 It is the first time that Mizzi and Schembri have reacted since the charges were filed against a number of individuals and companies variously connected to the deal. 
 Schembri and Mizzi, along with former Prime Minister Joseph Muscat, face the most serious charges of money laundering, bribery, trading in influence and a long list of other charges, including setting up a criminal association.  They are due to be arraigned next Tuesday.
 Kasco Engineering Limited and FSV Limited, both owned by Schembri, are among the accused. 
 The inquiry was triggered by NGO Repubblika in 2019.
 Mizzi and Schembri in their protests said that although the nature of the charges demanded a mandatory explanation from the person charged, no one ever spoke to them before the charges were pressed.
 Nor were they given “effective disclosure” by the prosecution, thus subjecting them to even greater prejudice.
 Upon the court’s direction the prosecution had given them the inquiry report but refused to hand over the appendices referred to in that report, even though most of those attachments were already in digital format.
 Replying, the Attorney General said that in her decree, the magistrate was very clear. What was to be made available were the proces verbal and any other material evidence which the police may have, resulting from any parallel investigation.
 The prosecution had handed over the proces verbal and was not obliged to hand over any other documentation. That documentation would be presented in court as part of the magisterial inquiry “in its entirety,” the AG said.
 But Schembri and Mizzi’s lawyers insisted that that information should have been handed over to them as soon as they were considered “suspects.” The Criminal Code itself granted that right to suspects and persons accused.
 Article 543AF of the Code states that such people are to have free access to all material evidence, both against and in their favour, held in police possession. That evidence may be made available to their lawyers so as to safeguard their fair trial and to be able to prepare a valid defence.
 As peoplefacing criminal charges, Schembri and Mizzi had every right to “full disclosure” from the very early stages of the compilation of evidence and especially before the court decreed whether there was sufficient prima facie evidence for the accused to stand trial on indictment.
 Such right to full disclosure was also part and parcel of the accused’s fundamental right to fair trial as safeguarded in terms of the European Convention on Human Rights, the pair argue.
 They called on the AG and the Police Commissioner to immediately grant them full disclosure without further delay, holding them responsible in damages.
 They also formally warned that they would institute constitutional proceedings should this rights violation not be remedied as soon as possible.
 Schembri and Mizzi also filed two separate replies to Repubblika’s bid to be admitted as an injured party in the criminal cases against them.
 Repubblika’s request, they said, was “nothing but a legal manouevre” to try to intervene in proceedings where the organization had no right to be.
 Repubblika had no interest in those proceedings in terms of law and their allegations “merited no reply.”
 “The only thing to say at this stage is that [Repubblika’s] allegations were more akin to a book of Aesop’s fables than a serious judicial protest,” they said. 
 Those allegations were both factually and legally “totally unfounded,” rebutted the lawyers, calling upon Repubblika to desist from any further odious, frivolous and vexatious action.

EPP boss Manfred Weber warns of far-right ‘neo-Nazis’,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/epp-boss-weber-warns-far-right-neo-nazis.1101476,25-11-2024,"001327.png,001328.png,001329.png,001330.png,001331.png","The leader of the European Parliament’s dominant political group has denounced some far-right parties in Europe as “neo-Nazis” and “enemies” and insisted that cooperation with French National Rally leader Marine Le Pen is “impossible”.
 European People’s Party (EPP) president Manfred Weber stressed his group’s resolve to only work with those that share its values on key issues.
 
 He emphasised his party’s “key conditions” for its partners in the European Parliament – that they be “pro-Europe, pro-Ukraine... and pro-rule-of-law”.
 “These are the basic issues for us, and that’s why, for us, it’s impossible to work together with [Marine] Le Pen. For us, it’s impossible to work with FPÖ [Freedom Party of Austria] or the AfD [Alternative for Germany]; they are neo-Nazis,” he said.
 “They are not only competitors; they are enemies, and we will fight against them because we are the party of Europe.”
  Weber was speaking to Times of Malta while visiting Malta for an  EPP political assembly hosted by the Nationalist Party, his group’s national party in Malta.
 Accusing Le Pen of “putting European integration into question”, Weber stressed there would never be any kind of compromise with the French far-right leader while promising his party would be “strong” on its principles.
 But, in recent months, those principles have been called into question by those who accuse the EPP of dealing with far-right parties when it suits them.
 In October, EPP MEPs voted with the right-wing European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) and far-right parties Patriots for Europe (PfE) and Europe of Sovereign Nations (ESN) to adopt a non-binding resolution backing Venezuelan Opposition Leader Edmundo González – a vote that received no left-wing support.
  And in November, amendments to an EU deforestation law slammed by critics as anti-green and tabled by the EPP were backed by MEPs from the same parties.
 Pressed on how his party could appear to work with PfE – which includes MEPs from Le Pen’s National Rally and Victor Orbán’s Fidesz – while disavowing cooperation with the far-right, Weber stressed there was no official collaboration while seeming to put the voting down to individual choice.
 “There is no cooperation with the Patriots for Europe on a European level; we don’t have structured cooperation,” he said, adding that left-wing parties had also formed majorities with far-right MEPs on some amendments.
 “They [PfE members] are elected, they have their place there, their voting right as individual MEPs, but we made sure that they have no impact in the leadership of Europe.”
  Turning to geo-politics, the EPP leader – who has been a vocal critic of Russia’s war in Ukraine and its president Vladimir Putin – said the conflict was “not only a territorial war... it is the borderline between the free world and the dictatorship world”.
 Stressing that more than 100,000 young Russian soldiers have died in the conflict, Weber said Putin does not care at all about his own citizens, while declaring his support for Ukraine to be “without condition”.
  Pointing to subversive tactics used by Russia to influence politics in Moldova, Georgia and Slovakia – “where fake news has already changed government; now we have a pro-Russian government” – Weber said the “bigger target for him [Putin] is that he wins over Europe”.
 “That sounds a little bit ridiculous, but the young Russian soldiers get a small book before they go into the war zone, and there it is described that they fight for a Eurasian Union from Lisbon to Vladivostok, governed by Moscow,” he said.
 “For us, that sounds crazy, but that’s the nature of this ambitious dictatorship... He [Putin] wants to think in an imperialistic way, which we thought was over after the Second World War. That was our hope... [but] he is again pushing us into the old world.”
 Calling for Europe to strengthen its defence capabilities, Weber – who has voiced his support for a European nuclear deterrent and suggested placing missile defences in Cyprus and Poland – said at present the continent was not capable to defend itself.
 “We still need the Americans to do the job. And frankly speaking, Donald Trump is right when he says, ‘why should 330 million Americans defend 414 million Europeans?’”
 Attributing Trump’s success in the recent US elections to his appeal to middle-class voters on inflation – “that’s a lesson also for me as a party leader” – Weber said it was important to understand the Republican leader’s success rather than just commenting on his populist appeal.
  But with Trump no stranger to controversy, how does the EPP leader respond to controversial statements from the US president-elect that undocumented migrants were “poisoning the blood” of America?
 “It’s unacceptable from a European point of view,” said Weber. “But the Americans have their way of doing things. I think we should not lecture them, we should not judge them.”
 Calling the next EP cycle “historic” with the “populist wave in mind”, however, he said the EPP felt “huge responsibility” to deliver on issues important to voters.
 “But we want to govern Europe from the centre. And the people know it doesn’t make sense to vote for populists, because the centre-right parties, the Conservative parties, are delivering.”
 Reiterating his party would only work with pro-rule-of-law parties, Weber said in Malta PN leader Bernard Grech was “really the person who is putting the rule-of-law question on the table”.
  But while the Nationalists made significant gains in this year’s MEP and local council elections, how does he respond to doubts about Grech, who has continued to trail Prime Minister Robert Abela in recent trust polls?
 “I see differently. I see Bernard acting with strong leadership... he was really insisting on putting questions of living conditions, of quality of life on the agenda today in our political assembly,” he said.
 “He knows what is at stake...  That’s why we want to support Bernard in his efforts... and to show that the [Nationalist] party here is not only a Maltese party; it’s part of the biggest family in Europe governing Europe.
 ”The Nationalist Party has seen its presence on the European stage boosted in recent years with the appointment of PN MEP Roberta Metsola to the post of European Parliament president.
  Last summer, Metsola secured her second term of two-and-a-half years – the traditional length for those occupying the post, which typically sees two presidents each five-year EP cycle.
  Asked if he thought Metsola might seek a third term in office following her re-election to the post earlier this year, the EPP president said the prospect was “too early to assess”.
 Addressing speculation she might return to Malta to lead the Nationalist Party in the future, Weber said it was “not an issue”, instead saying the PN enjoyed “two strong leaders” in Grech and Metsola.
 ‘Good to see where Muscat is today’ Last year, Weber described the lack of justice for those who ordered the assassination of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia as a “symbol of Malta’s rule-of-law failings”, and in 2021 said “evidence still points to the highest levels of government”.
 Asked if he still held the same assessment of the country, the EPP leader said that while there had been developments, there were still questions that needed to be answered.
 “I see the condition Joseph Muscat is in today, and that is good,” he said in seeming reference to the former prime minister facing corruption charges in relation to the Vitals deal.
 “But I have to say this took a very long time... so that’s why the questions are still there.”
 Stressing he wanted to avoid using rule-of-law issues “for party political interests”, however – while avoiding direct criticism of Abela – Weber said a recent European Commission report highlighting a lack of action on the issue showed there was still a lot to do in Malta.

Friends call 'solidarity meeting' outside courts when Joseph Muscat is arraigned,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/friends-call-solidarity-meeting-outside-courts.1092758,21-05-2024,001332.png,"Updated 11.11am with Repubblika letter to the police commissioner below.
 Close associates of former Prime Minister Joseph Muscat have called a 'solidarity meeting' outside the law courts today week as Muscat is arraigned over the Vitals hospitals deal.
 He is due to be formally accused of money laundering, bribery, trading in influence and a long list of other charges, including setting up a criminal association.
 The charges were filed earlier this month and Muscat reacted by saying they'd be funny if they weren't so serious.
 ""I am going to relish destroying each and every one of these charges and proving how they are built on fantasy and lies,"" he had said.
 Muscat is being arraigned by summons, not under arrest. 
 The 'solidarity meeting' was announced by broadcaster Emanuel Cuschieri who said the people needed to calmly and in a civilised manner show solidarity on Tuesday morning with the man who had truly cared for them. 
 
 The message was relayed by Muscat's lawyer and friend Charlon Gouder and another close Muscat friend, former Labour general secretary Jason Micallef, who said he would be there.
 It is not clear, however, whether the Labour Party is itself backing the event.
 Prime Minister Robert Abela had criticised magistrate Gabriella Vella over the timing of her inquiry report into the Vitals hospitals deal - weeks before the European and local elections. It was that report which ultimately led to the arraignment, although the decision to arraign and the actual arraignment date were set by the Attorney General and another magistrate.
 Former Chief of Staff Keith Schembri and former minister Konrad Mizzi are also due to be arraigned on Tuesday to face similar charges.
 
 Former Deputy Prime Minister Chris Fearne and former Finance Minister Edward Scicluna, now governor of the Central Bank, as well as a number of retired and serving civil servants, are due to be arraigned on the following day to face lesser but still serious charges including fraud.
 In August 2022 Cuschieri had also invited supporters to meet outside the law courts during the arraignment of former Infrastructure Malta CEO Fredrick Azzopardi, who faced criminal charges over illegal road works carried out on his watch.
 The Labour Party had dissociated itself from that event, which turned out to be a flop. 
 Robert Aquilina, the honorary president of Repubblika, who had instigated the magisterial inquiry into the Vitals case, on Tuesday wrote to the police commissioner to inform him the NGO was not planning any public events on the days of the arraignments.
 He said in a Facebook statement that Muscat was continuing to raise tensions in a bid to avoid the consequences of his deception while prime minister.
 It was evident that Muscat's irresponsible actions posed a challenge to the police to maintain law and order in such a delicate time, he said.
 Repubblika, he said, had always worked to ensure good order, even during its public protests and would therefore hold no events on May 28 and 29. 
 He appealed to the public to let justice take its course and not to fall for any provocation.

 The Public Service, she said, was one of the guardians of good governance and serving the people and the state was not always easy, particularly in certain tasks faced by senior public service officers.
 Her comments come a few weeks after the prime minister appeared to be critical of certain public officers following the European Parliament and local council election results.
 Robert Abela said some people employed by the government seemed to be there to have a ""cushy job"". 
 The president's comments also follow a decision by prosecutors to charge three top civil servants with crimes in connection with the Joseph Muscat-era deal to privatise three state hospitals.
 The president said the Public Service provided continuity of leadership from one administration to another. 
 Public Service officers must be firm, impartial, in no way partisan, and with the courage to stop if they believe that the chosen or proposed paths are not in the interest of the national good, for the benefit of our people and our country, the president was quoted as saying in a statement issued by her office. 
 ""The Public Service is the backbone of democratic leadership, one of the guardians of good governance. That is why public officers must be honest, principled, and above all loyal to the country and to the people,"" she added. 
 Therefore, for Public Service officers to accomplish and fulfil their obligations towards the state and the people in the performance of their duties, they must be guided by good judgment and caution.
 The president went on to praise the Public Service in its efforts to improve public information and accessibility, particularly through online platforms, but said one must not forget those who either do not know how, or do not feel comfortable using such means of communication, and therefore prefer in-person services.

ADPD to appeal as court dismisses challenge on parliamentary seat allocation,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/adpd-appeal-court-dismisses-challenge-parliamentary-seat-allocations.1102532,16-12-2024,001362.png,"ADPD plans to appeal a court ruling that dismissed its constitutional challenge over the allocation of additional parliamentary seats to the two main parties following the 2022 general election.
 The Green Party, ADPD, has long called for electoral reforms to ensure proportional voting representation, maintaining that the current system undermines democratic equality and rules favouring the Labour and Nationalist parties. 
 Speaking outside the courts on Monday, shortly after the verdict, chairperson Sandra Gauci said: “We will appeal as we believe that every vote counts and that every vote should be represented"".
 The constitutional case raised by ADPD in 2022 argued that Malta’s electoral laws discriminate against smaller parties. Their challenge was based on provisions of the law, which say that the allocation of extra seats in parliament to reflect proportionality with votes only applies to parties already represented in parliament; the same provision governs the allocation of gender-balancing seats, further compounding the disadvantage for smaller parties.
 Carmel Cacopardo, the party’s deputy leader, explained the reasoning behind Judge Ian Spiteri Bailey's decision on Monday.
 “Firstly, the constitution cannot contradict itself, and because of that, it cannot be contested. Secondly, the court decided that the constitution is not subject to the European Convention on Human Rights,” he said.
 Despite this outcome, ADPD remains resolute in its fight for electoral reform.
 “We will appeal, and if the Court of Appeal does not rule in favour, we will continue to raise the issue with the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg,” Cacopardo added.
 During the 2022 general election, ADPD saw its support increase but did not secure parliamentary representation. Subsequent MEP and local council elections in  2024 delivered mixed results, with the party winning two local council seats but struggling in the European Parliament elections, where controversial far-right candidate Norman Lowell received more than double ADPD’s first-count votes.
 When asked about possibly forming a coalition with another third party or independent candidate, Cacopardo said Alternativa Demokratika had already done so when it joined forces with Partit Demokratiku. 
 ""Nothing is excluded, but obviously, to form an alliance, they need to be of the same ideas. I cannot align myself with someone without principles.”

Everyone named in the Vitals inquiry must go - PN,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/everyone-named-vitals-inquiry-go-pn.1091935,21-06-2024,001371.png,"Every person named in the Vitals inquiry must step down from political life and resign from every public role they occupy, the PN said in a statement on Friday. 
 This comes after news broke that EU Funds Minister Chris Fearne, former minister and governor of the Central Bank Edward Scicluna as well as three top civil servants are likely to be criminally charged in connection with the Vitals deal. 
 The PN said that anybody, be it the prime minister, the deputy prime minister, a minister a parliamentary secretary or anyone occupying any role in the public service, that is named in connection to the deal should immediately be removed from their position. 
 “Anyone involved with the biggest fraud in our country’s history cannot continue to enjoy its protection. This is what accountability and justice without fear or favour demand, irrespective of what Robert Abela has to say about it,” the party said in a statement. 
 It is clear, they continued, that Robert Abela, Joseph Muscat and Chris Fearne are aware of the contents of the inquiry conclusions, not only because they are aware of their own actions throughout the years but also because Abela is making use of what he knows about the inquiry to execute political manoeuvres in his favour. 
 This is happening with the complicity of the Attorney General and the Police Commissioner who are still “occupied” by Castille and make all of their moves only with the blessing of the Office of the Prime Minister, they said.  
 “The PN expects that the Attorney General and the Police Commissioner to stop dragging their feet and do as they are obliged as stipulated by law in order to deliver justice to the people,” they said. 
 In comments on Facebook, Opposition Leader Bernard Grech said that Abela had failed to learn anything from what led to Joseph Muscat’s downfall. 
 “Robert Abela is decided and determined to hold on to his deal with the devil,” he said.
  Fearne, who took over the hospitals concession when Konrad Mizzi resigned from cabinet in 2019, is Malta’s nominee to become an EU Commissioner later this year. Scicluna served as Finance Minister at the time the deal was struck. 
 Neither Scicluna nor Fearne were singled out for any blame related to the deal in an investigation by the National Audit Office and they barely featured in documentation surrounding the deal that was filed as part of a civil court case that led to the deal being annulled. 
 Fearne has said that, while he is not aware of the details of the outcome of the inquiry, he maintains that there was no wrongdoing on his part. 
 Sources have said that the minister even called for a confidence vote among his fellow MPs on Thursday, insisting he never made a cent from the deal.

PN slams government over National Energy and Climate Plans delay,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/pn-slams-government-national-energy-climate-plans-delay.1101191,18-11-2024,001389.png,"The Nationalist Party on Monday called for strong, transparent, and ambitious climate policies as it noted that the European Commission had reprimanded Malta for not submitting its final National Energy and Climate Plans on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action.
 The Commission has given Malta two months for rectification, failing which Malta could be subject to legal action and financial penalties.
 The National Energy and Climate Plans are crucial tools for EU member states to outline clear strategies to meet the EU's targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, expanding renewable energy, and improving energy efficiency by 2030, the PN observed. The submission of such plans is essential for the European Commission to assess overall progress toward these goals.
 ""The Labour government’s failure to submit its final updated NECPs demonstrates yet another complete failure on climate action. This failure not only undermines Malta's credibility but also jeopardizes our ability to meet the EU climate targets legally mandated,"" the PN said. 
 ""Moreover, following the underwhelming proposals on climate change presented during the 2025 Budget, this formal notice only further underlines the government’s lack of ambition in renewable energy and climate policies, with Malta’s current targets already deemed insufficient by the European Commission.""
 The PN said it is the duty of the state to abide by its duties under EU law and ensure a sustainable future for the nation in the form of a strong climate and renewable energy policy. ""This issue goes beyond regulatory requirements; it is about protecting and building a climate-proof and resilient future.""
  The statement was signed by Eve Borg Bonello, shadow minister for climate change and  Ryan Callus, shadow minister for energy, research and innovation.

Students kept waiting for scholarship payments: ‘Wait causing constant stress’,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/students-kept-waiting-scholarship-payments.1091422,05-06-2024,001398.png,"A number of recipients of the Endeavour Scholarships Scheme have been waiting up to seven months to receive the first instalment of their scholarship funding since they started their course, a delay they say is impacting them personally and academically.
 Partly financed by the EU, the Endeavour Scholarships Scheme, run by the Education Ministry, supports tertiary education at a Master’s and PhD level. It aims to ensure the Maltese labour market is supplied with the right individuals to place it in a better position to compete internationally.
 Based on the last scheme, students are eligible for up to €12,000. That sum is given to full-time students in a foreign university who need to receive 120 academic credits. The scholarship payments directly correlate with the number of academic credits (ECTS) the awardee receives throughout their course.
 The students’ initial payment can cover up to 30% of the total credits they need to achieve throughout their course. This means awardees have to foot the entire costs, which can climb to  several thousands of euros.
 One recipient who waited seven months to receive funding from the start of the course said the wait caused “a constant and daily financial stress” even though she worked since the age of 16 to fund her dream course.
 The scholarship began in 2015 when full-time students’ tuition fees/bench fees were initially paid to the awardee at the start of their academic year.
  However, in 2021 awardees were told to expect initial payments in January, in what could be an awardee’s second semester. In 2022 and 2023, students were told to expect initial payments in February.
 Some students started receiving their initial funding during the last week of March, while one student received his at the end of April. This was two months after they were told they would receive their initial payment and more than seven months after they began their course.
 Students said they could not rely on the scholarship due to the long waiting times unless there was some form of financial aid.
 Some students complained that their course credits were not equally distributed throughout their academic year leaving them without funding. One recipient only received the initial payment while they were carrying out their course.
 “The rest of the payments were only given once the Master’s was completed, and, at that point, it was too late for me to use any of it,” said one student.
 The student is a science researcher and had to pay for her own lab equipment above and beyond her tuition fees. She said: “I feel that, due to the long delays in funding, I didn’t receive sufficient help with furthering my education. The way the Endeavour funding is being rolled out makes it difficult for people who don’t come from a privileged background or those who do not necessarily have any financial help to be able to access further education. The delays affected me both personally and professionally.”
 Questions were sent to the Education Ministry.

"Residents, activists unite against rampant encroachment of public spaces",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/residents-activists-unite-rampant-encroachment-public-spaces.1091643,27-04-2024,001400.png,"Activists and residents on Saturday launched the Il-Bankini taċ-Ċittadini campaign to protest the rampant abuse of public spaces taken over by commercial interests, mostly through tables and chairs.
 NGOs Moviment Graffitti and Flimkien Għal Ambjent Aħjar were joined by the residents' associations of Sliema, Valletta, Marsascala, Mellieħa, St Paul’s Bay and Cottonera’s Azzjoni Tuna Artna Lura.
 Addressing a press conference in Merchants Street, the organisations highlighted the difficulties experienced in various localities due to the take-up of public land by unrestrained commerce. This led them to form a coalition to compel the authorities to take action.
 The choice of Merchants Street was a symbolic one since it was a testament to the lack of serious enforcement and regulation which had caused this road to be almost completely swallowed up by catering establishments. The road became “a maze of tables, chairs, tents and other structures”, making it almost impossible for people to walk comfortably.
 Residents and activists explained they are not anti-business, but stressed that the balance between business and people’s well-being had shifted completely towards business interests.
 This imbalance can be felt and seen in places such as the Sliema, Gżira and Marsascala seafronts, where sidewalks have been completely taken up by catering establishments that day by day continue to extend their business operations on public land, making it impossible for residents to walk on sidewalks.
 They recalled how a frustrated Sliema resident had to resort to apply for an encroachment concession to return the pavement to public use after a developer occupied the road and pavement area illegally.
 The consequences of the lack of regulation on the occupation of public land by the catering industry are also felt by the Valletta residents, who claim they feel almost forced out of their homes to make way for business.
 In a statement, Moviment Graffitti said this problem was symptomatic of the mess that the Planning Authority, the Lands Authority and the Malta Tourism Authority are in, where their loyalty shifted towards the business interests and “seem more intent on facilitating abuse rather than enforce the law”.
 The deafening silence on the part of the authorities has led residents to come together to fight for their right to free, safe, and unhindered public access.
 They are demanding a review of legislation, more transparency in the way permits are granted, especially by the Lands Authority and the introduction of a right to action, giving any person the right to sue for the revocation of any encroachment granted if any permit conditions are breached.
 They stressed that if the authorities continue to ignore their pleas for action, more residents will continue to come together to fight for their rights.
 According to figures tabled in parliament, a total of 68 bars, restaurants and other food establishments have a permit to put out tables and chairs on public land in Sliema and Gżira. 
 Most of the permits stretch across Triq ix-Xatt and the majority of them are located in Sliema.

Joseph Muscat: 'If I’m guilty send me to prison for life',timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/joseph-muscat-if-i-m-guilty-send-prison-life.1092191,05-09-2024,001402.png,"Updated 6pm
 Joseph Muscat came ready for a fight in his first interview after it was revealed that criminal charges have been filed against him this week. 
 The former prime minister, along with his chief of staff Keith Schembri and former minister Konrad Mizzi are facing money laundering, corruption and bribery charges for their roles in overseeing a deal that privatised three state hospitals. A court found the deal to be “fraudulent” and it was  annulled last year. 
 But in a televised interview on F Living, Muscat came out swinging, telling presenter Karl Bonaci that, if he was actually guilty of what he is accused of he should “spend the rest of his life in jail”. 
 “They made me out to be Totò Riina,” he said, referring to the notorious Italian mobster while repeating his assertion that the charges are “laughable” and that he sleeps soundly at night because he knows that “he is absolutely not involved” with the things he stands accused of. 
 “The things they accused me of, I could spend up to 18 years in prison, but if it were true, if I took €30 million, I deserve to spend life in prison, I would deserve to stay there until I die and only leave until they carry me out in a coffin,” Muscat said. 
 Muscat gave the interview a short while after a court ruled that he should be given access to parts of the magisterial inquiry that concerned him. He described that decision as a positive step that he had spent the past year pushing for. 
 Not shying away from the spotlight, Muscat went on to say that despite the pressure, he is enjoying the increased attention this story has brought.   
 “I haven’t felt this alive in a long time. I feel like a boxer who has hung up his gloves but is now close enough to smell the ring,” the former prime minister said. 
 “I’m enjoying having more contact with people, I enjoy coming here and getting to speak and show things for what they are.” 
 Muscat said that it was those who were responsible for the criminal charges that would pay the ultimate price.  
 “When this story is over, me, the Labour Party and the country will come out stronger while those who came up with this fantastical story will be left broken in its wake,” Muscat continued.
 He also hammered home the claim that the inquiry alleges that he stole €30 million, repeating that figure throughout the interview.
 “Once this case is over, people will turn against those who are trying to peddle the lie that Joseph Muscat made off with €30 million,"" he said.
 Prosecutors have requested a €30 million freezing order on Muscat's assets and have filed similar freezing order requests for others facing prosecution.  
 During a press conference last Monday, Prime Minister Robert Abela told a journalist that it would be ""misinformation"" to interpret that to mean that Muscat or any single person ""took €30 million himself"". 
 Muscat, however, did just that, arguing that if you tallied up all the freezing orders that prosecutors have sought, they totalled €550 million.  
 “Some genius thinks that they paid more in bribes than the entire deal was worth,"" he said. 
 Muscat made it clear that he intends to spend years in litigation over the Vitals case. Those who had landed him before a criminal court would be made to pay, he said. 
 ""I'll sue the people who came up with this invention for the millions they wasted,"" he said. 
 Justice Minister Jonathan Attard previously said that the magisterial inquiry cost €10 million, although the prime minister subsequently cited an €11 million figure. 
 Taking a dig at rumours circulating that he planned to abscond from the country, Muscat said he would always return to Malta and had no intention of fleeing.
 He could not say the same of those who had instigated the case, namely civil society group Repubblika, he implied.
 “I hope that none of those people run away after they came up with this mess,” he said. 
 Muscat said he was willing to engage in litigation to make them pay. 
 “What I really want to see is an €11 million bill sent to the people who instigated this disaster and I mean it, I’m ready to go to court and open a case myself if it comes to that,” he continued. 
 “If they truly find that I took this €30 million then they can take me out of prison in a coffin. But it is all made up and I will take all the steps necessary to make sure that whoever came up with it, at the very least has to pay back the €11 million taken from the taxpayer.""
 During the interview, Muscat also addressed accusations that his criticism of Magistrate Gabriella Vella is piling on undue pressure on the judiciary.
 Criticism is measured by a different yardstick when it comes from people in Labour’s camp, he said.  
 “Why is it that when the PN or Repubblika speak out against the Attorney General or the police commissioner its freedom of speech, but when Joseph Muscat or Robert Abela say something it's attacking the judiciary,” he asked. 
 Labour supporters “are not children of lesser gods”, he said, as he sought to reassure Labour supporters that demonstrating in his favour “not be instigating”. 
 Muscat’s confidante and Labour firebrand Manuel Cuschieri has urged people to demonstrate outside the law courts when Muscat is arraigned. 
 The former prime minister argued that his criticism of the magistrate - he has called her biased and said she has engaged in “political terrorism” - was fair comment. 
 “If you criticise the Church it doesn’t mean you’re attacking God. Even priests who disagree with certain things and speak out, it doesn’t mean they’ve lost their faith.” 
 He argued that his battle against the magistrate was of interest to all of Malta. The inquiry, he said, showed how a person could wake up one morning and discover they’ve been charged with crimes, without being given the opportunity to explain themselves. 
 Prosecuting key former civil servants was also very dangerous, he said, citing the example of former Finance permanent secretary Alfred Camilleri. 
 Camilleri - who worked under both PN and PL administrations and who Robert Abela described as “immensely correct” - is one of three permanent secretaries facing criminal charges. 
 “One of my biggest fears is that a situation like this could end up paralysing the government,” Muscat said. 
 “If people in the civil service can be held liable and have nobody hear them out, I can imagine them thinking ‘what am I even doing here?’” he said. 
 “It could jam up the entire government and if the PN cannot see the problem they created, they are not seeing the gravity of the situation.”

Abela denies ordering police not to interrogate those named in Vitals inquiry,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/abela-denies-ordering-police-interrogate-named-vitals-inquiry.1097227,26-08-2024,001477.png,"Prime Minister Robert Abela has “categorically"" denied ordering senior police officers not to interrogate some of the people named in the magisterial inquiry into the privatisation deal for the running of three state hospitals.
 He was responding to an article that appeared in MaltaToday on Sunday, which reported claims by unnamed Labour insiders, including senior cabinet ministers, that Abela had ordered senior police figures not to interrogate some of those named in the inquiry.
 In a statement on Sunday evening, the Office of the Prime Minister (OPM) said Abela “denies categorically and in the most absolute way that he has ever given any direction similar to what has been maliciously reported.”
 The Prime Minister’s office said the claims had been made ""without verifying with the Office of the Prime Minister before publishing the report, which  shows how much the intention was not to report factually and truthfully.”
 The decision of who to interrogate was solely at the discretion of the executive branch of the police and the Attorney General, it said, stressing the Prime Minister “in no way interfered with the functions of the mentioned institutions.”
 Abela had instead worked to strengthen the rule of law and independence of such offices, with the European Commission noting a “remarkable improvement” in the rule of law in Malta, the statement read.
 It added that the Prime Minister “remains committed” to continuing such efforts.
 Earlier on Sunday, rule-of-law NGO Repubblika said Abela should deny the accusations in the  MaltaToday article, or resign.
 “We call on the prime minister to deny the allegation that he gave instructions to the police on who they should or should not interrogate and who they should or should not bring to court,” it said in a statement. 
 “If he does not do so, he should resign before nightfall”, Repubblika said.
 Meanwhile, commenting on the claims during a Net TV segment, Opposition leader Bernard Grech said Abela's administration had ""reached its lowest ebb.""
 MaltaToday reported claims by insiders that the alleged order not to interrogate those named in the inquiry into the hospitals deal was aimed at “cushioning the impact of the conclusions on Joseph Muscat” - an alleged decision one insider called a “big and serious mistake.”
 The claims appeared alongside assertions that the Prime Minister’s leadership was angering those within the government and the party.

 ""In the last eight years, Europe has always reacted to what the US does and waited for America to save us when there was a war close by"" Metsola told an event in Floriana organised by the EP office in Malta, CORE Platform and JCI Malta
 European countries should not expect US policy to always act to the EU's benefit, she said, providing a recent example: ""A [US] law was presented as an environmental law but was truly done to protect American industries. We were too late to respond to that"".
 Metsola was referring to the Inflation Reduction Act that provides generous tax credits and fiscal incentives on renewable energy, electric vehicle incentives, home energy efficiency upgrades, and advanced manufacturing companies. 
 Critics argue the act may promote a shift in green investments and production from the EU to the US.
 Next week the US will choose between Democrat vice-president Kamala Harris or former Republican president Donald Trump.
 On Wednesday, Metsola said that no matter who wins the election, the EU needs to be better prepared to act of its own accord, she said. 
 ""Our businesses are begging us to be prepared and not be complacent or squeezed by China and India,"" she added.
 Metsola noted that Maltese entrepreneurs had to focus on presenting the best products, and for that to happen, businesses needed all the support they could get from the government.

 Far-right gains in EU-wide elections, which triggered snap polls and political upheaval in France, appear to have focused minds around the positions at the bloc's helm -- negotiated among its members with an eye to geographic and political balance.
 While leaders were expected to formally make their choices known at a June 27-28 summit, a consensus already appears to be emerging. 
 ""I believe things can move forward efficiently. At least that is my wish, and that will be my frame of mind on Monday,"" French President Emmanuel Macron said at the end of the G7 summit in Italy, where he held talks with both German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and von der Leyen.
 Scholz sent a similar message, telling ARD television that ""a political majority is coming together"" and that ""things could be decided fast.""
 Monday's meeting kicks off at 6:00 pm (1600 GMT) in von der Leyen's presence -- but the commission chief will leave before dinner, when leaders are to tackle the matter of top jobs.
 Von der Leyen's European People's Party (EPP) was the biggest winner from the June 6-9 EU parliament elections, cementing the German conservative's bid for five more years helming the executive body of the world's second-largest economy.
 The other roles to be decided are: president of the European Council, which represents member states and is currently filled by Charles Michel; and the ""high representative"" -- the EU's foreign policy chief -- currently Josep Borrell.
 The second group in parliament, the Socialists and Democrats (S&D), have their sights set on the Council position -- with Antonio Costa, Portugal's 62-year-old former prime minister, seen as frontrunner.
 
 Costa resigned after becoming embroiled in a corruption probe -- but the case has since appeared to come apart, and diplomats suggest it is unlikely to stand in his way.
 The high representative position could go to Kaja Kallas, 46, current premier of Estonia and an outspoken Kremlin critic -- in a strong signal to the EU's east.
 A fourth job is in play: that of European Parliament president, decided by the legislature, not the leaders. It is likely to return the incumbent, the EPP's Roberta Metsola, 45, for another 2.5-year term.
 To secure the nod from EU leaders, the 65-year-old von der Leyen needs support from a ""qualified majority"" of 15 out of 27 countries, covering at least 65 percent of the bloc's population.
 A dozen leaders come from her EPP political grouping -- but she also needs to win over Macron, from the centrist Renew Europe group, and Scholz of the S&D. 
 Both leaders of the Franco-German axis at the heart of the European Union have emerged weakened after being beaten by far-right parties in this month's polls.
 Most spectacularly in France, Marine Le Pen's National Rally (RN) trounced the party of the president, who now faces the prospect of the RN's leader -- the 28-year-old TikTok-friendly Jordan Bardella -- potentially becoming his prime minister.
 Scholz meanwhile is resisting calls to also call snap elections since his party scored its worst-ever EU vote result, behind the far-right AfD and, in first place, the opposition CDU-CSU bloc.
 Conversely, the elections strengthened the hand of Italy's prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, who diplomats suggest may want to let the dust settle in the new EU parliament -- where her far-right party's grouping gained seats and may yet gain more -- and negotiate accordingly.
 If, as expected, von der Leyen ultimately pockets enough leaders' votes, she can set about choosing her commissioners -- drawn from each of the EU member countries with consideration for gender balance and political affiliation.
 But she will have one more hurdle to pass.
 The new European Parliament has to approve leaders' picks and proposed commissioners.
 Most lawmakers from the EPP, which holds 190 seats in the incoming 720-seat parliament, will endorse von der Leyen -- but she will need support from elsewhere to secure a majority.
 That would likely come from the other mainstream political families, the S&D and Renew, or from the Greens -- but von der Leyen has also been covering her bases by courting Meloni, on the hard right.

 The issue stemmed from a controversial decision by the Broadcasting Authority on August 21, when it fined RTK103 radio €4,660 after Lowell, the leader of Imperium Europa party, was excluded from a discussion programme in the run-up to the June elections.
 Buttiġieġ subsequently wrote on Facebook that while the right to freedom of expression should be respected, when this right was used to undermine the fundamental rights of other people by hate speech, it was everyone's responsibility to ensure that this narrative was not promoted further.
 ""Let us not undermine democracy by giving space to somebody who constitutes populist incitement which, apart from being dangerous, is also lacking basic facts,"" she wrote.
 Lowell complained that the parliamentary secretary's statement was based on mistaken media reports and constituted a breach of the ministerial code of ethics.
 The Standards Commissioner said two points needed to be considered: whether the parliamentary secretary's remarks were a reasonable description of the views of Imperium Europa and whether a member of the executive should express a position such as this.
 As for the first point, Buttiġieġ was referring to concrete facts when she referred to declarations by Lowell, who as leader of the party been found guilty of racist declarations in court. The Commissioner recalled that his office during a previous investigation, in 2021, had examined the website of Imperium Europa and found that it featured various declarations which went against the principles of democracy and equality, leading one to wonder whether it was respecting the criminal code. The site was no longer accessible, but the Office could confirm that up to just three years ago, the party transmitted extreme views, which could not be ignored. 
 As for the second point, a person who was appointed to the Executive did not lose his right to express a political opinion, as long as he or she did not make use of the media of the state for that purpose. In this case, Buttiġieġ had commented on her personal page on Facebook.
 Therefore the commissioner said there was no further basis for investigation of this case.

 Joseph Muscat, Konrad Mizzi and Keith Schembri are among roughly 19 individuals and companies named in criminal charges filed on Monday concerning the scandal-racked deal to privatise three state hospitals.
 Times of Malta understands the former prime minister, his chief staff and ex-senior minister are to be arraigned under summons, not arrest – meaning they will be expected to appear in court on the date of their arraignment and that they will be able to return home following their arraignment. 
 Sources said the charges were filed in court on Monday afternoon by three lawyers from the office of Attorney General Victoria Buttigieg. 
 Individuals and companies to be charged have been divided into three lots, though it remains unclear which crimes have been cited on each of those lots.
 Muscat, Mizzi and Schembri are understood to feature in the first of those three charge sheets, along with a number of others. 
 Repubblika’s honorary president Robert Aquilina told Times of Malta that he received confirmation from Buttigieg’s office via email that all the people mentioned by the inquiring magistrate will be charged.
 The inquiry, which was led by Magistrate Gabriella Vella and tasked with determining whether Muscat, his ministers or top officials committed crimes in connection with the deal to hand three state hospitals to Vitals Global Healthcare, was completed 10 days ago.
 Muscat immediately said the inquiry was a “political vendetta” and that he expected to be charged. Others believed to have been involved, including Mizzi, Schembri and Central Bank governor Edward Scicluna, have not commented.
 Chris Fearne, Malta's nominee to the European Commission and who is also believed to be among  those cited in the inquiry, has insisted he had nothing to hide. 
 Vitals was a company with no history of business and exited the privatisation deal after a few years, handing over operations to US healthcare giants Steward Health Care. 
 But Steward also did not honour contractual obligations, and last year a court annulled the deal on the basis of fraud. Steward - which is locked in a dispute with the government over a €100m exit fee it says it is owed - filed for bankruptcy in the US earlier on Monday.
 In a Facebook post, Joseph Muscat noted that police had not questioned him before charges were filed.  
 ""This is no longer just a vendetta, it is disgusting and an abomination. Tens of people's lives are being tossed into a bureaucratic dump for years, just to suit others,"" he wrote. 
 ""Anyone who is involved in this injustice or who looked the other way instead of trying to fix it will be judged harshly by the people, justice and history,"" Muscat said. 
  With the attorney general having now filed criminal charges in court, it is up to the judiciary to manage the next steps in the process.  
 The criminal charges that have been filed will be handled by the court registrar, who will allocate them to a magistrate at random, by lot.
 
 Whichever magistrate is assigned the case will then set a date for arraignment and notify the accused of the charges they face, and the date when the arraignments will take place.
 The inquiry that triggered the AG to file criminal charges remains secret, though Opposition leader Bernard Grech has said that it is clear that Prime Minister Robert Abela has a copy and is using it for his own political ends.

 Agius said he received that message verbally and that it was given to him on the OPM's behalf by someone ""external"", but implied he had a recording in which the person relaying the message could be heard making the offer.
 Agius, who served as the official driver to junior minister Andy Ellul, is one of five people accused of having perpetuated a massive, years-long fraud that saw people being falsely classified as disabled to be granted monthly benefit payments.
  He has claimed that the fraud involved top officials in Michael Falzon’s Social Policy ministry, including Falzon’s person of trust Mark Calleja, known as Il-Gulija.
 He is being defended in court by Jason Azzopardi, a former PN MP and major antagonist of Robert Abela’s Labour government.
 Speaking on Saturday while seated next to Agius, Azzopardi said his client’s experience with the OPM tallied with what he heard from another client of his, who is one of the people charged with having received fraudulent benefit payments.
 “This person would never have been found guilty, because they had a severe illness and lacked criminal intent. But someone at the OPM told them that if they repaid the money they received and got rid of me as their lawyer, they would avoid prosecution,” Azzopardi said.
 Azzopardi and Agius were guests on an RTK103 radio show hosted by academic Andrew Azzopardi.
 In a 10-minute appearance on the show, Agius – who is pleading not guilty to criminal charges – described himself as a “runner” in the fraud.
 He said he continued to relay applications to a top official in Michael Falzon’s Social Policy ministry, Mark Calleja il-Gulija, as recently as March 2023.
 By then, police had been investigating the fraud for well over a year.
 The racket saw beneficiaries being falsely diagnosed as severely disabled and given various falsified documents to present to a medical board, which classified them as eligible for monthly benefit payments.
  Silvio Grixti, a family doctor and former Labour MP, is alleged to have played a major role in the scam. He is being charged alongside Agius and others.
 Agius says the racket reached across government, with various ministries referring people to Grixti.
 “Ministries would send people to him at all hours of the day, threatening him with business cards,” he said, saying Grixti ended up as the racket’s “whore”.
 The real mastermind behind the racket has not yet been revealed, Agius said, adding that police seemed to not be interested in getting that information. Police, he said, had been instructed to only investigate people ""from the doctor [Grixti] down.""
 Falzon’s person of trust Calleja played a major role, he said.
 “They would tell me what to do, what to sort out, and say they would take care of everything. They did it for votes, and for money,” he said.
 When asked who made money off the deal, Agius said that it was people who organised the medical assessment boards. When pressed for names, he mentioned Calleja.
 “They’d say ‘let’s not set the board meeting for today, because our doctors aren’t there today,” he claimed.
 Minister Michael Falzon has denied any knowledge of the deal but stopped short of distancing himself from Calleja, his direct employee. 
 Agius has said that he sought – but was denied – whistleblower status in exchange for providing information.
 On Saturday, he said he applied for that status when he realised that information he provided police during interrogations was being leaked to the government.
 
 “They told the prime minister what I said at the FCID [Financial Crimes Investigation Department],” he said. “I have proof of that and will show it in court.”
 He also offered another anecdote to illustrate his suspicions of police leaking information.
 “In my second or third statement to the police, I mentioned a cabinet member. The next day, that member of cabinet knew that I name-dropped them,” Agius said.

Four takeaways from Malta’s local council elections,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/four-takeaways-malta-2024-local-council-elections.1093991,15-06-2024,"001596.png,001597.png,001598.png","Election season is officially over, with the counts for last weekend’s local council elections coming to a close on Friday night.
 Both parties are publicly negotiating the tricky task of either making a victory feel less like a defeat or disguising a defeat as a victory, but privately they will no doubt spend the next weeks gleaning whatever lessons they can from the election results.
 To help them along, here are four key takeaways that emerge in the immediate aftermath of the count.
 Labour’s losses continued into the local council election, but perhaps not to the extent that Labour insiders expected, with some bracing themselves for the party’s first local council defeat in two decades.
 Party supporters will be inclined to look on the bright side – Labour ultimately won the local council elections fairly comfortably, with over 52% of the total vote, holding on to an absolute majority of voters, unlike in the EP elections, where only 45% of voters supported the party.
 
 It also took home 252 seats, over 40 more than PN, and retained control of 39 local councils, well over half of Malta’s 68 localities.
 And, after all, any party would have been hard-pressed to repeat the triumph of 2019, making a decline in votes inevitable.
 But the party would do well to look at what went wrong and address the several red flags on the horizon.
 Labour’s 52% share may be a majority, but it’s also a sharp drop of almost six percentage points since 2019. The party won almost 16,000 fewer votes than it did five years ago. And what was once an 18 percentage point gap between the two main parties is now down in single digits, at just under 8%.
 Even more damningly, Labour lost votes in almost every single town in Malta and Gozo, losing virtually every locality that had been balanced on a knife’s edge. It lost its majority in Mellieħa, lost Msida, San Ġwann and Siġġiewi, three of the towns it had nabbed in 2019, and lost the key battleground of Mosta.
 Even in the localities it won, its majorities have been slashed, and in some it now leads by the most threadbare of margins. Pembroke, for instance, remained Labour-led by just seven votes.
 In total, the party lost 15 seats across the islands, shrinking its previous 79-seat majority almost by half.
 
 
 
 Just as worrying for Labour is that the party lost almost as much in its heartlands as it did in battleground towns. It dropped 14 percentage points in Marsascala and Santa Luċija, six in Żurrieq, and seven in Qrendi, amongst others.
 In Qala, the party lost a massive 18 percentage points, despite Abela having made its former mayor Clint Camilleri Gozo Minister.
 Although Labour strategists may have been expecting some middle-of-the-road voters to move away from the party after a decade, they will be asking themselves why their core voters are also beginning to look elsewhere.
 There’s no two ways about it, Labour won both the MEP and local council elections. But you’d be hard-pressed to find a more pyrrhic victory in Malta’s recent electoral history.
 The scenes of PN delegates’ celebrations at the Naxxar counting hall was all the evidence you need that the results are better than anything the party could have hoped for a fortnight ago.
 The party ate heavily into Labour’s lead across the islands and will enter the next legislature wielding far more authority over Malta and Gozo’s local councils than it previously did.
 It scored important victories in several key towns, including Mosta, St Paul’s Bay, San Ġwann and Msida, some with impressive swings, to bring its overall tally up to 24 councils.
  Just as importantly, PN won 20 more seats than it did in 2019, narrowing the gap in seats between the parties from almost 80 to a more respectable 44.
 It also held on to its councils, with the sole exception of Għasri, which slipped out of its fingers to come under Labour’s control.
 The big picture also looks rosier for PN than it might have expected. The party more than halved Labour’s lead, slashing it down from being over 47,000 votes ahead in 2019 to just over 20,000 now, gaining a healthy four percentage points in its share of the total vote.
 
 PN  registered gains in the vast majority of towns, with only a handful of relatively painless mishaps (a 14 percentage point drop in Kerċem, smaller drops in Balzan and Gżira).
 But while it's good news, the turnaround is in line with what the party was projecting - it hit its target of overturning five majorities by flipping Msida, San Ġwann, Mosta, St Paul's Bay and Siġġiewi -and was not the huge swing it celebrated during the MEP race.
 Apart from swinging five localities, it also helped to cancel out Labour’s majority in another five towns that will have hung councils.
 
 PN will also be puzzled by its performance in Valletta. The widely reported woes brought about by the city’s gentrification did little to deter residents from reinstating a Labour council, with independent candidates eating into PN’s share of the vote, dropping it by over 7%.
 Ultimately, PN still has a long way to go to bridge what substantially remains a chasm between the two parties.
 Given that the party found itself within the touching distance of just 8,500 votes in the EP elections, much to its own surprise, party insiders may secretly be feeling slightly disappointed that the gap in local council votes is still above the 20,000 mark.
 But what matters to PN, more than whether it won seats in one council or another, is that this week’s results mean that the party can approach the next elections believing that it stands a fighting chance, for the first time in years.
 For a party that spent much of the past decade in the wilderness, that alone feels like a significant victory.
 A glance at Malta’s new electoral map quickly reveals a novelty – while 2019’s election saw just two hung councils, both in Gozo, this time around, independent or small-party candidates will be tipping the balance of power in some major Maltese towns.
 Birkirkara, one of the most highly populated towns in the country, will see independent candidate Kaylocke Buhagiar as kingmaker, sitting squarely between PL and PN’s six seats apiece. A former PL councillor, Buhagiar had little difficulty getting elected, winning a seat on the first count.
 Mellieħa’s Matthew Borg Cuschieri will be in a similar position, taking one of the council’s nine seats, while the two major parties split the remaining four.
 Another independent candidate in Floriana, Nigel Holland, came just a single vote short of being elected on the first count, easily winning a seat once inherited votes were counted. A former independent mayor of the town, Holland will be joined on the council by two PN and Pl councillors apiece, one of whom is former national team goalkeeper Justin Haber.
  In Għarb it won’t be an independent candidate spoiling the major parties’ fun, but resident group Għarb l-Ewwel, who elected two of its candidates, David Apap and Lisa Marie Brooke, to join PL’s two councillors and PN’s sole elected representative.
 And in Żebbuġ it will be a family affair, with Steve Zammit Lupi and his mother Elizabeth both winning seats, to join PL’s four councillors and PN’s three. Already a popular councillor throughout the last legislature, Steve Zammit Lupi breezed his way to election, winning three times as many first-count votes as the nearest contender.
  More broadly, the positive signs for independent and third-party candidates in the European elections continued into the local elections.
 Candidates from small parties and those standing as independents upped their vote tally by some 3,600 votes, reaching just over the 9.300 mark. Just as significantly, they almost tripled their number of seats, going from four in 2019 to 11. And whereas they usually hover between the 1% and 2% mark, this election saw them bump their share of the vote up to 3.6%.
 
 No doubt, some of this is down to independent candidates like the aforementioned Kaylocke Buhagiar and former Gżira mayor (and MEP candidate) Conrad Borg Manché, both of whom defected from PL to stand as independents.
 But their performance, and that of many others (including ADPD leader Sandra Gauci who won a seat in St Paul’s Bay, Malta’s largest council, and ADPD secretary general Ralph Cassar, elected in Attard) will be heartening for individuals keen on standing on their own steam come next election.
 The race to the top between the two parties overshadowed the small fact that voter turnout dipped under 60% for the first time in Malta’s recent electoral history, settling at 59.6%, or 272,000 votes.
 Roughly the same number of people voted in 2019’s local council elections but, given Malta’s population growth over the past five years, the turnout back then was slightly higher, at 62.6%.
 While turnout in local elections is typically lower than in either general or European elections, 2019 was the first time that local council elections were held simultaneously nationwide, making it difficult to compare turnout across prior elections.
 What’s certain is that the last time voter turnout was this low in an election held nationwide, Malta was a very different place.
 Emerging from the ashes of World War II, 25,000 people, or 42% of registered voters, turned up to vote in Malta’s 1945 general elections, electing Pawlu Boffa’s Labour Party – the only party on the ballot sheet - to nine of parliament’s 10 seats. The tenth seat went to an independent candidate, Henry Jones.
 
 What last weekend's poor turnout means over the longer term remains to be seen. But with outgoing mayors and councillors complaining that councils have been stripped of their powers and reduced to the role of a village policemen, government would do well to consider whether it’s time to devolve more powers to local councils and reimagine their functions, in a bid to reignite the public’s enthusiasm for local politics.
 Still, Maltese continue to be far more keen to cast their vote than the average European. EU-wide turnout in this year's MEP elections averaged just 51% - a figure that was celebrated in Europe but which would be considered abysmal within a local context.

Inquiry into man's death at A&E waiting room after complaining of chest pains,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/delia-azzopardi-claim-man-dies-ae-waiting-area-reporting-chest-pain.1097355,30-08-2024,001614.png,"Updated 7.30pm with ambulance information
 An independent inquiry will investigate the circumstances of the death of a 55-year-old man at Mater Dei Hospital's emergency waiting room where he was left waiting despite allegedly complaining of chest pain. 
 Stephen Mangion, a retired police officer, died at around 11pm on Tuesday.
 In a Facebook post, his niece Claire Mangion wrote: ""Reality hits home... my dearest uncle Stephen Mangion was asked to wait and wait even though he had chest pain until he collapsed and died at the emergency of Mater Dei. A failed system that needs to change."" 
 According to lawyer and former MP Jason Azzopardi, the man was asked to go to Mater Dei's emergency unit with his private car after seeking assistance at the Floriana health centre.
 Social media users who said they witnessed the death said the man complained of intense chest pain but was asked to wait and collapsed and died before he was seen to.
 Azzopardi claimed the man's death was manslaughter. 
  However Mangion's former wife Miriam Attard, who was at the hospital when the incident happened, appealed on behalf of the family for the public to ""refrain from using this situation for political advantage or making any related comments"".
 According to police sources, a preliminary investigation into the incident at Mater Dei shows Mangion went ""voluntarily"" to the hospital at 8.30pm because he was not feeling well.  
 At 10.30pm he complained with reception of a sharp chest pain. CPR was performed and Mangion died at 11pm.
 He suffered from high blood pressure and was accompanied by his former wife and two children at the hospital.
 The police investigation has been widened to look into what happened at the Floriana health centre. 
 Health sources told Times of Malta that he had previously been accompanied by family members at the Floriana Health Centre. 
 An ambulance was sought to transfer him to Mater Dei Hospital but none could be immediately dispatched.
 He was accompanied by family members to hospital instead.  
 A magisterial inquiry by magistrate Joe Mifsud is underway and Forensic Doctor Edward Cherubino is assisting. 
  On Thursday morning health minister Jo Etienne Abela said an independent inquiry had been launched and its findings will be published.
 ""As a ministry, we want transparency and while we praise what is good, we also want to treat shortcomings with justice,"" he said. 
 The inquiry will look into the way Mangion was treated but also at general shortcomings, he said.
 ""As has happened before, we will be fully transparent - so if there were shortcomings, be they individual or systematic, we will not hide those. And if there are shortcomings, responsibility must be carried,"" he said.
 The inquiry was launched on Wednesday and the conclusions will be drawn by the end of September. 
 The board leading the inquiry will be led by retired Judge Joseph D Camilleri and includes Herbert Felice and Sylvia Spiteri.
 The health minister said the government is working to address staff shortages in the emergency department.
 ""It's no secret that the health system is understaffed in several specialised fields. We know that and we need to address it,"" he said.
 The measures include incentivising staff to work in emergency.
 ""That includes money, and in the last two months, emergency staff have seen a pay increase, and our plan is to keep increasing those wages,"" Abela said.
 The health minister was also asked about an urgent call to the private sector to outsource emergency care but said he is not involved in the tendering procedure. 
 ""There is an ongoing evaluation process that I cannot comment on,"" he said. 
 Abela said he is waiting for the results of the evaluation, which is a four-week process.
 ""I wish the service was available many months ago,"" he said.
  Speaking during a news conference on Thursday morning, Opposition health spokesperson Adrian Delia said Mangion’s death – in a place where he had gone to seek help - was “heartbreaking” and “enraging”.
 “Do we have to have deaths to take action in this country?... Even in the health system, government had to wait for a tragedy to happen to do something - as has happened in the construction industry and in the domestic violence field,” he said.
 He was referring to the death of Jean Paul Sofia in December 2022 in a construction accident and the femicides of Bernice Cassar in November 2021 and Nicolette Ghirxi earlier this month.
 In all three cases, the tragedies led to inquiries to improve flawed systems.
 Delia said the minister had announced an independent inquiry into Mangion’s death, but what guarantee did the minister give the public that the situation would not remain the same or get worse until then?
 “The family is broken. They are hurt. They lost their loved one… The public deserves to know what happened and who is responsible… This has long been coming,” he said as he went on to read several newspaper headlines that highlighted the strain on the hospital emergency system.
 Delia said government was not investing in the health sector that was under strain due to the increasing population.
 When a person goes to the Emergency Department they are asked to wait in a waiting area until a triage nurse calls them in.
  “In most cases, chest pain cases would be assigned as a high priority. Only a few chest pain cases would be assigned low priority. These would be clear muscular pain, rather than something cardiac,” according to sources close to the emergency department.
 If a chest pain patient is assigned high priority, the patient is escorted to an ECG room in the main area.
 The ECG result is shown immediately to the doctor in charge of leading the emergency department who will, in turn, decide if something needs to be done immediately or not.
 “Having said that, an ECG alone sometimes is not enough and you would still need blood tests to be taken to identify whether the chest pain is actually coming from a cardiac cause,” the person said.

Josianne Cutajar against PL plan to open up deputy leader party affairs for MPs,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/josianne-cutajar-pl-plan-open-deputy-leader-party-affairs-mps.1096413,08-07-2024,"001627.png,001628.png,001629.png","Labour's former MEP Josianne Cutajar has come out against proposed changes to the party's statute allowing sitting MPs or MEPs to occupy the role of deputy leader for party affairs.
 She told Times of Malta: “I do not agree with changing the statute in such a way that the person occupying this position can come from the Parliamentary Group or contest the next general election.”
 The Gozitan politician is considering whether to run for the post.
 She said she believes the deputy leader for party affairs should devote their undivided attention to the party “without perceived favouritism related to [matters concerning their] current or prospective districts.”
 She told Times of Malta her position has been consistent all along.  
 “I have always made it clear in meetings and internal communication before I was even asked and encouraged to contest.”
 An amendment allowing sitting MPs to contest the post, vacated last June by Daniel Micallef, is set to be discussed by the party’s General Conference this Friday.  
 Cutajar says she will respect any decision that the Conference will take, “but I will definitely take the outcome into consideration in my final decision on whether to contest or not.”
 The decision to hold an extraordinary session was formally announced on Wednesday morning following a meeting of the National Executive on Tuesday.
 It followed Jason Micallef dropping out of the race only days after confirming his intention to contest.  
 Micallef, the last Labour General Secretary before the post was abolished in 2010, changed his decision after meeting prime minister Robert Abela and MEP Alex Agius Saliba.
 He told Times of Malta he would not commit himself at this stage.
  “This discussion is premature.  At this stage the party’s statute does not allow me to contest because the current rules are what they are. I will always respect the decision of party delegates,"" Agius Saliba said.
 Meanwhile, Claudette Abela Baldacchino has also confirmed she is no longer interested in running for the post of deputy leader.
  Speaking to Times of Malta she said “I will remain active and I am ready to serve the party wherever needed, however not in the role of deputy leader.”
 She denied that the proposed changes to the party statute had anything to do with her decision.
 “I am not surprised that the party is considering changing the statute.  Any party evolves according to the times and the needs.  I have no doubt that the way things are evolving is in the interest of the party and the country.”
 Asked whether members of parliament would be able to juggle between constituency and party affairs, Abela Baldacchino said “we have had deputy leaders who were also MPs before, and they performed very well.”
 Konrad Mizzi occupied the post for a few weeks in 2016 and he was replaced by Chris Cardona who served until 2020.  Both were serving ministers but were allowed to stand following a similar amendment to the one being proposed now.  
 The statute was later changed to the previous version allowing MPs only the chance to contest for deputy leader parliamentary affairs.
 The elections for deputy leaders and other appointments in the Labour administration will take place between 13th and 15th September.
 Nominations for all positions will open on Friday, 23rd August and remain open until 25th August.

Ex Labour MEPs and CEO mull PL deputy leader run,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/ex-labour-meps-ceo-mull-pl-deputy-leader-run.1096289,08-04-2024,001645.png,"Josianne Cutajar, Gino Cauchi and Claudette Abela Baldacchino are considering contesting the post of Labour deputy leader for party affairs.
 The three could join the race with Jason Micallef to replace Daniel Micallef. who resigned shortly after the June European elections, although the focus is mainly on the former general secretary.
 “I believe the role requires a lot of listening and understanding, as well as vision, and I believe that, with my qualities and humble experience, I can significantly contribute to the party’s success and continuous relevance,” Cutajar said.
 The former MEP confirmed she had been approached by several people, both party delegates and others, who have encouraged her to contest.
 She said she believes this is not only about who gets to occupy the post of deputy leader but about the work that one can put into it and the results that one can achieve.
 
 “At the moment, the party needs a deputy leader who can devote their undivided attention without the added responsibility of managing their own constituency or district.”
 Regardless of her decision to run, Cutajar said she remains committed to supporting the party and ensuring that Labour continues to become stronger and adapt according to its values and ideals, well taking into account the current challenges and opportunities.
  Cutajar, who hails from Gozo, has been involved in the Labour Party from a young age and was a member of the local party committee and local council in her village. She also served as president of the Regional Committee for Gozo and was an executive member of Nisa Laburisti (Labour Women).
 Cutajar was elected to the European Parliament in 2019, serving a full five-year term until she decided not to run again.
 Former party CEO Gino Cauchi said he too has been approached by delegates and others to run for the post. However, he has not made a decision yet, adding: “I am still listening.”
 Cauchi was elected MP in 2008 after Karl Chircop passed away. A former journalist and broadcaster at TVM, he joined One Productions, Labour’s media arm, as head of news in 2000, taking over sales and marketing responsibilities five years later.
 He previously served as a member of Labour’s youth section in Santa Luċija and, in the late 1990s, was mayor of Pembroke.
 Abela Baldacchino has voiced her belief that the next deputy leader for party affairs should be a woman. 
 She stopped short of confirming her candidacy while insisting she has years of experience in the party’s structures.
 “At this stage, I will do what is in the best interest of the party.”
 Abela Baldacchino has been active in the Labour Party ranks since the 1980s.
 She occupied roles at committee level in Qrendi, was elected to her hometown’s local council and served as international secretary and president of Nisa Laburisti.
 She also served on the EU’s Committee of the Regions and was vice president of the Association of Local Councillors.

 Speaking at a political event in Gozo, the Opposition leader said he had ""taken note"" of the survey. 
 According to the MaltaToday survey, the PN now enjoys a 4.4 percentage point lead over Labour, after the PL's majority was slashed to  8,500 votes in the June European Parliament elections. 
 The survey puts support for the PN at 48.2% and the PL at 43.8% with ADPD securing 4.5% and other parties or independents 3.5%.
 Prime Minister Robert Abela however enjoys a trust rating of 42.6% compared to Grech's 26.6%. 
 Grech said on Sunday that the PN can help create a new future for Malta and Gozo. 
 He said a PN government will ensure economic growth that benefits everyone. 
 Grech said development should take place within a context of clear rules, rather than the ""intentionally equivocal"" ones that exist today. 
 ""We will create a level playingfield with rules that empower you to invest. We want to drive the economy forward to everyone's benefit and no one's detriment."" 
 Addressing his Gozitan audience, Grech backed calls for decision-making power to be given to a Gozo regional council. 
 ""We believe in Gozo, we believe Gozo should be its own region. Gozitans know what is best for Gozo,"" Grech said. 
 He hit out at certain government decisions, such as a termination of the cargo loading service between Valletta and Gozo. 
 ""All that heavy vehicle traffic now goes all the way to Cirkewwa,"" Grech said. 
 The Opposition leader said he wanted to see a change in the mindset that Gozo was reliant on wealth spilling over from Malta. 
 Grech said the PN believed wealth could be generated in Gozo and spill over to Malta.

ADPD pushes for Byron Camilleri to resign over ID cards scandal,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/adpd-pushes-byron-camilleri-resign-id-cards-scandal.1098101,14-09-2024,001684.png,"Updated 7.45 pm with Identitá reply
 The Green Party has rekindled concerns about a widespread identity card scam and joined calls for Home Affairs Minister Byron Camilleri to resign.
 In a press conference, ADPD leader Sandra Gauci and secretary general Ralph Cassar both criticised Camilleri’s handling of the issue and said it appeared he had not comprehended the gravity of the alleged scandal.
 “Byron Camilleri needs to be removed immediately. We know his true worth now,” Gauci said.
 ADPD’s calls come on the back of claims that as many as 18,000 identity cards were falsified with the help of officials at state agency Identitá.
 The claims, first made by lawyer Jason Azzopardi, are now being probed by a magistrate. Identita and Camilleri, who is politically responsible for the agency, have claimed that the allegations  are overblown.
 They say that in many of the cases flagged, the issues stemmed from people providing third parties with false personal information when applying for goods or services, not falsified ID cards. 
 ADPD speakers said on Saturday that the allegations were especially concerning because Malta was within the EU’s Schengen Zone and its ID cards therefore allowed free movement across Schengen countries.
 “It is highly unlikely that such a large volume of documents containing false information could have been produced without a well-planned, orchestrated effort involving multiple individuals and substantial amounts of money, as has been claimed on several occasions,” ADPD secretary general Cassar said.
  “Additionally, it is probable that the people involved believed that they could get away with it despite the high level of risk involved,” he added.
 Party leader Gauci said those responsible had to be made to pay and not let off with a “slap on the wrist”.
 “Nothing and nobody are protected anymore except those who steal and embezzle. The citizen is bereft of any form of protection from any possible angle because the institutions that were supposed to look out for the interests of the citizen have now taken advantage of the situation and stripped citizens of everything, including their identity,” she said.
 “Everyone who is involved needs to pay dearly and justice needs to be harsh with them. We can no longer brush off the responsibilities of those who weave this deceptive net for gain from the backs of people who are probably desperate and believe that this is the way things are done, when in fact this was another institutionalized yet illegal way to make money from foreigners who thought they would find a better life in our country.”
 Identità said ADPD’s claim regarding 18,000 people being given identity cards with false information is untrue and that the authority has already denied and explained this, saying “the investigation has to do with residency permits and not identity cards as ADPD had said earlier today.”
 The authority's compliance team has internal verification systems in place which it applies consistently and continues to strengthen and complement its processes with a number of measures.
 In fact,  a case related to residency permit, which is different to an identity card was forwarded to the police following an internal investigation with all the necessary evidence against a number of individuals for the police to take the necessary action afforded by the law.

 On Sunday, MEP Josianne Cutajar said she will not be contesting the role, and  Jason Micallef dropped out of the race earlier this month. 
 For the position of Labour Party President, the party received two nominations -  lawyer Alex Sciberras and former TVM head of news  Norma Saliba. 
 One of them will be replacing Ramona Attard, who last week said she will not be standing for re-election as PL president. She was elected party president just over four years ago in July 2020. 
 One of the lawyers on Joseph Muscat’s Vitals case, Ishmael Psaila, will not be contesting either, despite confirming he was considering seeking election earlier this month. 
 Louis Gatt submitted his nomination for the Vice President position. 
 For the post of International Secretary, nominations were submitted by John Grech and Georvin Bugeja. Bugeja perviously served as the president of the party’s youth group and now holds a position in the public service as the Head of Secretariat for the Parliamentary Secretariat for Equality and Reforms.
 Architect William Lewis submitted his nomination for the post of Organisational Secretary.
 The Commission also welcomed the nominations for 12 ordinary members in the National Executive of the Labour Party, from thirty-eight members.
 Voting will take place on Friday, September 13, at the National Labour Centre in Malta and the Labour Centre in Sannat, Gozo, and the vote count will take place on the same day after the voting closes.

Civil society groups also call on Byron Camilleri to resign,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/civil-society-groups-call-byron-camilleri-resign.1096532,08-09-2024,001732.png,"Three civil society groups have called on Byron Camilleri to shoulder responsibility and resign amid serious allegations of an ID card racket. 
 Last week former PN MP and lawyer Jason Azzopardi filed a court application seeking an urgent magisterial inquiry into what he believes to be a large-scale identity fraud racket. 
 He has claimed that some 18,000 Maltese ID cards were issued on the back of documents falsified by Identita officials. 
 Separately, the lawyer has also brought to light cases of people who fear their property is being used to commit fraud, after receiving bills from telephone companies addressed to people that have never lived there. 
 In a statement on Friday, the NGOs Repubblika, aditus and the Daphne Caruana Galizia Foundation said that the severity of the accusations are a stark reminder of the ""pervasive corruption"" that plagues the public service. 
 The alleged activities constitute a severe breach of public trust with potentially devastating consequences for vulnerable individuals who may have fallen victim to exploitation,"" they said. 
 ""They also underscore the pressing need to protect victims of trafficking, often left voiceless and exposed when public institutions fail to ensure their well-being.""
 The three groups also expressed solidarity with public servants who work to uphold the values of integrity and transparency in the face of systemic corruption. 
 We also express our solidarity with all public servants working diligently and in good faith, striving to uphold the values of integrity and transparency in the face of systemic corruption. 
 ""In light of so many shocking revelations, anything shorter than the highest form of accountability is an affront to the entire nation,"" they continued.
 ""We therefore call for the immediate resignation of the Minister of Home Affairs, Security and Employment. We also expect to see full and effective investigations into all allegations, with all perpetrators brought to justice."" 
 On Thursday the PN also demanded Camilleri's resignation, saying that his prolonged silence in the face of a series of 'chaotic' scandals is a sure sign that it is time for him to step down.

Standards committee endorses damning Bartolo-Camilleri report,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/standards-committee-endorses-damning-bartolocamilleri-report.1101335,21-11-2024,001741.png,"Update 7pm with PN, PL reactions
 Parliament’s standards committee unanimously endorsed a damning report which concluded that Clayton Bartolo and Clint Camilleri abused their power when they gave Bartolo’s then-girlfriend a lucrative consultancy job.
 In its next sitting - set for  November 27 - the committee will discuss and decide on a sanction for the two cabinet ministers. Until then, tourism minister Bartolo and Gozo minister Camilleri can write to the committee to explain their position.
 According to the Standards Law, the sanction can take the shape of one of three things: demanding an apology from the ministers, asking the House of Representatives to take measures “it deems fit” or “demand repayment for sources improperly used”.  
 During Thursday's meeting, Speaker Anglu Farrugia suggested that the committee considers recouping the funds handed to Muscat for the work she did not carry out.
 According to the report by the Standards Commissioner, Bartolo’s then-girlfriend and private secretary Amanda Muscat was first promoted to the tourism minister’s consultant with a salary of almost €62,000 in 2020. She was then promoted again as a consultant to the Gozo minister with an even higher salary of €68,000.
 In practice, Muscat continued to work as Bartolo’s private secretary, but on a much higher, consultant’s pay, even when she was, on paper, employed by Camilleri. 
 Bartolo and Muscat have since tied the knot. 
 As calls for the ministers’ resignations grew, Robert Abela stood firm behind Bartolo and Camilleri - both of whom are considered loyal allies to the prime minister.
 In a recent interview, Abela said that the circumstances of this case differed fundamentally from those of Justyne Caruana, who resigned as minister in 2020 after revelations of an abusive contract awarded to her partner Daniel Bogdanovic.
 “The facts in this case are different.  The circumstances do not warrant Bartolo or Camilleri stepping down from their ministerial duties,” he said.
 Asked whether Muscat would be asked to reimburse the money, the prime minister would not say, insisting that the controversy revolves around a €16,000 discrepancy in her pay. 
 “In Muscat’s case, the discrepancy isn’t €68,000. It’s €16,000. Naturally, this will now progress to the parliamentary committee stage, where further discussion is needed,” he said. 
 A spokesperson for the prime minister later said the €16,000 figure referred to net gains and did not include taxes and social security contributions.
 The OPM spokesperson confirmed that the discrepancy in gross terms was €23,026.  
 The OPM clarification followed a Times of Malta fact check.
 Contacted following the vote, Bartolo told Times of Malta it was ""not prudent"" to comment at this time and that he will be making his submissions to the committee.
 ""I've already said what I had to say in public,"" he said, adding that he will respect whatever decision the committee took.
  Justice Minister Jonathan Attard, who is a member of the committee, told Times of Malta following the vote that he had no problem with the report being adopted. 
 He added that the standards commissioner had among others recommended changes to the manual on recruiting public officials and these should be implemented as soon as possible.
 Asked whether Bartolo and Camilleri should resign, now that the committee has adopted the report, Attard said the committee's procedures were ongoing.
 PN MPs Mark Anthony Sammut and Ryan Callus said they were endorsing the report in its entirety.
 Opposition Leader Bernard Grech meanwhile told Facebook followers that the committee's vote reflected the national sentiment that Bartolo and Camilleri could no longer retain their ministerial roles.
 ""Today, Abela remains isolated, on his own defending Bartolo and Camilleri.
 ""Following the committee's decision Abela should ensure they resign. He should otherwise fire them.
 ""However, Abela is compromised as he is not free to decide. Abela is a prime minister who is only interested in saving his own skin. Malta needs a prime minister and government that prioritises the national interest. Malta needs a change.""
  In a statement following the vote, the PN said the committee had found Bartolo and Camilleri ""guilty"".
 ""Now that the report has been adopted, and Bartolo and Camilleri have been found guilty of breaching the Code of Ethics for Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries, Abela has no option but to dismiss the two ministers if they do not resign voluntarily,"" the party reiterated.
 The PN said the prime minister and the two ministers have, for weeks, shirked responsibility, claiming they would wait for the committee's conclusions.
 ""In this case, for reasons unknown, Abela is applying a double standard. While he refuses to dismiss Bartolo and Camilleri, he immediately sacked former minister Justyne Caruana as soon as the report in her case was published, even before the committee convened to decide whether to adopt it,"" PN said.
 ""Aside from the fraud involving public funds in the phantom job of Bartolo's wife, the government has also been caught in a web of lies and inconsistencies in its attempt to defend its ministers. On two separate occasions, Abela claimed he was the one who dismissed Muscat, contradicting Camilleri, whose Head of Secretariat testified under oath that he terminated her contract because her work with the ministry was completed.""
 Reacting to PN's statement, the PL said no parliamentary committee had found any ministers guilty of any fraud, as the Opposition was ""falsely trying to imply with its usual fixation towards fake news"".
 The word “fraud”, just like the word “phantom job”, were only invented by Grech and could not be found in the report, the PL said.
 ""The PN believes it can use the standards commissioner as it wants and as it pleases, even by attributing to it declarations that were never said by the Chief Justice Emeritus.
 ""In light of this deception, Minister Jonathan Attard and Parliamentary Secretary Andy Ellul, as government members on the standards committee, have written a formal complaint to the Speaker of the House to investigate and order the appropriate provisions on the way the PN is trying to mislead.
 ""It is incredible how the PN pontificates on ethical values and comes out lying at the first opportunity,"" the party said.
 Instead of continuing to make up fake news, Grech should see which of his MPs are absent from work and paid from public funds, the PL warned.

Mark Camilleri in talks with government to return to National Book Council,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/mark-camilleri-discussions-government-return-national-book-council.1092268,05-10-2024,001742.png,"Former book council chair Mark Camilleri is in discussions with the government over his possible return to the council as a consultant, the author told Times of Malta on Friday.
 “There are problems in the council, and I will go and do the job that has been lacking for the past three years,” Camilleri said.
 “Nothing has yet been decided. I have not signed anything, and discussions are still ongoing.”
 His comments come after MaltaToday reported that Camilleri will return to the council as a consultant and will be paid a salary in the range of €30,000 a year. Sources told  MaltaToday he will be allowed to work remotely.
 Camilleri led the National Book Council for several years until his contract was not renewed by the Education Ministry in 2021, a year after he clashed with then-education minister Justyne Caruana.
 Since then, he has been highly critical of the council and his successor as chair, who is also called Mark Camilleri. 
 When asked on Friday to confirm whether he will be returning to the council, Camilleri Times of Malta he is in discussions with the Education Minister.
 ""Nothing is signed on paper and the [MaltaToday] report is just words,"" he said.
 ""If I get a contract related to my actual work and which can help me grow, why not?"" he added. 
 In a Facebook post, Camilleri slammed MaltaToday's report, questioning why the paper ignored his investigations on Prime Minster Robert Abela. He said  MaltaToday did not contact him for comments.
 ""Is it because they are fully funded by the government?"" he asked.
 ""MaltaToday as a Labour Party newspaper has done its best to consistently attack and smear me while ignoring my investigative stories.""
  Camilleri told Times of Malta that even if an agreement was reached, ""there will be no changes to what I do"", and he will continue with his investigative work. 
 Camilleri's troubles with the council began in 2020, when then-education minister Justyne Caruana pushed for him to resign following a public spat with one of the lawyers representing alleged Daphne Caruana Galizia murder conspirator Yorgen Fenech. 
 He was ousted a year later and then branched out on his own. He runs a personal blog as well as an independent publishing house, Dar Camilleri, which was launched in 2021.
 That same year he published A Rent Seeker’s Paradise alleging corruption and bad governance by the Labour government. 
 In the book, Camilleri claims that Rosianne Cutajar had an affair with Fenech to get a leg up in her political career and that she had received “corrupt money” from him. Cutajar is suing Camilleri overthe claims. 
 He subsequently published transcripts of more than 2,200 WhatsApp messages between Cutajar and Fenech claiming the two were intimate and on very close terms.

PN demands immediate action on Stephen Mangion inquiry findings,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/pn-demands-immediate-action-stephen-mangion-inquiry-findings.1099172,10-08-2024,001756.png,"Updated at 6.45pm with PL statement
 The Nationalist Party on Tuesday criticised the government for seemingly downplaying the severity of the healthcare system's problems in light of the recent death of Stephen Mangion at the emergency department.
 Mangion, a 55-year-old resident of Valletta and a former police officer died from an aortic dissection after collapsing in the hospital's emergency waiting room on August 27.
 His death caused a public outcry on Facebook with claims that he had waited for hours despite reporting chest pains, first at the Floriana health centre and later at Mater Dei.
 A separate magisterial inquiry, headed by Magistrate Joe Mifsud and revealed by Times of Malta on September 10, had concluded that doctors and nurses who treated Mangion did nothing wrong and should not face criminal prosecution for his death.
 Yet, in a press conference, shadow minister Adrian Delia said Health Minister JoEtienne Abela is almost brushing off the shortcomings revealed by the ministerial inquiry last week.
 ""Although nobody was found to be negligent or responsible in Mangion's case, the inquiry nonetheless highlights several shortcomings in our system, which could have grave consequences in future cases,"" he said.
 ""Is the government acknowledging the seriousness of the situation? Are we offering timelines as to when the recommendations will be implemented? The government must answer to this.""
  The inquiry, headed by retired judge J.D. Camilleri, was concluded and published last week and found no single person was responsible for the death of the retired policeman.
 But it did find that the Floriana health centre, where Mangion went before being taken to Mater Dei, was only manned by doctors in training at the time.
 And although triage and an ECG test were performed promptly when Mangion arrived at Mater Dei Hospital's Casualty Department, there was a shortage of cubicles and he was made to wait for two hours in the clinical area, where he collapsed and died.
 On Tuesday Delia highlighted a few of the recommendations.
 A key concern is the reliance on paper-based systems, which can lead to delays and inefficiencies. While a pilot project for electronic records was reportedly conducted at the oncology department, its implementation remains uncertain, he said.
 Another issue is the accessibility of essential medical equipment. ECG machines, for example, are available at health centers but often locked and inaccessible, he added. This can delay diagnoses and treatments.
 The inquiry also pointed out that patients often wait too long to be examined by a senior decision-maker, he added. And staffing shortages and a lack of ambulances are further exacerbating the situation.
 Health Minister JoEtienne Abela previously told the press he wants to turn the triaging system on its head so that patients are immediately seen by a decision-maker at the emergency department, but he had indicated the doctors' union was blocking those plans.
 In a statement, the Labour Party said healthcare workers remain victims of the PN’s “fake news”, and who fail to apologise to them.
 “One would have expected at least an apology would have been made from the Opposition, but that is too difficult for them,” the statement read.
 “The Nationalist Party is quick to spread lies but arrogant to apologise when it has spoken falsely.”
 The statement said while the inquiry shows that no individual was responsible for the tragic death, the Opposition continues to persistently use it for partisan purposes.

"Watch: Foreigners in saturated industries must leave the country, PM says",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/watch-foreigners-saturated-industries-leave-country-pm-says.1096097,31-07-2024,001763.png,"Foreign workers who come to Malta for work but whose labour is no longer necessary must leave the country, Robert Abela said on Tuesday. 
 The prime minister was speaking to journalists outside Castille on Tuesday evening when he was asked what would happen to the victims of a restaurant owner who was jailed for two years after admitting to human trafficking. 
 “In our country, only those who are invited legitimately are welcome, foreign workers who are coming from third countries, so third-country nationals, and come to the country to work need the legitimate approval of Jobsplus and approval of Identita,” Abela said. 
 ""If there are situations where that process was not followed, the consequence is that. I understand their situation but I also have a duty to the national interest and if our job market is indicating saturation, it means that workers who aren’t legitimate must leave the country.""
  The government has been reviewing its plans for the employment of third-country nationals (TCNs) in Malta after  Times of Malta reported that hundreds of TCNS were having their  work permit application refused. 
 A court last week heard how a company director would bring foreign workers to Malta after falsely claiming they were needed at his restaurant. 
 The director was sentenced to two years imprisonment after admitting to human trafficking. 
 When asked if such workers will be sent back to their country and not treated as victims of human trafficking, Abela said he sympathised with the situation, but the final decision will be that workers who did not come to the country legitimately will be made to leave the country. 
 Abela previously said that the decision will not affect workers who are already legally employed. 
 “We are not saying we will kill the sector of food couriers or that y-plates will be eliminated, as these are services that our country needs,” he said. 
 ""But what we are saying is that having excessive workers in those two sectors will create a situation where the oversupply is detrimental to the country’s infrastructure.""
 In a statment on Wednesday the Malta Chamber called on the government to make a clear distinction between ethical and unethical businesses and enforce laws that ensure transparency when it comes to employing third-country nationals in Malta. 
 The chamber said third country nationals said should only be employed when there is a “demostrable need” in the labour market.
 “Many key sectors in Malta, including healthcare, elderly care, tourism, manufacturing, tech and financial services rely heavily on migrant workers due to a significant shortage in the local workforce,"" it said.
 ""This reliance underscores the importance of a strategic workforce plan that addresses these shortages, ensuring a balance between human resource needs and the country's capacity to accommodate them sustainably"".
 The Chamber also condemned unethical practices seen in certain businesses which exploit non-EU workers.
 “The Malta Chamber calls for a clear distinction to be made between ethical businesses which comply with employment laws and standards, and those that exploit legal loopholes to the detriment of workers and fair competition,” they said.
 “We urge continued vigilance and robust action to ensure that all businesses operate on a level playing field, respecting both legal standards and the rights of workers.”
 They urged the government to enhance transparency by releasing the data from the recent skills survey and called for stronger enforcement of labour laws and increased dialogue with stakeholders.
 “This collaborative approach is essential to create a sustainable and equitable environment for all sectors of the economy,"" the chamber said.

Watch: ‘I’ve never tried to be popular’ - Clyde Caruana,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/watch-i-ve-never-tried-popular-clyde-caruana.1094674,30-06-2024,001768.png,"Finance Minister Clyde Caruana says changes are needed if the country is to thrive. Interview by  Bertrand Borg.
  BB: We’re speaking just a few weeks after the MEP and local council elections, which Labour won but which left it shaking. The party lost more than 30,000 votes. What went wrong?
 CC: Election results do not change overnight. There has to be a momentum that leads to something, and I think there were certain indicators indicating that the public mood was perhaps changing.
 BB: Are you saying that you were not surprised by the 8,000-vote margin?
 CC: I was expecting a result with a margin between 18,000 to 20,000 votes, based on a number of things: turnout for public activities and the surveys themselves.
 BB: So 8,000 would still be considered a poor result compared to what you were expecting. How do you explain this sudden haemorrhaging of support?
 CC: The thing that surprised me most was that I was thinking that turnout would be lower. Rather than staying home, people went out. They voted and expressed their opinion in a very clear way. I think that in itself is a message that speaks volumes.
 BB: Polls, including ours, were off the target.
 CC: My take is that there is what I refer to as the Trump effect. When Trump was running for his first election against Hillary Clinton, pollsters underestimated his support. And to be quite frank with you, I experienced something similar to this when there was the leadership race in 2019, 2020.
 BB: You mean the Labour leadership race.
 CC: Chris Fearne’s campaign was more robust, he had more endorsements, there was a feeling he was going to win. So people were shy to express their intention to vote for Robert Abela. There was sort of this fear. And I think that kind of element was also present this time round. It’s not that easy for someone to say that ‘I’m not going to vote Labour’, given that this government won by a 40,000 majority. This has to be taken seriously, because this element may also be present in the future.
 BB: Are people frustrated with strains on the infrastructure and our rising population?
 CC: Definitely, definitely. Once the result was out I reflected a little bit. The Mintoff Labour government of the 1970s brought about significant changes to the economy and the setup of the welfare state. And yet the 1981 election was lost in terms of the popular vote. The Fenech Adami government between 1987 and 1996 brought about a significant overhaul in terms of economic change. But nevertheless, people wanted to move from that kind of model to something new. People always vote for something better, for something that improves their standard of living. People’s behaviour is linked to the economic cycle, but also to the nature of the economy. People are often after something better, and perhaps something that improves their quality of life. They’re not just after money. Given that they are now more affluent, people are after a better quality of life.
  BB: You used two examples, that of the Mintoff government and Fenech Adami government. In both cases, the incumbent government lost and the Opposition came to power. So if history is doomed to repeat itself, that doesn’t bode well for Labour.
 CC: I’m going to be very, very clear about this. I think that the people spoke out in a very strong way. They expect a change in the way things are done. The Labour government is still in time to deliver that change. But people have made their voice very clear. Either government delivers the change ‒ and I still think that Labour can bring back those thousands of votes – but on the other hand, that has to be real change.
 BB: So you think there is a chance Labour might lose the next election.
 CC: As always. People vote or confirm a government on the basis of the government’s deliverables. So as always, every election is the government’s to lose.
  BB: You’ve warned that our population will balloon to 800,000 by 2040 if we continue growing at our four per cent growth rate.
 CC: Yes.
 BB: That in itself is a sort of tacit admission that our GDP growth relies on the population growing.
 CC: It’s not that the population is leading to economic growth. What’s happening is that the type of investment we have – and that we are attracting – is very labour-intensive. We have to change that. It’s easier said than done, because at the end of the day we have to go for something that is more capital-intensive, something that produces more value-added.
 But we have to start, because otherwise if we keep repeating the same thing we will keep on attracting thousands of workers to the islands, and that is having its effects on the infrastructure. I said that we will be 800,000 people by 2040. If the current trends continue, we will already be at 600,000 by the end of this legislature [in 2027].
  BB: You were probably the first frontline politician to talk about shifting our economic model. That was in 2021, we’re now in 2024. And it’s hard to see any changes happening, apart from lip service, strategies and committees.
 CC: Let’s be very clear. This is not easy to do. It involves long discussions. All the social partners have to be on board, for the simple reason that changes will have implications on their members.
 BB: You seem to be implying that social partners have been the stumbling block.
 CC: No, I’m not saying they are a stumbling block, but as they say in Italian ‘ tra il dire e il fare c’è in mezzo il mare’ [easier said than done]. If we’re going to change the superstructure of the economy, the way how our economy works, that is going to have a direct impact on the employers themselves. There are parts of industries that are perhaps not efficient and need to restructure.
 BB: Can you give any examples?
 CC: No, no, this applies in general. The essence is that we have to start doing more with less. Let me give you an example with the financial industry. For years, we were accustomed to attracting business that looked at Malta only from a tax point of view. Now that is over. We have to look at things which give us more value added, such as, for example, aircraft leasing, or family business. You need less people but the amount of work that they do generates more value-added.
 BB: Construction still looms large.
 CC: Yes.
 BB: The fact that it pervades so many facets of our decision-making suggests a level of undue influence within politics.
 CC: Yes. I reiterate what I’ve said in the past. Voters think it is time there is clear separation between the construction industry and political parties. At the end of the day, the construction industry is just another economic sector that shouldn’t be treated differently from manufacturing, the professional sector, finance.
 BB: And you believe it is [being treated differently].
 CC: That is why I am saying it should change.
  BB: Do you raise this within cabinet and government?
 CC: I always speak my mind.
 BB: What’s the general perspective?
 CC: I say what I have to say, then of course, it’s up to the rest to accept what I say or otherwise. But I always speak my mind.
 BB: And the facts speak for themselves.
 CC: I’m not trying to point fingers. But since I came into this office, I always promised myself that I will be always frank and to the point. And if I have to say something, I always try to do so.
 BB: The employment strategy you presented in 2021 focused a lot on upskilling the workforce, on having a more educated workforce. It’s something you harp on about.
 CC: Because that is how countries get more affluent now.
 Let’s take the Netherlands. People on average work about 28 hours a week, yet their GDP per capita is more than double ours. Why? Because their workforce is much more skilled than ours.
 BB: When I look at education statistics for Malta, whichever way you measure it – from early school leaving to literacy, maths, science – we’re mediocre.
 CC: Yes, and it really pains me. We are one of the member states that allocate significant amount of money to education as a percentage of GDP, yet here we are in 2024 and 40% or so of 15-year-olds still fail to get six O Levels. That is something I can never accept. Economies are changing, technology is getting more sophisticated, and we cannot ignore the times we are living in.
 BB: Do you feel let down by your colleagues in education?
 CC: This also starts at home. Parents should encourage their children to read, or perhaps dedicate more time to follow what is happening at school. This is not just a task that should be borne by the state, there’s a responsibility within the family. I think this requires a national effort.
 BB: Robert Abela said last week that the economy needs to move from one that’s focused on economic growth, to one focused on quality of life. But the reality is that we are a bit like an addict hooked on GDP growth, because if we don’t grow our economy at the 4% clip that we’ve been growing it, we’re in big fiscal trouble.
 CC: There’s a big difference between economic growth and economic development. Economic growth has to happen. And there’s still room for our economy to continue to grow at 4%. What needs to change is how that 4% is created. And we have to start from somewhere. The country has come a long way but we need to triple the effort to move in that direction.
 BB: The EU recently put Malta on its naughty step, if you want to call it that, because of our excessively large deficit.
 CC: It was something predictable, you know.
 BB: I was about to say, you knew it was going to happen. It was in your forecasts, you knew these new EU rules were going to come into play. So what is the government’s response going to be?
 CC: I’m not worried at all. The excessive deficit procedure of 12 years ago was a guillotine. If you exceeded 3% [deficit], you had to cut immediately. Now, there’s more flexibility. In our case, the deficit has to go down by a minimum of 0.5% yearly. And if we want to do it on our own, without any interference from the Commission, we have to do that in four years. So I’m going to disappoint all those people who were perhaps in glee, saying this will bring down the Labour government or that there’s going to be tax increases or austerity. Nothing like that.
  BB: So subsidies will remain until the unit price of electricity can come down?
 CC: That is why we have to work hard to meet these targets, so we can justify them  when we are negotiating with the Commission.
 BB: Are you confident that subsidies will remain?
 CC: As long as I meet my targets.
 BB: As long as the deficit can come down by 0.5 percentage points per year.
 CC: Yes, and I’m very confident, as always, that I will meet my targets.
 BB: But the moment something happens…
 CC: It’s my job to make sure that moment does not happen.
 BB: So you’re not concerned by one credit rating report after the other flagging this as an issue.
 CC: Not at all. Even though credit rating agencies flag it, they still give us good ratings.
 BB: Six weeks ago, your ministry sent out 270,000 cheques in the middle of an election campaign. Are those cheques a wise use of government money?
 CC: It is a measure that enables us to give more to those who earn less. Income tax works the other way round ‒ the more you earn, the more you pay. This allows us to give more to those who need it most.
 BB: Wouldn’t it make more sense to just raise the minimum wage then?
 CC: No, because if you raise the minimum wage that will have a cascade effect on the rest.
 BB: Was it your decision to send out the cheques during an election campaign?
 CC: By and large, it always happens during this time of the year, March, April, May. It wouldn’t have made a difference. It didn’t make a difference.
 BB: It might have backfired.
 CC: I think that people have matured.
 BB: At a Times of Malta event last year, you said Malta’s economy is by and large dominated by cartels. You said: “Banking, telephony, whatever – it’s cartels.”
 CC: Because we’re a small market.
 BB: But you speak matter of factly about something that is illegal. Cartels are illegal.
 CC: Fine, but even if there’s the kind of tacit behaviour…
 BB: Of course. I believe the only cartel that is official is OPEC, right? Every other cartel is a tacit one.
 CC: It is a consequence of our small market.
 BB: But we have a law – the Competition Act – which says cartels are illegal. We have a regulator [the MCCAA] to enforce that law. So an admission like that by the country’s finance minister suggests that the regulator is not really doing its job.
 CC: There’s a fine line between what the regulator can do, what you can prove at law or in terms of numbers, and what you actually see. The fact that there are just a handful [of players] or one or two is going to restrict competition.
 BB: There’s a difference between having a handful of players, and having a handful of players acting as a cartel.
 CC: This goes back to the prisoner’s dilemma. If two companies are enjoying what we refer to as supernormal profits, why try and compete, and both end up worse off?
 BB: Are you happy with the work that the MCCAA does?
 CC: Why not? Yes.
  BB: You’ve lost two parts of your portfolio in the past year: Malita Investments and employment. That suggests you’re falling out of favour.
 CC: I’ve never tried to be popular. I’m 39 and I’ve been involved in the party for the past 25 years. Whenever I had to say something, I always did my best to say whatever I had to say. And I won’t change.
 BB: Losing the employment portfolio – does that make it a bit more difficult to shift the economic model  as you believe it should?
 CC: I’m saying what needs to be done, and I believe in that. At the end of the day, change cannot just come from one person. It has to be a collective effort of a government.
 BB: There was a reshuffle early this year. There were rumours that you were asked to change portfolio.
 CC: It wasn’t the case, no.
 BB: Are you confident you’ll still be finance minister in a year’s time?
 CC: That is up to the prime minister to decide.
 BB: And will you run for deputy leader of your party, if the position opens up?
 CC: No, I’m not interested. I’ve never been after titles or positions.
 BB: If you weren’t interested in titles, you would not be finance minister.
 CC: I get your point. You asked me whether I would like to go further up the scale within the party. No, I do not have any intention at all. Mind you, Chris Fearne is still deputy leader of the Labour Party.
 BB: What if Brussels were to come calling?
 CC: I’m not interested in that either. I think I still have a lot to offer over here.
 BB: Do you rule out ever running to be prime minister of this country?
 CC: The prime minister is Robert Abela.
 BB: You never know in the future.

34 disability fraudsters caught with false blue badges this year so far,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/34-disability-fraudsters-caught-false-blue-badges-year-far.1101189,18-11-2024,001776.png,"More than 30 people were caught carrying fake blue badge disability permits this year, inclusion minister Julia Farrugia Portelli told Parliament on Monday morning.
 Expressing her frustration, Farrugia Portelli said that despite toughened measures to combat the fraud, including the addition of penalty points to culprits’ driving licences, the situation persists from one year to the next.
 The blue badge allows holders to park in restricted parking bays. It is issued by Aġenzija Sapport to people with a disability.
 But, Farrugia Portelli said, 34 people were caught with falsified badges this year, with some perpetrators resorting to increasingly inventive ways to cheat their ways out of their parking woes.
 One culprit, she said, created a false badge using a hologram taken from a wine bottle in place of the badge’s security hologram.
 Others, she said, came across a misplaced blue badge in the street and, rather than returning it to the owner or the police, kept it for themselves.
 In total, six of these cases are now facing court action, with a further 11 cases to be re-examined to determine whether their claim for a badge is genuine.
 Farrugia Portelli was speaking during her ministry’s customary run-through of budget measures presented last month.
 She listed various new initiatives and projects set to open over the next year, foremost amongst them a €1.3m specialised programme for people with intellectual disabilities. The programme will be led by Richmond Foundation, with the involvement of Aġenzija Sapport, she said.
 The government will also open new respite centres for people with disability in the coming months, Farrugia Portelli said, including a new centre in Kirkop and a second centre in Dingli.
 The government will also launch a €5m investment with an NGO in the disability sector to help children and adolescents nurture their skills, Farrugia Portelli said, stopping short of providing more details on the project.
 “The government has already implemented 84% of its electoral manifesto in this sector,” she said.
 The session was also addressed by government MPs Romilda Zarb, Chris Agius, and Katya De Giovanni, as well as opposition MPs Graziella Galea and Charles Azzopardi.
 The latter argued that despite the benefits and allowances dished out in the budget, the number of people living in poverty is creeping upwards.
 Over one in three of Malta’s elderly is now living at risk of poverty or social exclusion, Azzopardi said, citing NSO data.
 “This is twice as many as in 2013,” he insisted.
 Others are struggling to meet their daily needs he said, with thousands considered to be living in a state of deprivation.

PN to boycott OPM's EU celebration in protest,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/pn-boycott-opm-eu-celebration-protest.1091772,30-04-2024,001506.png,"The Nationalist Party will not be attending the Office of the Prime Minister's event on Tuesday night to mark the 20th anniversary of EU membership in protest over statements made in the wake of the hospitals' inquiry. 
 The reception, scheduled for Upper Barrakka Gardens in Valletta, is organised by OPM for several dignitaries.
 In a Facebook post, PN leader Bernard Grech accused the prime minister and his government of waging a campaign against the judiciary, which is doing its duty to ensure justice against those that ""stole from the Maltese"".
 ""Because of this, myself and the parliamentary group of the Nationalist Party will not be attending the celebration because we cannot be present with the same prime minister and government acting against the democratic principles of Malta and Europe we are meant to be celebrating,"" Grech said. 
 The statement was made after a day of drama where it was revealed that a magisterial inquiry into Joseph Muscat and other ministers’ role in the Vitals deal to privatise three state hospitals had been concluded.
 Muscat, who has spent the past year battling the inquiry, described it as a personal “vendetta” and accused the magistrate leading it, Gabriella Vella, of waging war against himself and the Labour Party.
 Robert Abela also criticised the timing of the inquiry conclusions, which he said appeared to have been timed to damage the party’s campaign for the June 8 MEP elections.
 The PN leader said both Muscat and Abela were determined to block the wheels of justice from turning.
 In another post, European Parliament president Roberta Metsola said many in the country may feel vindicated today.
 ""Many others may feel betrayed and broken after the men they placed all their trust in, were finally exposed as what we always knew them to be,"" she said in a social media post. 
 ""But even now, my appeal is for those not to lose hope in politics or in politicians. They should demand better. Some will gloat. They shouldn't.""
 Others, like the Prime Minister, will collapse in a ""predictable, pathetic, panic"", launching personal attack on our judges, Metsola said.
 ""It's all he knows. The lack of leadership that has plagued his premiership will not change. He will remain lost. Adrift. Unable, once again, to rise to the occasion.""

Watch: Robert Abela on Jason Micallef: 'You cannot turn back the clock',timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/watch-robert-abela-jason-micallef-you-cannot-turn-back-clock.1096264,08-03-2024,001579.png,"Robert Abela said Labour Party delegates should not ""turn back the clock"" when asked about Jason Micallef's bid to run for the post of deputy leader for party affairs. 
 The prime minister's less-than-enthusiastic response to Micallef's candidacy came during an interview with LovinMalta, where he asked what he made of the VCA chairman's plans. 
 The interview was recorded on Thursday, a day before Micallef confirmed that he intended to run for the position, which delegates are expected to vote on at the party's next general conference in September.
 ""Jason Micallef gave his contribution in the past and I feel he still has a lot to give. If this rumour is true, then it is up to the party delegates to pass judgement,"" Abela said. 
 He said party delegates have always passed good judgement to keep the PL a ""winning movement"", he said, adding that the party's goal in selecting its leadership is not only to win elections but to keep the organisation in the best state possible to keep doing good in the country.
  He urged delegates to ensure that the party continues to open itself up in a way that is more appealing to moderate voters and in general to become more accessible to a wider band of voters. 
 ""Every time in the past that the Labour Party closed itself up, it lost the election. This is clear,"" Abela said. 
 ""It lost every time it encapsulated itself and adopted a siege mentality. So I want to appeal to the middle ground."" 
 When asked whether Micallef appealed to the middle ground, Abela replied that it was up to the delegates to decide. 
 ""What I can say is the same reply I gave you earlier, you cannot turn back the clock, you can only go forward,"" Abela said to quantify his response. 
 ""You asked me about a specific person, but I think my reply counts in general, when your time is up and you've given your contribution, don't come back.""
 Micallef served as general secretary of the Labour Party between 2003 and 2008 when Alfred Sant served as leader. He was re-elected soon after Joseph Muscat became leader in 2008 but the post was abolished a year later to make way for the unelected post of CEO.
 Micallef is known as a staunch supporter of Muscat.

"PN, government trade barbs on ID card fraud claims",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/pn-government-trade-barbs-id-card-fraud-claims.1096928,19-08-2024,001625.png,"Identità must publish an internal probe into claims that thousands of ID cards were falsified, the Nationalist Party said on Monday.
 The call prompted the Home Affairs Ministry to reiterate that the inquiry cannot be divulged, as it is now part of an ongoing police investigation.
 The two sides traded barbs days after a magistrate accepted a request by lawyer – and former PN MP – Jason Azzopardi to begin a magisterial probe into the claims.
 Azzopardi has said he has information that thousands of identities were effectively falsified by state agency Identità, as part of a years-long identity scam.
 The agency and the government have stopped short of denying the claims, instead saying Identità carried out its own internal investigation and reported some “individuals” suspected of wrongdoing to the police.
 Concerns about identity theft ramped up last week after The Sunday Times of Malta reported multiple cases in which individuals were being referred to hospital for  medical appointments and surgeries they did not book.
 On Monday, the PN said that the buck stopped with the government, specifically Home Affairs Minister Byron Camilleri.
 Apart from publishing Identità’s internal probe, it said, the government should also immediately set up a platform providing property owners full visibility of the people registered with the agency living at their properties.
 In a reaction, the Home Affairs Ministry said Identità had reported suspected wrongdoing to the police and improved its governance structures.
 The ministry said that publishing the internal investigation, as the Opposition wanted, would risk ruining the ongoing police investigation.
 It also reiterated Identità’s explanation to property owners reporting receiving correspondence addressed to people who do not live there: tenants could have moved or falsely used that address to sign up for services or goods.
 The ministry urged private operators to verify customer addresses by ensuring they match those listed on people’s residence documents or ID cards.
 “Identità cannot and will not be held responsible for false or fraudulent information being given to companies, entities or suppliers,” the ministry said.

Joseph Muscat lawyer mulls contesting Labour role,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/joseph-muscat-lawyer-mulls-contesting-labour-role.1096359,08-06-2024,001645.png,"One of the lawyers on Joseph Muscat’s Vitals case legal team confirmed he is considering seeking election to one of the posts in the Labour Party’s leadership and executive.
 Ishmael Psaila, 33, said he has been “urged to contest for more than one role by various party activists, delegates and people occupying internal roles within the party”.
 “I am considering such proposals whilst listening to the various views, concerns and comments of Labour activists. I am always willing to serve and aid the Labour Party, ensuring it remains the major political force in the country,” he said.
 “Such a democratic process helps to confirm the party’s core values, most importantly that of being open to anyone who wishes to contribute and serve.”
 Psaila would not say which roles he was considering but sources close to the party said he could be eyeing one of the three major positions – deputy leader for party affairs, president or executive secretary.
 So far, only former party secretary general Jason Micallef has announced he would seek the deputy leadership role.
  As a lawyer, Psaila is one of the former prime minister’s defence counsel. Muscat stands charged with crimes related to the hospitals deal.
 However, Psaila brushed away concerns that his role on Muscat’s legal team could create a conflict or taint a potential position he could occupy in the party.
 “My role as a criminal lawyer has nothing to do with a possible role within the Labour Party’s internal structures. Dr Muscat’s legal defence is totally independent from the internal politics of the Labour Party,” he said.
 “In this regard, I believe my loyalty to the party and my professional job as a lawyer are not in conflict and can never be such. I, for one, have always stated  that law and politics should always be kept independent of each other, in line with the true principles of democracy and separation of powers.”
 The Labour Party will be holding its general conference between September 13 and 15, during which it will elect a new administration, including successors for Chris Fearne and Daniel Micallef.
 Nominations will be open between August 23 and 25.

'We need a revolution': Jason Micallef considers PL deputy leadership,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/jason-micallef-seriously-considering-pl-deputy-leadership.1096135,31-07-2024,"001670.png,001671.png","Update 4.15pm 
 Jason Micallef is ""seriously considering"" contesting the post of Labour deputy leader for party affairs.
 On Thursday Micallef told Times of Malta he was “overwhelmed by the number of people, including party stalwarts, who reached out"", asking him to ""help out"".  
 ""I simply cannot ignore this call from party delegates, members of parliament and ministers.”
 Micallef said June’s European Parliament elections’ result showed the party has ""to work on its coherence and energy”.
 “The party needs to bring back the ideas and the energy it had in the early days in government. 
 “It should keep setting the agenda, giving birth to new ideas that are then pushed for the consideration of the party's national executive, the parliamentary group and eventually cabinet.”
 Micallef, who holds the chairmanship of the Valletta Cultural Agency, was recently critical of the way the party had lost touch with the electorate. Apart from his social media posts, Micallef even called for the renewal of the Labour Party during interviews on private TV channels.
  Micallef said the party's structures needed to undergo a “revolution”.
 He said the last significant renewal in the Labour Party took place after the 2008 election - 16 years ago.  
 At the time, a new leader and two new deputy leaders were elected.
 
 Micallef told Times of Malta the Labour Party should seriously consider the re-introduction of the role of Secretary General - an elected office.
 “It may not be possible to do all of this come September, during the general conference, however, the party definitely needs a Secretary General.”
 Micallef had occupied this same post between 2003 and 2009.
 Newly-elected MEP Daniel Attard is among those who publicly supported Micallef.
 He resorted to Facebook to declare he considered “his credentials suitable - if not the best - for the role of deputy leader"".
  Micallef has already declared his support for Ian Borg to contest the post for deputy leader for parliamentary affairs.
 Borg is being touted as the frontrunner to succeed Chris Fearne.
 The post of deputy leader for party affairs is currently occupied by Daniel Micallef, who last June announced he would not be seeking re-election, just days after the European Parliament elections in which the Labour Party saw its majority dwindle by tens of thousands of votes.  In those elections, the party also lost the fourth seat in the EP.
  However Micallef does not have universal support.
 Claudette Abela Baldacchino believes that the next deputy leader for party affairs should be a woman.
 Contacted by Times of Malta on whether she was considering running for the post, the former MEP would only say “I have years of experience in the party’s structures and at this stage I will do what is in the best interest of the party.”
 Abela Baldacchino has been active in the Labour Party ranks since the 1980s.   She occupied roles at committee level in Qrendi, was elected to her hometown’s local council and served as international secretary and president of Nisa Laburisti, the women’s branch of the party.
 She also served on the EU’s Committee of the Regions and was vice president of the Association of Local Councillors.
 The Labour Party's General Conference is set to take place in mid-September.

Maurice Tanti Burlò: The pen that poked Malta’s conscience,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/maurice-tanti-burlo-the-pen-poked-malta-conscience.1102140,12-09-2024,"001747.png,001748.png,001749.png,001750.png,001751.png,001752.png,001753.png,001754.png,001755.png,001756.png,001757.png,001758.png,001759.png,001760.png,001761.png,001762.png","Well-known cartoonist Maurice Tanti Burlò died 10 years ago, but his incisive political caricatures, published in Times of Malta , still strike a chord and are remembered as sharply by those who worked with him. Fiona Galea Debono reports.
 He lampooned without fear or favour. And in the words of his son Sebastian – who has continued an uninterrupted line of Tanti Burlò cartoons that “document Malta’s decline since 1977” – he was “Malta’s satirical conscience of hope”.
 Also known by the pseudonym Nalizpelra, Tanti Burlò died on December 10, 2014, aged 78, after 35 years of cartooning every week for the Sunday and daily paper – even when his strong hands trembled as he fought to hold his pen.
 Tanti Burlò’s legacy is a fine collection of newspaper cartoons – “witty, direct, colourful and, most of all, fun”, according to former Times of Malta editor Victor Aquilina, who had asked him to do a pocket cartoon for the front page of the daily paper, sparking off a long-lasting association.
  “Readers just loved his work, which packed a punch in humour and satire,” he said about the man who became as much of a kingpin at Strickland House as Alfred Gerada had been in the 1930s; a leading chronicler of the social and political life in the country – not in words but in cartoons.
 Tanti Burlò poked fun at whoever tickled his fancy, but particularly politicians, ruffling feathers in the process. Yet, former colleagues at Times of Malta say they barely ever had to refuse his work – “which is quite something, considering how risky cartoons could be in the life of an editor”.
  Aquilina recounts the only incident he ever had over the cartoonist’s work.
 “One fine day, (former prime minister) Karmenu Mifsud Bonnici stormed into my office, fuming over a cartoon that had greatly offended him. He took exception to the shape of the necktie Maurice had drawn in a cartoon about him, saying it looked phallic.
 “I tried to calm him down, saying it was no big deal in this day and age, but at this comment, he exploded into a rage.
  “Did I think it had a phallic shape? Well, in all honesty, yes. I must have overlooked the details of the drawing in the urge to get along with my other work. But, even so, I do think Karmenu overreacted and showed he was ultra-prudish. Or maybe he thought he could intimidate me…”
 So many years later, former Sunday Times of Malta editor Laurence Grech does not hesitate to pinpoint a cartoon that brought out Tanti Burlò’s “brilliance in his own way”.
 It was around September 1984 at the height of the Church schools dispute and Tanti Burlò came up with a cartoon of a British coin with former Labour prime ministers Dom Mintoff and Mifsud Bonnici on its head. The inscription around the edge was a play on the title of the sovereigns of England, Fidei Defensor (Defender of the Faith), and read  Fidei ‘Deafensor’ instead, highlighting their hard-headedness and failure to listen.
  Describing Tanti Burlò as a free spirit” and a “gentle” person, Grech said he gave him a free hand and rarely ever needed to censor him, despite having legal responsibility for his open criticism.
 Receiving his cartoons every week of his 17 years as editor, he only disagreed with him on a couple of occasions.
  Grech remembers these well, and they involved a swastika on former General Workers’ Union general secretary Tony Zarb’s arm, which earned the paper a Lm400 fine.
 “I had my doubts about it, but published it anyway,” Grech said. Zarb, at his most vehement, promptly sued.
  Such were the reactions to his work, and Aquilina points out the power of cartoons, saying that if a picture was worth a thousand words, a cartoon was worth far more, bringing out what the camera lens can never see.
 Sadly, however, with the decline in print journalism, political cartoons were becoming an easy target for the chop, Aquilina noted.
 Sharing fond details of his collaboration with the cartoonist, he recalled how he would usually bring over his work on a Saturday, accompanied by his son Sebastian, who stepped into his shoes when he passed on the pen of political cartoonist to him on his death.
  ‘A love for Malta and a distaste for bullies’
 Speaking to Times of Malta from London, Sebastian Tanti Burlò said he sometimes thinks to himself: “Thank God he is not here to see the cesspit Malta has become.”
 And yet, he constantly wonders what his wit and pen would have made of “this cabal of deplorables, who have reduced the islands he so loved to a pariah state on the outskirts of the EU”.
  It was his father’s “love for Malta and his distaste for bullies” that drove him in 1977 to pick up his pen and draw his first cartoon for the then Roamer’s Column.
 “I clearly remember as a child in the early 1990s being told I could never say he drew cartoons… I could just say he paints butterflies and works for Telemalta.”
  Recounting the ritual of delivering the cartoons with his father to the editor on Saturdays and walking down Republic Street after, Sebastian Tanti Burlò noted how politicians would stop him to ask to buy a cartoon that was clearly deprecating them.
 “It was only later that I understood my father’s genius and, moreover, politicians’ inflated egos. Although his cartoons openly mocked them, he drew them in such a way that they felt it a badge of honour to be portrayed by him.”
  More than just a cartoonist, Tanti Burlò was an artist, actor, educator, soldier, broadcaster, a fantastic father, and loving husband, his son said.
 He would have “hated and held to account this Labour government and flaccid Nationalist party”, he believed. “In the 10 years that he has been missing, he would not recognise the island he once loved.”
  It all began to “get back at Mintoff” for the way Telemalta employees, including himself, were suspended without pay for supporting strikers.
 He had described it as the start of “the 10 years of my political blacklisting by the Mintoff regime for having obeyed a legitimate two-day strike directive”.
  In his cartooning career, Tanti Burlò published three books: A Worm’s Eye View in 1982,  Blame it on Dom! in 2002 and  Blame It on Ed! in 2004, and his cartoons have also been featured as stamp designs.
 His established logo of the sun and three birds flying towards it, representing his immediate family, reflected his own “recognition of hope despite the personal, 10-year nightmare between 1977 and 1987”.
 In an interview just before his death, he had said: “After all, I firmly believe that hope – in the profane sense – is one’s ability to caricature despair.”
  Former Times of Malta journalist, George Cini, had written that going round an exhibition of the artist’s work in 2002 was “like resurrecting Malta’s eventful history over the last 25 years”.
 The cartoons often turned out to contain much more than meets the eye, and a case in point, according to Cini, was one showing former Labour leader Alfred Sant hacking with a sword the tail of a dinosaur whose head is Mintoff’s – Nalizpelra’s prime target.
 As Sant violently slashes the behemoth’s tail, newborn dinosaurs rush out of its chopped hind quarters – and the innuendos flowed on.

Watch: ‘Must we be compulsive mercenaries?’ – Vanni Bonello,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/watch-must-compulsive-mercenaries-vanni-bonello.1098388,22-09-2024,"001784.png,001785.png,001786.png,001787.png","MX: How did your father’s passion for art and your mother’s legal and judicial background shape your interests and career choices?
 VB: I grew up surrounded by uncles who lived the law full-time and by a father who personified art, culture and history. This may have conditioned my worldview and, to some extent, my choices. As a toddler I played in my uncle’s study, probably the largest private library of law books in Malta, and in my father’s quarters, which housed floor-to-ceiling books on art and history. They were a 24/7 presence in my formative years.
 MX: Did you ever experience uncertainty or consider different career paths before committing to law and human rights?
 VB: I was more attracted to history and art, but many cautioned me that was hardly a viable way to earn a living. The only fallback appeared to be that of a reluctant lawyer. I eventually exchanged my hobby for my profession and vice versa. Both eventually became loves of my life and now the three of us co-habit meaningfully.
  MX: What sparked your interest in collecting postcards, and how has this hobby influenced your perspective on art and history?
 VB: A passion for collecting can satisfy at least two distinct requirements – that of selfish, greedy hoarding, and the opposite one, of having more to share. I collect old Malta postcards and photographs rather compulsively, but solely to share them as widely as possible. My joy is making sure that what’s mine is also everyone else’s.
 MX: Given your extensive work on history, what are the most crucial lessons that history can impart to contemporary society?
 VB: It’s an illusion that history imparts any lessons. History only teaches us that it teaches us nothing. Has any inflated despot learnt anything from past calamities? Sorry if this sounds cynical but, in my view, never.
 MX: How do you perceive the Maltese people’s appreciation of their history and cultural heritage?
 VB: With some laudable exceptions, many Maltese appreciate history and heritage exclusively from a business and investment perspective. How many times have I been outraged by the defence of our heritage and our environment: because otherwise tourism will suffer; not because nature and icons of cultural memory are inestimable values in themselves; no, only because otherwise we risk losing money. Must we be compulsive mercenaries even in the pursuit of what is right?
  MX: Your father, Vincenzo Bonello, was a passionate nationalist and faced significant adversity for his beliefs, including internment and exile by the British. How did his experiences and stories influence your views on nationalism and human rights?
 VB: I can’t decipher my own DNA, but I rather doubt the injustices my father suffered for his unremitting aversion to colonialism contributed substantially to my commitment to the promotion of human rights and the rule of law. He certainly instilled in me a sense of the inevitability of Christian virtue, but I never recall him inspiring in me any resentment or any subconscious craving to settle scores.
 MX: Did your father’s experiences with the British colonial administration influence your decision to specialise in human rights law?
 VB: I don’t believe there was any decision-making involved in becoming a – or perhaps ‘the’ – human rights lawyer. That happened mostly by default. I was a busy civil law practitioner when the human rights abuses of the 1970s started biting. Victims could find very few, if any, lawyers willing to take up their defence in the law courts against the regime’s systematic contempt for human rights. Many of the 170 human rights victims I defended were referred to me by other lawyers who preferred not to challenge the mob rule that terrorised both lawyers and a part of the judiciary. Gradually, I earned the reputation of “ dak ma jibżax” (he’s not afraid of anyone), and human rights litigation eventually became my routine; on entirely false pretences. I was scared witless.
 My excuse for this masochism was a sense of duty towards what I believed was right, in spite of the hateful intimidation by the regime and the monumental cowardice of some members of the judiciary. I was handicapped by mothballed principles: you do your duty whether you like it or not. It’s good to do it if you’re gratified, and better still, if you’re terrified.
  MX: How would you describe your political views, and have they evolved over time? 
 VB: In so far as one can pigeonhole something so elusive as political orientation, I would identify myself as broadly centre-left, a believer in Christian democracy with a strong social mission. No doubt old-fashioned political views. Activism in politics is not for experiencing the highs of power, but as advancement of the people. Not as a slogan and as a vote-trap, but as a service and a mission.
 MX: Have you ever been involved with Nationalist Party, and if so, how did this involvement shape your perspectives?
 VB: I always tried to resist falling under the spell of partisan politics. My loyalties were never for a party or a leader, but for the political movement that most closely approximated my values and my principles. In my lifetime, that happened to be, on several occasions, the Nationalist Party. I found I could, with less difficulties, identify with the party’s social democratic principles, with its life-saving resistance to integration with the UK, with its passion for defending our centuries-old traditional culture, with its emphasis on education, with its struggles for self-government and independence, with its belief in Malta’s self-sufficiency, with its anti-totalitarian stances, and with its consistent openness to a European unity of purpose.
 Did the party always represent my ultimate ideals? Often it did, but not always. When I felt it did not, I was the first to register my disagreement and my disapproval. My loyalty, I like to believe, was consistently towards my ideals, not towards any particular partisan worship.
  MX: What are your thoughts on the political dynamics of the 1960s, particularly regarding Herbert Ganado’s splinter party and Giorgio Borg Olivier’s stance on Malta’s independence?
 VB: Herbert Ganado split from Borg Olivier’s mainstream on ideological grounds, not for personal ambitions. They both craved independence for Malta. Borg Olivier believed Malta could survive, politically and economically, with immediate independence. Ganado was more cautious. He was well aware and scared that all the countries in the British empire that became independent after the 1940s had turned into communist or military dictatorships shortly after. All, without an exception.
  With Mintoff around and at the height of his popular hold, that prospect was pretty chilling. Ganado had a more nuanced approach to independence. His programme consisted in three steps: One, obtain from London a solemn undertaking that independence would be granted the moment the Maltese asked for it.
 Two, consolidate the economy to make Malta viable and self-sufficient. Three: obtain independence. I believed in Ganado’s programme. With hindsight, I now acknowledge how right Borg Olivier was to take the gamble at a time when the economy was still a total mess. He had full faith in the resilience of the people, and independence promoted an unprecedented economic boom. Chapeau to Borg Olivier.
 MX: How do you view Dom Mintoff’s impact on Malta, considering his charisma and significant political influence?
 VB: It is undeniable that Dom Mintoff figures among the most charismatic, complex and contradictory personalities in our recent political annals. Though claiming to be the primordial patriot, he had no qualms in promoting the annihilation of our statehood by integration, first with the UK and, when that failed, with Italy.
 He aimed at ideals often precious but left a trail of destruction in the wake. He achieved invaluable social progress at the price of national divisiveness, violence and glaring contempt for democracy and the rule of law. Despite his domineering personality, he failed to rein in the violent, the corrupt and the incompetent in his entourage, something the less autocratic Alfred Sant achieved overnight with the flick of a finger. For his greatness I honoured him, for his failings I battled him.
  MX: How did you feel handling human rights cases during the Mintoff administration?
 VB: During the Mintoff regime and immediately after, I defended 170 human rights cases in the Maltese and international courts. In Malta, it was painfully uphill all the time. A good number in the Maltese judiciary had absolutely no human rights culture or sensitivity, nor the faintest desire to acquire any. No appeal from their lurid judgments to the Strasbourg Court of Human Rights was then permitted.
 Personally, I was repeatedly threatened and reviled in and outside court. I had the distinction of being hounded by a notorious Żejtun thug wielding a Kalashnikov, almost certainly the same weapon that later assassinated Raymond Caruana.
 When, in 1987, victims of Maltese violations were finally able to take their complaints to the Strasbourg Court of Human Rights, the then Maltese judiciary instantly acquired the most unenviable record in the whole of Europe – the ECHR rubbished over 90 per cent of their Maltese human rights judgments examined on the merits; a squalid record that even Russia, Azerbaijan and Turkey would have aspired to, but the poor innocents never made it. These were the Maltese courts I had to face daily. Things later thankfully improved.
 MX: Have you ever considered a career in politics to effect change, and what factors influenced your decision?
 VB: No, I never did. I admire and respect those who take up politics as a calling. They are not useful – they are indispensable. But to do politics you must pay the price for craving popularity. It was never a price I considered paying.
  MX: In 1990, you declined Eddie Fenech Adami’s offer to nominate you as Chief Justice. What were your reasons?
 VB: Prime Minister Fenech Adami ‘begged’ me (his words) to accept the nomination of Chief Justice and President of the Constitutional Court. I thanked him and told him I felt better suited to work in human rights law. If the office of Chief Justice could be combined with working as a judge in Strasbourg, I would have accepted. He said that would not be possible, and so I declined. Curiously, what was not possible for me became possible shortly later for someone else. Though, personally, this wounded me, I still pay unbounded homage to Fenech Adami for saving democracy in Malta from a barbaric death.
 MX: In 1998, you accepted Prime Minister Alfred Sant’s nomination as Maltese judge at the ECHR. During your 12 years in Strasbourg, you became known for drafting 53 separate opinions. How do you view the role of dissent in the judicial process, and do you consider it an art form?
 VB: Did I write 53? I never counted them. I hope I am allowed to flatter myself that during the 65 years of existence of the Strasbourg Court and the hundreds of judges that alternated on the bench, mine were the only separate opinions to be selected for publication during the judge’s tenure of office, and this entirely behind my back; a not insignificant distinction for a piddly judge from a piddly state. 
 MX: What motivated you to write separate opinions on European Court judgments, and what impact do you believe they had?
 VB: Giving reasons why you disagreed with the majority’s conclusion or reasoning is almost mandatory for judges in the Strasbourg Court. You have to justify your position. Separate opinions serve very useful functions. They have led to changes in case law in future similar cases. It is the functional way of showing the majority what you believe to be the errors of their ways. It doesn’t always work, but sometimes it does when the court finds inspiration in previous well-reasoned dissenting or separate opinions.
  MX: Your critical assessment of British behaviour in Basra led to a landmark human rights decision. Let me play the devil’s advocate. To what extent do you think your father’s treatment by the British influenced your perspective on this case?
 VB: My Basra separate opinion was my very last one before retirement. After the Anglo-American invasion of Iraq, when the armed hostilities had ended, the UK was tasked with the adminstration and control of the Basra region. Some British armed personnel behaved abominably – torture and murder of Iraqi civilians were not uncommon.
 The survivors of some of the victims sued in the UK for breaches of human rights. The government defended itself that its undertaking to respect human rights only applied on UK territory, and not in Iraq. The UK courts agreed with the government’s pleadings. The relatives of the victims then forwarded their complaints to Strasbourg. The Court (and, separately, I) argued that any state that has ratified the Convention of Human Rights is bound to abide by its obligation wherever it exercises control, and not only on its geographical territory.
 This was a revolutionary breakthrough that gave an added dimension to human rights protection. I did not pull any punches and let rip. Mine is one of the most quoted separate opinions in the history of the court; and not because I wrote it with any intent to vindicate my father, but because it was seen to be compellingly argued. 
 MX: How has Malta’s relationship with human rights evolved over the years, and what are some key milestones in this development?
 VB: When I started my legal career, the courts were mired at one extreme end: nothing, however monstrous the abuse, was human rights. Now we have swung to the opposite extreme – everything, even the most trivial, is human rights. Some of our law professionals have still to find a reasonable middle way.
 MX: How would you assess the current state of human rights in Malta, and do you believe it has improved over time?
 VB: There has been a marked, and positive, shift in human rights consciousness, exemplified by a cursory look at past and recent litigation. Up to the late 1980s, many human rights cases dealt with core complaints – torture, police beatings, extorted confessions, political violence, thuggery, official frame-ups, denial of freedom of expression and of conscience, unfair trials, political discrimination, hijacking of private banks, hospitals, schools, property, denial of labour rights. Now, thankfully, most cases that come before the courts deal with the niceties in the rent laws, money matters and poor governance. 
  MX: With few pending human rights cases in Malta outside of property rights issues, what does this indicate about the country’s human rights landscape?
 VB: There was a time when human rights were a stretcher case. Today they need some therapy and plenty of tender loving care.
 MX: Reflecting on your career and life, are there any decisions or actions you regret?
 VB: Yes. Sometimes I regret I never regretted giving too much. Periodically I lament having been an incurable idealist and a relapser. And not listening to my mother’s wisdom, like, don’t be generous if you can’t stand ingratitude, or, never argue with the stupid, the vulgar and the ignorant – they always win. Or believing, against all evidence, in the goodness of human nature.
 MX: How would you like to be remembered, and what do you hope your legacy will be?
 VB: I have no cravings for the time I am no longer around. My epitaph is written. It says: Vanni,  Vannitas vannitatum. Vanni, Vanity of vanities.

Owen Bonnici takes over from Chris Fearne as leader of the House,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/owen-bonnici-takes-chris-fearne-leader-house.1092791,21-05-2024,001794.png,"Culture Minister Owen Bonnici has taken over from Chris Fearne as leader of the house of representatives as the former deputy prime minister's responsibilities continue to be reassigned amid the fallout from the Vitals inquiry. 
 The announcement, published in the government gazette, means Bonnici will be responsible for setting parliament's agenda. 
 It is a role that is usually assigned to a deputy prime minister but Robert Abela has so far held off on officially designating a deputy and there is no constitutional requirement for him to do so. 
 Sources said Bonnici will become acting prime minister when Abela is absent from Malta or otherwise unable to perform the functions of his office.
 As the most senior member of cabinet, Bonnici had assumed the role several times when either the prime minister or Fearne had been indisposed.
 Fearne resigned from cabinet earlier this month as he faces fraud charges against him related to the deal to privatise three state hospitals.
 The office of the prime minister took over his EU funds, reforms and social dialogue portfolio. 
 Fearne also withdrew as Malta's nominee to the next EU Commission and while Environment Minister Miriam Dalli is seen as a possible replacement, no announcement has been made.

 Romanian Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu announced Monday the country would nominate MEP Roxana Mînzatu in place of fellow MEP Victor Negrescu who was originally tipped for the role.
 Meanwhile, Belgium is set to appoint Foreign Minister Hadja Lahbib after a similar change in direction, bringing the number of women set to join the commission’s ranks to 10, including von der Leyen.
 News of the appointments comes as Malta also faces calls to swap out nominee Glenn Micallef for a female candidate. In a phone conversation on Friday evening, von der Leyen continued to pile pressure on Prime Minister Robert Abela, urging him to replace Micallef, according to sources close to government.
 Negrescu told Politico Monday he understood he had lost out on the role amid von der Leyen pushing for female nominees, but said he accepted the decision while underscoring his “support for gender rights”.
 And later that day, Belgium – the last country to nominate a candidate three days past the deadline – announced its intention to put forward Lahbib, in a blow to outgoing commissioner and initial favourite Didier Reynders.
 The eleventh-hour changes come against a backdrop of mounting pressure from von der Leyen, who has pledged to make the next EU Commission more gender-balanced, and publicly called on member states to each present two nominees – a man and woman – for commission posts.
 Most member states ignored the request, however, noting that no such provision exists within the EU treaties. Bulgaria is the only country to have nominated male and female candidates.
 Last week, Times of Malta revealed how the head of the commission had asked Malta to change its nomination, with sources in Brussels saying von der Leyen had suggested keeping Malta's existing EU Commissioner, Helena Dalli, for a second term.
 Since then, pressure has continued to mount.
 Micallef is considered to be vulnerable because, unlike other nominees, the prime minister's former secretariat lacks political experience. 
 Sources said von der Leyen's demands have put Abela in a difficult position, forcing him to lose face at home by bowing to the demands – just months after having to backtrack on Chris Fearne, who was widely expected to be nominated – or risk Malta being given a weak portfolio.
 Abela has made no public comment on the matter since Times of Malta reported on the issue last week.  
 While the deadline for nominations closed Friday, von der Leyen has roughly until the end of this week until she formally assigns portfolios to EU commissioners.
 After being nominated, commissioners are grilled by MEPs, with the final decision taken by the European Council comprised of government heads of state.

 Abela said Malta must continue to see young people as the driving force capable of challenging the status quo and to improve the quality of various aspects of people’s lives.

New €1.3 billion collective deal for public sector signed,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/new-13-billion-collective-deal-public-sector-signed.1101739,30-11-2024,001870.png,"Over 33,000 public service workers are poised to get a pay bump and and better working conditions, after a new collective agreement for the public sector was formally signed on Friday.
 Following negotiations between the government and 10 unions, the agreement will take effect on January 1, 2025.
 Speaking during the signing of the ""historic"" agreement, Prime Minister Robert Abela said the government would have spent over €1.27 billion more on its workers by 2030, when the agreement is set to expire.
 Times of Malta had  exclusively revealed details about the new deal back in October.
 Abela said most of the money will go towards increasing salaries.
 Managers, police inspectors and other public service workers who fall under Scale 7 will see their maximum yearly wage increase from €32,000 in 2024 to €42,000 in 2030.
 Scale 12 workers, which include Diploma-qualified nurses, will see their maximum salary go up to €31,000 in the next five years, an increase from their current salary of €23,000. 
 Abela said those in the lower scales of the public service are the biggest winners of the agreement.
 Those on scale 20 - the lowest civil sector scale- will now advance to scale 18 within two years and begin earning €18,227 by 2030. The starting salary for scale 20 will also increase, Abela said.
 Those who have been working with the government for a year on scale 20, will immediately move to scale 18. 
 Describing the agreement ""as the biggest collective agreement in Maltese history with the biggest investment"" Principle Permanent Secretary Tony Sultana outlined several measures that will take effect come the new year.
 He highlighted a change in the way overtime is calculated for middle management positions - those on scales 7 to 10.  
 Previously, overtime rates were capped at rates applicable to scale 10, meaning middle managers on higher scales were being paid overtime rates not pegged to their hourly rate. 
 Gradually that measure will be eliminated and overtime rates will now reflect the hourly rate the worker is earning, Sultana said.
 Workers who have been working with the government for over 25 years will receive a new allowance for their longevity in the public service, he added.

"Labour media should become more balanced, says Agius Saliba",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/labour-media-balanced-says-agius-saliba.1098123,15-09-2024,001871.png,"Labour and its media must go beyond praising the government for its work and do more to debate policymaking, newly elected PL deputy leader Alex Agius Saliba has said. 
 “The politics of simply saying ‘good job’ and ‘thank you’ needs to end,” Agius Saliba said on Sunday, in his first speech as the party’s deputy leader for party affairs.
 Agius Saliba was elected to the role on Saturday alongside Foreign Affairs Minister Ian Borg, who is now deputy leader for parliamentary affairs.
 Alex Sciberras was elected PL president after narrowly defeating Norma Saliba.
 Agius Saliba said local party committees should not just be vehicles for fundraising and collecting membership fees, but should also participate in shaping policies and the party’s political vision.
 The party’s media wing ONE should also have more balanced discussions, he said.
 “People want to hear and see mature discussions, not just listen to statements by a minister,” Agius Saliba said.
 Addressing the party’s delegates during the closing event of the PL’s general conference, the MEP said: “Each and every one of us love the party, and because we love the party we need to point out when things are not going as well as they should.”
 Agius Saliba pointed to the high rates of abstention in the 2022 general election and last June’s EU and local council elections, saying that those who did not vote for the PL need to be heard.
 “Some who stayed at home would have never dreamed of doing so a few years ago,” Agius Saliba said.
 “To bring these people back, we must look back at the glorious history of the party and its socialist and social democratic roots.”
 Agius Saliba said that he will be inviting Sammy Meilaq to be at the centre of the discussion about the party’s future.
 Meilaq, who was an aide to former prime minister Dom Mintoff, said Malta is heading in an “anti-socialist” direction in a Sunday Times of Malta interview. 
 Labour's newly-elected deputy leader for parliamentary affairs, Ian Borg, said the PL and government need to have a long-term vision for the next 15 years and not just look to the next general election.
 Borg said the government is already implementing policies to encourage the use of more alternative energy, but said that other long-term goals like introducing a mass transport system also need to be considered.
 As Transport Minister, Borg unveiled plans to develop a metro system in Malta across 30 years to  much fanfare. Those plans, however, went nowhere and the Labour Party did not include talk of a metro system in its 2022 electoral manifesto. 
 
 Borg also said Malta’s urban environment needs improvement.
 “We need to get things done right and delivered on time,” Borg said.
 Borg said Malta’s long-term vision should also focus on providing quality healthcare with shorter waiting times, excellent education, and better pay for workers.
 He also said Maltese people should be prioritised in the labour market.
 “If a Maltese can do a job, they should do it, not a foreigner,” he said.
 Foreigners working in Malta should respect the country, its culture, and laws, and the Maltese should reciprocate that respect, he said.

‘We’re human too’: Indian community ‘saddened’ by PN MP’s remarks,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/we-re-human-too-indian-community-saddened-pn-mp-remarks.1091776,05-01-2024,001883.png,"Members of the Indian community say they are saddened by remarks from the shadow education minister, who linked Indian nationals to Malta being filthy.
 The Malta Malayalee Association said they were concerned the comments could lead people to think Indian nationals were “uneducated and dirty”.
 “We are human beings too and we came to Malta legally, with work permits, so how can he say that,” a spokesperson asked.
 On Monday, Nationalist MP Justin Schembri said Malta was “full of filth, shabbiness and Indians”, a comment that  drew sharp criticism from NGOs Repubblika and Aditus and Equality Parliamentary Secretary Rebecca Buttigieg.
 Stressing such comments by Schembri fuelled racism, the spokesperson for the Malta Malayalee Association, which represents people from the Kerala region of India, said the shadow education minister’s words had the potential to instil discrimination in the younger generation.
 “I feel very sad about his statement,” he said, “We pay taxes and are equal in the eyes of the law, so how can he say that?” 
 The spokesperson rejected Schembri linking Indian nationals to unsanitary conditions, stressing most Indian nationals residing in Malta were well-educated, with many employed in technical jobs and in the country’s healthcare system, especially nursing.
 “We have cultural differences, but our humanity is the same,” he said.
 The spokesperson stressed that while he had been saddened by Schembri’s words, in his experience they only reflected the opinion of the minority of the Maltese he had encountered, speculating the shadow minister may have issued the statement for “political reasons”.
 He added the group, which he said represents around 2,500 people, was considering taking legal action against the opposition MP. According to census data, in 2021 there were more than 7,000 Indian nationals living in Malta.
 Meanwhile, two Indian parents Times of Malta spoke to said they worried Schembri’s words sent the “wrong message”.
 One father said while he hadn’t faced discrimination personally, he was worried his eight-year-old son and six-year-old daughter could if such rhetoric were to influence others in their classes or the parents of other children.
 And asked what he thought to the prospect of Schembri ever being appointed education minister, another father said he was worried such an eventuality “could lead to bad changes in the system”.
 “Politicians need to think about their words before speaking as they affect people... it’s a multicultural society; he [Schembri] needs to realise that,” he said.
 The opposition MP has said he will not consider retracting his comments and has said on Facebook he will “keep talking because I am not afraid to tell the truth”.
 He initially made the comments under a Facebook post from ONE News showing Prime Minister Robert Abela meeting with staff from the cleansing department and Project Green, with Schembri saying ""the government has turned Malta into a dump.""
 Schembri has denied his words were racist, instead describing them as a “generic comment”.
 On Tuesday evening, PN leader Bernard Grech distanced himself from the MP's comments and said he had spoken to Schembri about them. He stopped short of saying whether he intended to discipline the MP or strip him of his education portfolio.

Blurring the lines between money and power ‘dangerous’ – president,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/blurring-lines-money-power-dangerous-president.1102419,13-12-2024,,"Blurring the lines between money and power was “dangerous”, president Myriam Spiteri Debono warned on Friday.
 In the president’s annual Republic Day speech, Spiteri Debono said it was time to seriously examine how parliament could be strengthened.
 The president said the question about whether MPs should be full-time has been raised for a long time, while the issue of financing of political parties has not yet been examined in depth.
 Spiteri Debono expressed hope that addressing the two issues could help decrease behaviour that was not only shameful but also dangerous since it blurred the “strict division” between the power of money and the power of people governing Malta.
 
 “We have to be direct and unequivocal in the delineation needed if governance has to really be in the hands of those chosen by the people.
 “We have to be careful not to overstep certain boundaries”.
 The president said the three pillars of justice - namely the courts, the Attorney General’s office and the police - should be free from outside pressures.
 “All types of pressure, even if well-intentioned is dangerous... good intentions can land us in hell.”
 The president questioned whether parliament’s Standards Commissioner had the means to be an effective disciplinary tool.
 She noted how decisions by the standards committee were usually taken on party lines, meaning the Speaker’s casting vote often determined the issue at hand.
 “Malta is witnessing incidents of unethical behaviour, at times, behaviour which is not honest and worthy of those whom the populace tasked with its representation”.
 Spiteri Debono said MPs who did not uphold the standards expected of them not only caused prejudice to the people but also to other MPs who were upright and honest.
 On parliament’s composition, the president said more needed to be done to perfect the correlation between the amount of first-count votes obtained and the number of seats given in parliament.
 The president also said it was desirable that recommendations emanating from public inquiries were implemented.
 She said the implementation of the Sofia inquiry recommendations have to be concluded, adding that a lot of work under the auspices of the Justice Ministry has already been accomplished.
 The president also noted that the Caruana Galizia inquiry put special emphasis on the journalistic profession.
 Spiteri Debono said it was important that the discussion regarding journalism as part of the tools of democracy continued.
 She said the Institute of Maltese Journalists’ transformation into a union might make it possible for the discussion to subsist with more commitment.
 Spiteri Debono used her speech to question whether local councils - introduced exactly 30 years ago - were being given the necessary tools and finances to ensure they had a more effective role in the community.
 The president said there appeared to be a lack of coordination between local councils and central authorities.
 It was important that local councils were kept in the know about matters concerning their locality.
 The president also touched upon the challenges faced by youths.
 She said property ownership was one of the main concerns worrying youths.
 This situation was the result of various factors that have to be tackled all together, the president said.
 Spiteri Debono gave a list of issues that needed fine-tuning in this regard, including the preservation of buildings in towns and villages, adequate infrastructure, conditions of work and pay, and the understanding that people have to be cared for holistically.
 “The term 'fine-tuning' is being used here since the various incentives given in recent years to protect our town and village centres - and also assistance, so that more people can become homeowners - should be acknowledged”.
 The president reminded attendees that 50 years ago, most working-class people were not homeowners. It was around that time that the process for the majority of people to become homeowners began.
 Spiteri Debono urged the Maltese to keep their hard work, resilience, solidarity and proper behaviour at the fore.
 “We are not in any way inferior to other peoples. We have seen and we are seeing this, in practice. We have to continue cleansing ourselves of the germs of colonialism that at times still evident in some of us”.
 The president said it was important not to corrupt the country’s youth: Our example should instil in them a character backbone, which translates itself into a keen sense of ethics, a keen sense of what is right and correct, she said.

 In a Facebook post on Friday, Muscat said he was prepared to answer every question related to the inquiry, as tension mounts over the hospitals debacle.
 “I have nothing to hide, and have no qualms with being transparent… I wrote to the police commissioner and told him to call me in as soon as possible and as soon as he has the conclusions of the Attorney General on the hospitals' inquiry, [so I can] answer any question he may have and show the facts,” he said.
 “As I already said this is another Egrant (the secret Panama company he was linked to). This is a political vendetta against me and my family. I will remain determined that the truth will come out,” he added.
 It emerged on Tuesday that a magisterial inquiry into Muscat and other ministers’ role in the Vitals deal to privatise three state hospitals had been concluded.
  Attorney General Victoria Buttigieg is now in the process of analysing the inquiry and the 78 boxes of evidence it involved, to decide whether or not to file criminal charges against people named in it.
 Muscat's written request to the police commissioner is superfluous: investigators question criminal suspects of their own accord and do not require any request to do so.  
 Muscat, who has spent the past year battling the inquiry, described it as a personal “vendetta” and accused the magistrate leading it, Gabriella Vella, of waging war against himself and the Labour Party.
 In a press conference on Tuesday, he said: “The institutions are working – working against Labourites.” He also said he had “no doubt” he would face criminal charges as a result of the probe, but said he had nothing to fear.
 “If justice exists, I will be a free man and then receive compensation for damages suffered,” he says. “I know I did nothing wrong.”  
 It is not the first time that Muscat has asked the police commissioner to get involved in the case: last November, in an interview with Labour shill Manuel Cuschieri, he said that he wanted the commissioner to investigate the deal of his own accord.

Watch: Thomas Bajada: the MEP who ‘approaches politics as a scientist’,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/watch-thomas-bajada-mep-approaches-politics-scientist.1096594,19-08-2024,002134.png,"On his first day at the European Parliament, Thomas Bajada demonstrated he plans to do politics differently.
 White paper in hand, he strolled up to cast his vote for Roberta Metsola to be re-elected as parliament president – the only Labour MEP to do so.
 It isn’t the first time the Gozitan has bucked a trend: his nomination came as a surprise and he was elected on his first attempt without relying on the backing of former prime minister Joseph Muscat.
 So, it is perhaps not surprising that he has a particular approach to his new role. The 30-year-old says he tackles politics from a scientist’s perspective.
  Trained to be inquisitive, he tests his hypothesis and draws conclusions according to the data, without much influence from his peers.
 With a Bachelor of Science in Biology and Chemistry, he also holds a Master’s in Ocean Governance.
 More recently he served as government’s technical attaché on fisheries at the Permanent Representation of Malta to the European Union in Brussels, and so, despite his inexperience as a politician, he understands how the EU institutions operate.
 Bajada represented Malta on the Council of the EU in negotiations related to the aquaculture industry.
 “Luckily I used to frequent the EP in my former role, or otherwise I wouldn’t have been able to even find the entrance,” he told Times of Malta.
 But as he settles into a new life as an MEP, Bajada admitted to feeling “overwhelmed” in his first week.
 “Walking into my first plenary [in Strasbourg] was emotional. I was overwhelmed. Then you have to get used to the electronic system of voting.”
  He says he feels “privileged” to be representing the Maltese and Gozitans, and puts that above party politics. He is even in favour of regular inter-delegation meetings involving Nationalist MEPs.
 “I have been insistent on us six [MEPs from Malta] working closely together. I am open to that option as well, but it takes two to tango,” he warns.
 Born in Gozo in 1994, he was active with the Soċjetà Filarmonika Leone and the Aurora Opera House. He also served as secretary general of the National Youth Council, and for a while was coordinator of the Labour student organisation Pulse.
 He believes innovation and technology may be key for the European Union to reach the climate goals it has set for itself without negatively impacting its citizens.
 Bajada insists “the challenges that we are facing as a continent have to be tackled with social justice in mind”.
 Settling into the role before summer recess began, he has been taking part in the first meetings of the committees to which he has been assigned: the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and Fisheries. Bajada is also a substitute member on the Economy and Monetary Affairs Committee.
 “As long as you have good assistants to guide you… they are the ones who do a lot of the preparatory work required for an MEP to work diligently and efficiently,” he says. Bajada may have attracted Gozitan voters in droves, but he believes he obtained a substantial number of votes from Malta. And yet, Gozo’s interests remain at heart.
 “Gozo has a reality unto itself with very specific needs. There are hardly any MEPs who can comprehend this. I want to ensure that whatever regulation is discussed, in whichever sphere, protect islands such as ours.”
 
 Bajada argues that Gozo must be approached holistically and not as an extension to Malta.
 “With digitalisation, Gozo can really become sustainable. It should now be possible for our youths, our entrepreneurs, to reap the benefits of the single market from home.”
 Bajada believes that a move towards new technologies, such as green energy and the digital industry, can boost Gozo’s perspective as an island that suffers from the much-maligned double insularity.

  WINNERS
 The star MEP candidates for both Labour and PN swept up a record number of votes at the polls, solidifying their status as frontrunners for their respective parties.
 European Parliament president Metsola made a record-breaking impression with voters, receiving 87,473 first-preference votes. The number is the highest ever received by a single candidate in Malta’s MEP electoral history.
  Agius Saliba also soared at the polls with 63,899 votes, a record number for Labour MEP candidates and which saw him surpass the previous title-holder of the PL’s most popular MEP, Miriam Dalli.
 It also represented a significant jump in votes for Labour’s lead voice in the EU, having gone up from 18,808 in 2019.
  The 29-year-old Gozitan technocrat was something of an enigma in this year’s electoral race. Despite starting his campaign late and not organising any significantly large campaign events, he made a strong impression with voters, to the detriment of candidates like Steve Ellul and Clint Azzopardi Flores who had stronger ties to the party.
 This elections cycle has seen the emergence of hung councils, thanks in no small part to the independent councillors who managed to snag seats in
 their localities, leaving no majority for either PN or PL. Kaylocke Buhagiar in Birkirkara, Matthew Borg Cuschieri in Mellieħa and Nigel Holland in Floriana are expected to be the kingmakers in their respective councils.
  Popular independent Żebbuġ councillor Steve Zammit Lupi received an overwhelming 2,342 votes in the election, in the process being able to transfer enough votes to his mother, Lillibeth Zammit Lupi, who will also be joining him on the council. Steve, a well-known environmental campaigner, is expected to serve as the town’s mayor, having received the highest number of votes.
 Għasri mayor Daniel Attard resigned from the PN in 2022 and questions arose on whether he would be able to hold onto his seat. But Attard ran on the PL’s ticket and won again, helping flip the village red.
  Sixteen-year-old Izak Catania De Giovanni, the son of Labour MP Katya De Giovanni, made history in becoming the youngest person to ever win a council seat in Malta. Despite the somewhat controversial inclusion of 16-year-olds on the ballot, Gabriel Borg Ferrando in St Julian’s and Nina Skye Briffa in Qrendi also managed to get elected on the PN ticket. Catania De Giovanni’s fellow 16-year-old Labour candidate Andre Mizzi missed the mark to join him on the council.
  LOSERS
 Despite far-right movements gaining significant traction in MEP votes across several countries in Europe, Malta seemed to have bucked the trend, with Imperium Europe failing to make a splash at the polls. Despite being long-established in Malta, the party’s vote share decreased from 3% in 2019 to 2% this time around.
 All polls ahead of the MEP elections said that Labour was projected to win by a much bigger majority than it actually did, much to the surprise of those counting and watching on election day. Pollsters themselves think that the undecided voters ultimately swayed at the last second.
 Despite managing to elect two councillors and making some traction in the MEP polls, the party lost a lot of ground to Arnold Cassola and Conrad Borg Manche. Most of the other independent candidates also barely scratched the surface.
 Despite the phrase “40,000” followed by a string of lemon emojis having established itself as the rallying cry of Labour’s unassailable electoral majority, that footing is no longer as solid, with the lead having shrunk to 8,454. Robert Abela’s demure victory speech certainly contributed to the idea that this win was not being treated like a win.
  Despite the housing minister saying he still enjoys the PM’s confidence, reports that Galdes got a dressing down from Abela are pervasive. It is understood that he was blamed for the Siġġiewi social housing debacle that saw magistrates reversing an order to register 99 voters in unfinished flats ahead of the election.
  From teasing an MEP candidacy, the former prime minister spent the latter half of the campaign embroiled in the start of a court battle in the wake of the Vitals inquiry. If his earlier statements were testing the waters for a potential return to politics, the prolonged court battle ahead has certainly seen that window firmly shut. Analysts also suggest that Muscat’s status splits opinion among Labour voters, with the hardcore questioning why Muscat wasn’t defended more by the party and moderates preferring the party to distance itself from its former leader.

Watch: 'Abela has read Vitals inquiry and is using it to save his own skin',timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/watch-abela-read-vitals-inquiry-using-save-skin.1091943,21-06-2024,002194.png,"Updated 1.55pm with PN statement
 Robert Abela has access to a secret magisterial inquiry into the Vitals deal and is using his knowledge of it for his own political benefit, Opposition leader Bernard Grech has charged.
 “If it’s not true, go ahead and sue me,” the Nationalist Party leader said at a public meeting on Friday evening. “If it’s not true, go ahead and report me.”
 Grech said that Abela’s words and actions made it clear that he and others already have access to the inquiry report.
 “Abela is using this information to save his own skin while drowning others. I’m making a clear accusation,” Grech said.
  The Vitals inquiry was sent to the office of Attorney General Victoria Buttigieg last week, who must now decide whether to press criminal charges against anyone cited within it.
 Its contents remain secret, but speculation about what the inquiry found and who it recommends criminal action against has shaken Malta’s political establishment this past week.
 Sources say Joseph Muscat, Konrad Mizzi and Keith Schembri are among a long list of people likely to face charges related to money laundering, with Chris Fearne and Edward Scicluna also  expected to be charged, albeit for lesser offences.
 Fearne is understood to have offered his resignation as a Labour MP during a Thursday evening parliamentary meeting. On Friday, he publicly said that he had never broken the law or ministerial ethics and had nothing to hide.
 Muscat,who has said he has “no doubt” he will be among those charged, has also said he is innocent and will fight what he describes as a “political vendetta” to the very end.
 Speaking on Friday, Prime Minister Robert Abela hinted that he has seen a copy of the inquiry.
 While he stopped short of directly answering when asked if he has seen the inquiry, in comments to Malta Today he said that he would not rest on the inquiry’s conclusions when deciding whether or not to sack officials involved.
 “I will look at the entire document and see if those recommended for criminal prosecution are cited in the inquiry text as having probably committed a crime, or if the conclusions advise criminal prosecution despite the report itself finding no evidence of them having committed a crime,” Abela said.
 The prime minister went on: “I will also see if the report recommends prosecutions out of the blue for people whose only sin is having been loyal to the state, under both PN and PL administrations.""
 The Vitals magisterial inquiry began in 2019 following a complaint by NGO Repubblika, which suspected top government ministers of corruption related to the multi-million euro deal that saw an unknown company given the keys to three state hospitals. 
 Separately, former Opposition leader Adrian Delia filed a civil case to have the deal annulled. He won that case last year, forcing the concessionaires to exit Malta and the hospitals to return to the public.  
 In a statement on Saturday afternoon, the PN said the attorney general should publish the inquiry without delay.
 Given that Abela and others within the government evidently have access to the iniquity, the Opposition and the general public was being kept at a disadvantage.
 It said that it would be willing to go to court to force the matter, recalling that the attorney general's office had already been judged to be discriminating in the government's favour in a similar fashion back in 2019. 
 Back then, the attorney general was forced by a court to hand then-Opposition leader Adrian Delia a full copy of the Egrant inquiry.   
 The attorney general had given a copy of that inquiry to then-Prime Minister Joseph Muscat, Muscat's personal lawyer and the Justice Minister, but not to the Opposition leader.

New BCA board to be led by former PA Commission chair Simon Saliba,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/new-bca-board-led-former-pa-commission-chair-simon-saliba.1091916,05-03-2024,002207.png,"The Building and Construction Authority board has been recomposed with a new chairperson and members, a week after the Justice Minister demanded the board’s resignation.
 Architect and civil engineer Simon Saliba will lead the newly-composed BCA board as its chairman. Saliba previously chaired the Planning Authority’s Commission but was sacked from that post in late 2020 after  clashing with NGOs.
 He replaces Saviour Camilleri, who lasted just over one year as BCA chair.
 Ian Borg – a close confidante of Prime Minister Robert Abela and not to be confused with the minister of the same name – retains his post as deputy chair of the BCA board.
 Three architects - Herman Bonnici, Krista Xuereb and Ivan Piccinino – lawyer Marouska Debono and Superintendent for Cultural Heritage Kurt Farrugia join the board.
 They replace architects Robert Ellul Sciberras and Eve Ghersci, lawyer Alexander Scerri Herrera and Charmaine Mangion.
 Board secretary Katia Farrugia Cachia has also been replaced by Jessica Schembri. 
 In a statement announcing the decision, Minister for Justice and Construction Sector Reform Jonathan Attard said the appointments would strengthen the regulator.
 “We are adding new skills, perspectives and experiences to the board. We know that there is still a lot to do for the sector, but it is more important than ever before that we move ahead with implementing our electoral pledges and the recommendations made by the Sofia public inquiry,” Attard said.    
 The BCA was plunged into crisis by the conclusions of that public inquiry, which heard how the regulator was riddled with legislative loopholes and was not adequately equipped to fulfil its role as a sectoral regulator.
 Problems within the entity came into full public view when one board member, Robert Ellul Sciberras, eviscerated the authority in his resignation letter, and its CEO Jesmond Muscat  resigned without explanation.
 The government has yet to announce a new CEO for the authority. Sources told Times of Malta that Roderick Bonnici, an architect who works for Infrastructure Malta, is a frontrunner for the job.

Ian Borg and Alex Agius Saliba to contest Labour deputy leader posts,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/ian-borg-run-pl-deputy-leader-parliamentary-affairs.1096992,21-08-2024,002215.png,"Updated 11am
 Ian Borg and Alex Agius Saliba confirmed on Wednesday they will be contesting the posts of Labour deputy leader for parliamentary and party affairs in the upcoming PL elections.
 In July  Times of Malta reported that the foreign affairs minister appears likely to succeed Chris Fearne, who stepped down in the wake of the Vitals court case.
 Sources close to Borg told Times of Malta on Wednesday that all MPs have privately pledged to back his candidacy.
 The party will hold internal elections on September 13 and 14, during which several key roles, including the party’s two deputy leaders, will be up for grabs. Nominations for all positions will open on Friday, August 23 and remain open until August 25.
 It looks like Borg will not face any competition for the post.
 While MEP Agius Saliba confirmed in a Facebook post that he will throw his hat in the ring for the party affairs post, former MEP Josianne Cutajar also seems to be mulling the role.
 Jason Micallef dropped out of the race only days after confirming his intention to contest. Claudette Abela Baldacchino also confirmed she was no longer interested in running for the post of deputy leader.
 In a statement announcing his candidacy, Borg said he would contest the role after considering calls ""from many quarters"" and with the support of his family.
 He said he also spoke to fellow Labour MPs and delegates, reflected on Robert Abela’s call for unity and consulted Fearne, who he said had committed himself to the role ""with impressive courage and determination"" for eight years. 
 ""I am choosing to extend my contribution to the consolidation of PL and the Labour Government because I wholeheartedly believe that Labour and the values it enshrines are the best political choice for our country and that we must all work tirelessly, as one team, for the common good of the people of Malta, as this Party has been doing since its inception, for more than a century,"" he said.
 Borg said since he ventured into politics at the age of 16 he has always believed in the ""great strength of our communities"".
 ""It reaffirms the need to make sure that as politicians, we must continue inspiring and empowering our families and businesses to achieve their potential, as we support our children to become stronger, principled and more sustainable Maltese generations.""
 In recent months, Borg presided over the United Nations Security Council on behalf of Malta, leading talks on decisions on the Middle East and Ukraine.
 He is also currently chairing the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
 ""When I meet with leaders of other countries, they wonder how a small island state like ours can punch above its weight with such significant results on an international level.
 ""This unparalleled potential of our people has convinced me to step forward and offer to dedicate more of my time and energy to our country and to Labour, by nominating myself to serve as deputy leader.""
  Meanwhile, Agius Saliba also confirmed he will be contesting the elections on Wednesday.
 He said he has been involved in the party politics since the age of 15: ""I loved the activists, delegates and party members with whom I've always worked -  without any personal interests or pretensions - to ensure the PL remains the largest political force in the country"".
 
 The MEP said he was going to invest even more effort in the party so that in three years, the PL will once again be an ""organised party full of eagerness and volunteers so that together we continue working for the good of the country"".
 It would have been easier to ignore the call (for him to contest the role) by Abela and the hundreds of delegates and activists, however, he had always been there when the party needed him, Agius Saliba added.

Former refugee welfare agency CEO found guilty of embezzling public funds,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/former-agency-ceo-found-guilty-embezzling-public-funds.1101291,21-11-2024,002217.png,"The former CEO of the Agency for the Welfare of Asylum Seekers (AWAS) has been convicted of embezzling public funds after a court heard how he used agency resources and employees for works on his private residence and boat. 
 Joseph Michael Baldacchino, 57, served as the chief executive of AWAS between 2016 and 2018.
 Charges were brought against him after an investigation by the Financial Investigation Directorate within the Internal Audit and Investigation Department concluded that he had made use of the agency’s resources to purchase items for himself and got AWAS employees to carry out private work for him, sometimes even during their working hours. 
 The court heard how in one instance, he had presented a receipt of €38.75 to be refunded to him for taking an employee out for a meal at a Ta’ Xbiex restaurant. 
 The accused initially said during questioning that he had taken out a female employee to lunch in recognition of her work, telling police he had done so because the woman had saved the agency “thousands of euros”. 
 However, when the woman was called to testify, she denied ever having attended the lunch with him. 
 On cross-examination, Baldacchino changed tack and said that it was not the employee that he had taken out to lunch, but the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. 
 He had done this, he said, because the permanent secretary had expressly forbidden him from using agency money to pay for meals, except when these were meals for agency employees. 
 He decided to defy those instructions, he said, because he did not agree with them and the head of the UNHCR was a very important person in the field of migration. 
 Baldacchino said he had presented the bill for the meal to be refunded as petty cash anyway and said he had instead gone to lunch with the female employee. 
 Another incident concerned a man who had been employed by the agency to work as a cleaner at the Ħal Far open centre for €4 an hour. 
 It was established that the man, a third-country national who lived at the Ħal Far tent village at the time, would be paid monthly after filling in an attendance sheet that had to be approved by the agency’s financial department. 
 The cleaner testified that on June 14, 15 and 17 of 2017, the accused’s son had picked him up from the tent village and taken him to a garage in Kalkara where he spent some 26 hours cleaning Baldacchino’s boat. 
 The man said he was never paid for his services and instead noted down the time he spent at the Kalkara garage on his attendance sheet, as he had not explicitly been told not to do so. 
 Baldacchino insisted he had given his son €120 in cash to pay the cleaner instead. 
 The court said that it did not believe his version of events. 
 Based on evidence and testimony given by employees from the agency’s financial department, the financial officer had refused to approve the hours listed by the cleaner on the days that he had been taken to the Kalkara garage and left a note asking for the CEO to approve those hours. 
 A review of the payment issued to the cleaner for June 2017 included the hours he had spent carrying out maintenance on Baldacchino’s boat, the court concluded. 
 The court also heard of several instances where Baldacchino had asked employees to acquire tools or materials for him and never paid them back, allowing them instead to file receipts for their expenses to be reimbursed by the agency. 
 On one occasion, Baldacchino asked a senior technical officer to give him one of the shower trays that had been bought by AWAS specifically to be installed at the Marsa open centre. 
 The man obliged and loaded it into the car designated for the CEO’s use. 
 Sometime later, Baldacchino complained to the same man that he had not found anyone to install the shower tray for him and the employee offered to do so himself. 
 The man and two other AWAS employees went to Baldacchino’s house on a Saturday morning on which they had not been scheduled to work and fitted the shower tray for him. 
 Baldacchino told the court he had tried to hand the employee €100 to pay for the shower tray, but the man had refused. He said he later gave the three men a bottle of whisky to thank them. 
 The court observed that from testimony it was clear the employees had refused payment for the time and labour spent to install the shower tray and not as recompense for the item itself. 
 The same technical officer testified that on different occasions Baldacchino had called him up to buy a pump for his boat - for which he was given specifications, paints intended for the boat and a stainless steel pipe. 
 The pump and the paints had been paid for by a cheque issued by the agency. The pipe was delivered directly to Baldacchino’s Birkirkara house and the receipt was left with the accounts department. 
 When questioned, Baldachino admitted it was possible that he had not paid back agency employees for the materials and tools they had bought on his instructions but that this was only because he was very busy with work at the agency and there were several problems at the refugee centres that needed his constant attention. 
 The court commented that ultimately Baldacchino did not present any evidence to substantiate his claims that he had in fact paid for these items himself. 
 In a sentence handed down by Magistrate Rachel Montebello, the court observed that Baldacchino was one of the few people who were authorised to approve the agency’s expenses and therefore knew well that those expenses had not been paid out in service to the agency, but for his own gain. 
 While she did note that Baldacchino had a clean criminal record and the amounts in question were not particularly substantial, the court could not ignore the fact that as CEO, the accused had abused his position by systematically using workers and funds from the agency to serve his own interests. 
 “Behaviour of this kind is abhorrent because the accused evidently breached the trust he was given to administrate funds that were paid out to the agency to use in the best interest of the public,” the Magistrate said. 
 While acknowledging that the role of a CEO is highly stressful and demanding, this could never justify the systematic behaviour shown by Baldacchino and as proven by the evidence, she added. 
 The court found him guilty of misappropriating public funds and sentenced him to a two-year jail term, suspended for three years. 
 He was also ordered to pay back €602 as recompense for the losses the agency suffered as a result of his actions. 
 Shortly after his appointment in 2016, Baldacchino had gotten into hot water when the hiring of his son as a support worker at the agency roused anger among employees. 
 In another incident in 2017, Bladacchino was given a warning after it emerged that he had created a fake vacancy in order to hire the son of a ministry official at AWAS while it was under his watch. 
 According to his LinkedIn page, Baldacchino is still currently working for a public body and serves as a senior manager at the Malta Food Agency.

 ""The Rule of Law requires that the judiciary is allowed to function without undue pressure.

 The prime minister repeatedly hit out at Gabriella Vella last week for concluding her inquiry weeks before MEP and local council elections in June. The magistrate was also criticised by former prime minister Joseph Muscat.
 On Wednesday, Opposition leader Bernard Grech said police protection should be provided for the magistrate.“We are in an unprecedented situation, the judiciary is under threat and that is unacceptable,” Grech said.  “It is very dangerous that the prime minister does not understand that he cannot attack the judiciary but has an obligation to protect it” he argued.
 The Chamber of Advocates last week also accused the prime minister of unleashing a direct attack on the judiciary and said the judiciary should be allowed to work without interference. 
 “It was only the judiciary that can safeguard the rule of law and guarantee justice for all. It should not be criticised for political or partisan reasons,” the chamber said.

 The case was revealed by The Shift which said it involved the wedding of permanent secretary Joyce Dimech's daughter. 
 The request for investigation was made by election candidate Arnold Cassola who said this appeared to be a case of abuse of power and conflict of interest.
 He noted that the legal notice was issued just a day before the wedding was held, even though the reception would have required months of preparation. 
 Furthermore, according to The Shift, were the new rules to be strictly applied, a request to use the ditch for such an event needed to have been submitted four weeks previously.
 He noted that such events had been previously banned to ensure the preservation of the site and public access.  The legal notice therefore indicated inappropriate use of legislative power for private or personal interests.   
 Cassola said the impact of the change of rules on the site needed to be evaluated. And why were the rules changed only for weddings?  
 He said the manner how the legal notice was issued, just a day before the wedding took place, could undermine public confidence in good governance and raise questions on abuse of power.

"Judiciary, not ministers, should handle warrants for wiretapping – EU prosecutor",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/judiciary-ministers-handle-warrants-wiretapping-eu-prosecutor.1096003,29-07-2024,002333.png,"Warrants for wiretapping in criminal investigations should no longer be authorised by the home affairs minister but should instead become the responsibility of the judiciary, according to a European prosecutor.
 Yvonne Farrugia, Malta’s European public prosecutor believes “this would ensure that any decisions regarding the interception of communications of criminals are made without any political influence.”
 Currently, in Malta, prosecutors and investigators who wish to monitor their criminal targets must file requests under the Security Services Act. This law, which deals with matters of national interest, stipulates that requests for warrants are made to the home affairs minister.
  In an interview with Times of Malta, Farrugia emphasised that this should no longer be the case in criminal investigations. “Magistrates grant arrest and search warrants, and a similar system should be adopted for cases where investigators seek to conduct surveillance on subjects of their investigations.”
 Prosecutors use wiretapping to gather evidence that can be used in court for many serious criminal offences. Farrugia argues that “members of the judiciary are capable of assessing the proportionality of the requests made by the investigators and can decide whether the request for a warrant is relevant and should be issued.”
 Since intercepts may also include personal data and information, Farrugia suggests that evolving the regulation of telecommunications intercepts may also aid the admissibility of evidence in open court.
 “We are dealing with measures that impinge on a person’s private life. In cases of criminal offences, especially organised crime, corruption, and very serious cases, this tool is crucial because, in the end, you need evidence to support your case in court.”
 Farrugia was appointed Malta’s European Public Prosecutor on July 29, 2020. The European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO) tackles large-scale cross-border crime against the EU budget. Operations commenced in June 2021 in 22 participating EU member states, including Malta. Since then, Poland and Sweden have also joined.
 By December 2023, the EPPO had 12 active investigations in Malta, which is less than one per cent of the 1,372 open investigations across the 24 member countries. Earlier this month, as a result of an investigation in Malta by the European Prosecutor’s Office 11 suspects, including nine public officers, were charged in court with customs fraud, corruption, participation in a criminal organisation, and money laundering.
 “This was a very serious case as the stakes are higher when public officials are involved,” Farrugia said.
 EPPO estimates that these alleged criminal activities in this particular case caused damage of over €15.9 million to Malta’s national budget and over €7.6 million to the EU budget.
 Farrugia defends the limited progress in other investigations, insisting these are complex and require resources that the EPPO does not have at its disposal. EPPO relies on the collaboration of the Malta Police Force and the Attorney General’s Office.
 “At the moment, we liaise directly with one police inspector who has pending national investigations. We would prefer to have a dedicated team of inspectors working exclusively on EPPO investigations, as this would enable us to conclude many more investigations.”
 Regarding the AG’s Office, Farrugia notes that cooperation has increased since EPPO’s Chief Prosecutor Laura Codruţa Kövesi criticised the Maltese authorities for not providing enough resources.
 “Our office remains autonomous, and the AG cannot make decisions that impinge on operational matters related to our investigations, but dialogue has increased,” she said.

Jason Micallef to contest for PL party affairs deputy leadership,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/jason-micallef-contest-pl-party-affairs-deputy-leadership.1096206,08-02-2024,002338.png,"Jason Micallef has announced that he will contest the race for the post of  Labour Party deputy leader for party affairs.
 In a Facebook post on Friday morning, Micallef said several PL delegates had encouraged him to run for the role, but it was not an easy decision to come to. 
 He said the announcement was preceded by long conversations with several party officials, including Prime Minister Robert Abela. 
 “From all of these meetings I understood that, in the present situation and with the experience I gathered during several years in the leadership of several party structures, as well as other experiences of leadership in national projects, I can help the renewal that the Labour Party needs right now,” Micallef said. 
 He added his next step is to listen to what delegates have to say about the matter, stressing the need for unity. 
 “The renewal that the party needs right now needs to be achieved by working hand in hand together, from the roots. Because we have always been here together, in the good and the bad, in fair and stormy weather, with genuine love for our glorious party,” Micallef said.
  Micallef, who currently sits as the chair of the Valletta Cultural Agency, and who served as Labour general secretary under Alfred Sant, previously told Times of Malta he had been seriously considering contesting for the role. 
 He said the party needed to work on its “coherence and energy” following the result of June’s European parliament elections, this following an uptick in Micallef being publicly critical of the way the party has handled certain affairs. 
 The Labour Party will be holding its general conference between September 13 and 15, during which it will elect a new administration, including replacements for Chris Fearne and Daniel Micallef, the latter of which Micallef hopes to succeed. 
 While insiders believe foreign minister Ian Borg is poised to be the front-runner in the race for Labour’s deputy leader, there were previously no clear contenders for the party affairs deputy leader role, although sources named former MEP Josianne Cutajar as a possibility.

 Abela, accompanied by his wife Lydia, led a delegation from the Labour Party that went to pay tribute to Gouder, who was found dead on Tuesday. 
 ""Karl Gouder was a politician who was respected by all. He worked without ever harming anyone. This is a moment where we must insist on national unity,"" Abela said in a short note on Facebook. 
 He was joined by former minister Chris Fearne, party president Ramona Attard and PL CEO Daniel Micallef, who also took time to sign the condolences book. 
 The book is being kept open to the public between 9 am and 7 pm tomorrow. 
 The PN previously announced that Gouder's funeral would take place on Saturday at the St Julian's parish church. It will also be broadcast on NET Television. 
 In a previous tribute to Gouder, Abela said that he had been friends with him since they were both schoolboys and despite later in life finding themselves on the opposite sides of parliament, their childhood friendship nevertheless endured. 
 ""Karl had a strong sense of duty to both his community and to citizens. I am truly sorry for his loss,"" Abela said.

Most people don’t trust political parties or the government: Eurobarometer,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/most-people-don-t-trust-political-parties-government-eurobarometer.1101777,30-11-2024,002407.png,"Two-thirds of Maltese don’t trust political parties and fewer than half trust either the government or Malta’s parliament, according to a new Eurobarometer study published on Friday.
 But these figures nevertheless mark a sharp rise on a previous edition of the study published earlier in the year.
 The survey’s findings generally show signs of an uptick in people’s attitudes towards the state of the country, reversing a negative outlook that had set in over the previous two years.
 Just under half now say that the country is headed in the right direction, 13 percentage points more than in the Spring, with a third saying they expect the country’s situation to be better over the next year (15 percentage points more than the previous survey).
 Meanwhile, there has been an increase in the number of people who say the situation in Malta is good (56%), that Malta’s economy is good (68%), and that their household’s financial situation is good (84%).
 
 And while trust in politics remains low, this has also seen an upturn.
 The number who say they trust political parties has risen by 17 percentage points to reach 34%, while trust in the government has also risen by 11 percentage points to reach 47%. And people appear to be more satisfied with democracy in Malta than they once were, rising by 14 percentage points to 54%.
 
 The survey also sheds light on Malta’s somewhat schizophrenic attitude towards the EU.
 While the overwhelming majority (91%) say that Malta has benefitted from EU membership, and only a quarter say Malta would be better off outside the union, two-thirds of Maltese also believe that Malta would carry more weight globally if it were no longer in the EU.
 But the survey finds that the Maltese have a particularly poor understanding of how the EU works, with fewer than half saying they know how the union functions, lower than any other European country.
 Nevertheless, the Maltese broadly trust European and international institutions, with the notable exception of NATO, which is distrusted by two-thirds of Maltese. Only the Cypriots and Greeks are more sceptical of NATO than the Maltese, the survey finds.
 The number of people who trust the written press has risen by 12 percentage points since the Spring, although just over half (51%) still say they tend not to trust the written word.
 Overall, trust in Malta's written press remains the lowest in Europe, 20 percentage points lower than the EU average. 
 Other forms of media fare little better. Trust in TV and radio also register scores far below most other European countries.
 
 The survey suggests that trust in the media is tainted by what people perceive as political influence.
 Fewer than a quarter (23%) say that Malta’s public service media is free from political influences, while less than a third say that the media provides information free of political or commercial pressure, both amongst the lowest ratios in Europe
 While trust in traditional media remains relatively low, even fewer say they trust websites (38%) or social media (21%), with over two-thirds saying that information about politics gleaned from social media should not be trusted.
 Four in every five say they frequently come across news that is misleading or outright false, far above the EU average of 70%, with a similar number saying that fake news is a problem in Malta.

 He was replying to a question by Nationalist MP Darren Carabott. 
 Between September 2023 and the end of August 2024, 433 reports were made to the police, of which 207 involved excessive noise in Valletta.
 In 2022  the government controversially amended the law to allow music to be played outdoors in Valletta until 1am, raising a storm of protest from residents.
 The figures tabled by the minister show that after Valletta, the highest number of reports about excessive noise were filed in Hamrun and St Paul's Bay, with 20 each, 16 in Sliema and 13 in St Julian's. 
 Sixty reports were filed in the whole of Gozo.
 Giving some details by district, the minister said 84 people were arraigned in the wake of the reports in Valletta, Floriana and PIeta. All are ongoing.
 Most of the prosecutions in the other districts are also ongoing, but in one case, involving St Paul's Bay, one person was fined €100 and sentenced to a month in prison suspended for a year. A fine was imposed for one case in St Julian's.

Il-Kollettiv: PL/PN duopoly are at a crossroads,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/ilkollettiv-plpn-duopoly-crossroads.1093752,06-10-2024,002418.png,"Malta's main political parties must choose between serving the people or powerful lobbies, civil society group il-Kollettiv said on Monday. 
 In an analysis of the European Parliament election results, the group said that the verdict shows that large swathes of the country feel that the Labour government's policies aren't working for them. 
 ""The detachment between political power and everyday life is reflected in the way in which the party has lost most of its support,"" they said. 
 Since the last election, they continued, the Government’s policy has been to distribute public resources – including land, the coast, and taxpayers’ money – to lobbies and individuals with private interests.
 This has led to the consequence of the loss of open spaces, the constant threat of construction and the lack of law enforcement across the board to be felt directly by local communities. 
 This situation has put not only the Government but also the Opposition at a crossroads. 
 ""The differences in economic policy between the two major parties are negligible and as long as these will remain servile to the interests of big business, particularly the construction lobby, the public’s disenchantment with these two monoliths will continue to increase,"" the group said in a statement. 
 ""In short, PLPN have to make a choice between serving its electors and serving lobbies.""
 Overall, il-Kollettiv said that it was disappointed to see a lack of European issues discussed during an EU election, while other important issues such as the cost of living and workers' rights are being sidelined. 
 They named Arnold Cassola as the ""moral victor"" of the election, interpreting his first-count votes are proof of the need for ""a credible force that can challenge the political duopoly with concrete proposals and clear policies"".
 ""Il-Kollettiv believes the electorate has had enough of the mediocrity that has been allowed to fester on our parliamentary benches throughout the last years and is looking for trustworthy people to govern it,"" they said.
 ""It is high time for an electoral reform that respects the wishes of those who do not want to be part of the political duopoly, which is suffocating public quality of life, and also the opportunity for change.""

PN MPs walk out of parliament as speaker rejects request to discuss inquiry,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/pn-mps-walk-parliament-speaker-rejects-request-discuss-inquiry.1092031,05-06-2024,002443.png,"Parliament descended into chaos on Monday afternoon after Bernard Grech’s request to discuss “the urgent need” for the Vitals magisterial to be discussed was turned down, prompting PN MPs to walk out.
 The session was temporarily suspended after opposition leader Bernard Grech called for the House to discuss “the urgent need for the inquiry to be published”.
 After a 45-minute delay, the speaker returned with his ruling.
 Since criminal proceedings are underway and developments are still taking place, discussing the inquiry in parliament could prejudice people’s right to a fair hearing, he said, turning down Grech's request.
 This was the same way that previous speakers had decided in similar cases, he said, he was quick to add, hoping to pre-empt criticism of his decision.
 “You haven’t understood my request at all,” an incensed Grech replied.
 “I don’t want to discuss the contents of the inquiry, I want to discuss the people’s right to have access to it.""
 The speaker’s ruling prompted Grech to order his fellow PN MPs out of the chamber, accusing the government and the speaker of trying to silence parliament.
 The session was stormy from the start, with MPs from both sides openly hurling accusations at one another.
 Grech said Abela’s public comments in recent days showed he had access to the inquiry and was selectively giving access to the report to certain individuals in his inner circle, while attacking magistrate Gabriella Vella.
 This, Grech said, meant that the inquiry’s publication was “a matter of urgent public information”.
 Abela was quick to reply, saying that Grech’s request was evidence that for the PN the inquiry was simply a partisan, point-scoring exercise.
 Denying that he had a copy of the inquiry, Abela argued that he was the first to call for it to be published, even before Grech.
 But he said that it is not parliament’s role to discuss whether or not it should be published, as that is a matter for the AG to decide, in line with the law.
 “You are saying that the House should cast aside its responsibilities and take on those of the AG. The House is the organ that legislates, it cannot take part in an exercise that goes against the laws that it itself creates,” he said.
 “Now that the establishment has spoken, it confirmed that parliament doesn’t have the right to discuss anything, but the establishment has the right to have the inquiry and decide on its own steam”, Grech retorted, mocking Abela’s recent accusations of a shadowy establishment.
 Amidst the debate, several government and opposition MPs could be heard yelling at one another from across the room. One particularly noticeable objector was former PN leader Adrian Delia, prompting Abela to address him directly.
 “If you want to know who the establishment is, I would ask Dr Delia who it was that removed him from PN leader and placed Bernard Grech instead”, Abela said.
 Delia came out fighting. “The establishment are those who stole three hospitals, who stole the health of the Maltese,” he exclaimed.

 In a press statement signed by shadow minister for Health Adrian Delia and shadow minister for social policy Stephen Spiteri, the party said by extending this service, cancer patients will waste less time in traffic travelling to the hospital, reduce stress and lower the burden on the oncology hospital. 
 “If the government wants to be credible when it says it is striving for a high-quality country, it must take more decisions to alleviate burdens on the most vulnerable and provide patients with the services they deserve without forcing them to beg for them,” the statement read.
 The party said it had previously called for cancer patients to no longer be “humiliated” by having to request cancer medication through the Malta Community Chest Fund, but to receive them through the national health service. 
 The statement noted PN leader Bernard Grech had raised this topic during his Budget 2025 speech in parliament. 
 “Now, shortly after this speech, the Minister of Health has finally announced that discussions are underway for the government to take responsibility for funding cancer medicines instead of the MCCF,” the statement read. 
 The party also suggested it would be better that a single entity purchases these medicines to benefit from more advantageous prices.

Pedestrianisation should be prioritised in Malta's town squares - ADPD,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/pedestrianisation-prioritised-malta-town-squares-adpd.1098396,21-09-2024,002477.png,"Pedestrianisation should be prioritised in Malta's village and town squares, with their primary use being for the enjoyment of the public, ADPD said on Saturday. 
 In a press conference in Mosta on Saturday morning, ADPD general secretary Ralph Cassar said that the way the saga of the Mosta Square has unfolded exposed both the council and the central government of lacking the vision for pedestrianisation as a positive goal for the locality. 
 “The government still does not have a clear policy that gives priority to pedestrianisation and invents policy according to the necessities of the political rivalry between the PN and the PL, a form of rivalry that Mosta is now well known for,"" Cassar said. 
 The PN leadership of the Mosta council shows it does not believe that the locality deserves to have a ""real"" square, he continued. 
 ""It shows that they are not serious, that they lack vision and that they are quick to abandon the goals of people-friendly spaces, giving in to the loudest ill-informed naysayers.""
 Pedestrianising the square would present countless benefits for its users, Cassar said, and promote an outdoor space that can be used by all. Aside from reducing traffic, the move will also serve to bolster local businesses. 
 ADPD chair Sandra Gauci said that those who are against pedestrianising the square are opposing ""true progress""
 She said it was facetious to argue that people were not making use of the square when it was closed to traffic, but irrespective of that, decreasing traffic in the heart of Mosta, should in and of itself be considered a good thing. 
 ""As if there needs to be crowds for something to be good.  The pedestrianization of Pjazza Rotunda should become permanent. This is what Mosta deserves,"" she said. 
 Mosta's councillors should stop playing parochial politics, as their opposition to pedestrianisation is showing them up for people who would rather a national monument like the Rotunda serve as a roundabout than build a healthy urban environment, she said. 
 ""We want the Mosta square, Pjazza Rotunda, to truly become a square for people and not just at the weekend,"" she said. 
 ""A square through which traffic passes is not a square at all but just a road like any other road.""
 Gauci added that the central government should have been clear about the conditions under which funding was given to the project and insisted that the Rotunda area should have been given back to the community. 
 ""The government must be clear about what it wants for the whole country with regards to urban planning policy, sustainable mobility and pedestrianisation,"" she said.
 ""If the government is convinced that pedestrianisation is good for people's health, it should have the courage to take the necessary decisions – including proper funding - for pedestrianisation projects throughout the country.""

 In each case, the minister replied that each of those projects was part of the government’s plan to invest an unprecedented €700 million over seven years to improve road infrastructure. Infrastructure Malta, he said, continues to carry out one project after another to prepare Malta for the future; projects that pre-2013 governments did not have the will or vision to carry out.”

 He was among MEP candidates who went head-to-head on Thursday in a debate held by the Kunsill Studenti Universitarji (KSU).
 Two candidates were representing the Labour and Nationalist parties at the debate, with the others being independent candidates, ADPD and ABBA. 
 Questioned about his position on European defence, Grech Mintoff said Malta’s role in Partnership for Peace was a “betrayal” of Malta’s neutrality, but throughout his intervention, he complained that small parties and independent candidates are not being treated fairly by the debate organisers. 
 He said small parties and independent candidates were initially given far less time in the debate, and it is only because of their insistence that the debate format changed for each participant to have five minutes each. 
 Still, the imbalance of more members from the PL and PN was unfair, he said, before proceeding to walk to centre stage and smashing an egg on the ground, to giggles from the crowd and debaters. 
 He made his way out of the side door of Sir Temi Zammit Hall, claiming that the KSU was ""PL and PN"".
 His reaction elicited an immediate comment from independent candidate and comedian James Ryder Muscat who said: “If I am elected I will not let Grech Mintoff anywhere near a chicken.”

 The Malta Employers’ Association said in a statement collective bargaining negotiations for public sector employees should not be held closer than three months before an election.
 It claimed that while on the one hand, the party in government would be in a much weaker bargaining position to negotiate when in election mode, on the other hand, it could also use the outcome for pre-election propaganda.
 Talks on the new collective agreement have been ongoing since December 2022.
 Last year, Malta Union of Teachers head Marco Bonnici accused the government of having failed to keep its electoral promise to substantially improve the working conditions of educators. 
 In November the union issued a set of directives to teachers and educators in all Church and state schools, culminating in a  one-day strike. 
 Talks resumed and were proceeding well until recently, with Times of Malta reporting that educators could once again resort to industrial action after  discussions collapsed.
 On Friday, the MUT issued a one-week ultimatum before calling out the Education Minister for  lying about wage increases promised to teachers.
 In a statement on Saturday, the Malta Union of Teachers said Clifton Grima’s talk about teachers getting a €10,000 raise and new teachers starting on a €36,000 salary “are nowhere to be found in government's financial proposals to MUT”.
 The MEA is now warning that while it believes educators deserve adequate remuneration for their critical services, ""it would be in the interest of both sides of the table to conduct negotiations with cool heads"".
 The period during an electoral campaign was ""definitely not an ideal setting"" for the union and the government to arrive at an equitable solution, it said.""Collective bargaining should never be weaponised by either unions or government, as this could have a long-term destabilising effect on the labour market.""

 Abela has heaped scorn on the inquiry and the magistrate who led it, saying it is biased and that sections of the judiciary are part of an ""establishment"" that is out to destroy the Labour Party. 
 When asked by Times of Malta  last week whether he would report the magistrate to the Commission for the Administration of Justice, he had instead said it was now up to the electorate to scrutinise the judiciary
 His comments have earned him a rebuke from various quarters.
 NGOs have described his statements as ""authoritarian"" and a ""threat to democracy"". Students gathered on Tuesday evening in solidarity with the judiciary. And on Wednesday morning,  a former chief justice offered the magistrate being targeted, Gabriella Vella, his solidarity. 
 On Wednesday, President Spiteri Debono spoke up.
 She urged for prudence ""in the choice of words spoken"", adding that emotions ""should not rule our heads"". Such behaviour only served to cloud the reasoning faculties, she added.
 ""The exercise of prudence is of utmost importance,"" the president said.
 ""Our laws provide remedies in those cases where individuals feel subjected to prejudice. This also includes instances where individuals consider they have been discriminated against, and deprived of their legitimate rights.""
 Spiteri Debono added there were legal remedies in cases when the legal processes were in some way vitiated - a message that could be interpreted as a rebuke to Abela's repeated, public criticism of the way the inquiry and prosecutions were handled.  
 ""The present situations essentially require that all institutions, but particularly the courts and the judiciary, can exercise their functions in a serene atmosphere,"" she said.

 Independent MEP candidate Arnold Cassola said banners he had installed in Mġarr, Gozo and Xewkija both vanished between Friday and Saturday. 
 Banners promoting Nationalist Party MEP candidate Peter Agius in Marsascala and Xemxija also mysteriously disappeared, Agius said separately. 
 Cassola said that he had filed a police report in Victoria about the banners' removal.
 “Apart from revealing that certain cowards still exist in our country, this episode fills me with great courage,” Cassola said in a statement.  
 “There are those who are in strong fear that, on June 8 next, the 58-year PNPL duopoly is going to implode and a third Maltese voice is going to enter the European Parliament for the first time.”
 The two banners were hung in Mġarr and Xewkija and encouraged voters to “cast a vote for integrity” by voting for Cassola. 
 In a police report he filed on Saturday evening, Cassola told Victoria police that he knew the banners were still in place on Friday. He encouraged officers to use footage from CCTV cameras in their vicinity to identify the culprits. 
 Cassola told Times of Malta that a fellow MEP candidate alerted him to the banners' sudden disappearance.
 He discovered that his banners were missing shortly after Peter Agius reported the disappearance of his own banners. 
  ""These banners were installed legally and are an important way for us to be able to reach voters, given that PBS is controlled by the Labour Party and the government is dishing out cheques on the eve of an election,"" Agius wrote. 
 ""I will not be intimidated by vandals and will continue to work day and night to be there for you."" 
 Cassola, an academic and activist who has been involved in local politics for decades, is campaigning on a platform focused on environmental issues, good governance and social justice.
 Among the 39 candidates running for MEP in the June 8 elections, he is the most experienced, having contested every MEP election in Maltese history.
 In 2004 – Malta’s first-ever MEP elections – Cassola won almost 25,000 votes, representing Alternattiva Demokratika. He would go on to contest two more MEP elections as an AD candidate before quitting the party and running as an independent in 2019. 
 Agius, who is a lawyer by profession, served as head of the European Parliament office in Malta and then within the secretariat of then-EP president Antonio Tajani.
 He first ran for an MEP seat in 2019. Polls suggest he is well-placed to obtain a seat in the June 8 elections.

 This prompted independent politician Arnold Cassola to request the investigation on suspicion that there could have been nepotism and abuse of power in allowing this wedding reception to take place at a historic venue. 
 However, in a statement, Dimech insisted that the venue was booked for her daughter's wedding through established protocol and no special exception was made for their wedding to be hosted at the location. 
  ""We followed the established procedure and made the booking via the online form on 7 September 2023. This booking facility was available for everybody,"" she said. 
 ""In fact we are aware that two, if not three, other bookings for weddings were made, all prior to the publication of the Legal Notice covering the use of Ċittadella for weddings against a fee. It is also evident that the Cittadella has been regularly used for innumerable events over several years.""
 Dimech also said that the €5,000 fee was paid via bank transfer and there are records of both the the booking form and the banking transaction. 
 ""Any assertions and claims that we did not make a booking and did not pay the fee for the use of Ċittadella as a wedding venue are completely false.  Furthermore, we followed the procedure available to any interested parties.""

 Rule of law NGO Repubblika, independent candidate Arnold Cassola and 16 student organisations have also said publically that Camilleri should resign over the scandal. 
  Calls for his removal, however, did not appear to dampen his supporters, who turned up for a rally in Mġarr, Gozo on Saturday. 
 Camilleri published footage and pictures of the event where he was photographed hugging young children and the elderly as well as posing for selfies with other supporters. 
 MEPs Alex Agius Saliba and Thomas Bajada - who is also from Gozo - were both in attendance at the rally, with Agius Saliba appearing to speak on the podium during the event. 
 Addressing his followers the day after, Camilleri said that a ""thank you"" would not be enough to express his appreciation for the ""hundreds"" who attended the Christmas-themed gathering. 
 ""I am honoured by your support my friends,"" he said in a Facebook post. 
 ""Your strong and continuous support gives me greater strength and determination to continue working for our Gozo and our country.""

ABBA goes to court to demand its right to throw eggs,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/abba-goes-court-demand-right-throw-eggs.1093004,20-06-2024,002341.png,"Ivan Grech Mintoff, leader of the right-wing ABBA political party, has called on the Broadcasting Authority to apologise for stopping him from taking half a dozen eggs into a television studio last week, and to allow him to protest at the BA offices instead.
 Grech Mintoff, who is a candidate in the June 8 MEP elections, was stopped from entering the studio by Broadcasting Authority CEO Joanna Spiteri.
 Spiteri told him he was not allowed to bring the eggs into the area, where the debate was being recorded. Grech Mintoff was due to take part in that debate. 
 ""I need these eggs to protest,” Grech Mintoff had replied.
 In a judicial protest filed on Friday, Grech Mintoff said that his right to peaceful protest had been violated by that refusal.
 Grech Mintoff hit the headlines when he threw eggs in front of the prime minister during Labour's March 31 commemoration in Vittoriosa, protesting that Malta's neutrality was being undermined.
 He repeated that stunt earlier this month, when he hurled an egg on stage and stormed out of a university debate, in protest over speaking time.
 In his judicial protest, Grech Mintoff called on the BA to publicly apologise for not allowing him to protest.
 He also called for the regulator to instead allow him to protest with his eggs at the BA’s headquarters in Ħamrun.
 The protest was signed by lawyer Carmel Gatt.

"As it happened: Accusations, walkouts, drama as Vitals fallout intensifies",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/live-blog-abela-speak-vitals-inquiry-leads-criminal-charges.1092026,21-06-2024,"002355.png,002356.png,002357.png","Prosecutors filed criminal charges against Malta’s former prime minister Joseph Muscat and others on Monday, as Prime Minister Robert Abela emphasised that everyone implicated is innocent until proven guilty. 
 Abela said he was aware that criminal charges had been filed in court in connection with an inquiry into a deal to privatise three state hospitals, and questioned the way Muscat and other suspects had been treated. 
 He shot down talk of calling a general election, saying that was what the ""establishment"" wanted. The prime minister also said it was too early to consider the resignations of Chris Fearne, Edward Scicluna or other public officials implicated by the probe. 
 In a frenzied political afternoon, Nationalist MPs marched out of parliament and Muscat  came out swinging, saying it was an ""abomination"" that investigators had not questioned him before pressing charges. 
 Those who did that, and those who did nothing to stop it, would be judged harshly by the people and history, Muscat said.    
 And meanwhile, thousands of kilometres away, Steward Health Care - the company that took over the hospitals deal from original concessionaires Vitals Global Healthcare - filed for bankruptcy in the US. 
 Follow events with our live blog. Refresh the page for the latest updates.
 7.45pm It's been short but intense, and now it must end. We'll be wrapping up this live blog here, though of course many questions remain unanswered. What, specifically, are Muscat and others charged with? When will they appear in court? What did the inquiry find? 
 We'll be working to answer those questions, and many more, in the days and weeks to come. 
 In the meantime, here's our coverage of today's key events: 
 7.35pm Meanwhile, Labour firebrand Manuel Cuschieri has once again come out in full defence of Muscat, echoing Jason Micallef’s view that this ""lie"" is even bigger than the one about (secret company) Egrant.
 But Cuschieri went one further: he wants Muscat supporters to physically gather outside court in support when the former prime minister and others are called to court. ""We need to unite to show what we really mean... We need to protest against this political vendetta.""
 7.32pm Bernard Grech described the Vitals deal as a “deal with the devil” and said Robert Abela appears enslaved to it. 
 He warned Abela: “if you want to remain gripped to Muscat, if you continue attacking the judiciary, attacking 20 student organisations, attacking journalists posing questions and the Maltese people, it means you are so weak you are choosing a pact with the devil, and money, over the health of the Maltese and democracy”.
 “Let go of Muscat and for once choose the national good.”
 The PN leader said the longer the inquiry is withheld from the public the more damage to the country. 
 Grech said Abela was a slave to the crimes of the past, as millions were stolen from the Maltese. 
 7.11pm In his press conference, Abela told reporters they should “ask Adrian Delia” who the “establishment” is. 
 Delia was PN leader for three turbulent years during which the party was racked by infighting. 
 Speaking in Żebbuġ, Delia pushed back against the PM’s suggestion. “I’ll tell you who the establishment was in the past 10 years: Muscat, Schembri, Cardona, Scicluna, Fearne, Abela and the Muscat cabinet were the establishment,” he said. 
  7.05pm Jason Micallef, who chairs Labour media arm ONE and also leads the Valletta Cultural Agency and Ta’ Qali National Park, says Muscat is facing a “vendetta” that’s “twice as bad as the Egrant lie”. 
 The same people who fuelled those claims are at it again, Micallef says, and just as the Egrant claims ended up in nothing, the same will happen here too. 
 “The way this lie was presented, the way inquiry conclusions were leaked on social media, the way the inquiry was timed, make this lie twice as bad as Egrant,” he says. 
  6.56pm PN MP and former party leader Adrian Delia is addressing a PN rally in Żebbuġ. It was Delia who filed the civil suit that led to the hospitals deal being struck off by a court.  
 We expect party leader Bernard Grech to speak at the event, too. 
 Watch it in the video below.
  6.55pm PN MEP David Casa takes a dig at the prime minister's rhetoric about the 'establishment': 
 ""According to the PM, the establishment is me, Roberta Metsola, the opposition, the independent journalists, the church, civil society, the judiciary, the students... Everyone's the establishment, bar the criminals. This prime minister has lost it and he's dangerous.""
  6.43pm Academic and political commentator George Vital Zammit believes Muscat's post earlier this afternoon is an incitement to violence.
 In a Facebook post, Zammit said Abela has a duty to ensure law and order, or else the incitement is going to boil over, just as it did when Donald Trump's supporters broke into the Capitol.
 
 We made a similar point in an editorial last Sunday, Vital Zammit notes. 
 6.32pm When it became known that the magisterial inquiry was concluded, Abela focused his criticism on its timing. The magistrate, he said, intentionally sent it to the attorney general right at the time when nominations for MEP candidates opened. 
 Abela is still making that argument, but in the past days - and this afternoon - the bulk of his criticism has focused on more specific points. 
 He suggested that some of those prosecuted are not really cited in the bulk of the inquiry, and said the only crime of others seems to have been the fact that they worked under Labour. 
 Court experts were paid too much, he has argued. Those prosecuted were not given the chance to testify. And, Abela says, voters will make up their minds about how the inquiry was carried out once they've seen it. 
 It's an interesting shift in tone and focus. 
 6.25pm Prime Minister Robert Abela has concluded a press conference. 
 In a nutshell, Abela: 
 If you missed the event and have 90 minutes to spare, you can watch it in the video right below. 
  6.17pm The judiciary must be able to do their work without being targeted, intimidated and threatened as the Prime Minister has done, European Parliament president Roberta Metsola said in a social media post.
 In a choice between protecting his partisan interests and safeguarding the reputation and stability of the country, the Prime Minister must learn to put the country first, Metsola said.
  “This is not a time of tribalism, of false divisions or petty partisanship. Neither is it the time for triumphalism. Now is the time of sober, calm, leadership. Now is the time for justice. It is time for a prime minister to carry the responsibility of his post and not allow his blind panic to drag the country down with him.”
 6.15pm Abela sacked Konrad Mizzi before he was found guilty by a criminal court, a journalist notes. Why adopt a different line now, he is asked. 
 Abela doesn’t reply, and instead says the media is treating Muscat as guilty before he has been heard. 
 He then takes a swipe at the magisterial inquiry’s €11m cost. Was that expense justified, he asks, or did foreign court experts take the country for a ride? 
 A few days ago, the justice minister says the probe cost €10 million.
 6.05pm Abela shoots down suggestions that he will call a general election. He tells the reporter who asked the question that he was encouraged to ask the question by “the establishment”.
 “It has its tentacles everywhere in the country and uses its methods to get its way. Come June 8, the people have to decide if they want the establishment in Europe.”
 6pm Robert Abela shoots down talk of Joseph Muscat having had €30 million in assets frozen. 
 “If an attachment order involving dozens of people leads to €30m being frozen, it does not mean that they each got that amount. Some might have pocketed nothing at all. Let’s not peddle disinformation,” he says.
 5.58pm Abela makes a pitch to voters, saying their June 8 vote will be a vote in favour or against this magisterial inquiry.
 Voters will need to decide if the timing of the inquiry was a coincidence, and how the inquiry treated each of the individuals cited. 
 “They will need to decide if the decisions made were draconian and against people who were loyal to the state,” he says. 
 5.54pm Abela is still speaking.
 Meanwhile, Parliament is back underway after a 45-minute delay for the speaker to think about Grech’s request for the House to discuss the need to publish the magisterial inquiry.
 The speaker disagrees. 
 Any discussion about the matter in parliament could prejudice criminal proceedings, Anglu Farrugia says, quoting from a similar ruling that he gave back in June 2020 about a motion at the time of the Daphne Caruana Galizia inquiry.
 “You haven’t understood my request at all,” Grech says. “I don’t want to discuss the content of the inquiry, I want to discuss the people’s right to have access to it”.
 With that, Grech and his fellow PN MPs walked out of parliament, boycotting the session.
 5.51pm Abela reiterates that nobody facing criminal charges and in public office will be suspended at this stage.
 “I will need to read the entire proces verbal [inquiry] before making that call,” he says.
 5.46pm Abela’s is asked – twice, by two separate journalists -  if he has read the inquiry. 
 He says he “does not have a copy” of it.  He however confirms that he was informed that criminal charges were filed against people involved today.
 Abela then goes on for a while about his concerns that the inquiry plucked people’s names out of thin air when recommending prosecutions. That’s quite a specific allegation to make if he has not read the inquiry. 
 5.41pm Abela implies that we should expect a constitutional challenge to this magisterial inquiry [presumably by Muscat]. 
 “We’ll see how this inquiry was carried out… everyone will make their own minds up about the individuals involved, but also on the magisterial inquiry,” he says. 
 “And if it turns out someone’s rights were breached by the way it was carried out, then of course history will judge that.” 
 5.39pm Abela says he does not believe  Muscat’s fiery post was a veiled attack on him. “The way I read it, Dr Muscat was saying that an inquiry that lasted five years was concluded right as nominations for the MEP elections opened,” he says. 
 5.34pm Muscat will not be kicked out of the Labour Party, Abela says. 
 “Does the presumption of innocence not apply to him, just because he’s a former PM?” Abela says, before once again implying that the inquiry departed from the premise that certain people were guilty a priori. 
  5.31pm Abela says he does not have a copy of the inquiry’s  proces verbal – something that the  PN believes is evidently untrue.  
 The PM says he will take a decision about Chris Fearne’s political fate [he is Malta’s nominee to the European Commission] once he sees the report and can see on what basis he [Fearne] has been implicated by the inquiry.
 The same goes for Edward Scicluna, he says. 
 5.27pm Abela makes a brief allusion to Muscat’s complaint about not being questioned before being charged, without ever mentioning him by name. 
 He asks, somewhat rhetorically, if it is right for people to face criminal charges without being given the opportunity to defend themselves first. 
 5.25pm Abela says “loyal servants of the state” are also reputed to be among those charged. That would be an injustice and one that the courts will have to remedy, he says.
 That is believed to be an allusion to former civil servants likely to be arraigned. 
 5.20pm Abela emphasises that a magisterial inquiry is not a criminal court and that its recommendations are not tantamount to guilt or innocence.
 He implies, however, that the magisterial inquiry “departed from a position of presumption of guilt.” 
 Abela again repeats his suspicions about the inquiry's timing, saying he had first spoken out about it last January after getting ""clear information"" that the probe was being timed to coincide with the MEP elections.
 5.15pm Robert Abela will soon give a public statement from the Auberge de Castille. Watch it in the video below.
  5.10pm Meanwhile, Net News are alleging that a freezing order of Muscat’s assets runs up to an eye-watering €30 million. We have not been able to verify that, so we cannot say whether or not the figure is correct.
 Legal sources tell us it’s highly unlikely for a specific amount of assets to have been identified at this early stage, before suspects have even been arraigned. 
 5.02pm We're still waiting for Abela to speak. Meanwhile, you can read  what Joseph Muscat had to say about the afternoon's events. Apart from lashing out at prosecutors, he also took aim at ""those who washed their hands of trying to fix this injustice"". 
 We've spoken to several Labour insiders, and they all - unanimously - told us they think that's a direct swipe at Robert Abela. 
 Lawyer and former MP Franco Debono thinks so, too. 
 ""Could it be that [Muscat] is suggesting that Abela is using the magistrate as scapegoat?"" Debono mused on Facebook, referring to Abela's weeks-long criticism of the magistrate who led the inquiry leading to criminal prosecutions.
  4.52pm A stormy parliament session is suspended while the speaker decides on Bernard Grech’s request for parliament to discuss the “urgent need” for the magisterial inquiry to be published, doubling down on his claim that  Abela has a copy of the inquiry and is cherry-picking who to give it to. 
 Abela retorted that Grech’s request shows that “there is now no doubt that for PN the inquiry is nothing but a point-scoring partisan exercise”. Abela is arguing that he was the first to call for the inquiry to be published, but that Grech’s call for parliament to discuss its publication is a distortion of parliament’s role.
 4.45pm Welcome to this live blog: we'll be giving you running updates of political developments this evening.
 We're not sure what to expect, but we know for a fact that the prime minister will be giving a press statement at 5pm.

"Bernard Grech: We made big strides, but you won't see that on TVM",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/bernard-grech-we-made-big-strides-wont-see-tvm.1093999,15-06-2024,002380.png,"Bernard Grech has highlighted the Nationalist Party’s gains in local council elections while slamming public broadcaster PBS for going out of its way to not report the swing in votes.
 The PN lost local council elections to the Labour Party but dramatically reduced what was a record deficit, clawing back 20 new councillor seats and 27,000 votes when compared to 2019.
 It now has a majority in 24 councils, having flipped six councils its way and losing one to Labour, Grech said.
 It also obtained a majority of votes in Birkirkara and Mellieħa, but was tied with Labour for seats. Elected independent candidates hold the key to control in both those localities.
  Speaking at a press conference on Saturday and with PN councillors seated behind him, Grech gave various statistics illustrating the way in which the party had made up lost ground and said the PN was ready to govern.
 “But none of this detail has featured on the national TV station,” he said. “TVM, which works using your taxes, does not report any of this.”
 TVM provided live coverage from the counting hall but its website only reported the final outcome of each locality’s election, with little context.
 Grech used the press conference to make a pitch to voters and talk up the PN’s electoral prospects.
 “Some people were discouraged by the big gap [between parties] but now have more faith,” he said. “The PN I lead will continue to be an open party welcoming all. Let us work together, the country awaits us.”
  Grech said that the party’s focus would continue to be on individuals’ wellbeing and quality of life, and reiterated his party’s call for carrying capacity studies to be carried out across the country.
 “We want to know how each locality can grow and thrive. We are in favour of progress, but not at your expense,” he said.
 Grech also shot down any suggestion that local council elections should be depoliticised and only feature independent candidates.
 “We must respect people’s vote,” he said. “In localities where PN got, say, 48% of the vote, let us not say that someone who got a small percentage should govern.”

Ġbejna tan-nagħaġ is on the verge of getting EU protection status,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/gbejna-tannaghag-verge-getting-eu-protection-status.1097752,09-10-2024,002443.png,"Malta’s traditional sheep cheese, the ġbejna tan-nagħaġ, is on the brink of being awarded special status as ‘Protected Designation of Origin’ by the European Commission.  
 An application to protect the heritage of the cheese rounds was submitted around two years ago and has now reached the final stage of approval.
 Other EU member states have three months to review it and lodge any objections to recognising the cheese as a form of national heritage that deserves to be protected.
 A spokesperson for Xirka Produtturi Nagħaġ u Mogħoż, the association representing local sheep and goat herders, said he was “thrilled” with the development. 
 “It took us 13 years of battling to get here,” he said.
 The application details strict criteria for ġbejna tan-nagħaġ production, from the size and weight of the cheese to the sheep’s diet and packaging methods.
 According to the application, the product is a fresh cheese produced with whole raw milk from sheep of the ‘Maltese’ breed and its crosses with the Friesian breed or others, and that are registered in the Maltese islands, including Malta, Gozo, and Comino.
 If approved, ġbejna tan-nagħaġ would be Malta’s first protected food heritage product, earning the prestigious PDO label. 
 The PDO status identifies products that are produced, processed and prepared in a specific geographical area. It safeguards regional foods from mass-produced imitations and ensures quality standards.  
 Examples of other products that have protected status in the EU include Parmigiano Reggiano cheese, Parma ham, Champagne and feta cheese.
 “The benefits of the PDO for us would be that smaller genuine producers will be able to access an open market,” added the spokesperson.
 Looking ahead, it already has another goal in sight, to push for the protection of ġbejna tal-mogħoż (goat cheese) as Malta’s next heritage product.
 
 Initially, the application included both, but just before it was sent off it was controversially revised to focus solely on sheep cheese.  
 This means cheese made from cows’ milk, ġbejna tal-baqar, such as those made by Benna, or ġbejna made with additives, modern drying and curing methods, and even powdered milk, will be able to use the term ‘ġbejna’ but would not be protected. 
 The agricultural NGO, the Maya Foundation, was among those who objected to the change at the time saying that “at face value the current submission might seem that it is protecting the product, but in the long term it will actually harm it”.

NGO launches petition to have smaller parties represented in parliament,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/ngo-launches-petition-smaller-parties-represented-parliament.1094128,19-06-2024,002465.png,"Civil society NGO il-Kollettiv is petitioning parliament to reform the electoral system, because it says the current one leaves voters who did not choose big parties unrepresented in parliament. 
 The group is circulating a petition - signed by former Labour MEP Cyrus Engerer - calling for the immediate opening of a consultation process on this matter and to see reform carried out within this legislature. 
 “Through this petition, Il-Kollettiv seeks to give representation to the 143,028 voters who chose to vote for independent and smaller parties – or to abstain – in the last European Parliament elections held on June 8. These amount to 38.6% of the electorate; out of these, 12.7% voted for independent or smaller candidates,” the group said in a statement. 
 “This confirms how the Maltese voter’s profile is changing as time goes by, and how there are shifts in opinion from one election to the other.”
 However, these shifts in opinion, they said, are being ignored because the current system requires candidates to capture 16.7% of the district vote to be elected.
 “A democracy is only strong when it represents the smaller voices, and not only at election time. An analysis of the votes achieved by the independent and smaller parties will show that, at 12.7%, it will equate to 10 of the 79 seats in national Parliament. In reality, however, the present system works in favour of the two big parties, and this means that no independent or third party will ever be elected,” the group said. 
 “At every election, various representatives of the two major parties insist that voting for a smaller party is equal to wasting your vote. After 143,028 voters chose not to vote for either government or opposition parties, it’s high time that they are given a fair representation in our democracy. Through this petition, the public has the chance to show that it wants to be represented in the running of the country.”

 However, his dreams of becoming a musician were sidelined for decades as he prioritised his career and family.
 Now, thanks to the government's Qatt Mhu Tard initiative, Aquilina can finally pursue his lifelong passion.  Qatt Mhu Tard is derived from the Maltese ' qatt m'hu tard', which translates to 'it's never late'.
 Aquilina has been writing spiritual Christian music for years and has even organised karaoke nights in Maltese for other senior citizens.
 However, as he said, “the problem is you need to be a millionaire to publish a song,” indicating that financial constraints have always held him back despite having the time and talent.
 With the initiative's help, Aquilina can now produce 10 new songs which he is excited to share on his YouTube channel. 
 Aquilina pointed out that many older people engage in creative hobbies such as poetry and art, but their work often goes unnoticed. He urged people aged 65 and older to apply for the Qatt Mhu Tard initiative, reminding them of the famous Elvis song,  It’s Now or Never.
 The initiative was officially launched on Monday by Parliamentary Secretary for Active Ageing Malcolm Paul Agius Galea, who described it as an opportunity for seniors to fulfil their dreams.
 “We want to help you start your project today, whether through financial support or connecting you with the right people,” Agius Galea said.
 A total of €10,000 has been allocated to this voluntary initiative, with each applicant eligible for up to €1,000 in funding. Initially focusing on music-related projects like Aquilina’s, the initiative plans to expand to include drama, literature, and other creative endeavours.
 Interested applicants must be 65 or older and are encouraged to involve younger generations in their projects.
 Applications are open until September 15 at senior service centers in Malta and Gozo, online, or by calling 2278 8900.

 Die Welt, citing senior EU diplomats and European Commission insiders, said she is set to give Raffaele Fitto from the far-right Brothers of Italy party the executive vice-president portfolio in charge of the economy and post-pandemic recovery.
 
 The job would oversee how the bloc's pandemic recovery fund worth hundreds of billions of euros is deployed.
 Fitto is Rome's minister for European affairs.
 Others to be named EU vice presidents include Valdis Dombrovskis, from Latvia and currently EU's trade chief. His role will be EU expansion and Ukraine reconstruction, according to the report.
 France's Thierry Breton, the bloc's internal market commissioner, will take on industry and strategic autonomy according to Die Welt.
 Spain's Environment Minister Teresa Ribera has been chosen for a ""transition"" portfolio which will include ecology and digital affairs.
 The nominee for the EU's foreign policy chief, Estonia's outgoing leader Kaja Kallas, will also be named an executive vice president.
 Each European member state put forward nominees for von der Leyen's 26-person team.
 Slovakia's Maros Sefcovic, currently an executive vice president, is set to remain as a commissioner in charge of inter-institutional affairs.
 Czech Industry and Trade Minister Jozef Sikela will be in charge of energy, while Poland's ambassador to the EU, Piotr Serafin, will handle budgetary issues.
 After the Commission president names her line-up, the candidates undergo confirmation hearings in the European Parliament in September and October.

 But while some see the brief handed to Micallef as a sign of “total humiliation”, others say it is an improvement over outgoing Commissioner Helena Dalli’s equality “non-portfolio”.
 
 Micallef will be expected to coordinate and shape European Commission efforts to involve youth in EU decision-making, lead work on an EU-wide cyberbullying plan and contribute to an EU investigation into social media’s broader social impact.
 Among other things, he has been asked to focus on improving the working conditions of artists and cultural professionals, to find ways of making it easier for young people to visit cultural sites and to engage on a global level to promote EU-based sporting events.
 Aged 35, he is the youngest commissioner-designate on Ursula von der Leyen’s teamsheet and among the least experienced when it comes to frontline politics.
  Times of Malta spoke to six current and former EU officials about Micallef’s brief, unveiled by Commission President Ursula von der Leyen last week. All were granted anonymity to allow them to speak freely.
 None had a bad thing to say about Micallef or his competence. Many, however, had strong opinions about the way in which Malta is perceived at EU level.
 Malta’s waning power
 “This is a pure punishment and humiliation, we got the worst portfolio of all,” a European Commission official told Times of Malta. 
 “Malta used to get mid-level portfolios. Now we’ve received two zero portfolios in a row.”
 Another Commission official saw the glass as half-full.
 “It’s certainly more colourful than the previous non-portfolio,” the official confided, referring to the Equality portfolio that Malta’s outgoing commissioner Helena Dalli handled. 
 Both those officials – as well as others working within the EU’s complex maze of institutions, bodies and agencies – fear Malta’s EU-level power is on the decline.
 “Malta was asked again and again and again to reconsider its candidate,” a Commission official reflected. “We refused to do so, and so we have been banished.
 “It means we can exert no influence over legislative and policy design for the next five years, in the one place we hold 1/27th of the [EU] vote.”
 An EU insider with years of Brussels experience also said it seemed like Malta was moving down the pecking order.
 “It feels a bit like Malta has been put at the very back after our reputation became tainted. Maybe Malta’s government doesn’t care about the EU,” he reflected.
 Political horse-trading
 The value of a strong Commission portfolio lies in the proxy political power it grants member states, allowing them to horse-trade favours and push for their nationals to be placed in key, influential positions within other commissioners’ cabinets.
 Within Brussels circles, a Commissioner’s hard power is gauged by two key metrics: the amount of control he or she has over the Commission’s complex bureaucracy, and the extent to which a portfolio includes sectors subject to EU law and with a budgetary programme. 
  When measured by those two yardsticks, Micallef’s portfolio is effectively a weak one, EU insiders concurred.
 No part of his portfolio comes with legislation-making power, and if approved by MEPs, Micallef will report to Romania’s Commission nominee, executive vice-president Roxana Mînzatu, with only partial control of one of the Commission’s primary policy-making bodies, Directorate Generals (DGs).
 Malta’s first four EU commissioners – Joe Borg, John Dalli, Tonio Borg and Karmenu Vella – all had full DGs under their control.
  And while Micallef will have a decent budget for EU sports and culture programmes, it is nowhere near the mega-billions some other commissioners can count on.
 “A weak portfolio makes you almost negligible at the commissioner’s table,” a Commission official explained.
 “Micallef’s portfolio seems fitting for his stature, but there’s no denying it’s a weak one, in terms of Commission politics. Now a lot will depend on how effective his team will be at getting Maltese officials placed within other commissioners’ cabinets.”
 In the eyes of a former Commissioner’s head of cabinet, no amount of negotiation is going to make up for the handicap that Malta is starting off with. The next five years will be bleak, the former official predicts.
 “Malta will suffer a loss of influence [within Brussels]. Anything Malta does will be stonewalled. Any time Malta asks for comprehension from the Commission, it won’t get it.”
 “I suspect the Maltese government doesn’t understand how insulting Micallef’s nomination was,” the former top official said. “It was a real ‘up yours’ to the Commission. And we will pay a bitter price for it.”
  The insult had nothing to do with Micallef’s technical competence, the former official stressed.
 “His profile just does not match the role, and at this level, profile is everything.”
 Micallef’s low political profile – he has never had a public-facing role, having previously served as the prime minister’s chief of staff – was cited by many of those interviewed.
 “You don’t send a person with zero days in politics to do one of the most political jobs on the continent,” an experienced Commission official said. 
 “Nobody is doubting Micallef’s competence as a civil servant. The problem is he has no political experience, no political clout, and no relationships with politicians as peers.”
 A Maltese diplomat was more sanguine about Micallef’s prospects.
 “A high profile will carry you for the first few weeks, but if you’re not up to it you will collapse like a house of cards,” he said. “Everyone who meets him emerges pleasantly surprised. He is extremely competent and knows EU procedures inside-out, unlike political old hands,” the diplomat argued.
 The diplomat acknowledged that von der Leyen wanted Malta to nominate a female candidate, but insisted the country was not the only small member state to hold firm.
 “Cyprus, Luxembourg and Czechia all resisted pressure to swap nominees for women,” the diplomat noted.
 The EU insider who spoke to Times of Malta landed somewhere in between those two perspectives.
 “Micallef is a big unknown in Brussels,” the insider said. “I was surprised by his nomination. That said, if he performs well, he might get a second term, and by then he’ll be a familiar name in Brussels and in line for a meatier portfolio.”
 A bigger chunk of the pie
 There was one positive almost all observers agreed on: Micallef looks set to control a bigger chunk of the Commission’s political machinery than his predecessor.
  Helena Dalli’s equality portfolio gave her control of one directorate, which are subdivisions of directorates-general (DGs), and one unit, the smallest offices within the Commission system.
 Micallef’s portfolio gives him influence over most of DG-EAC, the directorate-general focused on education, arts and culture.
 “It’s streets ahead of Dalli’s role,” a Maltese diplomat said.
 A former Commission official agreed, saying Dalli was “completely invisible, both in Brussels and Malta”.
 “This is definitely an upgrade over the Equality portfolio,” he said. “Now for Micallef to have an impact, it’s important that his head of cabinet or deputy is an established Commission official with extensive procedural experience.”
 An MEP hurdle
 That’s assuming Micallef even makes it to his first day in office: Malta’s nominee could be a target when MEPs grill commissioner-designates. Political journalism organisation Politico cited Malta’s nominee as one of five commissioner-designates “most likely to get the chop”.
 A former Commission official who spoke to Times of Malta was even more downbeat about Micallef’s prospects.
 “I’m convinced MEPs will kill his nomination. They’ll want a scalp or two, and this will be an easy one,” he said.
 He was in a minority. Others had a more positive view.
 “Had von der Leyen given him a big portfolio he would have almost certainly been toppled by MEPs. As it is, perhaps they will close an eye: their focus will be on the big portfolios,” an EU insider noted.
 Another official, who works in the Commission, saw things in a similar light.
 “Von der Leyen gave him something that’s up his street. She didn’t want him to get killed in parliament. It might be uncomfortable for MEPs to kick out a young person just because he’s young and inexperienced.”
 And if Micallef doesn’t make it past the MEP hurdle, Malta could have a natural replacement lined up.
 “It’s no secret Owen Bonnici would be keen on the job,” a diplomat argued. “He has a decade of ministerial experience and has been culture minister for years. MEPs would find it hard to overlook that.”

"Media groups call on EU to suspend treaty, impose sanctions on Israel",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/media-groups-call-eu-suspend-treaty-impose-sanctions-israel.1097231,26-08-2024,002553.png,"The Daphne Caruana Galizia Foundation and the Institute of Maltese Journalists (IĠM) are among some 60 media and rights organisations urging the EU to suspend a cooperation accord with Israel and impose sanctions on the country’s military leadership. 
 In a joint letter to high-ranking European Commission (EC) officials on Monday morning, the organisations accused Isreal of the “unprecedented killing of journalists and other violations of media freedom”. 
 The group said that since Hamas’ attack on the country in October, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government had effectively created a “censorship regime”. 
 Calling the war in Gaza “the deadliest period for journalists” in decades, the organisations said more than 100 journalists had been killed since October amid reports of “torture and mistreatment” against others. 
 Drawing on a report from the New York-based press freedom organisation the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), the group said Israel had “targeted” journalists during its offensive in Gaza, calling such action a “war crime”. 
 Other journalists had been held without charge in retaliation for their work and forcibly disappeared, the media coalition said.  
 Meanwhile, the total ban on independent media accessing Gaza was “unprecedented in modern times,” it said.  
 “Journalists have been able to report from the frontlines in almost every major conflict over the past three decades: from Ukraine to Rwanda,” the group said.  
 “By comparison, despite the Israeli government press office issuing media credentials to approximately 2,800 international journalists to enter Israel... only select journalists have been allowed to enter the Gaza Strip — all under Israeli military escort and with restrictions on reporting.” 
 The letter sent Monday was addressed to EC High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell Fontelles and EC Executive Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis.
 Earlier this month, Al Jazeera condemned the killing of two of its journalists in an Israeli strike on Gaza, calling the deaths a ""cold-blooded assassination"" in a statement.
 And in May, Israel took the controversial decision to take the TV channel for the news outlet off-air in the country.
 In an interview with Times of Malta in July last year, before the start of the war in Gaza, Israel's ambassador to Malta Ze'ev Boker  rejected claims his country targeted journalists, saying no Western military force was ""as selective and distinctive as the IDF.""
 Israel's offensive in the region was sparked when Hamas militants crossed into the country in October, killing 1,200 people.
 More than 40,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, have been killed in Gaza since the start of the war, according to Palestinian health authorities.

 The court issued the order on Monday when it provisionally upheld a request for a warrant of prohibitory injunction following a PN protest.
 Party general secretary Michael Piccinino told a press conference that the PN was calling on the court to take action over the violation of its orders and to give a remedy to the PN. 
 He pointed out that in terms of the law, the broadcast of politically-partisan advertising was illegal unless it was part of a Broadcasting Authority scheme. 
 He said the authority itself had issued charges against PBS because of its broadcasting of a spot which broke the law. 
 Piccinino also reacted to Labour Party claims that through its actions, the PN wanted to send PBS employees to prison. 
 He said the PN did not ask for anybody to be sent to prison. It was the management of PBS which had broken the law, not the workers. And it would seem that for Labour, people could go about breaking the law as if nothing had happened, Piccinino said.
  Earlier, Culture Minister Owen Bonnici, who is responsible for public broadcasting, while accusing the PN of wanting to send workers to jail, said  the PN wanted to stop PBS broadcasting spots which had even been carried on its own Net TV.
 It was worrying, he said, that PN leader Bernard Grech did not want people to know what was in the Budget and his tactics were shameful.

Watch: Agius Saliba handed out €150 vouchers to voters – ‘I broke no law’,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/watch-agius-saliba-handed-150-vouchers-voters-i-broke-no-law.1093040,29-05-2024,"002586.png,002587.png,002588.png","Updated 8am with comment by Peter Agius
 Labour MEP candidate Alex Agius Saliba handed out 100 vouchers – each worth €150 – to voters during home visits and on the streets – a potentially unlawful practice he claims will not sway people’s votes.
 The vouchers entitle the holder to a €150 ‘laptop/PC service’ from The Notebook Centre, a computer and electronics shop in San Ġwann.
 It specifies that the voucher is only redeemable for a back-up, general servicing, physical cleaning, re-formatting, virus removal and for the installation of free anti-virus software. It is transferable and is valid until February.
 But the vouchers – which have a total value of €15,000 – seemingly violate a law that forbids the practice known as ‘treating’.
 Electoral law defines ‘treating’ as the act of providing food, drink, entertainment or provision before, during or after an election for the purpose of corruptly influencing people’s votes.
 Agius Saliba insists, however, he broke no law and the vouchers were not an attempt to influence people’s voting intentions.
 “A free anti-virus subscription or computer format will not sway one’s vote,” he told Times of Malta.
  On Sunday morning, PN MEP candidate Peter Agius told Facebook followers he too had met a family who had received one of the vouchers.
 ""This is 'corrupt practice'. According to the law, whoever does this can lose their seat once elected.
 ""No wonder they protect Muscat. No wonder they don't want to hear about the rule-of-law. PL buys votes to win and is willing to break all legislation to succeed.""
 “These vouchers may in no way be deemed as a treat intended to corrupt or influence an individual’s vote and portraying them as such would serve solely to deflect attention from the real issues at stake in this election; choosing representatives who will improve the well-being of Maltese workers, consumers and vulnerable groups.”
 Agius Saliba, Labour’s top candidate and the only sitting MEP seeking re-election next month, admitted the computer shop donated the 100 vouchers to him for his electoral campaign.
 He decided to hand them out during his door-to-door visits because he felt it made no sense to raffle them during a coffee morning or other fundraising activities, since these events are generally attended by an elderly cohort of people, he explained.
 “I therefore opted to distribute these vouchers whenever the right opportunity arose during my door-to-door visits, with the exception of 20 vouchers distributed this week on my way to a door-to-door session in Ħamrun (St Joseph Street). No vouchers were distributed during mass events or gatherings,” he said.
  “They will be declared as a donation as per established procedure and in accordance with the General Election Act. The vouchers, as clearly indicated, are redeemable solely for services they provide (formatting and backups).”
 He said he is informed that vouchers just like them are “widely distributed by many different entities and have little to no glamour due to their narrow scope, usually related to educational activities”.
 Times of Malta called one of Agius Saliba’s aides on Friday morning, purporting to be a voter who needs a new mobile phone and enquiring whether he can get one of the vouchers and use it to purchase the phone.
  The aide admitted the vouchers were handed out during house visits but said he could not give him one and even if he did, he could not use it to buy the phone.
 The law says: “Any person who corruptly by himself or by any other person, either before, during or after an election, directly or indirectly, gives or provides, or pays wholly or in part the expense of giving or providing any food, drink, entertainment, or provision to or for any person, for the purpose of corruptly influencing that person or any other person to give or refrain from giving his vote at the election, or on account of such person or any other person having voted of refrained from voting or being about to vote of refrain from voting at such election, shall be guilty of the offense of treating.”
 It also specifies that the voter who corruptly accepts the handout shall also be guilty of the offence.
 Questions sent to the management of The Notebook Centre remained unanswered.
  But Agius Saliba is by no means the first or only candidate to give handouts. Myriad politicians from both parties have been doing it much creatively over the years.
 In their obligatory expenses filings following the 2022 election, candidates from both parties admitted to blowing money on gifts and entertainment.
 Joe Giglio, the PN’s biggest campaign spender, dropped €462 on rose boxes in March that year. Later Giglio clarified that his were not handouts, but tokens that were distributed to people who had already paid to attend an event and that their payment was used to cover the expenses of the same event. Thus, he told Times of Malta, there was absolutely no comparison between the €15,000 worth of vouchers handed out by Agius Saliba and his handouts - worth €472.
 Labour’s Owen Bonnici took a different tack, in the knowledge that the way to a voter’s heart is through their stomach.
 He held two pasta buffets on successive nights at the Grand Excelsior in Floriana, at a total cost of €9,600, and Roderick Galdes – who was the campaign’s biggest spender – declared €4,300 on alcohol during the campaign. And that was just a fraction of his total spend.

Standards commissioner says there's 'no basis' to revise Miriam Dalli report,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/standards-commissioner-says-no-basis-revise-miriam-dalli-report.1097638,09-05-2024,002589.png,"The Standards Commissioner has said there is ""no basis"" for him to revise a report on Miriam Dalli, after the PN alleged that a mistake had let the minister off easy. 
 The commissioner, former chief justice Joseph Azzopardi, had previously found that a statement issued by the ministry was politically ""partisan"" and therefore in breach of the ministerial code of ethics. 
 But since the minister had apologised, Azzopardi had considered the matter closed. 
 In reaction, the PN said that Azzopardi had made a mistake when he noted that Dalli had not yet been appointed minister at the time the complaint was filed. 
 This mistake, they said, should be corrected and the report sent off to be considered by the Standards Committee. 
 Dalli was appointed minister on November 23, 2020, and the commissioner's report was published in January 2021, when she was bound by the ministerial code of ethics. 
 In a statement on Thursday, while Azzopardi did not dispute this timeline, he further clarified that the previous commissioner George Hyzler had received the report on November 1, 2020, and therefore the statement in question had not been issued while Dalli was a minister. 
 He said that the case was closed both because Dalli had nevertheless apologised over the matter and when considering that some time had already passed since the report was filed. 
 ""Therefore, there is no basis for me to revise this case's conclusions and refer it to the Committee for Standards in Public Life,"" Azzopardi said.
 ""Case K/058 affirms the principle that official statements issued by the government should not include content of a partisan nature. The way the case was concluded has not material impact on this fact."" 
 In reaction to Thursday’s letter, the PN said that through his actions Azzopardi was “rendering himself part of the system of impunity and couldn’t care less attitude that has brought the country to its knees”. 
 In the statement, Shadow Justice Minister Karol Aquilina said that the commissioner was persisting with a mistake even though it had been specifically brought to his attention. 
 In his report, Azzopardi found that Dalli had breached three articles of the code of ethics, but through this decision, the commissioner was “protecting Dalli from the consequences that should have arisen from his own report”, Aquilina said. 
 “It is now more clear than ever how right the PN parliamentary group was to vote against the appointment of Chief Justice Emeritus Joseph Azzopardi as Standards Commissioner.”

Abela: PN is planning a 'trap' for Labour supporters who gather for Muscat,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/abela-pn-planning-trap-labour-supporters-gather-muscat.1092809,22-05-2024,002617.png,"Robert Abela has alleged that the Nationalist Party is setting a ""trap"" for Labour supporters who will gather in support of Joseph Muscat next week. 
 Abela said the Opposition wants to ""stoke tensions"" on the day that a ""solidarity meeting"" for Muscat outside the Valletta law courts takes place. 
 In an immediate video response, Opposition leader Bernard Grech slammed Abela for irresponsibly stoking tensions and told him to go to the police with the information, if the claims are true. 
 The demonstration is set for Tuesday, around the same time former Prime Minister Muscat is due to be arraigned on corruption charges.
 Various Labour ministers stopped short of endorsing the rally when asked for their views about it on Tuesday. Instead, they urged attendees to remain calm and to make themselves heard by voting Labour on June 8.
 Speaking outside Castille on Tuesday afternoon, Prime Minister Abela spoke more directly about the demonstration.  
 ""I am informed that on May 28, the Nationalist Party is planning a trap that is not nice at all. My appeal to the people is to keep calm and not to be provoked,"" he said. 
 Abela said he was confident that the rally would remain peaceful, saying ""just like [Muscat] never fell for the traps the PN tried on him, he will not allow anyone to fall for this one"". 
  Abela did not provide specifics about his allegations when asked to do so. 
 ""The last hope the PN thinks it has to get back here [Castille] is to stoke tensions. It's a very ugly trap,"" Abela said. 
 ""I understand why the Opposition has been speaking about the 1980s. They are again using tactics of that era,"" he said. 
 Abela said the only strategy for the ongoing electoral campaign is the Vitals hospitals deal inquiry and its aftershocks. 
 The prime minister was repeatedly asked if he endorsed the solidarity demonstration, but did not give a yes or no answer. 
 Abela was speaking hours after a Castille cabinet session. 
 During a political activity later on Tuesday evening, Abela once again appealed to his supporters to remain calm, urging them to ""take the high road"" in the face of the Opposition's ""provocations"". 
  In a video message posted to Facebook shortly after Abela's comments were publicised, Opposition leader Bernard Grech slammed Abela, calling his action ""dangerous"" and urging him to go to the police if his information is to be believed. 
 ""It is evident these are comments of a desperate person who has not only lost control of the Labour Party and the government but is a Prime Minister who instead of doing everything he can to make sure our institutions work with serenity, is not only attacking them, but is making up stories about the PN,"" Grech said. 
 ""Robert Abela, you must stop this dangerous attitude immediately. Your speech is intended to rile people up, to do damage and create trouble. So that’s why I am warning you to put a stop to this behaviour.""
 Grech appealed for caution and urged people not to give in to the Prime Minister's provocations. 
 Earlier ministers funnelling out of cabinet were asked if they endorsed the ""solidarity meeting"". 
 Like Abela later, the five ministers made similar appeals for calm and caution against provocation. 
  Lands Minister Stefan Zrinzo Azzopardi appealed for calm, adding ""what's important is that people vote on June 8"". 
 Culture Minister Owen Bonnici and Public Cleansing junior minister Glenn Bedingfield both made identical comments.
 Equally, Finance Minister Clyde Caruana said: ""In this moment, the important thing is to remain calm; we live in a civilised country where people have matured - what's important is to keep calm"".
 Home Affairs Minister Byron Camilleri said it was not his job to endorse or not endorse the meeting, but warned against falling for ""provocation"". 
 ""We know the PN's tactic in this campaign: to provoke. They did it in parliament and in other instances towards us,"" he said 
 Muscat is set to be arraigned by summons (not under arrest) next Tuesday. 
 He faces criminal charges of money laundering, bribery, trading in influence and a long list of other charges, including setting up a criminal association, in connection with a deal to privatise three state hospitals. 
 Muscat has said he is innocent of all charges.
 ""I am going to relish destroying each and every one of these charges and proving how they are built on fantasy and lies,"" he said earlier this month.
 Next week's ""solidarity meeting"" is being organised by Muscat ally Emanuel Cuschieri and relayed by his lawyer and friend Charlon Gouder and another close Muscat friend, former Labour general secretary Jason Micallef.

 In a statement on Wednesday afternoon, the Nationalist Party joined the Gouder family's call for information on the circumstances surrounding his death. 
 The 45-year-old was found dead in Valletta early on Tuesday morning, with police sources saying the death is not being treated as suspicious.
 However, allegations on social media that Gouder received threats in the days before his death have sparked concern.
 ""In this tragic situation, we understand that it is in the interest of everyone involved in public life to discover the truth, and if someone contributed to Karl Gouder’s death, they should face justice,"" the PN said. 
 ""Whoever they are, wherever they are from,"" it continued.
 The party urged anyone with relevant information to pass it on to inquiring Magistrate Antoine Agius Bonnici.
 ""We demand that all the authorities and institutions in our country use the powers and resources at their disposal to uncover what led to the tragic death of Karl Gouder,"" it said. 
 Gouder's death has ""deeply wounded"" his family, friends and colleagues, as well as the leadership and grassroots of the party, it continued. 
 ""This is a pain we will continue to live with, and we are determined to treat it as a daily reminder of the need to care for each other and for the society we form part of,"" it said.
 ""We want justice, not revenge. The Partit Nazzjonalista firmly believes that justice is a virtue essential for the well-being of all of us living together.""
 In a statement later on Wednesday the Labour Party also backed calls for people to come forward with any information that could assist the police and the inquiring magistrate looking into Gouder's death. 
 The PL extended its solidarity to the Gouder family and said that it wanted the facts and the whole truth about the death to be made public. 
 ""Karl Gouder was a politician respected by all, dedicated to the service that he willingly took on and to the community and Maltese society. He worked without ever harming anybody,"" they said. 
 ""This is a moment where maturity must prevail as much as national unity."" 
 Gouder had previously shared on social media his struggles with mental health.
 The sudden death came days after Times of Malta announced he was the front-runner to occupy the post of party general secretary. 
 He had held the role of chief operation officer of the PN’s media arm and had been outgoing general secretary Michael Piccinino’s right-hand man during most of his tenure.
 His sister-in-law Maxine Gouder went public with a request for information as the family comes to terms with a death that shocked political circles in Malta. 
 Former PN MP Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando told Times of Malta he had filed a police report about ""reliable information"" that Gouder was threatened, though he acknowledged he had no proof. He also would not reveal who he was referring to. 
 Blogger and author Mark Camilleri also claimed that Gouder was being threatened, saying former OPM official-turned-blogger Neville Gafà was behind those threats. 
 Gafà told Times of Malta  that was untrue and that he had never met, spoken or texted Gouder. 
 A police investigation and a magisterial inquiry into the death are currently ongoing.
 ""It is not prudent to divulge further information at this stage,"" a spokesman said.

 Abela has repeatedly claimed he does not believe the timing of the conclusions of the inquiry into the Vitals hospitals deal, weeks before the June 8 MEP elections, was coincidental.
 Anyone who believes there was any wrongdoing by a member of the judiciary or a lawyer has the facility to report them to the Commission for the Administration of Justice.
 The comission's proceedings are held behind closed doors.
 However on Thursday he told Times of Malta that since Magistrate Gabriella Vella had taken her inquiry to the political arena with the ""perfect timing"" of closing a four-and-a-half year process, now it was up to people to send its strong message in the June 8 election. 
  He was speaking following a press conference where he introduced the nine candidates fielded by the Labour Party for the European Parliament elections. 
 Asked whether he was saying the magistrate was biased, he said he will comment on this once the inquiry conclusions are made public.
 At the moment all he could comment about was the timeline ""which was surely not a simple coincidence"".
 ""People can reach their own conclusions on whether this was intentional or not. The Commission is not the only body that scrutinises the judiciary. People will take their decision on June 8,"" he said.
 ""People must send a strong message that they will not accept these kind of manoeuvres by the establishment. A strong message in favour of their sovereignty to decide who governs the country,"" he added. 
 He said this was not an attack on the Labour Party but one that impinged on democracy and the people's power to choose. 
 ""People must protect themselves from this,"" he said.
   Asked who formed part of the establishment he was referring to, Abela said they were different people and parts of different institutions who were working from behind the scenes to dictate what happens and what decisions are taken. 
 The June 8 election will not sweep all this under the carpet but will send a strong message against the establishment, he added.
 ""We thought it's going to be an election like any other but this issue gave it a totally different dimension because the establishment raised its head.
 ""If there's any danger to our democracy, it was created by this clique of people and their manoeuvres. People must send a strong signal and that is why our slogan is about giving strength to the Maltese (Is-Saħħa lill-Maltin),"" he said.
 When reminded that a substantial number of members of the judiciary were appointed by the Labour government including former MP Wenzu Mintoff, former deputy leader Toni Abela and former international secretary Joe Mifsud, Abela said he will not go there, saying only that all these steered away from their political allegiances. 
 ""I have no doubt that the timeline chosen was done to send a message and influence the election campaign and its result. This is very dangerous and I expected much better,"" he said.
 Abela said that with her decision, the magistrate also tainted other members of the judiciary. 
 Asked who he was referring to when he said he would not allow anyone to destabilise the country, the prime minister said it was the establishment who was not interested in the country's progress but was only focused on its own advancement.
 He said part of this establishment was still pulling the strings within the Nationalist Party. 
 ""Ask Bernard Grech who's part of the establishment,"" he told the journalist. 
 Answering questions about the social benefits scandal, Abela said Family Minister Michael Falzon had his full support. 
 Last month, Roger Agius - one of five who stand accused in court of alleged involvement in the large-scale racket - claimed that an official at Falzon's ministry had facilitated the fraud and reassured him that as long as the minister remained in the post, they would never be in any trouble.
 Agius was the driver and close confidant of doctor and former Labour MP Silvio Grixti.
 Falzon later took to social media to deny having anything to do with the racket.
 The scandal has seen hundreds of people being given falsified documents which they then used to apply for monthly severe disability benefit payments, costing taxpayers upwards of €5 million.

Joseph Muscat calls for ‘big push’ on infrastructure projects,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/joseph-muscat-calls-big-push-infrastructure-projects.1100428,11-01-2024,002642.png,"Joseph Muscat has called on the government to give a “big push” to certain infrastructure projects.
 Speaking during an interview on Smash Radio, the ex-prime minister, who is facing corruption charges, said the government should prioritise the implementation of its “very ambitious” electoral manifesto.
 Jason Micallef, a close ally of Muscat, was in August appointed by Labour as a special delegate for the manifesto’s implementation.
 “As a voter, I do not want to see us fall behind. I do not see enough impetus on certain projects. We are halfway through the legislature. Certain things need a big push,"" Muscat said. 
 Muscat said the Labour government will ultimately be judged on whether it delivers on the promises in its manifesto.
 Questioned about the narrowing gap between Labour and PN, Muscat said the government’s prime message and drive should be delivering on its promises.
 He said the PN has failed to answer the fundamental question of what it stands for.
 While complimenting PN leader Bernard Grech on managing to attract people to the party, Muscat said many Nationalists are still waiting in hope for European Parliament president Robert Metsola to take over the reins.
 Muscat said such a dream would be short-lived, as people would quickly see through Metsola, just like they did with former PN leader Simon Busuttil.
 Turning to the budget, Muscat said the key measure is the continuing subsidies on energy and fuel bills.
 He warned that any government that touches energy bills “will topple”.
 Muscat said this very thing happened to a Labour government in 1997 and a PN government in 2013.
 The ex-prime minister said the government should not shy away from consistently reminding people about these generous subsidies. 
 The ex-prime minister said during the interview that he could not speak about the hospitals privatisation deal due to a court ban.
 He however welcomed a recent declaration by health minister Jo Etienne Abela stating that Malta would have been better off had the project worked.
 Muscat said the government should not shy away from roping in the private sector for large capital projects.

 “The hatred there is for Joseph Muscat and Robert Abela is unbelievable,” supporter Dominic Bonett told Times of Malta in a vox pop shortly before the prime minister  took the stage at the event in Valletta.
 “Shame on them. Malta cannot be better. Ask families and they’ll tell you. Whatever they do, we will stand by Joseph. Long live Labour (Viva l-Labour).”
  Another supporter – Joe Demicoli – said he is not worried about a Muscat prosecution because he did nothing wrong.
 “Of course he did a lot of things – but good things,” he said.
 People were especially angry about the timing of the inquiry conclusion. 
 First, the magistrate took too long to get it done and then dropped it right before the election, several argued, echoing a narrative that is being pushed by the PL.
 Supporters were asked to react to news that a magisterial inquiry into the hospitals deal was concluded last week and could lead to Muscat's criminal prosecution.
 Muscat has already said he has ""no doubt"" he will end up facing criminal charges in the case.
 “In my opinion she’s [the magistrate] biased and she did it to hinder Labour from winning the fourth MEP seat,” Joseph Azzopardi said.
 “Why didn’t she at least leave it till after the election so that it wouldn’t be as harmful to the PL?”
 He did acknowledge Muscat or someone in government could have possibly broken the law somehow and said if they did, they will be found guilty. But it was not fair for the media and the PN to cast a dark shadow over Muscat and to present him as a corrupt man.
 Another man – also called Joseph Azzopardi – thinks the courthouse might just as well have the badge of the PN on its front door.
 “You see those columns there?” he said, pointing to the courthouse a few metres away.
 “They should stick PN badges on it because it has become a PN club. The PN headqaurters is broke – they don’t even have enough money to pay electricity bills – so they found another club which is called ‘the court’. It’s all corrupt.”
 Joan Micallef is worried that Muscat is arrested because it would be an injustice to him, seeing all the good he brought to the country be overshadowed by “their lies”.
 77-year-old Tony Briffa does not even care if Muscat did something wrong. To him, what matters is only what is in his pocket.
 “I was born in a poor family and now I have a pension of €1,200. When did we ever see all that money?! And you expect me to vote for the Nationalists? Whatever they say, it’s here that matters,” he said, slapping the pocket on his trousers.
 “I don’t care. I only care about what I’m getting in my pocket.”
 Carmel Micallef answered about Muscat as if he were asked about Jesus.
 “What did this man do wrong? He always fed the hungry and provided for those who were thirsty,” he said.
 “He gave us dignity. Why are they going to prosecute him? He is not guilty of anything and these are all lies that were made up about him.”

EU court ruling against finch trapping based on 'minor breaches': Minister,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/eu-court-ruling-finch-trapping-based-minor-breaches-minister.1098274,19-09-2024,002702.png,"The EU court's ruling that finch trapping for ""research purposes"" was illegal was based on ""minor breaches"" of the European directive, minister Clint Camilleri told  Times of Malta .
 ""The court did not say it was against the principle of the research derogation, but only that Malta's legislation allowing finch trapping needed to include more details about why and how the research is conducted,"" the hunting minister said on Thursday.
 The minister was reacting to a decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union which on Thursday ruled that Malta's finch trapping for ""research purposes"" was illegal because the government's project does not establish a genuine research purpose and, therefore, cannot be justified.
 The ruling came after the European Commission took the Maltese government to court over its 2020 decision to allow the trapping of wild finch for research purposes.
 Camilleri told Times of Malta that issues the Commission had brought up - such as the use of the terminology ""citizen science"", using clap nets to capture birds, live and electronic decoys and lack of enforcement, had not been mentioned in the court's judgment.
 The ruling only said that Malta did not explain the details of its research well enough in its legislation, Camilleri said.
 One reason for that shortcoming could be linked to Malta's British legal system: ""Maltese legal notices usually do not explain the story behind the law. On the other hand, European legislation contains much more background"".
 Camilleri added the court had concluded that Malta's current legal framework for how the research trapping occurred was ""clear and precise"".
 Camilleri, who attended the court's ruling in person, said the government was committed to following the judgement, but it still needed to decide how it would do so.
 Asked if finch trapping will continue in Malta, Camilleri said: ""In the coming days, we will study the judgment in detail and decide the way forward in Cabinet"".

 Opposition leader Bernard Grech has refused to say whether one of his MPs would face consequences for equating Indian people to 'filth', but said he disagreed with the comment. 
 Education shadow minister Justin Schembri came under fire on Monday for saying that the government had saddled the country with ""filth, shabbiness and Indians"". 
 Schembri stood by that comment when contacted by Times of Malta, saying it was a ""generic"" one that reflected ""what people are talking about.""
 NGOs have accused Schembri of peddling racism, with some demanding he be kicked out from the PN.
 Confronted by journalists on Tuesday, Grech repeatedly refused to say whether he would be holding Schembri to account for his comments, but said he disagreed with them. 
 “For me, the comments are not acceptable. I already spoke with Justin (Schembri), and Justin clarified his position that he did not want to be understood in that way,” Grech said. 
 The PN leader was asked several times if Schembri would remain in the Nationalist Party, the parliamentary group, retain his role as education spokesman or suffer any consequence for his comments. 
 Grech declined to answer any of those questions. 
  Instead, the PN leader redirected his replies to comments made by Prime Minister Robert Abela about the judiciary, repeating several times that “the country’s judiciary is under explicit threat by the prime minister"". 
 In a brief post on Facebook, Schembri said that he ""in no way wrote that any nation or people are 'filth'"". He did not apologise for it. 
  Equality junior minister Rebecca Buttigieg and human rights NGOs called out the PN MP over his comments.  
 Repubblika said Schembri’s comments were ""dehumanising,"" and “racist” while Aditus Foundation called for Schembri to ""exit stage"" over the ""racist"" and ""repugnant"" words.
 Neil Falzon, director of Aditus, encouraged PN leader Grech to “take note”. 
 Grech said that people of any race should not be subject to discrimination.  
 “For me, any human - wherever they may come from - or whatever orientation they have, has their value and that value should be respected. But I remind you again that the country is in an unprecedented situation where the courts are being attacked."" 
 As he continued to walk to his car, Grech was asked again what action he would take.  
 “I already answered; you need to understand that a prime minister who is attacking the judiciary should have his position questioned,” he said. 
  Schembri has previously flirted with far-right rhetoric. 
 As a local councillor in 2019 praised hard-right Italian politician Matteo Salvini’s stance on Immigration. 
 Back then he was publicly criticised by several PN colleagues.

"Drop fuel subsidy and provide free local transport instead, ADPD proposes",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/drop-fuel-subsidy-provide-free-local-transport-instead-adpd-proposes.1101128,16-11-2024,"002718.png,002719.png","Money being used to subsidise petrol and diesel prices would be more effective if it was used to provide free regional and local transport options, the Green Party believes.
 ADPD public relations officer Brian Decelis and deputy chairperson Carmel Cacopardo argued that transport measures being proposed are inadequate and more radical change is needed.
 Both speakers reiterated one key point: that the root cause of traffic congestion is that there are simply too many cars on Malta's roads, and that any initiatives that fail to address that problem will not have any significant impact. 
 They emphasised their concerns about Malta’s rudderless transport plan during a press conference held on Saturday on a pedestrian bridge over December 13 street in Marsa.
 Decelis said the government should first implement what was identified in the Transport Masterplan 10 years ago before engaging in infrastructure projects that fail to offer solutions.  
 “Road widening and an increase in flyovers have not solved the problem; if anything, they have only shifted the problem elsewhere. Congestion on the roads does not materialise only when there are traffic accidents and major events like the recent Sigma Summit.  It has become a daily occurrence,” he said.
  “If what had been proposed in the Masterplan ten years was implemented, we would not be experiencing what we are experiencing today”, he said.
 Cacopardo said a lack of political will to address transport problems has led Malta to its current situation.
 “It is too late to implement small measures for gradual change.  It has now come to a point that radical changes are necessary,” he said.
 Cacopardo said it would make sense for the government to make it easier for people to fulfil their daily needs in their own towns and villages, reducing the traffic strain on main roads.
 The government’s transport masterplan had found that half of all trips made by private car were for short distances that took less than 15 minutes, he noted.
 He noted that small, local businesses were not in a position to compete with supermarkets and large stores on town outskirts, and said this is “a major weakness that needs to be addressed.”
 Paris and other major cities around the world have made similar pushes to encourage residents to have their needs met within the communities they live in, not more than a fifteen-minute walk or bike ride away, he noted.
 Proposals being pushed by the transport minister would ultimately have very little impact on traffic, because none address the root cause of the problem, Cacopardo said.
 “The government must develop positive measures regarding free public transport and extend that to both local and regional public transport.  It would be sensible to work on well-organised local and regional transport to reduce traffic on the road rather than subsidise petrol and diesel.  As pointed out by the Masterplan published ten years ago, such a measure would address half of the short journeys we make by private car”, he concluded.

 Criminal lawyer Ishmael Psaila said he was mulling throwing his name in the hat after several delegates and activists urged him to run following the June elections results.
 Writing on Facebook shortly after the nominations closed, Psaila said he had already committed to representing Muscat ""months ago"", a decision ""the leadership of the party felt... could be an obstacle to the party"". 
 The 33-year-old said he believed the ""legal profession and the political role shouldn't mix, but I am only interested in the good of the party because nobody is bigger than the party.""
 His statement resurfaces long-standing rumours about internal fissures within PL, specifically that Robert Abela's party is uncomfortable with Joseph Muscat's embroilment in the Vitals case.
  ""I wish that in this election delegates are allowed to freely choose those who are the best suited to take the roles of president, national executive and other positions,"" wrote Psaila.
 ""This movement should re-open its doors to whoever is ready to give a genuine contribution.""
 As a lawyer, Psaila is one of the former prime minister’s defence counsel. Muscat stands charged with crimes related to the hospitals deal.
 Earlier this month Psaila told Times of Malta that he was  mulling contesting for one of the PL's top posts, but would not elaborate.
 He also brushed away concerns that his role on Muscat’s legal team could create a conflict or taint a potential position he could occupy in the party, insisting his legal roles and his roles in the party can never be in conflict.
 Nominations for the upcoming Labour party elections closed on Sunday morning.
 For the position of Labour Party President, the party received two nominations - lawyer Alex Sciberras and former TVM head of news  Norma Saliba.
 One of them will be replacing Ramona Attard, who last week said she will not be standing for re-election as PL president. She was elected party president just over four years ago in July 2020.
 Voting will take place on Friday, September 13, at the National Labour Centre in Malta and the Labour Centre in Sannat, Gozo, and the vote count will take place on the same day after the voting closes.

 In 2022, over 190,000 people – equivalent to 35% of the population – received social security benefits, with each claimant receiving on average almost €6,000, the Social Protection 2024 report found. 
 Those living in the Southern Harbour district – including Valletta, Floriana and the Three Cities – registered the highest proportion of social security recipients, with 43% of the district’s population receiving benefits. 
 Meanwhile, the Northern district, encompassing areas including Mosta, Mellieħa and St Paul’s Bay, saw the lowest proportion (30%) of inhabitants claiming social security benefits.
 At a local council level, Mdina saw the highest proportion of social security claimants with 55% of the population receiving assistance, while Swieqi saw the lowest proportion (21%).
 Almost half (49%) of all the social security beneficiaries received old-age benefits, totalling 92,000 claimants.
 And while 17% of the population received old age benefits, this contrasted with the proportion receiving unemployment benefits, with less than one per cent of the population receiving such support in 2022.
 Meanwhile, almost 2% of the population (just over 10,500) received disability assistance. Żejtun saw the highest proportion of disability claimants (4% of the population) while Swieqi reported the lowest (less than one per cent).
 In total, more than €1.13 billion was spent on social security benefits in 2022, accounting for 44% of the €2.56 billion total social spending which included healthcare spending and energy subsidies.
 From 2018 to 2022, admissions to Mater Dei stayed relatively stable, hovering at around 64,000 per year.
 While the number of patients attending primary care centres rose almost 4% over the same period to around half a million by 2022, GP home visits plummeted by around 80%, falling from 22,700 to 4,400.
 And while the overall number of admissions to Mount Carmel stayed relatively stable from 2018 to 2022, the number of compulsory admissions jumped by almost 80%, rocketing from 393 to 705 over the same period.
 In total, there were almost 2,250 admissions to Mount Carmel in 2022.
 
 European outlook
 Overall, over one quarter (26%) of the EU’s GDP went towards social spending, with France dedicating the highest share (32%) out of all the countries in the bloc, closely followed by Austria (29%).
 Meanwhile, Ireland and Romania dedicated the least to social spending, allocating 11% and 14% of GDP, respectively.

This is Mater Dei's plan to reduce emergency waiting time and increase beds,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/this-mater-dei-plan-reduce-emergency-waiting-time-increase-beds.1093226,30-05-2024,002753.png,"A Mater Dei Hospital plan will see an increase in beds, a drive to reduce waiting times at the emergency department and the relocation of some services.
 Some measures in that plan are set to be implemented in the coming weeks while others will come to fruition in the coming years, Health Minister Jo Etienne Abela pledged, as the general hospital continues to feel the strain of excessive demand and limited resources. 
 One measure set to begin operating in the “coming weeks” is a telemedicine hotline to try to cut down numbers at the emergency department. Patients may call the number - 1400 - before going to Mater Dei hospital. 
 After hearing a patient’s symptoms and history, a doctor on the line will advise the patient where to receive treatment best. 
 This means a number of patients would be rerouted to local health centres instead of Mater Dei's emergency department. 
 “Of course, anyone with grievous injuries should go to Mater Dei, not just call,” the minister said. 
 The government will run an information campaign to promote the hotline. 
 The government also plans to decrease emergency room waiting times by outsourcing less critical cases to private hospitals. 
 Rules that require third country nationals to have private health insurance for their first year living in Malta will also be enforced. That means that non-EU workers will be unable to get free-at-the-point-of-use healthcare for their first 12 months of residency. 
 In the long term, Mater Dei’s emergency wing will expand both in height and width. Once completed, the emergency department will have 70 cubicles, up from 30. 
 Abela said the emergency department plan will cost the government over €17 million and accommodate Malta’s needs for the next 20 years. 
 Abela wants to increase Mater Dei’s bed space by 600 and increase the number of operating theatres. Currently, the hospital has around 1,200 beds. 
 Many of the hospital's 120 administrative staff will be moved to offices outside the MDH grounds and into offices in nearby Swatar. Administrative staff are set to move from the hospital in the “coming weeks,” he said.
 That move will make way for two new wards, Abela said.
 Disinfecting medical tools will also be moved from MDH, he said, to make way for beds and operating theatres. Space used for storing physical files will be cleared up through digitalisation, he said.
 The government also wants to refurbish and rebuild St Luke’s Hospital and move services currently provided at MDH. 
 These include day surgeries, outpatient services, and the dental department, he said. 
 The medical and nurses school will also move to St Luke’s hospital, he said.
 The health minister also plans to increase bed capacity at the Intensive Therapy Unit from 20 to 28 beds. 
 That will be done by “cannibalising” conference rooms.

 Since being charged with involuntary homicide, Richard Bilocca's position is no longer tenable, they said.
 In a statement after the arraignment, environment shadow minister Rebekah Borg said that Bilocca’s position in light of the charges is “no longer tenable” and that he must “resign or be removed” immediately. 
 Environment Minister Miriam Dalli's silence on the matter is “more proof of her incompetence” the statement added. 
 “The severity of the case and the charges stem from a tragic accident that resulted in the death of a WasteServ employee while working at the plant, casts an ugly shadow on his credibility. This means the CEO cannot continue to perform his duties.” 
 Joseph Ellul was found dead with lacerations to his throat on May 10, 2022, next to an elevator at the Marsa plant which is operated by WasteServ. 
 Bilocca and five others were arraigned on Tuesday after a magisterial inquiry concluded that there was enough evidence for criminal proceedings to continue. 
 According to court experts, Ellul died when he stuck his head in the hatch to check a piece of machinery that was malfunctioning. 
 The inquiry report noted that Bilocca testified that the machinery was not “childproof” and attributed the death to an “act of stupidity”.
 However, the inquiring magistrate also laid out evidence from court experts that identified health and safety failings, including the lift hatch not having any guards, mesh or other safety features in place.

Whatever happened to Labour’s unassailable lead?,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/whatever-happened-labour-unassailable-lead.1093744,06-10-2024,002821.png,"Saturday’s election saw Labour’s 42,000 vote lead dissolve into thin air, with PN coming within touching distance of an electoral win after more than a decade in the wilderness.
 With PN celebrating a defeat that feels like a victory and Labour digesting a win that tasted of defeat, some obvious questions arise.
 How did a seemingly insurmountable lead get cut down in one fell swoop? Did Labour’s lost votes go to PN? And how does the strong showing of independent candidate Arnold Cassola play into this?
 Labour entered this election on the back of a decade of unprecedented electoral success, with one record-breaking victory following the next, regularly winning more than 54% of all votes.
 But this plummeted in the European election, dropping by some nine percentage points, to see the party take just over 45% of all voters’ preferences.
 The scale of this drop is unprecedented in Malta’s recent electoral history. Just to give one example, the swing that swept Labour into power back in 2013 saw PN drop six percentage points, turning a 1,500 vote win in 2008 into a 35,000 vote defeat five years later.
 In practice, this means that some 23,500 fewer people voted for Labour in these elections compared to 2019.
 Labour’s 45% share of the total vote is also its lowest in over half a century.
 We need to dig into the archives to find a worse tally, to a time when England were about to win their first (and only) World Cup, The Beatles were readying to release the seminal Eleanor Rigby, and George Borg Olivier’s PN swept to victory in the 1966 elections, holding Dom Mintoff’s interdicted Labour Party to just 43% of the vote.
 
 It did, compared to its disastrous showing in the MEP elections in 2019, but perhaps not as much as the narrow gap between the parties would suggest.
 In 2019, PN registered just under 38% of the total vote, its lowest tally in recent history. PN received 42% of votes this time around, a marked 4 percentage point increase compared to 2019.
 It is also higher than the tallies that the party registered in any previous MEP election, where it had never raised its head above the 40.5% mark.
 But this year’s 42% share is roughly the same tally it registered in the 2022 general elections and is actually lower than the share it won in both 2013 and 2017 elections, both of which ended it heavy defeat.
 
 That’s not to say that PN didn’t gain any votes, quite the contrary.
 Just over 109,000 voters gave PN their top preference this time around, almost 11,000 more than 2019. But this is fewer than half of the 23,500 votes that Labour haemorrhaged.
 In practice, this means that out of every two votes that Labour lost since 2019, only one of them switched to PN, with the other preferring to look elsewhere.
 Some of PN's gains are likely attributed to the extraordinary popularity of Roberta Metsola, whose performance far eclipsed all other candidates not just in this election, but in all previous European elections too.
 When the dust of this election settles, PN insiders will be mulling what the party needs to do to make inroads with the unhappy former Labour voters who still shun the party, as well as whether Metsola's votes will translate into PN votes in a general election, should she not feature on the ballot sheet.
 The exodus from Labour was also key to the rise of independent candidates, particularly Arnold Cassola who saw his tally rise by roughly 10,000 votes since 2019 to now reach over 12,000 first-count votes.
 Cassola wasn’t the only independent or third-party candidate to perform respectably. Former PL mayor Conrad Borg Manché won almost 6,000 votes, while far-right Nazi sympathiser Norman Lowell received just under 7,000 first preferences.
 More broadly, independent and third-party candidates increased their tally by over 12,500 votes since 2019, making it the best showing for independent or third-party candidates in any MEP election to date.
 
 While this wasn’t enough to see a third-party candidate win a seat, it certainly was enough to eat into Labour’s huge majority and also prevent PN from bridging the gap further.
 In the run-up to the election, Labour was clearly concerned about voter abstention, with a higher-than-usual number of people in Labour-leaning districts indicating that they intended to sit the election out.
 While district turnout figures suggest that this did come to pass, at least to some degree, the overall drop in total turnout that was feared didn’t happen after all, with virtually the same number of people voting this year as they did in 2019.
 This meant that, once again, some 100,000 voters stayed home on election day, with just over 270,000 people casting their vote.
 It appears likely that the disgruntled Labour voters who stayed home were matched in number by voters in other districts, many of whom may have cast their vote for either PN or independent candidates.
 The whims of these 100,000 people who abstained are likely to shape the direction of Malta's next general election, when the overall turnout is likely to climb from just over 70%, as is customary for European elections, to well over the 80% mark.

"EU warns Malta over excessive deficit, urged to cut subsidies",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/eu-warns-malta-excessive-deficit.1094153,19-06-2024,002823.png,"Updated 3pm with PN reaction 
 The European Commission has formally warned Malta and seven other EU member states over their excessive budget deficits.
 Separately, the European Commission also reiterated its call for Malta to wind down its energy subsidies as well as take other measures to tackle a severe shortage and mismatch of skills, ease traffic congestion and increase renewable energy.
 Warnings over budget deficits were issued on Wednesday against Belgium, France, Italy, Hungary, Malta, Poland and Slovakia.  Romania was accused of having failed to heed previous warnings. 
 ""In light of this assessment, and after considering the opinion of the Economic and Financial Committee, the commission intends to propose to the council to open excessive deficit procedures for these member states in July 2024,""  the EU executive said.
 “Longstanding structural challenges are holding back the EU’s competitiveness,” EU Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis said in a statement.
 “We look forward to receiving national fiscal structural plans from member states that bring down debt and deficit and reflect today’s recommendations.” 
 For decades, the EU has set out targets for member states to keep their annual deficit within 3% of Gross Domestic Product and overall debt within 60% of output.
 The Maltese government has repeatedly defended its position, arguing that the deficit is falling as the economy grows. Malta ended 2023 with a deficit of -4.9%.
 The Finance Minister has insisted that the gap will continue shrinking by 0.5 percentage points each year up to 2026 in line with the Economic Governance Framework agreement reached between EU finance ministers last January. 
 The Commission in recommendations to member states on Wednesday (see recommendations in full on pdf below) called on Malta to submit the medium-term fiscal-structural plan in a timely manner and to keep the general government debt at a prudent level over the medium term in line with EU treaties.
 It again urged Malta to ""wind down the emergency energy support measures by the 2024/2025 winter"" and address remaining aggressive tax planning risks, introduce a withholding tax on outbound payments or equivalent defensive measures, and amend rules on non-domiciled companies..""
 Prime Minister Robert Abela had warned ahead of the EU elections earlier this month that Malta would not lift the energcy subsidies' whatever the EU said.""
 The commission on Wednesday also urged Malta to continue with the swift and effective implementation of the recovery and resilience plan, including the REPowerEU chapter, ensuring completion of reforms and investments by August 2026. 
 Malta was urged to strengthen the quality and labour market relevance of education and training to address low educational outcomes as well as the severe shortage and mismatch of skills, in particular by fostering basic skills of students and the professional development of teachers.
 The country was also told to accelerate the deployment of renewable energy through large-scale projects as well as small-scale investments in direct energy production and consumption.
 A call was made for Malta to address traffic congestion by improved quality and efficiency of public transport and step upinvestments in ‘soft mobility’ infrastructure.
 In a reaction (carried in full on pdf below) the government noted that the European Commission had observed that Malta’s economy would continue to outperform other member states in 2024 and 2025. This growth is expected to be driven by net exports and private consumption. 
 ""Similarly, the fact that the rate of inflation is projected to be halved by 2025 confirms that the government’s policies to promote price stability when it comes to basic necessities are bearing the desired results.""
 The government reiterated that the deficit will narrow by 0.5% annually, ensuring it falls below 3% over the next four years.
 It said it remained committed to effectively implementing the Recovery and Resilience Plan, including the REPowerEU Chapter, and the Cohesion policy programmes. The implementation of this plan will tackle areas addressing the green and digital elements, as well as reforms in other sectors.
 Various initiatives were being undertaken to support the green transition, it said, including the launch of four new calls for investments in larger renewable energy systems, from 40kW up to 1,000kW and another call for large-scale renewable energy systems exceeding 1,000kW in 2024.
 The Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) Malta Financial Instrument had been fully implemented and had generated some €65 million worth of loans to final recipients. A second electrical cable interconnection between Malta and Sicily is planned to be commissioned by the end of 2026.
 On traffic, the government said significant investment had been directed towards improving transportation infrastructure, including both major and urban road networks specifically focusing on the TEN-T roads, the upgrades to the inner-harbour ferry system and the promotion of alternative eco-friendly commuting options. The extension of the free public transport to all, for instance, led to an increase in the usage of this service.
 The government did not directly address the energy subsidies in its reaction. 
 In a statement on Wednesday afternoon, the PN said the warning follows similar warnings by the Opposition that the government had ignored. 
 “Once again, the PN is urging the government to stop wasting public funds and ensure Malta's expenditure is sustainable.
 “The debt - which exceeds €10 billion and accrues nearly €600,000 in daily interests - is alarming and unsustainable,” the PN said.
 The party also urged the government to explain the impact of excessive deficit procedures to the electorate and detail how it will try address the problem.

Robert Abela on Joseph Muscat: ‘You are asking about the past’,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/robert-abela-joseph-muscat-you-asking-past.1096301,08-04-2024,002940.png,"Robert Abela has refused to weigh in on whether his predecessor Joseph Muscat did more harm than good to the Labour Party.
 Fielding questions about the ex-prime minister during a Lovin Malta interview, Abela said: “You are asking about the past, I am looking towards the future. The Labour Party has been led by Robert Abela for the past four years”.
 Pressed further about the ex-prime minister, Abela questioned the “fixation” interviewers have with asking him about Muscat.
 “People want to hear about the future. Joseph Muscat had seven years in government, he gave his contribution. Now they have trusted me to give my contribution.” 
 Muscat resigned in January 2020 in the wake of the Daphne Caruana Galizia murder probe, paving the way for Abela to become prime minister. 
 Abela indicated that former leaders should exit the political scene to give space to their successors.
 “I will disappear from the political scene once my time is up,” he vowed.
 He refused to say whether Muscat should follow this advice.
 “The worst mistake you can make is to try to turn back the clock. That’s how I see it. That is why it is important for politicians to have a profession to fall back on, so they are not dependent on politics,” Abela continued.
 Muscat warned he will be more vocal ever since the police searched his home in January 2022 as part of the Vitals corruption probe that culminated in criminal charges being filed against the ex-prime minister in April.
 He even teased running for the European Parliament elections prior to the criminal charges. At the time, Abela  refused to shut down the possibility of Muscat running on the Labour ticket. 
 Jason Micallef, who is widely viewed as a proxy for Muscat, has thrown his hat in the ring for the role of Labour deputy leader.
 Abela used the same analogy about ""turning back the clock"" when asked about Micallef's bid. 
 Abela apologised for the frequent power cuts that have plagued the island over summer.
 He acknowledged that investment in the power distribution network had not kept pace with Malta’s economic growth.
 The prime minister insisted the country has enough electricity capacity to cater for demand.
 He said the government will not waiver from its targets to get more electric vehicles on the road, despite the increase in demand this will bring.
 Abela said the government is exploring the possibility of hooking up a solar farm in Libya with the Maltese grid via an interconnector.
 On the stalled €600 million waste-to-energy plant, Abela said the winning bid was €200 million cheaper than its nearest rival.
 An appeals court overturned the adjudication process by Wastserv after finding members of the adjudication panel and the contract review board had a conflict of interest.
 The winning bid was placed by a joint venture between French company Paprec and local construction company Bonnici Brothers.
 Abela acknowledged his “friendship” with some of the Bonnici Brothers’ directors but said this in no way impacted the procurement process.
 On the suspension of Edward Scicluna as central bank governor, Abela denied claims that the cabinet was divided over how to handle the issue.
 Scicluna is facing charges over the hospitals' privatisation scandal, but pushed back as pressure from the prime minister to resign.
 A compromise was reached whereby Scicluna was “suspended” on half pay for the remainder of his term as governor.
 Abela appealed for the courts to handle the Vitals case “efficiently”.

Żurrieq residents tell candidates to stay away unless they oppose developments,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/zurrieq-residents-tell-candidates-stay-aways.1091820,21-06-2024,"003006.png,003007.png","A number of Żurrieq residents have stuck yellow stickers on their doorbells warning candidates for the European and local elections to stay away unless they are against two major developments in the area.
 With the June 8 election approaching, candidates are visiting homes to win over voters.
 But in Żurrieq, some residents have stuck a bright yellow sticker on their letter box and doorbells reading: “Dear candidate, do not knock on this door unless you spoke up against development in Nigret and tal-Bebbux.”
 Last year, residents fiercely contested an application to allow development on 12,000 square metres of arable land in Nigret, Żurrieq, with some 1,500 objections filed against PC/00049/19.
 Yet, the Planning Authority voted unanimously to allow the Żurrieq farmland to be developed.
 The application allows the applicants, Grand Property Holdings Ltd., owned by James Barbara and Jason Mifsud, to extend existing roads, create a new one, and rezone the entire area for terraced housing.
 Żurrieq Residents’ Association had urged the government to designate the site as a community open space.
  This week, Times of Malta reported on yet another project in Żurrieq, this time how the government confirmed it has given the go-ahead for a road to be built through agricultural land, opening up the area for the building of three-story residences.
 Farmers whose families have tilled the land for generations told Times of Malta that they were aware that the area, once ODZ, had lost development protection in 2006 through the rationalisation exercise by the government.
 Yet, the arable land, which is also lined with trees, was still cultivated and the Strategic Plan for the Environment and Development mandates the protection of “good quality agricultural land from development”.
 Times of Malta was informed that “anonymous activists” have been handing out the stickers to residents. 
 They are similar to the yellow stickers Marsascala residents placed on their doorbells back in 2022, warning politicians to stay away unless they planned to oppose the marina plans.
 Later that year, Prime Minister Robert Abela dropped the marina plans.

When Karmenu Mifsud Bonnici wanted George Vella to be leader,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/when-karmenu-mifsud-bonnici-wanted-george-vella-leader.1102155,12-08-2024,"003009.png,003010.png,003011.png,003012.png,003013.png","Former president George Vella was walking into a Labour Party executive meeting after the 1992 general election defeat. He was late.
 Before he could sit down, he heard then party leader Karmenu Mifsud Bonnici announce that he – George Vella, who was then an MP – would succeed him as leader. This was news to him.
 Vella revealed this in the new book Karmenu. Il-Verità, Xejn Anqas Mill-Verità (The Truth, Nothing But the Truth) in which 24 individuals who knew and worked with Mifsud Bonnici shared memories, experiences and reflections. The former prime minister passed away in 2022, aged 89.
 Edited by Joe Borg and published by SKS Publishers, the book includes chapters by Mifsud Bonnici’s cousin and former president Ugo Mifsud Bonnici, President Myriam Spiteri Debono, Evarist Bartolo, Marie-Louise Coleiro Preca, George Abela, Alfred Sant, Toni Abela, and Joe Mifsud, among others.
  In part of his contribution, Vella spoke about the 1992 Labour meeting held at the Maċina.
 “I was walking in and I heard him say: ‘I decided that the best person to lead the Labour Party is George Vella.’ I said: ‘What is he on about?’, I was still standing up and walking in. I said: ‘Sorry, sorry, sorry.’ I apologised then I said: ‘What are you saying?’”
 Vella revealed how Mifsud Bonnici had never consulted him. However, he later told him he had decided he would be the best fit for leader.
 He reached his conclusion after he made a list of potential candidates and allocated points depending on family ties, integrity, experience, language proficiency, and other factors – and Vella scored the highest.
 Vella felt that now that the announcement had been made – and was picked up by the media – he had to, at least, consider it.
 It was a difficult time, and he spent a week of sleepless nights – consulting many over the matter.
 He eventually decided this was not for him. But Mifsud Bonnici did not want to accept it and also announced his name during a meeting in Gżira.
 Vella wrote a letter to Mifsud Bonnici explaining he was not consulted and did not want the role and was ready to publish the letter. He eventually accepted the situation and Alfred Sant went on to become leader following an election with Lino Spiteri.
 Vella said this episode was an example of Mifsud Bonnici’s stubborn nature – once he set his mind on something, he would not turn back.
  Another example of this stubborn trait was EU accession – something Mifsud Bonnici fought against until the end. Vella said he was very close with him until the EU accession issue.
 After the 2003 referendum and general election defeats, the PL accepted the results and promised the people that a Labour government would lead better and negotiate better. But Mifsud Bonnici persisted in his ‘exit Europe’ strategy.
 “I remember it was the only time I heard Karmenu say the word ‘idiot’. He told me: ‘You are such an idiot. The day will come when people will assault you in the streets because of this policy’,” he wrote.
  After that, they were no long close. Mifsud Bonnici stopped dropping by at his house for long chats as he used to.
 As Vella reflected on his former party leader, he described him as a good, intelligent man but was “not a political animal”.
 “While having the right principles is crucial, you must have the political nous, which I feel Karmenu did not have. If Karmenu thought: ‘I want to take this path’, he would take that path. If he felt he was right, he felt this gave him the right of way. The political world does not work that way.”
 And one other example was the Tal-Barrani clashes on November 30, 1986, one of the darkest chapters in Malta’s political history. It started when the Nationalist Party decided to hold a mass meeting in Żejtun, a Labour Party stronghold. A permit was initially granted but then withdrawn.
 The Nationalist Party insisted it would go ahead in the name of freedom of expression, sparking violent clashes between the two parties.
  Vella admitted that he was one of the people who advised Mifsud Bonnici not to allow the meeting.
 “I remember telling him: ‘Don’t give the permit for the meeting’. I reasoned that way to avoid trouble.... Today I understand that it was a mistake.
 “Karmenu could have said: ‘Okay, I will give the permit. But if Nationalists are coming to Żejtun, stay indoors and let them be.’ But the incitement went on. Unfortunately, we hear words like: ‘They will not set foot into Żejtun.’ It was a senseless decision.”
 Vella, like other contributors in the book, spoke about how Mifsud Bonnici was very loved by the people. He was a reserved person who fought for what he believed in.
 He was not in it for the money – but for the love of his country. Vella shared how he was once told that the government owed him some Lm30,000 (€70,000) for legal work he had carried out. But he did not want the money and asked that it be transferred into the consolidated fund. He was also very generous with people in need.
  Vella reflected on how Mifsud Bonnici entered politics during a dark political climate in 1984. He spoke how he believed his predecessor, Dom Mintoff, had appointed him party leader as a strategy move to block others in the party from taking the role.
 “The time that Karmenu spent as prime minister were not happy times, they were not easy. In those circumstances, I believe that what Karmenu did, he did because he was convinced it was for the best: not for his personal interest or for the party, but in the interest of the country. History will be the judge of him.”

Professionals slam 'irresponsible' Clayton Bartolo for dismissing degrees,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/professionals-slam-irresponsible-claims-qualifications.1101281,20-11-2024,003049.png,"Professionals on Wednesday slammed ""irresponsible"" statements that discounted the necessity of qualifications, experience and ethical standards for consultancy positions within the public sector.
 The statement by the Malta Federation of Professional Associations was issued in the wake of a scandal involving Tourism Minister Clayton Bartolo and Gozo Minister Clint Camilleri, and a lucrative job given to Bartolo's wife Amanda Muscat.
 Earlier this month, a report by retired chief justice Joseph Azzopardi revealed how Bartolo and Camilleri were both found to have abused their power and breached ministerial ethics when they gave Bartolo’s partner (now wife) Muscat, a job as a highly paid consultant. 
 The PN has since rallied people in protest, urging for the dismissal of the two ministers. 
 Independent candidate Arnold Cassolla, who was the first to report the issue to the Standards Commissioner has also urged the Public Accounts Committee to recover “some of the €68,000 swindled from the taxpayer for doing nothing"".
 Bartolo made a conditional apology, while a defiant Camilleri insisted he did  nothing wrong. Prime Minister Robert Abela accepted Bartolos' apology as "" sufficient"". 
 But on Friday, Bartolo continued to defend his wife’s lucrative consultancy role by saying some people can do a job based on experience alone.
 “In life, it is not just about diplomas or degrees. In life you have those who are able (to work) because of their experience,” Bartolo told Times of Malta.
  On Wednesday, the MFPA dissociated itself from partisan disputes but stressed that ""in harmony with the principles of professionalism"", it advocated for a meritocratic framework wherein policy advisors and consultants to decision-makers met the necessary academic qualifications and experience, and adhered to high ethical standards.
 ""Education forms the foundational building blocks of all professions. MFPA has consistently expressed serious concerns regarding declining educational standards, as evidenced through MATSEC examination results, and questionable hiring practices that ignore the lack of suitable qualifications including political appointments of people of trust as consultants to ministers,"" the MFPA said.
 MFPA said it was also distancing itself from public comments by high members of government that discounted the necessity of qualifications, experience and ethical standards for consultancy positions in public service.
 ""Such irresponsible claims undermine and discredit the need for students to pursue academic education to attain qualifications in the form of diplomas and degrees, and for professionals in all areas of practice to strive to enhance their practice through continuing professional development during the course of their service to society. 
 ""These declarations continue to encourage the decline of educational standards and a lack of professionalism and accountability in our country.""
 The MFPA said several professions were already plagued with trumped-up positions filled by lesser-qualified people attempting to do the work of qualified and warranted professionals.
 Masking deficiencies in qualifications, experience and accountability of individuals in any position, especially those in high-ranking ones, as well as the proliferation of dubious designations undermined the integrity of professions and tarnished the social fabric, the federation added.
 ""Professionalism is not merely a title but a commitment to ethical standards, social responsibility and fitness for purpose.
 ""Professions are a vital component of civil society, and we urge and encourage our youth and students to pursue careers defined by diligence and genuine passion, "" MFPA reiterated.
 The MFPA statement was endorsed by the Association of Podiatrists, Association of Speech-Language Pathologists, Chamber of Engineers, Dental Association of Malta, Kamra tal-Periti, Malta Association for the Counselling Profession, Malta Association of Occupational Therapists, Malta Association of Physiotherapists, Malta Association of Professional Conservators and Restorers, Malta Chamber of Pharmacists, Malta Chamber of Psychologists, Malta Veterinary Association, Medical Association of Malta, Society of Medical Radiographers, The Maltese Association of Social Workers and The Maltese Association of Youth Workers.

 Engerer said the obvious message that emerged from the story was that one could not speak out, as everything would have been arranged beforehand.

 ""As I have always said, it is the law on political party funding which needs to be changed if the environment is to ever be given a chance,"" he said.

 Borg obtained 678 delegates' votes or 95.8% of the votes cast in his election; 30 voted against and there were 13 abstentions.
 Agius Saliba obtained 635 or 92.3% of votes cast; 53 voted against; there were 28 abstentions and five invalid votes.
 A total of 721 votes were cast in these elections for a turnout of 95.1%.
   Both candidates thanked the delegates for a strong turnout and for taking part in party renewal.
 It took around one hour and 20 minutes for the counting process to be concluded at the Labour headquarters, even though the two candidates were uncontested.
 Borg, who serves as Malta’s Foreign Affairs Minister, will now serve as Labour’s deputy leader for parliamentary affairs, succeeding the outgoing Chris Fearne. The role automatically makes him deputy prime minister, taking charge of the nation whenever Robert Abela is absent.
 Agius Saliba, a Labour MEP who leads the party’s three-person delegation in Strasbourg, will serve as the party’s deputy leader for party affairs. He replaces Daniel Micallef, who stepped aside in June.
 Labour’s two deputy leaders are among the party’s most popular politicians.
 Borg, 38, served as mayor of his hometown Dingli as a teenager and was just 27 when he was elected to parliament in 2013. He has served as a parliamentary secretary for EU funds, Infrastructure and Transport Minister and Foreign Affairs Minister.
 Agius Saliba, 36, spent years working within Labour’s executive and as an adviser to various Labour ministers before running for MEP in 2019. His popularity grew during that term, and in March 2024 he almost doubled his vote count as he was reelected.
 The two posts are among various ones to be determined by votes cast by Labour members in elections held across Friday and Saturday.
 Apart from the deputy leadership positions, Labour will also elect a new party president, international secretary and executive.
 Former TVM head of news Norma Saliba and lawyer  Alex Sciberras are both vying to become party president, while Georvin Bugeja and John Grech are contesting the international secretary position.
 The 12 seats on the party’s executive are the most contested positions: there are 37 candidates in the running.

Galdes dismisses allegations of gerrymandering on Siġġiewi social housing,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/galdes-dismisses-allegations-gerrymandering-siggiewi-social-housing.1092028,21-06-2024,"003104.png,003105.png","Housing Minister Roderick Galdes has brushed off accusations of gerrymandering ahead of the June local elections after 99 voters switched their address to an government housing block in Siġġiewi, despite not living there.
 Last month, the Nationalist Party asked the court to switch the residents' addresses back to their current homes because the building was not ready to house people.
 The party said it had caught the government gerrymandering and pointed out that ""coincidentally"", two-thirds are from the electoral district of the housing minister.
 But Galdes dismissed accusations that the Labour is using its power in government to introduce new voters into Siġġiewi and help nudge the local council election there in its favour. 
  “The accusations of gerrymandering in the elections are not true,” Galdes told journalists on Monday. 
 “Over the years I have received numerous parliamentary questions from members of the Nationalist Party asking me when the block will be ready. Now that it is ready, they filed a court application, it is shameful.”
 “Gerrymandering is when you gain something more, so when it comes to the elections of MEPs and local councils, this makes no difference,” he said.
 “Today we have a situation where a person can contest in Mdina, but live in Qormi. Someone can contest in Gozo and live in St Paul’s Bay, it makes no difference, this is the law.”
 The huge, newly constructed housing block, named after the late Labour MP Silvio Parnis, is still being finished.Previously, Times of Malta visited the site and confirmed that while the block is in its finishing stages, the apartments – at least on the ground floor – are empty of all furniture and amenities.
 On Friday, three women amongst the 99 registered as residing at the social housing admitted in court that they do not live there. Two of the women said they were currently living in Qormi with their parents because the Siġġiewi housing was currently uninhabitable. 
 Galdes, however, insisted there were ""people who are living there"". 
  He said that soon a social housing building will be inaugurated in Bormla, and asked if the Opposition also plans on filing court applications against the new residents.
 ""These are vindictive court applications,"" he said.
 ""Do you believe as Housing, we should make people wait another month before moving into social housing because of an election,"" he asked.
 When asked if it is a coincidence that two-thirds of the people are from his electoral district, Galdes said that when people apply for social housing, they apply for that close to their original locality.
 ""I don't expect these people to go to Gozo, or far away from where their families are. So it was a coincidence that yes, this social housing apartment is in my district. Is Bormla in my district? Let us be fair,"" he said.

 Helena Dalli's husband claimed on Wednesday that high officials in the Labour Party had worked to destroy his wife’s credibility and stop her from becoming Malta’s president.
 Patrick Dalli's statement comes on the same day that the Dallis’ son Luke announced he was quitting the PL’s broadcasting stations.
 Patrick Dalli took to Facebook with his claim after Illum said Helena Dalli was lobbying for a second term as European Commissioner, instead of Glenn Micallef, who is Malta’s nominee for the post.
 Patrick Dalli echoed his wife’s earlier statement, saying the claim was “another lie about Helena.”
 Helena Dalli has already denied reports accusing her of trying to sabotage Micallef's nomination.
 She was among the favourites to become the president of Malta but did not secure the spot following the PN's pushback to appointing anyone who formed part of former prime minister Joseph Muscat's cabinet.
 But on Wednesday morning, her husband claimed two PL officials had also conspired against his wife. 
 “Soon you will know the manoeuvres that were made in the appointment of the President of Malta by two high-ranking officials of the Labour Party to harm Helena's credibility,"" Patrick Dalli told social media users.
 “It was a fascist attack on a woman who dedicated her life to the Labour Party and the Maltese people.""
 The government is facing pressure from the commission to swap Micallef with a female candidate.
  Sources in Brussels have suggested that keeping Helena Dalli on for a second term is one of the options being discussed. However, it appears that the government is reluctant to move forward on it.
 Helena Dalli, who is currently the EU’s equality commissioner, would not say if she endorsed Micallef’s nomination or if she would consider staying in the commission for another term.
 “It would be highly unethical of me to comment on an ongoing discussion between my president as commissioner and the prime minister of my country, also given the fact that this falls outside the remit of my portfolio,” she told Times of Malta.
 Pressed to say whether she would endorse Micallef, she said: “I will not undermine my president” in a reference to EU Commission president Ursula von der Leyen.
 It is not unusual for outgoing commissioners to wish incoming ones well: Cyprus' outgoing commissioner Stella Kyriakides publicly congratulated the country's nominee Costas Kadis last month, for instance. 
 On Wednesday, Micallef said he has always seen support from Dalli.
 ""I have nothing but admiration and respect for Commissioner Dalli and her work. I worked with Dalli when she was minister responsible for EU affairs and equality, during which period I was entrusted to lead the Brexit Department and the EU Coordination Department. I am grateful for her trust,” he said.
 Micallef said both Dalli and himself were “committed to promoting and safeguarding Malta’s values and interests in the EU”.
 “Dalli and I spoke when the prime minister announced my nomination, and she wished me well. She has always supported me and believed in me,” Micallef added.
 The Dalli's son Luke has meanwhile also announced he would stop presenting two current affairs programmes - Manatnejn and Awla - on the Labour Party’s media.
 “It is a very difficult decision for me - one that I reached following several events in recent years, months, and weeks, but above all, after a long consultation with the people I love most in my life,” Luke Dalli said.
 He said he had been presenting programmes ONE’s radio and TV channel for 14 years.
 “The fact I was born and raised in the Labour Party makes this decision one of the most difficult I have ever had to make in my life. But it was one that had to be made, and it had to be made now,” he said.
  He said he will return to party media “once the right circumstances return”.
 But speaking to Times of Malta, Dalli said he was quitting purely for personal reasons.
 “I’m leaving because I want to spend more time with my family,” he said.
 He stressed that leaving the PL's arm was his decision and not ONE's.

 He has claimed that some 18,000 Maltese ID cards were issued on the back of documents falsified by Identita officials. 
 Separately, the lawyer has also brought to light cases of people who fear their property is being used to commit fraud, after receiving bills from telephone companies addressed to people that have never lived there. 
 In a press conference on Thursday, shadow ministers Darren Carabott and Ivan Castillo said that it is increasingly clear that there are “huge problems” at state agency Identita and that the “chaos” at the heart of Camilleri’s ministry is finally coming to the fore. 
 They said that Camilleri is no longer good in the role that he occupies and should resign. 
 Despite these issues going public, Camilleri has remained silent, they said, barely reacting to Azzopardi’s request for an inquiry into the alleged racket. 
 “The people need a government with a backbone but instead they only get absolute silence,” they said, adding that Camilleri has also failed to speak about other issues, such as the extension of police commissioner Angelo Gafa’s term as well as the death of a person within the  forensic unit at Mount Carmel Hospital while in state custody. 
 Silence, they continued, appears to be symptomatic within the government, as the administration has also failed to reply to the PN’s request for the labour market research to be published. 
 “Robert Abela and Clyde Caruana flooded our country with cheap labour and whom they now say they no longer need,” they said. 
 They also recalled that Camilleri’s answer, when asked by David Agius how many people worked as food couriers, was that there is presently no such category for such workers. 
 “In light of this, the PN must ask how can we know for sure that the market is saturated if we have no information on how many people actually work in the industry?” they said.

Pro-Palestine activists want Malta's parliament to debate Middle East fighting,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/propalestine-activists-malta-parliament-debate-middle-east-fighting.1098735,28-09-2024,003155.png,"A group of Maltese activists are pushing MPs to urgently debate Malta’s position on violence in Palestine and the Middle East.
 They want parliamentarians to formally demand an immediate ceasefire and humanitarian access in Gaza, the West Bank, Israel and Lebanon and to adopt a stronger position against Israel.
 Military supplies heading to Israel should not be allowed through Maltese waters, the activists said, and any Malta-registered vessel carrying such supplies should be struck off.
 The activists, who together form a group named Ġustizzja għall-Palestina (Justice for Palestine) have launched a petition to pressure parliament into discussing the ongoing conflict.
 As of Saturday morning, the petition had just 470 signatures.
 “As the conflict escalates, it should be a foremost concern not only for those directly involved, but for all countries in the Mediterranean region, including Malta. In such dark moments in history, every country must step up to its responsibilities, not only through rhetoric but also through concrete actions,” Ġustizzja għall-Palestina said.
 It is the second time that the group has called for a parliamentary debate about the conflict, having made a similar call in August. 
 Fighting in the Middle East has raged ever since terrorists attacked Israel on October 7 last year. After months of bombarding Gaza, Israeli forces refocused their efforts on Lebanon in the past weeks, pounding its capital Beirut as they targeted Hezbollah's top leaders.
 On Saturday, Israel said it had killed Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah. 
 Malta has called for an end to violence and in a speech at the UN General Assembly on Friday, Prime Minister Robert Abela called for ""decisive steps"" to resolve the conflict. 
 Foreign Affairs Minister Ian Borg has given a ministerial statement to parliament about the conflict and parliament's foreign affairs committee has condemned violence there. 
 But parliament's plenary - which is currently still in summer recess - has not held a debate centred on the conflict.  
 The petition calls on parliament to:

 PN MP and Home Affairs spokesperson Darren Carabott said Gafa’s time in office had been characterised by “serious deficiencies” that led to a lack of enforcement and demoralised officers within the police force.
 “Labour’s failure to remove the commissioner led to the police force’s reputation being tarnished, with resources, recruitment and motivation all declining,” Carabott said in a statement.
 The PN has criticised the current commissioner on several occasions. It said that while the government had ignored calls to sack him, it now had a perfect opportunity to change leadership.
 “There are several people in the country capable of filling this important role and who would be willing to act when their country needs them to,” the PN said.
 “The PN believes this is an opportunity for both sides of the House to identify a unanimous choice (for police commissioner) who is capable of working in Malta’s favour and work without fear or favour.”
 Gafa was appointed police commissioner in June 2020 and was the first commissioner to be appointed following a public call. He previously served as CEO of the police force, having spent a career as a police investigator and inspector.
 He succeeded Lawrence Cutajar as commissioner.

 An explosives team was called to the Labour Party headquarters at around 8am on Thursday after security personnel spotted ""a small device"" on the ground outside the Ħamrun building.
 Neighbours meanwhile reported they heard ""a small explosion"" in a dustbin outside the headquarters at around 2am.
 Nobody was injured but the people inside the building were evacuated on Thursday morning 
 A large police contingent turned up on site and the road was closed while investigations were ongoing.
 By 1pm people were given the all clear to re-enter the building.
 
 PL president Ramona Attard said a small explosion was heard in the early hours on Thursday and the place was evacuated: ""We are very calm and letting the police and the AFM bomb squad do their work"".
 Prime Minister Robert Abela meanwhile said on Facebook the small explosion was heard at night. He urged for calm.
   Bernard Grech and the Nationalist Party expressed solidarity with the PL in a statement.
 Grech offered his support to Abela, deploring the act and saying he hoped that those responsible were caught.
 The party also asked for police to comb the surrounding area of the PN headquarters because of the ""risk of similar action"".
 It later thanked the armed forces and police for their work.

Repubblika: Abela's 'authoritarian and fascist' statements a threat to democracy,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/repubblika-abela-authoritarian-fascist-statements-threat-democracy.1092047,21-06-2024,003048.png,"Updated 12.52pm with Aditus Foundation statement below.
 Repubblika said on Tuesday it would resist the prime minister's ""hostile take-over of democracy and justice,"" describing his statements in the wake of the Vitals inquiry report as  ""authoritarian and fascist"".
 ""Even before news emerged of the inquiry's conclusion, Prime Minister Robert Abela launched a coordinated and emphatic public campaign targeting the inquiring magistrate as a ""member of the establishment"" explicitly accusing her of inflicting partisan retribution on Joseph Muscat and the Labour Party,"" the rule of law NGO said.
 ""Several government officials have taken up these remarks to initiate an online and real-world campaign of victimisation of the inquiring magistrate. Labour Party media has also published photos of the inquiring magistrate, targeting her for hatred and intimidation and exposing her to a credible risk of violence.""
 ""Once again we see a coordinated effort conducted from the Office of the Prime Minister and led by the incumbent in that office, to undermine the credibility of anyone taking the evidence of bribery and corruption to their logical and legal conclusion, to threaten them, to intimidate them, and to ensure that people reasonably suspected of crime and corruption and any political associates with them continue to enjoy impunity. The Daphne Caruana Galizia inquiry found this conduct to be the cause of her killing, for which the inquiry found the Maltese state responsible.""
 The NGO observed that Abela had also publicly claimed that as the executive branch leader, he served as ""a check and balance"" over the judiciary.
 ""This is a power the constitution, in seeking basic separation of powers, is explicit in not wanting the executive to have, especially considering that this outrageous intervention by the government is intended to protect politically powerful individuals from facing criminal prosecution. The Prime Minister’s conduct amounts to a gross assault on judicial independence and the rule of law,"" Repubblika said.
 It added that it could not stand idly by as the prime minister assaulted judicial independence and undermined equality before the law in his interests and the interests of his party. ""We will resist this attack and we will stand by state officials of conscience"".
 Its statement comes one day after Abela held a press conference to confirm that prosecutors have filed criminal charges against his predecessor Joseph Muscat and others. 
 
 Abela used the press conference to emphasise that the accused are innocent until proven guilty and implied that the magisterial inquiry that triggered criminal charges was biased and had treated them unfairly. 
 He also took digs at individual journalists who were there to report on the event and ask him questions, prompting condemnation from the Institute of Maltese Journalists.
 He, Muscat and Labour media have pushed the line that the magistrate who led the inquiry is part of an ""establishment"" that wants to secretly control the country and harm the Labour Party. 
 The Aditus Foundation in a separate statement on Tuesday also criticised the prime minister's remarks, describing them as a vile attacks on the judiciary and journalists.
 ""The prime minister’s speech left no room for interpretation. It was a direct and unequivocal undermining of people and positions simply because he is not comfortable with their activities. A prime minister should under no circumstance exploit his power to shame, bully or intimidate anyone. When the targets are the judiciary and journalists, the entire nation should rise up in their defence and claim 'Enough!'” Aditus said.

Jason Micallef’s deputy leader bid divides Labour ranks,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/jason-micallef-deputy-leader-bid-divides-labour-ranks.1096291,08-04-2024,"003056.png,003057.png","Jason Micallef’s decision to contest for the post of deputy leader has been met with enthusiasm and scepticism, highlighting divisions within the party.
 The former party general secretary’s declaration has sparked enthusiasm among several delegates and grassroots supporters but stirred unease among the moderates who fear it will lead to a messy contest and accentuate the cracks.
 Hours after confirming he was running for the position, Micallef’s Facebook post was liked by almost a thousand well-wishers, flooded with comments and shared many times.
 Among those publicly praising his integrity and achievements were employees of the Labour media wing ONE. Those endorsing him include the party’s new MEP Daniel Attard and Charlon Gouder, lawyer for former leader Joseph Muscat.
 
 But the vocal show of support masks the division the announcement has caused.
 Robert Abela’s response was less than enthusiastic. 
 Asked about Micallef’s possible return during an interview on Thursday, the prime minister said Labour Party delegates should not “turn back the clock”.
 “Jason Micallef gave his contribution in the past and I feel he still has a lot to give. If this rumour is true, then it is up to the party delegates to pass judgment,” he told Lovin Malta.
 Abela urged the delegates to ensure the party continues to open up to appeal to moderate voters and become more accessible to a wider band of voters.
  On Saturday morning, Micallef resorted to Facebook to thank delegates and others for the “highly positive reactions” and the “wonderful sense of enthusiasm that my candidacy has sparked and that has not been felt for a long time”.
 He also pointed fingers “at the PN and its extremist factions, such as Repubblika"" and “the usual chorus in the so-called independent media” for “fabricating stories and other narratives fed to them by hidden hands.”
 Micallef said the positions he held within the Labour ranks were always entrused to him by the delegates and will continue to trust in their good and sincere judgement.
 Times of Malta spoke to several party delegates, MPs and officials to gauge their reaction.
 One party delegate told Times of Malta that while Micallef is known to be popular with the party’s grassroots, he made several enemies along the way.
 “Some adore him, others disdain him,” said another delegate.
 One official said: “With Jason as deputy leader, the party is set to shrink rather than grow. He is very partisan by nature, a quality required only in the right doses at the right times.”
 Another party insider did not mince his words: “It would be a disaster to elect Jason. We’d be handing the election to the Nationalist Party on a plate.”
 They pointed out that Micallef was among the ringleaders calling Labour supporters to gather outside court in Valletta to support Joseph Muscat, when he was charged over the hospitals privatisation deal.
  “I am not keen on having a deputy leader who is so tribal, who cannot distinguish between the good of the state and the upkeep of the rule of law from the interests of the party.”
 A former Labour MP said “there will be friction at the party’s helm if Jason is elected because he is highly opinionated.  This is not necessarily negative but Robert [Abela] likes to be surrounded by ‘yes men’.
 “Jason is not the greatest fan of the Abela administration.  Everybody knows this.”
 Announcing his candidacy, Micallef highlighted that before taking the plunge he had spoken at length with several people in the party, including Abela, and other officials. 
 But a former PL official said it is an open secret that Micallef has a history with the prime minister’s father, George, who had contested the Labour leadership against Muscat in 2008.
 In 2008, while on Xarabank, Micallef reminded delegates that George Abela had “abandoned the party mid-way through the [1998] election”.
 This was a reference to Abela objecting to prime minister Alfred Sant’s call for a snap election. Abela stood down as deputy leader and Labour lost the election.
 After the narrow Labour electoral defeat in 2008, George Abela had called for a detailed report analysing the responsibility for the loss, an apparent dig at Micallef, who had overseen the party’s electoral campaign as general secretary.
 Fast forward to 2024 and speculation is mounting that Abela may be considering proposing an amendment to the party’s statute which would allow members of parliament to contest the post of deputy leader for party affairs.
 One source said a change in the statute would allow an MP to take on the post, indicating Abela wants a deputy leader for party affairs who is more attuned to carry out his programme without question.
 “Besides, Abela does not want a deputy who has remained close to Muscat even though, ironically, it was Muscat who had elbowed Micallef out of the party structures in 2008.
 Micallef remains the only candidate so far to have confirmed running for the post of deputy leader for party affairs, made vacant by the resignation of Daniel Micallef in June.
 Other names being touted are former MEPs Josianne Cutajar and Claudette Abela Baldacchino, and former PL CEO Gino Cauchi.
 In September, party delegates must also elect a deputy leader for parliamentary affairs to take over from Chris Fearne. Minister Ian Borg is considered the clear frontrunner.
 Nominations for both posts open on August 23, while the party’s general conference has been scheduled between September 13 and 15.

 On Monday,  Times of Malta reported that according to leaked corporate records, Steward Health Care funded a campaign to smear the former health minister through  “fake” corruption claims.
 Steward allocated costs for its spy operations to its Malta budget, which was primarily funded by taxpayers under the €90-million-euro per year hospitals' contract.
 The records were obtained by OCCRP and shared with Times of Malta and the  Boston Globe. 
  Hours after the relevations, the prime minister reassured reporters outside parliament had always trusted Fearne.
 Challenged by reporters about a speech in parliament last year in which he appeared to defend Steward, Abela said that on that day he had merely highlighted the work the company had carried out in Malta.
 During a tumultuous parliamentary session in  March of last year, Abela had defended the government’s actions in the wake of the collapse of the fraudulent hospitals deal and had highlighted the work carried out by Steward over the years.
 On Monday he insisted he had not defended Steward, and had no intention to do so, ""especially if what was reported today is true"".
 On the contrary, he would be asking lawyers seeking to recoup funds handed to Steward for which no services were provided, to look into the claims revealed and recover any funds used for the smear campaign.

 Zammit, who had built up a reputation for speaking out against environmental destruction and overdevelopment, last year announced that he had resigned from his position as Mayor and as president of Labour's Gozitan Regional Committee after a 23-year career in politics. 
 At the time he had explained briefly that he had come to this decision in order to not be a burden to others. He had previously said he believed the construction sector was out to ""eliminate"" him politically.  
 But in a Facebook post on Friday, Zammit said he was approached by many citizens who encouraged him to return to politics. 
 Expanding on his previous decision to resign, he said that at the time he wanted to take a ""strong position"" to highlight the need for reform in the country's approach to environmental protection and a desire to see a change in the way business and politics interact. 
 He added that he also wanted to see more power and funding diverted towards local councils. 
 Zammit said he wanted to remain an active voice insisting on change in local politics, and had therefore decided to run for office once again on behalf of the Labour Party.
 ""I'm not doing this because I've been given some promotion or promised a position somewhere, as some may think,"" he said. 
  ""I'm doing this simply because politics is in my blood and Xagħra is in my heart."" 
  Shortly after Zammit resigned last year, Prime Minister Robert Abela said he had kept in communication with the former mayor and was working to resolve the issues that prompted his resignation. 
 In an interview with Times of Malta in 2022, Zammit accused the construction lobby of trying to  tank his political career after a poor showing at the general election that same year. 
 At the time he had said that he was frustrated by the electorate's short-sightedness on over-development in Gozo and more focused on the immediate gains that property speculation could net them. 
 He also claimed that certain developers threatened to silence him because his candidacy was perceived as a spoke in their wheels.

Union bosses hit out at 'politically motivated' budget-themed lockscreen,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/public-sector-workers-greeted-budgetthemed-lockscreen.1100341,31-10-2024,"003328.png,003329.png,003330.png,003331.png,003332.png,003333.png","The heads of two unions have hit back at the government broadcasting a budget-themed image on public sector devices earlier this week, calling the move politically motivated and unrelated to public sector jobs. 
 The pink-to-turquoise lockscreen, which appeared on public sector devices the day after the government announced Budget 2025, was emblazoned with the slogan ‘A country of quality’ (“Pajjiż ta' Kwalita”).
 The image also shows the public service logo and a QR code linking to a budget slogan-titled Facebook video showing interviewees discussing aspects of life in Malta they want to see improve, followed by a segment featuring Prime Minister Robert Abela.
 In an apparent nod to the government’s recently launched document ‘Malta Vision 2050’, Abela suggests a revised economic model will achieve such aims.
 “I’ve understood your thoughts, your priorities and your concerns. And since our country’s economy has progressed so greatly, now is the time to choose quality over quantity,” Abela says.
 “I want to see our country move to one that prioritises quality as this is the only way to enjoy the best.”
 UHM Voice of the Workers trade union CEO Josef Vella said the lockscreen represented an “imbalance in how power is exercised.""
 “I don’t think this is an apolitical message. This is another way of imposing your message... [and] an imbalance in social dialogue,” he said.
 Stressing “no marketing agency has the power to reach 34,000 people at the touch of a button,” Vella noted the union was not able to communicate with its members through official channels, with emails sent to workers’ government email addresses undelivered or bounced back.
 “But the government can communicate with its employees with a political message. We weren’t born yesterday,” he said.
  The topical image was first flagged by teachers, who reached out to Times of Malta to report its appearance on screens earlier this week.
 Malta Union of Teachers' president Marco Bonnici said the union disagreed with computers displaying “material unrelated to schools”, adding it had contacted the education ministry about the issue.
 A public service spokesperson said such lockscreen images were normal, with images related to vaccination programmes, mental health, green initiatives and employee programmes, among other topics, circulated on public service devices every few days.
 “We don’t find it contradictory; it’s an official government document and a budget for all the nation,” the spokesperson said. “It’s a true copy of the document presented in parliament.”
 Stressing the image was “non-political”, he emphasised the public service was a “major participant” in forecasting and implementing budget measures, adding it had received no official complaints about the image.
 Addressing teacher concerns, the spokesperson noted that as public sector workers, educators were “part of the government service” and “affected by the budget”.
 He said the video linked to the QR code was the ""official video"" explaining this year's budget slogan and was shown on the Malta government website.
  The spokesperson said the lockscreen would be replaced by a new image by Monday, adding this was not the first budget announcement to prompt the appearance of such an image.
 The lockscreen remains on public sector computer screens at the time of publication.
 This week, residents also received leaflets by post-advertising budget measures, highlighting those affecting taxation, education, family allowances, and elderly care, among others.
  Earlier this week, a court ordered PBS to halt a broadcasting political spot in connection with the budget after the PN claimed it was unconstitutional. 
 The court presided by Judge Miriam Hayman directed the Broadcasting Authority to oversee PBS content and ensure it avoids broadcasting any partisan spots, in accordance with legal standards.
 Finance Minister Clyde Caruana announced a slew of measures for next year including widened tax bands and increases to the minimum wage and cost-of-living-allowance.
 Reacting to the announcement, Opposition leader Bernard Grech accused the government of using the budget to boost Abela’s popularity following the June elections and subsequent opinion polls.

 The campaign will also use television, radio, outdoor advertising and digital channels ""to engage the Maltese public with key historical moments that have shaped the nation's identity"".  
 Celebrations will then culminate in an official ceremony to be staged in St. George's Square, Valletta.

 The figures were provided by Culture Minister Owen Bonnici in reply to a parliamentary question by Nationalist Party MP Julie Zahra.
 The launch took place in March at the National Museum of Arts in Valletta.
 Bonnici said the launch event cost €72,383, excluding VAT.
 Zahra also asked Bonnici for a breakdown of spending on international journalists who travelled to Malta to cover the event.
 Bonnici said costs for journalists Angelica Christina, Villa Emily Watlington from Art in America and Anna Uclea were invited by Malta Biennale. 
 Returning flights for Villa cost €748 and flights for Watllington came to €928. Accommodation for Uclea added up to €1503. Costs for other journalists were covered by other entities or their employers.. 
 Zahra also asked Tourism Minister Clayton Bartolo for a breakdown of the costs of events and advertisements related to the Malta Biennale and if the events were sponsored by the Tourism Board. Bartolo said the information would be provided in a future sitting.
 Maltabiennale.art continued until the end of May It welcomed 80 artists from 23 countries whose works ranged from painting and drawing to installation, sculpture, and video. 
 The MaltaBiennale received criticism from the arts industry lobby MEIA, who slammed a “lack of professionalism” behind the large-scale event.
 It called on Heritage Malta, the Finance Ministry, the Heritage Ministry, and the Tourism Ministry to publish the research conducted and documentation of the event for which €1.7 million was allocated.
 The Nationalist Party also criticised the “disappointing” Malta Biennale, saying it was “more expensive” than the world-renowned  Venice Biennale.

 A vigil is also planned in his memory this evening in Gozo, while the PN will be running a special broadcast on its media channels. 
 Gouder, 45, a former PN MP and party stalwart, was found dead in Valletta earlier this morning. 
 Throughout his political career, he also served as St Julian's mayor, the chief operations officer of NET media and also served as the PN's campaign manager for last June's European Parliament and Local Council elections. 
 The PN said in a statement that all activities that the party had planned until this Sunday have been cancelled. 
 They described Gouder as a man of principle who sought to do good and not gain positions of power.
  Party leader Bernard Grech extended his condolences to Gouder's family and said that he was a personal friend and dedicated person towards the party.
 ""Karl will always be remembered by the PN as a person of principle who constantly sought how he could do good for others,"" they said. 
 ""His leadership in every role he occupied was always based on what was right and how improvements could be made. From his youth, Karl held various roles as his activism was always a means to make a difference.""
 They added that while Gouder had held various roles both on a national level as well as within the party, he had not been the one to seek them out. 
  ""He never sought these positions; rather, it was those who saw in him a person capable of providing guidance and direction who encouraged him to take on such roles,"" they continued, adding that this experience had prepared him to run for PN Secretary General. 
 ""The experience he gained over the years, all his knowledge and his energy were being channelled into this new role.""
 NET Television will be broadcasting a special programme honouring Gouder's memory this evening at 5.30pm. 
 Gozitan PN MP Alex Borg announced that a vigil is also being held in front of the PN club in Victoria at 7pm.

 As KM Malta Airlines opened bookings for discounted €90 flights back to Malta for the election, swathes of voters were left waiting for hours and the phone lines jammed up.
 With no alternative method to cast their ballot in the upcoming MEP and local council elections if they live overseas, Maltese expats who wish to vote must return to the island and do so in person.
 As Air Malta did before it, KM Malta also announced that it would offer discounted flights for Maltese citizens to encourage them to return home to vote. 
 However, as these reservations can only be made over the phone through KM Malta's call centre, callers found themselves facing long wait times in order to book their flights. 
 Maltese voters living overseas have repeatedly appealed to the government to  make voting easier, suggesting proxy, postal, or overseas ballot boxes used in other countries.
 ""They should have invested in a proper system where you would be able to vote online, just like other countries,"" said the voter who made over 200 phone calls.
 ""Having to redial over 200 times is incredibly frustrating considering I just want to exercise my duty and vote.""
  “Since 8am, the line has been busy, and I called at least 12 times, and I am still waiting,” said another Maltese voter in the Netherlands.
 A Times of Malta reporter made multiple attempts to call the listed number, but the line repeatedly went dead, and there was never a response.
 The extra flights and special fairs are only available through KM Malta Airlines and must occur in and out of the same city. The flights are available to book until June 8. Bookings are subject to availability. 
 
 Malta is one of just four EU member states, along with Ireland, Czechia, and Slovakia, that do not allow any form of overseas voting.
 The government has subsidised Maltese voters residing overseas to catch a flight to vote in person in Malta for several years.
 Times of Malta has contacted KM Malta Airlines for comment.

PN says Standards Commissioner mistake got minister off the hook,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/pn-says-standards-commissioner-mistake-got-minister-off-hook.1097565,09-03-2024,003509.png,"The Standards Commissioner has been asked by the PN to correct a mistake in a recent report about Energy Minister Miriam Dalli and ensure that the minister does not benefit from that mistake.
 The commissioner, former chief justice Joseph Azzopardi, last week found that a statement issued by the ministry breached the ministerial code of ethics by being politically ""partisan"".   
 The statement had hit back at criticism by the PN about projects led by Dalli’s ministry.
 The Standards Commissioner had said that since the minister had apologised, he considered the matter closed.
 In a statement on Tuesday, the Nationalist Party noted that the commissioner had said that Dalli was not responsible for the ministry at the time the statement was issued.
 This, it said, was a serious mistake. She was appointed minister on November 23, 2020 while the report was issued in January 2021, when Dalli was minister and therefore bound by the ministerial code of ethics.  
 The party said the Standards Commissioner therefore needed to correct his report and rather than close the case, he should send the report to the Parliamentary Standards Committee for its consideration.  
 Karol Aquilina, shadow minister for justice, said it was unacceptable for ministers who abused their position to get off the hook because of 'mistakes' by the Standards Commissioner. 
 PN MPs Mark Anthony Sammut and Ryan Callus have written to the speaker asking him to urgently convene the parliamentary committee for public standards.

Minister’s silence on Fort Chambray ‘unacceptable’ - Din l-Art Ħelwa,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/culture-minister-silence-fort-chambray-unacceptable-din-lart-helwa.1102534,16-12-2024,003513.png,"Heritage NGO Din l-Art Ħelwa has called on Heritage Minister Owen Bonnici to declare his position on controversial plans to demolish the historic Fort Chambray barracks in Għajnsielem, condemning his silence on the matter as “unacceptable”.
 Last week, the Planning Authority (PA) approved plans to demolish the historic barracks to make way for apartments and a five-star hotel, a decision which attracted considerable criticism from residents and NGOs alike.
 In a strongly worded statement on Monday, Din l-Art Ħelwa said it was shocked by Bonnici’s “noticeable silence” on the “alarming” decision and called on him to take a stand on the issue.
 “As the representative tasked with safeguarding Malta’s rich cultural heritage, it is imperative that the minister voices his position on such a critical matter that affects not only our history but also our identity as a nation,” the statement read.
 “The silence is deafening and sends a concerning message about the value afforded to our heritage and to the voices of those who wish to protect it”, the NGO said.
 ""We call on the Minister to clarify his position and reaffirm his commitment to the preservation of our cultural patrimony... The people deserve transparency and action from their leaders"".
 The PA approved plans to demolish the barracks following a recommendation in favour of the plans by the PA case officer. The approval applies to two planning applications; one tasked with demolishing the barracks and the other the site's development.
 Gozitan developer Michael Caruana successfully applied to build 105 residential units and a five-star hotel comprising 64 en suite rooms and 50 apartments.
 Calling the barracks “integral to our collective memory and iconic in their aesthetic,” Din l-Art Ħelwa said in its statement the loss of the historic buildings would be a “significant cultural loss”.
 Reacting to news of the approval last week, NGOs Din l-Art Ħelwa - Għawdex, Wirt Għawdex, Għawdix, and Moviment Graffitti slammed the PA for its “haste to recommend the destruction and development” of the fort.

Labour asks for Vitals magistrate’s recusal on Siġġiewi housing block cases,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/labour-asks-vitals-magistrate-recusal-siggiewi-housing-block-cases.1092071,05-07-2024,003521.png,"Magistrate Gabriella Vella has turned down a request by the Labour Party to recuse herself in several cases filed by the Nationalist Party to correct the electoral details of soon-to-be Siġġiewi tenants who switched their official addresses to yet-uninhabitable residences.
 Times of Malta revealed last month that a social housing block that is still under construction had  99 people registered to vote at that address, despite no one yet actually living in the building.
 The PN filed court applications calling for corrections to the electoral register in such a manner as to reflect the actual home addresses of some 99 voters.
 Those applications were assigned to various magistrates, including Magistrate Gabriella Vella.
 Six of the cases were scheduled for a first hearing on Tuesday.
 But the Labour Party, represented by its president Ramona Attard, voiced a request for the recusal of Magistrate Vella in light of the “public controversy” sparked recently in relation to the magistrate’s work on the Vitals inquiry.
 That inquiry “identified members and representatives of the Labour Party,” and issues arose over the timing of the conclusion of that inquiry which appeared to be linked to the June 8 elections.
 Those elections were the subject matter of the electoral applications which Magistrate Vella was now called upon to decide and that was why the party- as intervenor in the proceedings- was seeking her recusal, argued lawyer Pawlu Lia.
 Vella, who oversaw the recently concluded Vitals inquiry, has repeatedly come under fire from the Labour Party, particularly since it was confirmed that the inquiry recommended criminal action against former prime minister Joseph Muscat. 
 The attorney general has since filed charges against Muscat, as well as his former chief of staff Keith Schembri, former minister Konrad Mizzi and others. 
 Prime Minister Robert Abela has hit out at the magistrate several times, claiming the timing of the conclusion of the inquiry so close to the opening of nominations for the upcoming June 8 elections is suspect. 
 Faced with that request, Magistrate Vella observed that the court could not figure out how a decision concerning a correction of the electoral register could in any way be affected by the magistrate’s other duties as inquiring magistrate.
 This was a case of upholding or otherwise a request to correct details on the electoral register, not striking a voter off that register.
 The PL requested authorization to intervene in the proceedings filed by the PN and that request was upheld. That intervention had no bearing on the applicant’s request to correct the register.
 When all was considered Magistrate Vella deemed the recusal request as not justified.
 The cases were put off for the hearing of evidence next week.
 Lawyers Karol Aquilina and Joseph Grech are representing the applicant.

 The PN leader was speaking in Sliema and quoted a Times of Malta opinion piece written by the former Labour Party councillor and activist Desmond Zammit Marmara, titled “ Do Malta a favour, do not vote Labour”. 
 In the piece, Marmara wrote: 
 “If you love your political party and, above all, your country and wish for a better future, then you cannot by any stretch of the imagination vote Labour.”
 With weeks away from elections, Grech said he wanted to add to Marmara’s opinion. 
 “If you truly love this country, vote for the Nationalist Party,” he said. 
  “In this historic moment for our country, do not leave your fate and that of your family in the hands who betrayed you and this country.”
 Grech pointed out how on May 28, former Prime Minister Joseph Muscat and his former chief of staff Keith Schembri and former Minister Konrad Mizzi will appear in court. 
 The three and several others stand accused of bribery, trading in influence, money laundering and various other crimes in connection with the hospital privatisation deal. 
 The following day, May 29, former deputy prime minister Chris Fearne and Central Bank governor Edward Scicluna, who face fraud charges related to the same hospitals’ deal, will also appear in court.
 “Before they used to ask us for our evidence, and now we see they will be accused in our courts,” Grech said.
 He said Abela was continuing to defend this “corrupt group”, and continued to attack the judiciary, journalists and anyone who did not agree with him. 
  He said the front page of the Sunday Times of Malta once again showed how the government continued to work against the people. 
 According to a Times of Malta report, a €1 million “political support fund” created by Steward Health Care was suspected to have been set up to pass on bribes to Muscat, Schembri and Mizzi. 
 The funds were held by Accutor AG, a Swiss company suspected of being used as a centralised money-laundering hub for payments linked to the hospital deal involving Vitals and Steward.
 “You must understand, do you know how the biggest victim is from all this? It is you and the whole country,” he said. 
 “That is why on June 8, you will decide who should represent Malta in the European Parliament. Those people should make you proud to be Maltese, and not embarrass you.”
 Speaking about the local council elections, Grech asked how voters could vote for any Labour Party councillor candidate when Abela stole the councils' power and funding. 
 “How can we vote for a Labour candidate, when it is the same party that destroyed our towns with construction and never-ending traffic,” he asked. 
 “Abela tells you to close an eye to corruption and tells you that what is going on right now is irrelevant to the European Parliament elections,” he added. 
 “But you know that this is not the Malta and Gozo you want to live in. We are part of Europe, which means we share the same principles such as the safety of rights, truth, democracy and justice. We are a party that lives by these principles.”
 Turning to the pre-election cheques families have begun to receive, Grech said the government could not buy people through such incentives. 
 “When you receive this cheque, with half a smile, I know what you will be thinking,” Grech said. 
 “You will say, ‘thank you Prime Minister’ but I am not bought like those around you, and I will vote how I like!’’. 
 Grech also slammed the reality TV show that will star the Labour Party MEP candidates. The four-episode reality show will be broadcast on ONE and kicks off on May 27. 
  “So while his friend Muscat is being taken to court, Abela has decided to produce a reality show,” he said. 
 “I do not know whether to laugh or cry. People do not want to watch a reality show but they want politicians who are serious about the reality of life.”
 Grech said he was aware some people were unsure who they would vote for or if they would vote at all. He said while he respected the people’s decision, voters should not miss an important opportunity to vote for their future. 
 “Remember when you are in that polling booth, for those few seconds, power will be in your hands, and you have the power to vote for no more fraud, no more corruption and no more incompetence.” 
 He ended his speech, once more by asking for the people to vote for the Nationalist Party. 
 ""Vote for the PN candidates you believe in, the Nationalist Party is the only alternative. Any other vote is for Abela, and that is a lost vote.""
 MEP candidates Peter Agius and David Casa also addressed the crowd.

'PL government is comfortable with scandals’: Bernard Grech,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/pl-government-comfortable-scandals-bernard-grech.1097488,09-01-2024,003561.png,"The Labour government has reached a new level of mediocrity and is comfortable facing one scandal after another, PN leader Bernard Grech said on Sunday. 
 Grech was addressing party faithful on Net TV, days after lawyer and ex-MP Jason Azzopardi filed a new legal proceeding for a complex racket involving LESA officials that saw tourists unknowingly fined for traffic contraventions committed by local drivers. 
 News of the LESA racket came weeks after Azzopardi called for an “urgent” magisterial inquiry into claims that 18,000 ID cards have been issued since 2015 on the strength of documents fabricated by Identitá officials. A magistrate upheld Azzopardi’s request for the  inquiry.
  Grech said the PL government was built on secrecy to benefit itself.
 “[The government] wants to continue pigging out, so it does all it can to secure its position to do so.”
 Grech also slammed the decision to keep parliament closed for summer recess as the country faces one scandal after another. 
 “People need politicians to work, not have a three-month summer holiday,” he said, adding the PN will continue to add pressure on the government whether in or outside of parliament. 
 On Sunday Grech once again criticised home affairs minister Byron Camilleri and said every entity under his remit was linked to criminal scandals.
 Over the past weeks, Grech and the PN repeatedly called for Camilleri's resignation or removal from his role as minister.
 “Abroad, if a false identity card is revealed, the minister resigns and serious investigations are called for,” he said, claiming the government did not address the scandal because it was part of it. 
 “Where is prime minister Robert Abela and why has he not called for Camilleri to resign? What is he scared of? Why all this fear to take action?”
 On Sunday Grech referred to the upcoming budget, insisting the government must focus on an economic model based on quality, not quantity.
 He compared the current state of Malta to that of the 1970s.
 ""This government is comfortable with mediocrity - it doesn't matter if there is sewage outflow ruining our bays, traffic issues or an untenable situation in our hospitals and emergencies,"" he said.
 ""This is a government comfortable with having many scandals.""
 Asked to react to Michael Piccinino’s decision to step down from party general secretary, Grech said it was a “bittersweet moment”, adding he will miss their close working relationship. 
 The PN leader also referred to the PN’s upcoming Independence Day celebrations, themes ‘Il-Quddiem’. 
 He said the celebrations will not only focus on Malta’s 60 years of independence but also the future and a ew form of independence. 
 In a statement, the PL said Grech's ""cheap politics"" was ""baseless"".
 ""All he needs to do is look in the mirror and see a professional tax evader and a party that continued operating illegally. He did not even have the respect to honour an extension granted to him,"" the party said in reaction to the PN leader's comments. 
 A PL government had brought about big reforms, including within the social sector and the party will remain focused on addressing people's needs, the party added.

 An investigation was made following a complaint by shadow justice minister Karol Aquilina, who raised concerns about Abela and Attard having information about the magisterial inquiry into the death of Jean Paul Sofia while it was still in progress. 
 On that day that he announced a public inquiry into Sofia’s death, Abela revealed that the magistrate who was conducting the magisterial inquiry had asked for another extension. He had used the opportunity to criticise the delay, adding that “the government will not be held hostage by the courts”.  
 In his complaint, Aquilina said that Abela and Attard had no right to obtain the information they disclosed and this amounted to a breach of statutory duties and ethics as well as abuse of power and unlawful conduct. 
 In his reply, Attard had said that as justice minister it was his duty to communicate with the Attorney General after the expiration of the already extended one-month term of the magisterial inquiry and that the law permitted the attorney general to share the process verbal of the inquiry at her discretion and upon request. 
 Standards’ Commissioner Joseph Azzopardi said in his report that the prime minister had given an almost identical reply to Attard’s, adding that such information could not be described as confidential.
 Citing the relevant laws, Azzopardi said that it was ultimately the attorney general’s discretion whether to provide the process verbal to anyone.
 “It is not correct to claim that the prime minister and the justice minister obtained information they had no right to receive,” he said. 
 Abela and Attard had pointed out past instances where two ministers, Carmelo Mifsud Bonnici and Tonio Borg, had answered parliamentary questions about magisterial inquiries, Azzopardi observed. 
 “Providing information about the status of a magisterial inquiry - whether it is ongoing, has been concluded, or has had its term extended - does not constitute disclosure of the content of the minutes, documents, or evidence collected within it,” he said.
 “The provisions on confidentiality in the Criminal Code are crucial for the administration of justice, but they should not be applied more broadly than the law actually requires. There is no indication in this case that the prime minister or the minister for justice were given any content from the minutes.”
 Azzopardi therefore concluded that the complaint did not hold and that neither Abela nor Attard had been provided with any information that could not be disclosed. 
 In reaction to the report, the Labour Party said that the complaint to the standards commissioner reflected the behaviour of a vindictive Opposition focused on fake news and trying to score political points. 
 “The Opposition remains blinded by partisanship, focused solely on spreading baseless accusations,” it said. 
 “The truth has now come to light.”
 The Nationalist Party in a statement signed by Karol Aquilina, observed that while the prime minister had, for weeks, said that the magistrate requested more time for her inquiry, the standards commissioner declared that no such request needed to be made.
 She only needed to inform the attorney general that she needed more time, explaining her reasons.  
 The prime minister should therefore publicly apologise to the magistrate and promise not to attack the members of the judiciary again, Aquilina said.

 “Justice is taking place, but it is still a black day. We would all have preferred that this country did not experience what it went through today"" Grech said. It would have been better had Malta not been robbed of €400 million through the fraudulent hospitals deal. It would have been better had Malta's image not been harmed in this way, making it look like it was some sort of jungle where anything could happen, he said.  
  Speaking during a Net TV interview, Grech said the people who turned up to support Muscat outside the law courts were deceived and instigated to react in that way to intimidate the magistrate. 
 “The responsibility lies with whoever told them to go outside the law courts. It is a clear case of the end justifies the means, that those who want to protect Joseph Muscat at all costs will do so by intimidating the judicial process,” he said. 
 He also slammed Prime Minister Robert Abela for protecting his predecessor and for his 'dangerous rhetoric' over the past few days. 
 ""Where is this so-called trap,"" Grech asked, referring to Abela's previous claims that the PN was planning a ""trap"" for Labour supporters attending Tuesday's rally outside the courts.
 “As we have seen, even when the leader has changed, the machine stays the same. Changing the leader and their suit is not enough- the system is corrupt,” he said. 
 Grech reiterated his warning that a big electoral victory for Abela next month would encourage him to do as he pleased.  
 He also argued that now was not a time for a fight between the political parties, but for a fight against the corrupt group that had 'hijacked' Mintoff's workers' party. 
 
 ""Mintoff's party was a party for the workers, those who suffered and risked their life to put food on the table,"" he said. But that party had been turned into a machine intent on gathering a large enough majority to do what it wanted. 
 ""My appeal is that if we are to save this country, everyone, Nationalists, Labourites, and those who are in the middle, must come together to change Malta,"" he said.

 No public official should use their office to bestow unjustified privileges upon close associates or family members at the expense of public trust and resources, human rights NGO Aditus Foundation said. 
 It was reacting to a Commissioner for Standards report that established that Tourism Minister Clayton Bartolo and Gozo Minister Clint Camilleri abused their power and violated ministerial ethics by securing a lucrative public position for Bartolo’s wife, Amanda Muscat.
 Muscat, who originally served as Bartolo’s personal secretary, was elevated to a high-paying consultancy role in Camilleri’s Gozo Ministry. This transfer, found to be a “fictitious” arrangement, allowed Muscat to continue working within Bartolo’s Tourism Ministry while drawing a €68,000 salary as one of Camilleri’s persons of trust.
 Aditus joined the calls for the ministers' resignation and accountability to restore public trust in the integrity of the Maltese government.
 Bartolo’s justification of Muscat’s position that “in life, it is not just about diplomas or degrees” and that “experience alone” qualified her for the role is a vile affront to all hard-working people, Aditus director Neil Falzon said. 
 The minister failed to address the fundamental issue: his wife was unqualified for the role and did not perform the duties expected of her position.
 Aditus said it is further shocked by the Prime Minister’s laissez-faire attitude, choosing to stand by nepotism instead of defending Malta’s interests and good governance.
 “By allowing these ministers to remain in office, the government sends a worrying message that public office can be used for private gain without consequences.”
 Public office is a privilege to be exercised in service of the people, not as a means of securing benefits for personal connections, it added.

 Prime Minister Robert Abela announced during a meeting with the Chamber of SMEs on Friday. 
 Abela was discussing how the government had sought to tackle the growing waiting list for free IVF treatment by off-loading the service to private clinics. 
 However, in doing so they encountered an anomaly from the self-employed who found it difficult to avail themselves of these services, as they do not have leave benefits due to the nature of their work. 
  Ablea said that the government planned to address this by extending the paid leave entitlement given to couples in employment who undergo IVF treatment. 
 He said that this would be paid out in the form of an incentive that is roughly equivalent to 100 hours of paid leave at minimum wage. 
 Presently, couples undergoing IVF while in employment are entitled to 100 hours of leave paid in full by their employer, irrespective of whether the treatment is sought locally or overseas.
 If both prospective parents are employed, the person receiving the treatment shall be entitled to 60 hours of paid leave, while the other parent will be entitled to 40 hours. 
 If only one of the prospective parents is in employment, they are entitled to 60 hours if they are receiving the treatment themselves or 40 hours if they are not. 
 Abela said that this will similarly now apply to the self-employed in the same way. 
 According to the Department of Industrial and Employment Relations, couples shall be entitled to the full 100 hours of leave for up to a maximum of three processes.

 The Daphne Foundation said Muscat’s appointment appeared to violate Council of Europe prison rules, particularly rules 76 and 77 on the need for prison staff to be carefully selected, properly trained, and have the professional capacity and personal suitability for their role.

 Muscat occupies the position of head of strategy at Malta’s prison, a role that, until her suspension this week, put her in contact with those held in custody in connection with serious crime.
 ""Her directorship of companies linked to Ruja Ignatova’s One Coin scam and her appointments on multiple companies enabled by Iosif Galea, who now stands charged with financial crime, should have disqualified her from any role in the Correctional Services Agency,"" the foundation added.
 It pointed out that Muscat’s LinkedIn profile showed that her longest professional experience was as producer and presenter at ONE Productions Ltd and a ministerial aide.
 ""At best, her appointment to Malta’s prison service reflects yet another instance of the public service being abused to pay off ONE employees and others closely linked to the governing party to the detriment of the public interest it is meant to serve. At worst, the alleged abuse of her role to facilitate illicit meetings in prison for those accused of serious crime is suggestive that criminal, corrupt or unethical influence has infiltrated the structures that are meant to prevent it.""
 The foundation said it would be writing to the Commissioner of Police, the Minister for Home Affairs and to prison authorities to denounce these events and to raise questions about the method and purpose of Muscat’s appointment and how and why illicit or improper meetings in her office were enabled.

"Deny the allegation or resign, Repubblika tells prime minister",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/deny-allegations-or-resign-repubblika-tells-prime-minister.1097211,25-08-2024,003709.png,"Prime Minister Robert Abela should deny an allegation that he instructed police who they should interrogate in the Vitals inquiry, otherwise he should resign, Repubblika said on Sunday. 
 In a statement, the rule-of-law NGO referred to an article published in MaltaToday  that quoted “internal sources including senior ministers” who claimed that Abela had directed senior police officials not to interrogate individuals mentioned in the hospital corruption inquiry, in an attempt to protect former prime minister Joseph Muscat. 
 “We are not shocked by this allegation because, as we have long stated, the decisions of the police and the Attorney General in corruption cases make neither legal nor logical sense, but only make sense because they suit the government and the Labour Party.”
 Repubblika said that in criminal cases, the prime minister has no right to give instructions to the police, let alone when his friends are suspects in the crimes being investigated. 
 “These senior ministers are describing a blatant abuse of power, illegal conduct by a prime minister to protect criminal friends of his.”
 Repubblika criticised the ministers who witnessed the abusive and illegal behaviour for hiding behind anonymity. 
 “We call on the prime minister to deny the allegation that he gave instructions to the police on who they should or should not interrogate and who they should or should not bring to court.
 “If he does not do so, he should resign before nightfall”, Repubblika said.

Abela stands by Fearne: 'He will stay on as deputy PM',timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/abela-stands-fearne-he-stay-deputy-pm.1092131,21-06-2024,003716.png,"Updated 6pm
 Chris Fearne will remain as deputy prime minister unless an inquiry into the Vitals hospitals deal clearly links him to a crime, Robert Abela told parliament on Wednesday.
 “If Dr Fearne is mentioned in the inquiry conclusions but not in the body of the text, then I will continue to defend him to the end and he will stay on as deputy prime minister,” Abela said.
 The prime minister was speaking after Opposition leader Bernard Grech demanded an urgent parliamentary debate about the need for Fearne to resign.
 ""This is something of vital importance,"" Grech said. ""The public has the right not to be represented by people facing serious criminal charges."" 
 Fearne, who serves as deputy prime minister and EU Funds minister, is to be charged with fraud and misappropriation in connection with the €400m deal to privatise three state hospitals.
 As health minister, he oversaw the deal between 2019 and its end last year, taking over that role from Konrad Mizzi. He is among dozens of people to be prosecuted, though he said earlier on Wednesday that he has not yet been formally notified of the charges against him.
 Those prosecutions come as a result of a years-long magisterial probe into the deal which was concluded 10 days ago. The Nationalist Party has said everyone cited in the inquiry and who holds a public post should resign, singling out Fearne and Central Bank Governor Edward Scicluna, who will also be charged.
 Abela told parliament that it was too premature to discuss resignations, as it remained to be seen what the inquiry had actually found in relation to Fearne and others.
 He said he wanted to reiterate his calls for the Attorney General to publish the inquiry’s findings, saying he was keen to read it.
  Opposition leader Bernard Grech was not having it.
 Abela was again taking the country for a ride by implying he has not read the inquiry, he said, as he urged Speaker Anglu Farrugia to reprimand him for having lied to parliament.
 Grech also took aim at Abela’s defence of his deputy.
 
 “Godfrey Farrugia was sacked as health minister over a tent,” Opposition leader Bernard Grech told parliament on Wednesday. ““Now we have a former health minister charged over a €400m theft.”
 He was referring to Farrugia’s resignation as minister in March 2014, two months after he was publicly reprimanded by then-prime minister Joseph Muscat for having set up tents for influenza patients outside Mater Dei Hospital.
 Following deliberation, the Speaker refused the Opposition's motion. 
 “While the House shares Bernard Grech’s concerns, it is bound by the rules of the House,” Farrugia said. 
 According to parliament’s standing orders, a request for a minister to resign must end with a parliamentary vote, he said citing various rulings provided by parliament over the past 30 years concerning similar motions. 
 He said the Opposition should file an appropriate motion if it wanted to push for a resignation. 
 The ruling prompted an angry response from Grech, who said parliament was enabling the government through its rulings. 
 As the Speaker sought to shut him down and declared him out of order, the Opposition leader upped his objections.
 ""The deputy prime minister is out of order. The government is out of order. This parliament is out of order,"" he charged, in lines reminiscent of an iconic scene from 1979 drama And Justice For All.

New Property Market Agency to regulate market intermediaries,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/new-property-market-agency-regulate-market-intermediaries.1094404,24-06-2024,003718.png,"A new bill for the setting up of a Property Market Agency for the regulation of the property market went before parliament on Monday. 
 The main role of the agency will be to regulate the activities of property market intermediaries, real estate agents, property consultants and brokers. 
 The agency will also be tasked with making recommendations to the government concerning a national policy on property market intermediaries, issuing standards in respect of brokerage and related services in the property market; participating in discussions leading to development planning, monitoring the property market and act as regulator related to the property market.
 It will also promote educational campaigns, promote and coordinate the training of persons working as property intermediaries.
 The agency’s board will be formed of nine persons appointed by the minister responsible for property.
 The bill was moved by Justice Minister Jonathan Attard, who is also responsible for the properties sector. He explained that the new agency will take over the functions performed by the Licensing Board formerly established under the Real Estate Agents, Property Brokers and Property Consultants Act.  
 The new law provides that no person may work as a property broker or real estate agent or be employed or engaged as a branch manager, property consultant or specific property consultant unless he/she is in possession of a licence issued by the agency.
 
 People registered with the agency as occasional brokers will not require a licence as long as they, prior to any involvement in any transaction, seek approval from the agency before the commencement of any activity, according to the bill.
 Anyone who fails to comply with the provisions of the law shall be liable to an administrative penalty not exceeding €20,000 imposed by the agency.
 The bill further provides that in every contract concluded after December 1, 2024 where land is acquired, transferred or leased, the parties need to declare whether or not the services of a real estate agent, broker, occasional broker or property consultant were engaged and whether brokerage was due.
 Any party to a contract and any property broker who acts in contravention shall be liable to an administrative penalty of not more than €10,000.
 Every licensee and registered partnership will need to file an annual return indicating all transactions that carried received brokerage fees during the previous calendar year.
 The Administrative Review Tribunal shall be competent to hear and determine objections made by any person aggrieved by any decision of the agency.
 Attard said the bill would benefit not only property intermediaries but also buyers and those who invest in property. 
 PN MP Stanley Zammit said the Opposition would vote in favour of the bill, but the country should also be discussing the quality of the property market and the way property prices had soared. 
 The bill was unanimously given a second reading.

"PN calls for investment in CDAU building, professionals on Children's Day",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/pn-calls-investment-cdau-building-professionals-children-day.1101285,20-11-2024,003730.png,"The PN on Wednesday urged the government to address the ""disastrous situation"" at the CDAU by investing in a suitable building and in the professionals who provide therapy services for children there.
 The Child Development Assessment Unit (CDAU) offers treatment and speech, physio and occupational therapy to children with various difficulties, such as autism, global developmental difficulties, learning difficulties, ADHD, cerebral palsy, head injuries, down syndrome and other conditions.
 Addressing the media outside the CDAU premises at St Luke's Hospital on World Children’s Day, three PN spokespeople said the unit currently operated from a neglected building within the old hospital.
 Graziella Attard Previ, Adrian Delia and Ivan Bartolo said that despite over 4,000 children relying on the various services provided by the unit, the clinic did not offer a suitable environment for vulnerable children.
 Attard Previ said young children - especially those requiring help during the crucial first five years of their lives - were assessed at the unit. Such assessments were critical in determining the best plan for their development, and these children deserved the best possible environment – not a neglected building with a malfunctioning lift and unpleasant surroundings.
 She urged the government not to attempt patchwork fixes – temporary solutions, she said, were not an option.
 Moreover, there were currently long waiting times for children to see a psychologist and receive the necessary report to secure the help they need at school.
 There are also difficulties in providing consistent therapy sessions, whether from speech-language pathologists, occupational therapists, or physiotherapists, she added.
 ""Appointments are infrequent, and sometimes even cancelled, all to the detriment of the children’s development. Parents often have no choice but to seek private therapy. Despite all this, the government remains indifferent,"" she said. 
 Delia meanwhile said that a nurturing environment, welcoming buildings, and suitable spaces were essential to creating the best atmosphere for children, offering them comfort and reassurance.
 ""Despite claims to the contrary, the reality is that in this area, we remain significantly behind due to the lack of necessary investment to support those who cannot fend for themselves.""
 Bartolo spoke about child poverty, noting that despite economic growth in recent years, there has been an increase in the social gap.
 ""This social divide is leading to a rise in the number of families depending on food banks and soup kitchens, as well as an increase in homelessness due to reasons such as domestic violence, financial problems, and mental health issues.
 ""The situation is even worse for those reliant on social benefits and renting accommodation. In such cases, children suffer the most, often becoming nomads moving from place to place,"" Bartolo said.
 The shadow minister added that while there was a long waiting list for social housing assistance, there were also children living in garages because their parents could not afford the high rents.
 The solution, he said, was to prioritise education to break the cycle of poverty within families that have fallen behind in life, and ensure these individuals are not exploited.
 ""Eradicating poverty is the responsibility of politicians,"" Bartolo insisted.

"'PM complicit in Vitals saga: he knew about fraud but did nothing,' Grech claims",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/pm-complicit-vitals-saga-knew-fraud-nothing-grech-claims.1093054,26-05-2024,"003795.png,003796.png","Bernard Grech accused Robert Abela Sunday of being “complicit” in the Vitals scandal, claiming the Prime Minister knew the deal was corrupt for at least three years and failed to act on it. 
 The Opposition leader was addressing a political activity in Mellieħa, where he praised media houses for choosing to reveal the details of the process verbal of the Vitals magisterial inquiry. 
 The Sunday Times of Malta reported extensively on how investigators who combed through the deal which saw the privatisation of three state hospitals found  signs of crime everywhere they looked. 
 The newspaper also details how Keith Schembri and Konrad Mizzi are suspected of planning to secretly own a company that exclusively supplied these hospitals with medicine and medical equipment.  
 Referring to the inquiry on Sunday, Grech said Abela has been attacking the judiciary and the media intently because he did not want the public to know what the content of the inquiry found. Nevertheless, the truth has been outed, he said.
 “Today we found out that Abela, while he was already prime minister, has known for at least three years that the deal was fraudulent because one of the people accused had told him about it,” Grech claimed. 
 “We know - black on white - that someone informed him that there was fraud. That’s why he didn’t want you to find out what’s in the inquiry, but today we know that he was complicit”. 
  Abela, Grech continued, had made a “pact with the devil” to be made prime minister and the public was finally watching it unravel before its eyes because “there is no honour among thieves”. 
 The more these deals unravel, the more we learn how detrimental they were to the public, Grech said. 
 “With every word, this inquiry hammers home confirmation that this country has been overtaken by a criminal mafia establishment,” he said. 
 “This is a prime minister who has been completely taken over. He threw you, your children and our country away to save himself. He wants to buy your vote so that after June 8 he can throw you away again,” Grech said, referring to the timing of tax rebates and announcement of new financial grants close to the election date. 
 “This is why we know that you have had enough and that there are thousands who remain silent but cannot take it anymore,” he added, noting that even staunch Labour supporters were telling him they were fed up with the PM’s behaviour. 
  During his rally, Grech again addressed Abela’s claim that the PN was setting a “trap” for Labour supporters who intended to  turn up outside court to support Joseph Muscat on Tuesday. 
 Muscat, Keith Schembri and Konrad Mizzi are to appear in court to face charges of corruption, money laundering and criminal association, among other serious crimes, related to the hospitals' deal. 
 Dredging up Labour’s history of political violence, Grech said it was “shameful” for the PM to make such claims, when historically it has been the PN and its supporters who suffered violence at their hands.
 “Are you trying to make sure that trouble happens and then try to blame us for it,” Grech said. 
 “You killed Raymond Caruana,” he continued, raising his voice to agitation, as the crowd responded with angry shouting. 
 “It was the PN who suffered tear gas, who were beaten and arrested for nothing while Labour was in government.”
 “It was under your party that the police and the AFM beat us and shot at us because we wanted to hold a mass meeting in Żejtun. Be ashamed if you even remember how to.” 
 The PN’s government was the one that ended political violence once and for all, he continued, striving for peace and to build bridges, even appointing Abela’s father George as president. 
 Abela has the gall to accuse the PN of fomenting violence when the assassination of Daphne Caruana had happened under Joseph Muscat’s watch, he added.
 The trap accusation is a “total fabrication” because despite Abela’s so-called concern he had not even bothered to go to the police with his information, Grech said. 
 “When you uttered this lie I asked you to go to the police. If you were a man of integrity and worthy of the office you hold, you would have done it to protect your citizens,” he said. 
 “Now it has been five days since I asked him to go to the Police Commissioner, and you know what, he hasn’t gone, because either he knows that he lied or he has no faith in the Police Commissioner.” 
 “He obviously didn’t go because he knows he’s lying,” Grech added with finality.

 Cremona had spent the past months leading the organisation as its acting president, following the resignation of Robert Aquilina.
 She was formally appointed to the post at a special members’ meeting held on Friday. Renato Camilleri will serve as vice president, with Aquilina serving as honorary president.
 Cremona is a professor at the University of Malta's Theatre Studies department and a former ambassador to France. It is her second stint as Repubblika president: she also led the organisation in 2019-2020.
  In a speech, Cremona pledged to give the NGO’s education and citizenship initiatives a push and to involve Repubblika’s executive committee members more actively in its work.
 The NGO also needed help from its rank-and-file members, she said. Help needed ranged from expertise in areas such as the economy, science and education to more mundane tasks like ringing up NGO members.
 Cremona said she would also like Repubblika to engage more directly with integrity institutions such as the office of the Ombudsman, parliamentary standards commissioner and National Audit Office.
 The NGO, she revealed, has plans to create a “political observatory” focused on governance-related policy proposals.
 “It’s hard to understand why parliament needs urgent reform or laws like the whistleblower act need to change. We’ve issued policy papers about some of these issue but we need to apply more pressure for the government and politicians to listen and take concrete action,” Cremona said.
 She ended with a note of pride.
 “It’s an honour to see this ‘ragtag bunch [erbgħa qtates] that we make up have an impact on the rule of law in our country. Together and one step at a time we will achieve a clean Malta,” Cremona said.

 “I have learnt secrets about the European Parliament that I didn’t know before,” Agius admits. 
 Having worked at the European Council and having served as a member of parliament president Antonio Tajani’s secretariat, Agius is no stranger to Brussels and Strasbourg. 
  For four years he also served as head of the European Parliament Office in Malta.  
 He was elected to the European Parliament on the Nationalist Party ticket in June, at the second attempt, and he now sits with the European People’s Party MEPs.
 “I have learnt how deals are struck within one’s own group and how essential they are. I have learnt that collaboration between delegations and MEPs is key if one is to make headway. These are things which I had taken for granted but now I understand they are key to my performance in parliament.”
 Agius underscores the importance of forging alliances within the European Parliament. 
 “The new MEPs are all in this boat together and we sympathise with each other. I need allies in all the European Parliament’s committees if I want to advance the interests of the Maltese and the Gozitans,” he says. 
 He believes that mutual understanding and support are crucial. “From experience, I can say that when people understand your position, they are more prone to support you.”
 Agius is committed to addressing “bread and butter issues” that impact the daily lives of his constituents. 
 “I will be working on the internal market, consumer standards, food safety… the primary sectors like agriculture and fisheries,” he explains. 
 Agius believes his proactive approach includes participating in any committee discussing matters relevant to Malta, even if he is not an official member. 
 “The European Parliament allows one to be present on all committees. I may participate in a committee of which I am not officially a member. That is why I mentioned alliances. Even if I am not a member of the industrial or the energy committees, I will use the presence of my colleagues and other MEPs in other political groups to voice my position.”
  Agius also advocates for better coordination among MEPs. 
 “It is not a bad idea to have a structured forum in which we could coordinate our positions. But it may make even more sense to have a platform that would bring together the MEPs with the social partners. It may well be that such meetings are organised in an informal way,” he suggests. 
 He sees potential for collaboration with MEPs from the opposing Labour Party on committee levels, despite acknowledging inherent limitations due to differing priorities.
 Agius’ primary focus remains the safeguarding of Malta’s national interests. 
 “We have to keep an eye on the national interest in each and every proposal made by the European Commission. We must carry out impact assessments on the Green Deal, on proposals on transport, agriculture,” he emphasizes. 
 He highlights the unique challenges faced by Malta, such as the small size of its farms compared to those in larger EU countries like Poland. “We have to make sure that the European Union understands our reality… and that each proposal takes note of Malta’s needs.”
 Recognising the importance of raising awareness about Malta’s specific circumstances, Agius is committed to ensuring that the EU appreciates the unique challenges faced by smaller member states. 
  “Often, this does not happen enough because it requires a lot of work. We need to raise awareness in the EU much more than other countries.” To this end, Agius is actively building relationships with MEPs from countries with similar situations to Malta. 
 “The situation in the Netherlands and the Czech Republic may be more similar to ours than to Germany and Italy. That is why I have tried to meet the Cypriot MEPs, because their situation is much closer to ours,” he notes.
 In his new role, Agius is determined to navigate the complexities of the European Parliament, forging alliances, and advocating for Malta’s interests with unwavering commitment. 
 He is trying to use his experience and proactive approach to make a significant impact on behalf of his constituents.
 Agius ran in the 2019 MEP elections but his nearly 10,474 first-count votes were not enough to get him elected then.
 Last June Agius obtained 9,418 first-count votes and ranked second among the PN’s candidates behind EP president Roberta Metsola, from whom he inherited another 11,643 votes which propelled him into winning the much coveted third seat for his party.

The Maltese: among the most worried and stressed in the world – report,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/the-maltese-among-worried-stressed-world-report.1094664,07-01-2024,003855.png,"The Maltese are the fourth biggest worriers in the world, according to recently released polling data.
 Almost two-thirds (63%) of the Maltese reported feelings of worry, while more than half (55%) reported feeling stressed, according to the Global Emotions 2024 report from polling company Gallup.
 Only Afghanistan, Israel and Guinea reported higher levels of worry than Malta, while just nine countries out of the 142 surveyed reported feeling more stressed.
 
 But with the European Commission describing Malta’s economy as robust and growing and US-based monitor Freedom House scoring the country highly for civil liberties and political rights, why are we so worried?
 “There’s a sense of impending doom,” said anthropologist and University of Malta associate professor David Zammit.
 “There’s a sense Malta is becoming less livable, and that partisan politics are taking us towards a mafia state and increased environmental degradation,” he said.
 Describing the country as “overcrowded”, Zammit said the increased population had placed “tremendous strain” on Malta’s infrastructure, which, when combined with a more materialistic culture, was making people feel more stressed.
 “We’ve definitely become more consumerist, more capitalist... We’re overcrowded, highly competitive and the space we inhabit is becoming more and more hostile,” he said, describing the country as being in “mimetic conflict”.
 Mimetic theory is the idea that people’s desires are influenced socially and decided collectively; simply put, we want what we want because others want them.
 Emphasising the importance of the environment, Zammit said environmental constraints had led to some residents being forced to “live next to building sites for years”.
 A survey in June last year found 72% of respondents said they were concerned about the state of the environment, with other concerns including traffic (87%), cost of living (83%), construction (80%) and corruption (71%).
  Meanwhile, a separate study the same year found the biggest issue on young people’s minds in Gozo was the environment, with those surveyed wanting more environmental protection and green spaces and less construction.
 Weighing in on the Gallup findings, economist Marie Briguglio said the country’s results came despite a strong performance in the UN Human Development Index (HDI).
 Malta scored “very high” and above France and Spain in the index which combines life expectancy, education levels and GDP per capita to assess and rank countries, according to the most up-to-date data available at the HDI website.   
 “We urgently need to examine and address this disparity which has worsened over recent years,” said Briguglio.
 “Judging by Malta’s performance on other global indicators this may be linked to urbanisation, noise, population density, accidents at work and even perceptions of corruption”, she said.
 “These impact the way governance at large is perceived and that in turn affects most areas of life. Well-being is not just about the nation doing well materially on average. It’s about how people feel day to day.”
 Despite the high levels of worry and stress in the country, Malta scored well in other indicators in the Gallup survey, with just over one in five saying they felt angry.
 Respondents were asked if they had felt certain emotions “during a lot of the day” before the poll to gauge levels of stress, worry and other emotions.
 Around 1,000 respondents in 142 countries were surveyed last year by phone or in person.

 ""In its 103 years of existence, the party has always dealt with forces that are out to destroy it and which would do anything to destroy it,"" the former senior minister told Facebook followers.
 ""But the biggest damage to the PL was always done by those within it who used the party for their own personal interests - to fatten their pockets.""
 
 Bartolo's comments come hours after ex-PM Joseph Muscat, former OPM chief-of-staff Keith Schembri and former minister Konrad Mizzi pleaded not guilty to bribery, corruption and other crimes. The three were among 14 individuals and nine companies charged during a historic court hearing on Tuesday.
 Throughout the day, hundreds spent hours outside the court building to show support for the former PL PM.
 Another 14 individuals, two companies and a legal firm - including former minister Chris Fearne and Central Bank Governor Edward Scicluna - are being charged in court  on Wednesday.
  On Wednesday morning, the former education and foreign affairs minister said the PL was being pulled in different directions by different people, just like a ship caught in a storm.
 He warned of a lack of strong leadership that would otherwise set the party on a new route for the good of the country and the party.
 Bartolo said that while the party will manage to secure more votes than the PN in the upcoming elections, it has ""serious long-term problems"" because of a growing gap between the party and parts of society.
 While the party still had the support of those on low income and who had primary and secondary level education, it was ""losing the support of those earning a monthly €2,000 and more and who have post-secondary and tertiary education"".
 ""This is not a good sign. A party that wants to represent the state and the government, cannot have a tribal culture representing only part of the population.""
 ""The PL has often faced outside enemies: the British colonial government, a conservative Church and the local social class that believes it has the divine right to eternal rule.
 ""When the party did not have internal enemies, the PL managed to come out victorious against the external enemy.
 ""It lost elections when it lost wide support because of internal enemies that used the party for their own gain,"" he warned.
 Bartolo urged the party to stop the loss of support by addressing the ""serious problems created by enemies within: not just when it comes to political leadership and corruption, but also when it comes to the huge economic growth that brought about wealth and job opportunities but also burdened local infrastructure"".

 Dad demanded us to stop and we clambered into the car, petulant, in grief. No one would have ever predicted what we would experience in the next couple of hours. 
 Dad drove the 1.2-litre, Soviet petrol-engine car with pride. On that day, a sense of secrecy and immediacy prevailed. Continuing to bicker at the back of the car, we finally arrived at our destination. 
 To give context, Malta in the 1980s was highly politicised with a volatile environment with a threat of constant violence.
 Party politics was at fever pitch, and yobs were dotted across the island, rubbing shoulders with the establishment.  
 For those readers old enough, they would recall most Sundays were filled with dread, anticipating injuries or deaths.
 That was the Malta we lived in. 
 Stepping into a packed Gudja cemetery, dad held both my and my sister’s hands firmly, while mum was sweating, trembling and repeatedly asking dad “are you sure?” 
 Raymond Caruana, a PN activist, was murdered in a drive-by shooting while he was at the Gudja PN club and dad wanted to pay his respects at his funeral. 
 Not long after we entered the cemetery, we started hearing flippant remarks: “Too late, dott”, “what are you doing here?”, “you are not one of us”.
 The hostility was palpable.
  Our earlier fraternal dispute became frivolous. Head down, we clasped our dad’s hand even more firmly.
 As young children, you could not fathom why people were spewing these vicious comments. However, we were acutely aware of the political scenario in Malta for we experienced insults on countless occasions, based solely on who we were. 
 Amid all that hostility, belligerence and hatred, stood out the best attributes of humankind.
 Within a few minutes, we were welcomed and surrounded warmly by several people ‒ people of a different political ideology, a different “colour of blood” ‒ spearheaded by the then PN MP, George Bonello Dupuis. 
 Those people understood the rationale behind my dad’s gesture. The gentle crowd circled us, hushed the insolent remarks, and the hecklers and superseded them with words of kindness, praise and even applause. That gentle crowd only grew bigger and bigger. 
 To this day, I still remember vividly that dad’s intention was not to get any adulation or affirmation.
 He was from the “opposite side”.
 His sole purpose was to show us all what hatred brings along with it and how an act of kindness can prevail and beat hatred any day when humans find common ground.
 A hard lesson to understand as a 10-year-old ‒ perhaps not the best teaching methodology one might argue ‒ yet the lesson stuck for life. 
 You can never be “too late” to show kindness. Thank you dad for showing us the way.

"'Fire Bartolo, Camilleri immediately and recoup swindled funds': Arnold Cassola",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/fire-bartolo-camilleri-immediately-recoup-swindled-funds.1101199,18-11-2024,003944.png,"Independent candidate Arnold Cassola on Monday added his voice to calls for the immediate dismissal of Clayton Bartolo and Clint Camilleri following a damning report by the Standards Commissioner.
 Addressing the media in Valletta ahead of a protest in front of Parliament organised by the PN, Cassola said the tourism and Gozo ministers should be fired and any  money stolen from the Maltese taxpayer returned.
 He added he would be asking the Public Accounts Committee in parliament to recover “some of the €68,000 swindled from the taxpayer for doing nothing"".
 Cassola accused the ministers of promoting “arrogance, clientelism, and nepotism” in Maltese politics.
 He was the first to report the issue to the Standards Commissioner after a report by The Shift alleged that Amanda Muscat, Bartolo’s then-girlfriend, was transferred from the Tourism Ministry to the Gozo Ministry for work she did not turn up for.
 The commissioner’s investigation found that Bartolo and Camilleri had abused their positions and breached ministerial ethics.
 The report showed that Bartolo’s now-wife was employed in a government position for which she was unqualified and did not perform her duties, while Camilleri failed to ensure proper oversight of his employees.
 Cassola questioned whether Bartolo had shown favouritism towards his “girlfriend” at the time and why Camilleri allowed employees to neglect their responsibilities.
 On Monday, Cassola commended Finance Minister Clyde Caruana and  Alicia Bugeja Said, who were found guilty of ethics breaches last year. He praised them for admitting their wrongdoing and returning the public funds involved.
 “The same cannot be said for Prime Minister Robert Abela,” Cassola remarked, accusing Abela of refusing to apologise three times for an ethics breach related to a Facebook advert.
 The Standards Commissioner offered to close the case if Abela apologised.
 “The fish stinks from the head,"" Cassola added.

"To be the best party, we must have the best people: Chris Fearne",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/to-best-party-best-people-chris-fearne.1098086,14-09-2024,"003947.png,003948.png,003949.png","For the Labour Party to remain on top and continue winning elections, it must attract and maintain the best people who will contribute to the party’s vision and goals, former deputy prime minister Chris Fearne said on Friday. 
 Addressing party members and delegates at the Labour Party General Conference, this was Fearne’s final speech as the party’s deputy leader, as voting for the party’s new deputy leaders and administration kicked off on Saturday evening. 
 This was the first time Fearne addressed a crowd following his resignation as deputy prime minister and minister in May. Later, in July, he announced he would not seek re-election as  Labour Party deputy leader. 
 His announcement came after a magistrate declared that there were enough grounds for him and several others to stand trial for fraud and misappropriation in the Vitals hospital case. 
  Fearne began his speech by recounting memories of when he was a pediatric surgeon at the renowned Great Ormond Street Children’s Hospital in London. 
 “I remember discussing with one of my professors, and he asked me a question that remains with me till this day,” Fearne said. 
 He recalled how his professor asked him if he knew why Ormond Street is the best paediatric hospital in the world.
 ""He said it is because they only hire the best doctors, the best nurses, and the best management. It attracts the best because it is the best.”
 He said this is the key secret ingredient to making any organisation, be it a hospital, a football team, or a political party, the best. 
 “Just because we won (an election) once, twice, three times, that does not mean we will win again if we do not have the best people by our side,” he said, as the crowd applauded.
 He said while the party must continue to attract and inspire those with the best talent, it must also retain the people who have brought it success.
 “We cannot push those who serve the party, and this country aside. Yes, we need new blood, but we must also keep the people who have helped us win once, twice, three times. We need the experience of the veterans and the enthusiasm of our youths.”
 During his speech, Fearne also addressed the party’s manifesto and the large projects it promised, including the seven-year plan to invest €700 million to create green urban spaces. 
 “I believe the next €700 million project should be to improving our social wellbeing,” he said. 
 “We have a drug problem (....) there are people who have depression and who live in solitude. There is a housing problem, and there are foreigners who contribute to our country but have no form of support. We see real social problems of real people, and we need to work hard to ensure that no one suffers alone.”
 On his end, PL’s outgoing deputy leader for party affairs Daniel Micallef urged the delegates to resist those who want the party to enter a siege mentality.
 “We cannot isolate ourselves and make everyone the enemy because they are against us,” he said.
 “We cannot call people who are not traditional labour voters ‘opportunists’, this sort of discourse is not good. We must remember where we came from and that we do not destroy what we built.”
  He noted how he worked mainly behind the scenes, and would not be one in search of “the limelight”. He addressed the criticism he received when he resigned shortly after the MEP elections, which saw the party lose the fourth MEP seat it had won in 2019. 
 “My time had come to an end,” he said. 
 Micallef also addressed how Maltese society is changing at a faster rate than ever before. 
 “Are we changing fast enough,” he asked, and said the party must work to be proactive, rather than reactive when faced with challenges. 
 He asked whether it is time to reform the electoral system, and if the country should keep 13 districts.
 Micallef also spoke about reforms, specifically addressing abortion. 
 “The writing is on the wall for those who want to see it,” he said. 
 “Regardless of what Malta’s political parties believe, abortion will one day be legalised.” 
 He called for the party to have a civilised discourse on the topic and to be respectful towards different opinions. 
 He also mentioned the need to address voluntary euthanasia. Micallef previously opened up about his support for euthanasia. 
 During her outgoing speech, PL president Ramona Attard said the most important thing to have is humanity, and encouraged the new party members to keep this in mind. 
 Attard appealed for more humanity in politics, as this has “regressed a lot.” 
 She said the Labour Party is a strong team because even if there are arguments between them, they work in the best interest of the country. 
  Attard condemned those who used the Standards Commissioner role to “attack” ministers and their families. 
 “The Standards Commissioner's role is important, but it was not created to scare people. Perhaps now is the time to revise the role so that abuse can be stopped, and it is not used as a tool of intimidation,” she added. 
 She also said it was a mistake to remove prison sentences for criminal libel and said that the fines should increase.
 Party delegates are now able to cast their vote for the party's new deputy leaders and new administration. Voting is open Friday until 11pm at the National Labour Centre in Ħamrun and the Labour Centre in Sannat, Gozo.
 Voting will continue on Saturday between 9 am and 2 pm in Ħamrun, and 9 am to 1 pm in Sannat, Gozo.

€700m roads project set to be completed at end of next year – minister,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/700m-roads-project-set-completed-end-next-year-minister.1094513,26-06-2024,003956.png,"A project announced in 2017 and launched in 2018 for the rebuilding of all of Malta’s residential roads was 95% done and would be completed by the end of next year, Roads and Infrastructure Minister Chris Bonett said on Wednesday.
 Speaking in parliament, he said that 1,315 roads were rebuilt in the past six years, an unprecedented level of work.
 People used to complain about a lack of roadworks in the past, now they were complaining that too much was being done at one go, he said.
 Some 94% of the €700m roads project had been completed, he said, with an average of 200 roads every year, which was more than handled by the last PN administration in five years.
 Some 100 roads remained to be done, he said. €634.2 million had been spent so far and €65.8m were needed for completion.
 This, Bonett said, was the country’s biggest ever infrastructure project, and it needed to be seen in the context of other works to update utility services and roads furniture.
 Referring to PN criticism about failure to give information in parliamentary questions, the minister said a single question had been asked covering spending on all road works in the past years. When a detailed reply could not be given, because of the work involved, the opposition had resorted to asking questions for every road done, At this rate they would have to put some 1,300 questions.
 Much information was already in the public domain, he said, and more would be given in the coming weeks.

Many were turned off by Labour's 'partisan tone' during election campaign - CEO,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/many-turned-off-labour-partisan-tone-election-campaign-ceo.1094659,29-06-2024,003963.png,"Many people were turned off by Labour's partisan tone during last month's election campaign, party CEO Randolph De Battista said on Saturday. 
 Speaking during Andrew Azzopardi's radio show, De Battista pinpointed the ""partisan"" discourse about the judiciary that dominated the campaign. 
 Prime Minister Robert Abela hit out against a magistrate who recommended criminal charges against ex-prime minister Joseph Muscat and a raft of other government officials. 
 Abela claimed the charges linked to the hospitals deal were timed to cause maximum damage to Labour during the election campaign. 
 De Battista distanced himself from this line of attack on Saturday, saying it probably cost more votes than it won. 
 The Labour CEO said that while the party should never forget the progress made under various leaders, Muscat should be allowed to defend himself and the party should be allowed to move forward. 
 De Battista said many people want Labour to adopt a more moderate tone that represents the entire population
 ""The election showed us people want us to work differently. I have been sending this message across internally for years now."" 
 
 De Battista said there is a ""small but noisy"" group within Labour that is keen on maintaining the status quo. 
 The Labour CEO has in recent weeks been in the crosshairs of Neville Gafa, a former government official closely linked with Muscat's chief of staff Keith Schembri. 
 De Battista brushed off the attacks, saying it shows he is doing his job if a ""mafioso"" or a ""fascist"" hits out at him. 
 The Labour CEO insinuated in a cryptic Facebook post on Friday that he had kicked Gafa out of Labour in 2018 on Muscat's instructions, after Gafa faced ""very serious allegations."" 
 Gafa was employed by OPM during that same period. 
 De Battista refused to be drawn into further detail about the post during the interview with Azzopardi. 
 He denied claims peddled by Gafa that his partner Cyrus Engerer tried to organised a block vote against Labour MEP Alex Agius Saliba within the European Parliament. 
 De Battista said attacks like the ones peddled by Gafa were intended to apply pressure on people within Labour who are advocating for a cleaner way of doing politics. 
 Questioned about his relationship with the prime minister, De Battista said he speaks regularly with Abela. 
 Abela said this month that he has ""differences of opinion"" with De Battista. 
 The Labour CEO however downplayed this, saying on Saturday that it is important to have a diversity of opinions within the party, rather than everyone singing from the same hymn sheet.

Malta Chamber: 'Amateur' public procurement needs major reform,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/malta-chamber-amateur-public-procurement-needs-major-reform.1094327,22-06-2024,003811.png,"Public procurement is broken, and the government’s failed attempt to allocate a €600m tender to build a waste-to-energy plant is the latest example of that, the Malta Chamber of Commerce, Enterprise and Industry believes.
 In a statement on Saturday, the Chamber said there was now a preponderance of evidence – from National Audit Office reports to court judgements and appeals sentences – to show that public procurement “is not functioning transparently and equitably, resulting in abuse, amateurism and irresponsible handling of public funds.”
 The Chamber statement did not directly reference any particular case which prompted it to issue the statement. But sources confirmed that the influential business lobby was left aghast by a public contracts debacle which this week saw a court of appeal cancel a €600 million tender award decision.
 The massive tender, intended to build a waste-to-energy plant in Magħtab, was awarded to a consortium made up of French waste management giants Paprec and local contractors Bonnici Brothers.
 The award decision was confirmed by the Public Contracts Review Board after a rival bidder appealed the decsion.
 But a court of appeal this week ruled that the entire decision had to be annuled, members of the Tenders Evaluation Committee and the PCRB had conflict of interest issues which disqualified them from playing a part in the process.
 In its statement on Saturday, the Malta Chamber said problems with public procurement were well known and recalled that it had issued a report suggesting ways to reform processes back in 2021.
 “Breaches and abuses continue to happen because there is limited transparency, weak internal controls, inadequate checks and balances, as well as conflicts of interests. The current legal remedies are, at times, ineffectual and limited, as to what can be challenged and by who,” it said.
  The Chamber said that while the government has acknowledged problems, neither it, the Opposition or Malta Council of Economic and Social Development has done much to implement reform.
 Some of the Malta Chamber’s recommendations include:
 Both the business community and public “has had enough of cowboys running roughshod over good governance and clean business,” the Chamber said, emphasising the need for all economic operators to be on a level playing field.
 
 “Public procurement spending is taxpayer money. Government has the duty and obligation to manage the spending of taxpayer money correctly, ensuring value for money and avoiding extravagant spending which is of no beneficial value to the taxpayer,” it said.

Watch: Abela admits to 'differences of opinion' with Labour CEO,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/abela-admits-difference-opinion-labour-ceo-ahead-meeting.1093856,06-12-2024,003823.png,"Robert Abela has admitted there are ""differences of opinion"" within Labour with the party's CEO Randolph De Battista.
 The prime minister said he would not be removing De Battista from the party's parliamentary group but refused to give the same assurances about his role as chief executive. 
 Following a meeting between the pair on Wednesday, De Battista said he will stay on in the role. 
 ""But the important thing is not whether I'm still there or not, because anyone who knows me knows that I don't like to talk about myself or the work I'm doing in my role which is to see that the Party's finances are managed wisely,"" he said. 
 Questions over his position emerged following a meeting of the Labour Party's executive and parliamentary group where Abela blamed ineffectual party administration for its dismal performance in the European elections. 
 ""Randolph is an integral part of the (parliamentary) group. He has opinions that are not necessarily the same as that of all who are in the Labour parliamentary group,"" Abela told Times of Malta in a doorstep on  Wednesday morning.
 ""Do I agree with him on everything? No,"" Abela said.
  He said that some of De Battista's opinions might reflect the message sent by the electorate, which reduced Labour's majority over the PN to just 8,500 votes from 42,000 in the 2019 election. 
 Abela said he would not be censoring or eliminating De Battista as an MP but when asked about his CEO role, the Labour leader said: ""That is a discussion we need to have and to respect that discussion I would rather not comment"".
 Meanwhile, De Battista said his future was in the hands of the prime minister but added that as CEO his role was to keep the financial and administrative  situation of the party sustainable.
 ""I always worked genuinely in that regard"" he said.
 He said there were certain issues that he had always raised internally but that now he was ""happy that others are also speaking about those issues."" 
  Abela was also asked about his confidence in housing minister Roderick Galdes.
 During Monday's joint parliamentary and executive group meeting Galdes was given a ""dressing down"". 
 One MP said Galdes was criticised over people around him failing to show respect for those asking for services for the ministry.
 However Malta Today reported that Galdes was also singled out  for criticism over being the minister responsible for a debacle in Siġġiewi that saw magistrates reversing an order to register 99 voters in unfinished flats ahead of the election. 
 But on camera, Abela praised Galdes.
 ""There is not only trust in him as a minister but also a personal friendship that goes back many years,"" he said. 
 Abela said he spoke generally in the meeting and appealed for more sensitivity when encountering people's realities and challenges.
 ""Its not an issue of favours, its an issue of their rights. When people speak to us about their rights we need to be sensitive to their realities"" he said.
 In issues like health, housing or social benefits there needs to be a certain sensitivity, he said.

 “I want to see a Maltese person sent to the International Space Station,"" Ryan Callus told parliament this week. ""We have quality, we have capable human resources.""
 He said Maltese scientists are already making great strides in space research and so sending an astronaut on a space mission should be within reach. 
 Callus was speaking during a parliamentary debate on Malta’s role in the European Space Agency, with MPs ratifying a new agreement that strengthens Malta’s role in the body.  
 The five-year agreement raises Malta’s status from observer to 'European Cooperating State', parliamentary secretary for research, Keith Azzopardi Tanti said.  
 This means that the space agency and the government-run Malta Council for Science and Technology (MCST) will now be required to invest €1.5 million a year in space research.
 Most will be given to local companies via competitive grants, the junior minister said.  
 He said the agreement would lead to the growth of the space sector and would attract foreign investment. 
 Callus said the PN supports the new agreement but said Malta should go further and be on par with other small EU countries like Croatia and Cyprus as a full member of the European Space Agency.  
 Being a full member means bringing more research and opportunities for Maltese scientists.  
 He said this would mean Malta contributing more to innovation that affects people’s lives, including biomedical research.  
 Cases where Malta uses its space agency status to conduct research would significantly increase should Malta become a full member, Callus said.  
 Maltese scientists are already taking advantage of the country’s European Space Agency connections, Callus said, citing research by University of Malta scientist Joseph Borg, who found that human blood in space reverts to its foetal type.
 The research could lead to a breakthrough for thalassaemia patients, whose haemoglobin is dysfunctional after birth and requires a lifetime of transfusions.
 Speaking in general terms, Callus said the government needs to invest more in research.
 “The University of Malta only receiving €1.3 million in research funding is only a drop in the ocean compared to what is needed,” he said.  
 Those who file for MCST grants often get no money even though their applications are highly rated, he said.

'Gozo to be model for sustainable development': Abela launches PL campaign,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/gozo-model-sustainable-development-abela-launches-pl-campaign.1091674,21-06-2024,003861.png,"Robert Abela on Sunday promised Gozo will become the new model for sustainable development in the country, following years of critique that rampant construction was souring the sister island’s charm. 
 The Prime Minister was closing the Labour Party’s general conference, which launched the party's slogan for the upcoming MEP and local council elections: ‘Is-Saħħa lill-Maltin’ (strength to the Maltese). 
 A slight deviation from the lyrics of the national anthem, Abela inferred that the theme had been derived from a series of town hall meetings where party officials heard pressing concerns from citizens from all walks of life. 
 This included a meeting in Gozo on Friday, where Abela said that while economic development must continue to grow on the island, it could not come at the expense of its distinct identity. 
 Stakeholders have long criticised unrestrained development they say is changing Gozo’s character, including in  Xlendi, where a series of  high-rise buildings have permanently altered the skyline of the seaside village.
 Last year, a coalition of Gozitan entities even asked the government to place a moratorium on new ODZ planning applications in Gozo and pause policies that allow for extended building heights. 
 “Gozo is an island of villages and for it to advance, it cannot forget the things that made it what it is today,” Abela said. 
 “This is foundational and is the only way development can make sense. Gozo is going to be the model for new and sustainable development in our country,” he promised. 
 Issues that were once viewed as challenges, such as the environment and the digital sphere, must be transformed into opportunities for the good of the country, he added. 
 Outspoken Xagħra mayor Christian Zammit, who last year quit politics and Labour over development woes, announced on Friday he had  returned to the party and would be contesting local council elections on its ticket. 
 He had previously said that he believed players in the construction industry had tried to “eliminate” him from politics. 
  Turning his sight on the Opposition, Abela said while the government had sought to find solutions to alleviate the burdens of the pandemic and inflation caused by war, the PN had continued to insist its initiatives were straddling the public with excessive debt. 
 “They have remained the party of austerity,” Abela said. 
 He continued to say that the country was lucky to have experienced economic growth, but it must now also address the challenges that come with it. 
 “You have a choice on what road to take. The Opposition’s attitude is to dismantle everything and go back to stagnation because that is what they did when they were in power and everyone knows the consequences of those actions,” he said. 
 “The other option is to change your attitude, keep what is good and change what isn’t working.""
 Abela also accused the PN of trying to undermine the government during the 2019 political crisis. He said the PL ultimately prevailed because it chose to act responsibly and to continue building on the good.

 While not outright stating an intention to contest for the position, Agius Saliba said in a Facebook post on Tuesday he would be supporting efforts to have the party's statute amended to allow MPs or MEPs to hold the post. 
 Presently, the PL's statute says that a person who forms part of the party's parliamentary group, which includes MEPs, is not allowed to submit their nomination for the post. 
 Agius Saliba said he met Prime Minister Robert Abela to discuss the matter and said he supports his vision for the future as well as for the party. 
 He added that he was informed that former general secretary Jason Micallef was invited to a similar meeting with the prime minister. 
  Micallef later confirmed he would no longer be contesting. 
 In a Facebook post, Micallef said he had a lengthy meeting with Abela about the process of renewal needed in the party before the next general election. He also said that he had met with Agius Saliba. 
 “After the conclusion of these meetings, I no longer feel that I should continue contesting for deputy leader for party affairs,” Micallef said.
 “I am doing this because I continue to insist on what I believe in. The best interests of the Labour Party and its people, to me, remain always and everywhere first and foremost.”
  With Labour delegates set to vote on a new executive at the upcoming general conference, the race to fill former deputy leader Daniel Micallef's post has heated up in recent days, with  Jason Micallef announcing his intention to contest the position.
 However, Micallef's bid ruffled feathers within the party, with both enthusiasm and scepticism expressed by Labour officials, exposing a fissure within the party. 
 Robert Abela had a less than enthusiastic response to Micallef’s candidacy, saying in an interview that party delegates “should not turn back the clock” when voting on a new deputy leader and instead focus on making the party more appealing to moderates.
 Former MEP Claudette Abela Baldacchino, who has expressed interest in the role but never confirmed she intended to run, also appeared to back the idea of Agius Saliba helming the post. 
 ""How the news is evolving is a show of faith that the Labour Party is united behind Prime Minister Robert Abela, who only wants the best for our country,"" she said.

 PN MPs Karol Aquilina and Claudette Buttigieg have now filed a parliamentary motion seeking to have the law amended.
 SLAPP, or Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation, are legal cases that are intended to bully critics into silence by those with the financial means to effectively weaponise the legal system.
 Malta came under pressure to introduce anti-SLAPP legislation following the murder of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, who faced a raft of legal cases and garnishee orders in connection with her reporting.
 The country transposed a new EU anti-SLAPP directive into law earlier this year, becoming the first EU member state to do so.
 But a foundation named in Caruana Galizia’s memory and focused on advocating for media freedom believes the EU directive does not go far enough and should be bolstered.
 So too does the PN, which in a statement on Saturday said that the new law only offers journalists ""the minimum level of protection” required.
 “The Partit Nazzjonalista views the Anti-SLAPP directive as a significant opportunity for our country not only to adopt laws in line with EU directives but also to offer the highest possible level of protection for journalists from the abuses of those wishing to hide the truth,” the PN MPs said.
 Apart from revising the law, the Opposition also wants “broad and effective public consultation” on how the anti-SLAPP directive should be incorporated into national laws, with a March 2025 deadline for that.
 The Opposition also wants public consultation on recommendations made by a public inquiry into Caruana Galizia’s assassination and reminded the government that its promise to publish a white paper on reforms to strengthen journalism in Malta has yet to materialise. The government made that promise over one year ago.

PN hits back at councillor who wants to sue it: 'he told people to vote Labour',timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/pn-hits-back-councillor-wants-sue-it-he-told-people-vote-labour.1091976,05-05-2024,003892.png,"A Cospicua PN councillor who intends to sue his own party spent years encouraging people to vote Labour, the Nationalist Party said on Sunday.
 James Cauchi, who represents the PN as local councillor, this week filed a judicial protest against the party, saying he was sidelined after being approached by an internal faction that wanted to topple party leader Bernard Grech.
 Cauchi claimed that he had rebuffed the faction’s advances and pledged loyalty to Grech, but was nevertheless ignored by the party when it came to nominating its candidates for the upcoming June 8 local council elections.
 On Sunday, the PN hit back at Cauchi’s claims in a public statement.
 Cauchi, the party said, had spent years encouraging people in Cospicua to vote for the rival Labour Party and had also attended political events organised by Cospicua’s former mayor, now junior minister Alison Zerafa Civelli – all while serving as a PN councillor.
 “He continued to do this despite being repeatedly warned,” the party said. “Despite all that, we hoped his attitude would change, and we therefore asked him if he intended to run again on the PN ticket. The email he received was sent to all current PN councillors.
 “James Cauchi didn’t reply to the email for months, all while posting on social media to encourage voters to cast votes for candidates for both parties,” it said.
 The party said that when Cauchi eventually told the party that he wanted to run as a PN candidate, the party’s administrative council decided it no longer wanted him on its ticket.
 Cauchi’s judicial protest against the party proved that decision to be the correct one, the party said.
 “We opted to stay silent and not say anything about this. But given that Cauchi has gone public, we must set out the facts,” the PN said.

 “We must help small producers to protect and safeguard the authenticity of their products and tap new markets. By doing so we will also enrich our European and Maltese identity” Agius said.

Government ignores calls for judicial oversight of wiretapping,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/government-ignores-calls-judicial-oversight-wiretapping.1096312,08-09-2024,003920.png,"The government continues to ignore calls for the introduction of safeguards and judicial oversight on wiretapping in criminal investigations.
 Contacted by the Times of Malta, a spokesperson for the home affairs ministry declined to clarify the government’s position on the matter. 
 Nor would they say whether the government would consider introducing a bill in parliament to amend the Security Services Act, responding to long-standing calls from several authorities for wiretapping in criminal investigations to be treated separately from national security investigations.
 Last year, Mr Justice Toni Abela remarked during a court case that the Security Services Act should be revisited because the law permitting phone intercepts in criminal investigations lacked judicial safeguards and potentially breached human rights.
 The issue was first raised by Franco Debono, who, as a member of parliament in 2011, urged the government to consider transferring the authority for Security Service interceptions in criminal investigations from the political authority of the minister to the investigative or judicial authority.
 At that time the law was 15 years old. Thirteen years later, it remains unchanged.
 Last month, Yvonne Farrugia, Malta’s European Public Prosecutor, called for the law’s revision in an interview with  Times of Malta.
 The law has also been criticised by GRECO, the Group of States against Corruption of the Council of Europe. GRECO has consistently urged the Maltese government to empower the judicial authority in authorising the use of special investigative techniques in the investigation of corruption offences. 
 In its second compliance report from the fifth evaluation round on Malta, published last March, GRECO noted that “no steps – not even a legal analysis of what would be a possible way forward – have been taken by the authorities”.
 In response to Times of Malta, the government merely stated that it had taken note of GRECO’s remarks.
 Citing national security reasons, the government refused to provide statistics on how many wiretapping warrants for criminal investigations had been signed by successive home affairs ministers since 2010. 
 Similar questions directed to the Justice Ministry were referred back to the Home Affairs Ministry.
 GRECO is uncomfortable with ministers and executive members of the government overseeing the issue of warrants in criminal investigations. 
 “The influence of the executive on law enforcement authorities, particularly those deciding on the use of special investigation techniques for possible corruption offences, is a key factor in the inefficiency of the Maltese criminal justice system in effectively investigating allegations of possible involvement of PTEFs in corruption offences,” it stated. PTEFs are heads of government, ministers, and their advisers.
 Sources explained: “How can members of the executive involved in criminal wrongdoing be caught when their colleagues control the process of warranting wiretapping? Would members of the executive grant warrants for phone intercepts of their colleagues?”
 The revision of the wiretapping law is also necessary because it could potentially breach the fundamental rights of individuals whose communications were lawfully intercepted as part of investigations. 
 In June 2023, in its deliberations on a request made by Charles Muscat, known as ‘il-Pips’, a court held that the secret services law “would likely” breach his fundamental right to a fair hearing. Muscat was charged with setting up a drug trafficking racket from behind bars, and law enforcement used evidence gathered through phone intercepts to break the ring.
 The court directed the criminal court to ensure that the accused’s fundamental rights would be safeguarded throughout the criminal process. 
 However, it noted that the court may not have been competent to decide on the constitutionality of the evidence intercepted during investigations carried out in 2001 under a warrant signed by the then home affairs minister.
 This is why GRECO has recommended that any revisions to the law should make it “clear to all authorities involved in the investigation of corruption that the evidence lawfully obtained by such means is admissible in court”.

 In a brief political activity in Mosta, party leader Bernard Grech said that, having been the party in government that introduced local councils to Malta in 1993, the PN has always believed in citizens having greater freedom to participate in local politics. 
 Prospective PN councillors, he said, are all united in the belief that every town and village in Malta should undergo a “carrying capacity” study so that investment in the necessary infrastructure to support localities can be ensured for the years to come. 
  The party will also make sure that pressure is made on the government to ensure that road closures don’t happen in a haphazard way or in a way that obstructs entering or exiting a locality.
 Councillors will also guarantee to do their utmost to ensure cleanliness in their localities and tackle waste collection issues.

Labour stole from workers instead of working to protect them - Bernard Grech,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/labour-stole-workers-instead-working-protect-bernard-grech.1091809,21-06-2024,"003931.png,003932.png,003933.png","Instead of working to strengthen workers the Labour Party has actively stolen from them, Opposition Leader Bernard Grech said on Wednesday, in a Mayday meeting overshadowed by news of the conclusion of the Vitals inquiry. 
 The Nationalist Party launched its campaign for the June 8 MEP and local council election, debuting the slogan ‘Għalik’ (For You) during the political activity.
 Throngs of party supporters came to support the campaign at Ġnien l-Għarusa tal-Mosta, many decked in the PN’s shield and others waving the blue and starry flag of the European Union.
 Taking aim at Labour’s campaign ‘Is-Saħħa lill-Maltin’, Grech said that, in light of the Vitals inquiry coming to a close, it is clear that Labour says one thing but does the complete opposite.
 “They said ‘strength to the Maltese’ when in reality everybody knows how they have stolen from the worker,” he said.
 A magisterial inquiry looking into the role of former prime minister Joseph Muscat and other ministers in the privatisation deal of three state hospitals was concluded, triggering instant backlash from Muscat who has repeatedly accused the magistrate of leading a politically motivated vendetta against him.
 Prime Minister Robert Abela also piled on the pressure, accusing the inquiry of being timed to damage Labour’s prospects in the upcoming election.
 The case now rests with the Attorney General who must analyse the inquiry and decide whether to charge the people named in it or not. Muscat, as well as his former chief of staff Keith Schembri and former minister Konrad Mizzi, are among the prime targets for prosecution.
 Grech used his time to once again condemn attacks on the judiciary and said that these were meant to intimidate when Labour already knew what the outcome of their actions would be.
 “They know that they stole from us, stole €400 million instead of spending that money to invest in our health as they should have done,” Grech said.
 “They robbed you, they robbed me, they robbed every worker that suffers and perseveres.” The people now expect the police and the attorney general to act immediately to deliver justice immediately.
 Grech continued that the government is too mired in its own internal squabbles, caused by its own incompetence, to notice the problems the average citizen faces.
  The government is too busy “intimidating the courts” to continue to work to solve problems and thus the Labour Party’s problems have once again become the nation’s problems, he said.
 “We are seeing the real pact with the devil unravel before our eyes and the real victims are you, your families and your children,” Grech continued. “This depressing spectacle that we are assisting on a national level is the result of a government that has forgotten or forced itself to forget, what the function of a government actually is in a democratic European country.”
 While Labour insiders had confessed to worrying about a weak lineup in MEP candidates, Grech said the PN was proud of all its candidates and praised the stellar work of its MEPs.
 “And if we were able to achieve so much with two representatives, just imagine what we could do with three,” Grech said to loud cheering.
  European Parliament President Roberta Metsola echoed the sentiment and said that the prime minister’s “attacks” on the judiciary go against the political integrity that the party believes in. Such attacks, she said are unacceptable and are not representative of a nation of people that are fundamentally honest.
 “In these past hours, I’ve been met with a mix of emotions. Some feel that they were proven right, but being right doesn’t mean anything without justice,” she said.
 While understanding that some people may feel betrayed, Metsola added that people should not lose hope in politics and politicians.
 “Some will falter but others are more predictable and you can foresee their attacks because he is weak, lost and doesn’t know how to behave like a prime minister, she said.
 She added that the choice on Election Day was between those who shirk their responsibilities or those who come up with solutions.
 “Do you want those who take the initiative and change things for the better or those who are not even fit to lead?” Metsola questioned.
 “Do you want those who find every excuse to blame Europe for their own shortcomings or those who are capable of participating in Europe and changing it for the better?”
 She promised that the PN is working to restore respect to Malta.

 Back in July, Times of Malta reported how  Farrugia, a top aide to former prime minister Joseph Muscat and former CEO of Malta Enterprise, was expected to take over the role.
 Farrugia’s appointment was confirmed in a press release on Friday, which said he would assume the role on 12 August. 
 Farrugia, who was CEO of Malta Enterprise since 2019, was a top aide to Muscat before the appointment.
 He has been a key internal figure in the Labour Party's electoral campaigns in 2017, 2022 and last June's European and local council elections.

Maltese secondary school exam features questions about minister's article,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/maltese-secondary-school-exam-features-questions-minister-speech.1093865,06-12-2024,003948.png,"The Education Ministry has launched a probe after a Maltese language exam at public secondary schools featured questions about an opinion piece written by a minister.
 Students were asked to read an article by Environment Minister Miriam Dalli and answer a number of questions about it, as part of a reading comprehension exercise.
 The January 2024 article, titled ‘Positive achievements in waste management’, highlighted the government’s work to increase recycling rates and reduce waste dumped into landfills.  
 Students taking the test were asked to determine whether the article highlighted “positive or negative results” and to “find a phrase that shows how Malta’s economy is doing well”, among other things.
  Lawyer and former PN MP Jason Azzopardi flagged the questions on Facebook, saying that the test was pure “propaganda” on Dalli’s behalf.
 He claimed that the test was administered to 15-year-olds “with learning difficulties”.
 Nationalist Party education spokesperson Justin Schembri also disapproved. 
 ""Partisan politics should never end up in an exam paper,"" he said. 
 Environment Minister Dalli, the subject of the exam questions, immediately distanced herself from the matter and said she had first learnt about the exam question from the media.
 ""An article written by me as a minister should have never been included in an exam paper,"" she said. ""I have children myself and understand that seeing a political name in an exam paper rankles.""
  A short while later, the Education Ministry issued a statement to distance itself from the test question.
 “No ministry has any access to exam papers or the contents of exams,” it said. “There are specific structures and processes in place to ensure that exams are led by technical people within the education sector, with no political or administrative interference,” it added.
 When contacted, Education Minister Clifton Grima was even more direct.
 ""It's hard to understand the lack of common sense that is required to draft an exam question like this,” he said.   
 He emphasised that his ministry has no control over what questions are asked in exam papers. 
 Grima's ministry will now be setting up an investigative board tasked with establishing the facts in this case.
 The board will also be asked to provide recommendations on how to improve the current system of drafting exam papers, the ministry said in a statement. 
 No information about the board members, its timeframe or specific terms of reference was provided.
 Correction 4.10pm: A previous version stated that the exam questions concerned a speech given by the minister. It was an opinion piece she wrote.

Society should not be built purely on the pursuit of money - Robert Abela,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/society-built-purely-pursuit-money-robert-abela.1094350,23-06-2024,003966.png,"Robert Abela on Sunday said Maltese society should not be built purely on the pursuit of money. 
 Speaking during an interview on ONE Radio, Abela said that apart from having a strong financial base, people also place value on other aspects of life like the environment and equality.
 He said the reality faced by Labour when it took over the country’s leadership 11 years ago was different from the reality faced today.
 Back then, the priority was stimulating the economy and helping families become financially stable. Quality of life then was associated with financial stability. 
 Abela said society has since changed and priorities shifted.
 “What sort of society do we want? A society where money is the be all and end all, or one where money is important, but is not the ultimate goal,” Abela asked.
 The prime minister also touched upon concerns about the influx of foreign workers over the past year.
 A state of the nation survey published last week found over one in every four people are “very uncomfortable” with Malta’s multiculturalism.
 Abela rejected claims that Malta’s economic growth was fuelled purely by the boom in foreign workers.
 He spoke about the need to focus on the creation of quality jobs, rather than focussing purely on employment numbers.
 The prime minister rejected calls by the European Commission this week to phase out Malta’s energy and fuel subsidies, in light of the country's growing deficit. 
 He said the subsidies had been one of Malta’s main measures to combat inflation.
 “This does not mean we will ignore the Commission. We will go to them and explain the need for these subsidies due to Malta’s unique situation, given the lack of a gas interconnector and the country’s distance from the European mainland,” Abela said.
 Abela played down concerns about Malta’s rising deficit, saying the government is committed to its plan to reduce it by 0.5% yearly.
 He said the deficit was a consequence of investing in people, something  the government did not plan to stop doing.
 Abela said while the PN government had let national debt balloon to 70%, Malta’s deficit under Labour was well under the EU’s 60% threshold.
 He said the government will deliver a “strong and positive” budget that addressed the middle class and offered strong incentives.
 On the nomination of PN MEP Roberta Metsola for a second term as European Parliament's president, Abela reiterated that the government would be backing the nomination.
 He said this did not however mean that the government agreed with many of the “wrong” decisions taken by Metsola.
 Abela contrasted the government’s position with the PN’s, saying the Opposition took every possible opportunity to undermine Labourites who were nominated for prominent positions with the EU institutions.
 The PN has already put the government on notice about its plans to nominate PL backbencher Edward Zammit Lewis as a European Court judge, saying it was an insult to all those who believed in justice.

 The customary pre-election cheques were this year described as “recognition” of workers’ contributions to building Malta’s economy.
 This despite the OSCE warning that they will once again be scrutinising this practice, having already said in 2022 that it does “not conform to international standards and good practice”.
 Some voters also received a second cheque in the form of additional COLA payments for vulnerable households. 
 On Monday the Finance Minister was answering a parliamentary question by PN MP Graham Bencini, who asked Caruana to explain the reasoning behind the issuing of the cheques.
 He also asked the minister to say how many cheques were sent to people who were not Maltese citizens.
 Caruana said the 269,563 cheques were part of the Nippremjaw il-Bżulija [Rewarding hard work]  scheme. The scheme formed part of a process launched in 2018 to compensate workers, with the lowest earners receiving the highest compensation.

  Malta Chamber officials noted how only a fraction of their proposals were adopted in the last budget, and stressed the need for a sustainable economic model that is not dependent on population growth.  
 Grech recalled how four years ago he had proposed a national conference to analyse and address the challenge of population growth, yet the proposal fell on deaf ears.

Government to discuss legal protection for 'white hat'  hackers,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/government-discuss-legal-protection-white-hat-hackers.1097780,09-08-2024,004041.png,"The government is committed to creating a legal framework that supports hacking practices that are ethical and well-intentioned, Prime Minister Robert Abela said on Sunday morning.
 Speaking on One Radio, Abela said that on Tuesday the Cabinet will discuss a policy document drafted by the Malta Digital and Innovation Authority (MDIA) aimed at protecting ethical hackers also known as “white hat” hackers.  
 The document, which will be available for public consultation, will introduce safeguards for those who contribute to improving computer and data security systems, clearly distinguishing them from individuals involved in malicious activities.
  Referring specifically to the charges issued against three University of Malta computer science students and their lecturer who, two years ago, found and exposed security flaws in FreeHour, Malta's largest student application, Abela emphasised the government’s commitment to fostering a safer digital environment. 
 The prime minister said that this year’s budget would project the government's vision for the next ten years in various areas including population, the electricity infrastructure, healthcare, transport, pensions and education.
 “This will be a budget that demonstrates the direction we wish to take as a country. It will highlight how we can achieve a better future,” Abela said.
 He said the government would continue to meet stakeholders to consider additional proposals which may be incorporated into the final document by October.
 He also addressed concerns raised by The Malta Chamber, stating that while the government shared its vision of improved governance and a more efficient economy, it could not support the Chamber’s call to remove subsidies on utilities because such a move would negatively impact businesses and families.  
 Abela underscored the need to attract higher value investment that was less labour intensive, easing the reliance on foreign workers. He noted that during the first half of this year, Malta Enterprise approved 12 projects worth €144 million compared to 43 projects valued at €36 million throughout last year.
 “We need to be selective even in the investment we attract. It’s not about accepting investments employing hundreds of workers.  We prefer quality investments that employ fewer but more highly skilled workers with good wages. That is the direction we have set, and that’s what we are delivering.”
 Abela said that the government’s pledge to grant children’s allowance in full for all children would be fully implemented two years ahead of schedule.  
 He said that circumstances dictated the early implementation of a measure that was meant to be staggered over five years.  
 “Parents have already received €250 per child.  This year 62,000 children will receive the final €90 payment.  That is our commitment to social justice, measures for families that impact everyone,” Abela said.
 The prime minister also announced that the government would soon exempt mental health professionals from charging VAT.
 “While medical care has been exempt from VAT for decades, counsellors and psychotherapists were not included in this exemption.  This measure will ensure that more people with mental health issues can afford to seek professional help.”
 A legal notice addressing this anomaly is set to be published in the coming days.  
 Questioned on Labour’s general conference scheduled for the end of the week, Abela called upon delegates to send a strong signal by supporting the candidacies of Ian Borg and Alex Agius Saliba as deputy leaders.
 Borg is the sole candidate for deputy leader for parliamentary affairs.  Once confirmed by Labour delegates, he is set to become deputy prime minister, a post vacated by Chris Fearne who stepped down after facing charges related to the Vitals/Steward hospitals’ concession case.   
 MEP Alex Agius Saliba is the only candidate for the post of deputy leader for party affairs.  Labour’s national executive recently changed the party’s statute to allow current members of parliament to contest the post.
 Abela said that Labour is renewing itself while in government, something which other governing parties failed to do.

What’s happened in Malta is that while the economy has grown, so has social inequality. That’s a contradiction. It’s anti-socialist to grow the economy but reduce the workers’ share.
  MX: Social democrats in Malta and Europe have embraced free-market policies and economic growth. They argue that way they can support the lower tiers of society. Isn’t everyone benefiting from this?
 SM: No, that’s not true. Europe and Malta only follow free-market principles where it suits the capital owners. Governments, including Malta’s, have printed money – what they call ‘quantitative easing’ – to bail out corrupt banks, causing inflation across the eurozone, which is essentially an additional tax on people.
 MX: So, in your view, Malta’s Labour government is capitalist?
 SM: Obviously.
 MX: How do you feel about that?
 SM: Today’s Labour government prides itself on being ‘business-friendly’. They say you must first create wealth before distributing it. But in post-war Europe, socialist policies like those of Mintoff in Malta showed that investment and development could happen alongside true socialist principles. The idea that private business should be left unchecked to drive development is false.
 MX: Can you give an example of where the private sector is being left unchecked?
 SM: It’s not absolute but, as I said, deregulation has increased across Europe, including Malta. Industrial laws today favour employers, granting them more rights while restricting workers’ rights. For example, the right to strike is much more limited now – there are rules requiring advance notice and limits on how many can strike. The worst is when an effective strike gets declared illegal, as happened to the nurses in Malta.
 MX: But if workers’ rights have diminished, why aren’t we seeing more industrial unrest or protests?
 SM: First, there’s plenty of work available, and we even need foreign workers. However, the legal protections for workers have decreased, and unions, in my opinion, are making a mistake by not uniting under a single council. We are the only European country where unions don’t operate collectively. This weakens their bargaining power, especially when dealing with the government.
 MX: NGOs in Malta complain about lack of governance. Do you agree?
 SM: Absolutely. The lack of governance is a major problem, leading to widespread corruption and mismanagement. It’s becoming evident that something needs to be done.
 MX: Why is Malta in such a state?
 SM: There are honest politicians in both main parties but there are also those who are in it for personal gain. The ‘ butisti’ are more interested in their pockets. Both parties have their share of self-serving individuals in parliament.
  MX: You seem to be equating both political parties but the levels of responsibility are different…
 SM: Corruption is cross-party. It’s not exclusive to Labour or Nationalists. During the Nationalists’ time, there were corruption scandals like the Fairmount case, which the General Workers’ Union exposed, but nothing happened. Now, with Labour in power, it’s more visible because those in government have more opportunities to exploit.
 MX: In your view, is corruption being tackled?
 SM: Not at all. There are three factors promoting corruption in Malta. First, there’s the privatisation of parliamentary democracy. Parties, especially Labour in government, have become reliant on corporate lobbyists for funding. These donations aren’t charitable – they come with strings attached, and donors expect a return on their investment. To fight corruption, we need to ban corporate donations to political parties. Bernie Sanders refused corporate donations but still raised significant funds from small, individual contributions. His average donation was $20 and he still raised as much as other candidates. He had a strong programme for the people.
 MX: Ultimately, he wasn’t successful in his bid for the White House.
 SM: But that was because the Democratic Party leadership didn’t want him as their candidate, and they used a loophole in their rules to allocate extra votes against him.
  MX: Besides banning corporate donations, what else would you change?
 SM: Malta’s culture of  omertà. The government keeps many things hidden, even the contracts for the renting of umbrellas on Comino. This secrecy is unnecessary and promotes corruption. We need open government policies where everything, including contracts, is made public unless there’s a genuine security concern. The Whistleblowers Act, the Freedom of Information Act and the anti-SLAPP laws are all good, but they should be part of a larger, open government policy. But neither party has this on their agenda.
 The big four accounting firms in Malta are what I call the ‘four legal mafia families’. They audit private companies but also help them evade taxes and launder money. They operate legally, but the second part of their role – helping companies avoid taxes – should be removed. It’s anti-social.
 MX: Labour is currently undergoing changes, with elections for key positions.  What’s your take on this?
 SM: These changes are tactical, not strategic, and will only create empty noise. The prime minister might be trying to create a more efficient administration but there’s a bigger issue. The internal politics of the government are dominated by speculative corporate lobbyists.  They have too much influence on decision-making, especially in sectors like construction.
 MX: Who are these speculative lobbyists?
 SM: People like [Joseph] Portelli,  Ċaqnu and Yorgen Fenech. They fund political parties, not out of generosity, but to further their own interests.
 MX: Are you saying these lobbyists are more powerful than the prime minister?
 SM: They have a lot of control over the economy and government decisions. In construction, we’re facing overproduction. It benefits a few contractors and landowners, but it’s not good for the Maltese people. It’s damaging the environment and making us dependent on foreign workers.
 MX: Does the economic model need changing?
 SM: I’m not an economist but there’s a global movement advocating for ‘de-growth’ —the idea that not every sector needs to keep expanding. Some areas should grow if it benefits the people but others should shrink where necessary.
 MX: Are you saying Malta’s economy should stop growing at its current rate?
 SM: Not necessarily. Ideally, the economy should continue to grow but only in areas where it’s beneficial to the people. Other sectors, like construction, should scale back.
 MX: Which sectors should grow, in your opinion?
 SM: There are areas we haven’t yet fully explored where growth would be beneficial. We need to focus on those.
 MX: Should tourism continue to grow?
 SM: No, we should focus on attracting higher-class tourists, but it shouldn’t keep growing indefinitely.
 MX: What about construction?
 SM: No, construction shouldn’t grow either. Neither tourism nor construction should keep expanding.
 MX: So, in your view, these sectors should shrink?
 SM: They don’t necessarily need to shrink but they shouldn’t keep growing either. There should be selectivity in economic growth.
 MX: Should Malta continue relying on foreign workers for sectors where locals are unwilling to work? 
 SM: The current situation concerning foreign workers is a historic first for Malta. In the past, foreigners would force their way in and impose their superiority. But now, for the first time, we are inviting foreign workers.  For this reason, it’s the economic model that should be criticised and not the foreign workers. Insulting them is ignorance. However, I don’t believe Malta’s economy should rely on foreign cheap labour. This creates a divide. Some people genuinely care about improving workers’ conditions while others exploit them for profit.
  MX: You’ve always been vocal about Malta’s neutrality. What are your thoughts on neutrality in 2024?
 SM: I fully agree with Mintoff’s stance that Malta should remain neutral, as outlined in the constitution. Before we joined the EU, Mintoff wanted guarantees that Malta would stay neutral, not get involved in wars, even for Europe.
 MX: Were those guarantees given? Are you satisfied with them?
 SM: No. The guarantee Mintoff wanted was much clearer. I have a copy of the agreement between Malta and Italy, where Italy agreed to defend our neutrality without Malta being involved in conflicts like NATO in Ukraine.
 MX: Ukraine was neutral for some time but was still attacked. Couldn’t Malta face a similar situation?
 SM: That’s not what happened. Europe invaded Russia twice, once with Napoleon and again with Hitler, both times through Ukraine. Ukraine was used as a stepping stone by European armies. That’s the historical context.
 MX: But wasn’t there fear that Russia would invade Europe through Ukraine?
 SM: The first mistake the West committed was provoking Russia by expanding NATO eastward, closer to Russia’s borders, and by supporting a coup in Ukraine. The Minsk Agreement could have provided autonomy to Russian-speaking regions in Ukraine, similar to the situation of Scotland in the UK. But Zelensky reversed his position, deceiving Ukrainians, Europeans and all of us.
  MX: Are you comfortable with Malta’s foreign policy?
 SM: Malta’s foreign policy is clearly being dictated by the US. According to our constitution, we’re supposed to work for peace, which means staying neutral in conflicts. But Malta consistently sides with NATO, whether in Ukraine or Gaza. Our position is much more pro-US than pro-Palestine. There’s also hypocrisy – our government criticises Georgia for repressing protests while, at the same time Biden sent the US National, Guard firing rubber bullets at peaceful protesters.
 MX: Do you feel that your views are represented in the Maltese parliament?
 SM: Not at all. Both parties need a major upheaval. The grassroots need to rebel – not violently but forcefully enough to push the parties to change direction.
 MX: Do you still vote?
 SM: No. In the last local elections [June 2024], I voted for a particular candidate who stood for election in Baħar iċ-Ċagħaq, but in the European elections, I didn’t. If a general election were held today, I wouldn’t vote for Labour, especially because of their stance on neutrality. If things don’t change, I won’t vote at all.
 MX: Since Labour came to power in 2013, have you voted in the general elections?
 SM: I’ve always been loyal to the party and voted in every election. But this issue of neutrality is pushing me away. While governance and the economic model are internal matters that can change, the biggest reason I may not vote remains the neutrality issue.
 I’ve always said that Malta should not join the EU army.  I publicly ask the prime minister why hasn’t he declared in parliament that Malta won’t join the EU army.
 There is a legal precedent which we may use.  Europe granted the UK the option not to join the EU army before Brexit. Why hasn’t Robert Abela made a solemn declaration that Malta will never impose military conscription on its youth?  It is becoming increasingly fashionable in Europe to bring back conscription.
 Malta’s involvement in NATO’s Parliamentary Assembly is also dangerous because it discusses military operations. This makes us a legitimate target for Islamist terrorists, especially with what’s happening in Gaza. If the Maltese people realised this, they would be protesting against the government. We’ve become a legitimate target because we’re aligned with NATO. Imagine what could happen to our tourism industry if there were a terrorist attack.
  MX: You’ve always voted Labour, but you were also involved with the Front Maltin Inqumu and Karmenu Mifsud Bonnici in the mid-2000s. Did you still vote Labour during that time?
 SM: Yes, I’ve always voted Labour, even during that time.
 MX: Even after the disputes between Mintoff and Alfred Sant?
 SM: Yes, I tried to mediate between them twice. I’ve always maintained a good relationship with Alfred Sant and we had coffee recently.  We happen to follow different brands of Labour.
 Joe Paris and I were closer to Mintoff, and we always tried to resolve their differences. But I can tell you I always voted Labour. If the neutrality issue doesn’t change, I won’t vote for Labour anymore.
 MX: Let’s talk about your past. You were a dockyard worker and a Labour activist from a young age.
 SM: Yes, I served on the Labour Party executive for 12 consecutive years, from 1985 to 1997. I also served four years on the Discipline and Vigilance Board from 1988 to 1992, and I was involved in many mass activities within the party. I worked closely with Mintoff and Mifsud Bonnici.
 MX: During the Labour governments of the 1970s and 1980s, what stands out to you in terms of their work for Malta?
 SM: Their philosophy was to uplift the working class, with the belief that helping the lower classes would eventually benefit everyone. Today, it’s the opposite. There’s this idea that subsidising the wealthy will lead to trickle-down benefits for the poor. But that’s a lie. Mintoff’s approach was to raise the lower classes, not rely on trickle-down economics.
 MX: Do you think Mintoff succeeded in this?
 SM: Absolutely. I remember a time when Valletta was full of beggars. People were migrating to Australia for work. Young couples had to live with their parents because they couldn’t afford housing. Mintoff built houses, established social services and believed in lifting people from the bottom up. That’s very different from today’s economic theory.
 MX: There was a lot of unrest in the late 1970s and 1980s, with protests that sometimes ended badly, like the torching of the Times of Malta building in 1979 and the attack on the opposition leader’s house. Then, in 1984, there was the attack on the Curia.  What changed since then?
 SM: Those were turbulent times, but you don’t see such actions today because the two main parties aren’t as diametrically opposed as they were.
 MX: What do you mean by that?
 SM: The conflict used to be horizontal. Labour was truly left-wing, and the Nationalists were truly right-wing. Today, both are neo-liberal. The opposition now comes from grassroots movements, like  Graffitti and NGOs like  Repubblika, which is incidentally exposing the weaknesses of the Nationalist Party.
 MX: How?
 SM: Because they are vocal about issues that the Nationalist Party isn’t capable of doing. To my mind, it shows that the Nationalist Party is weak in its beliefs and in its past.
 MX: Are you saying Repubblika is revealing the Nationalist Party’s ideological weakness?
 SM: Yes,  Repubblika is exposing the Nationalists’ weakness because they should be the ones attacking the government on certain issues. Their lack of criticism, when they stand to gain most, shows they are ideologically and administratively weak.
 MX: And why do you think the Nationalists aren’t making these critiques?
 SM: Because there are opportunists – ‘ butisti’ – on both sides of parliament, and they all have something to hide. Both parties rely on speculative corporate lobbies. Parliamentary democracy has been privatised, and this applies to the Nationalists as much as it does to Labour. I criticise Labour because I want to see it improve and not depend on speculative lobbies, but the Nationalist Party is no different.

 The decision comes months after the 2024 Budget speech when the idea of pausing some services during the morning rush hour traffic was first announced.
 “We consulted with stakeholders to come up with measures to reduce traffic at rush hour. We are finalising a plan that will ensure that a number of services on our roads are not provided before 9am,” the budget speech had stated.
 Bonett, who took over the transport portfolio in January, said his ministry will publish a white paper this summer.
  “The public consultation will be about short-term measures on the reorganisation and optimisation of traffic aimed at reducing congestion,” he told Times of Malta.
 Previously, Bonett had told TVM he was persisting with the work done by his predecessor, Aaron Farrugia, and continuing discussions with stakeholders.

Watch: Galdes certain he enjoys PM's confidence after reported 'dressing down',timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/watch-galdes-certain-enjoys-pm-confidence-reported-dressing-down.1093912,13-06-2024,004114.png,"Housing Minister Roderick Galdes has avoided commenting on a reported dressing down from the prime minister in the wake of Labour's results in the European elections.
 Although he did not deny the reports, Galdes said he was sure he continued to have Robert Abela's confidence. 
 Times of Malta reported on Wednesday that Galdes was criticised at a meeting of the Labour executive and the parliamentary group because people around him failed to show respect for those asking for services from the ministry.
  Malta Today reported that Galdes was also singled out for criticism over being the minister responsible for a debacle in Siġġiewi that saw magistrates reversing an order to register 99 voters in unfinished flats ahead of the election. 
 Labour won the EP elections, but a 42,000-vote majority in 2019 was narrowed to some 8,000.
 Replying to questions at Naxxar counting hall, where he turned up to watch vote-counting for the council of his hometown Qormi, Galdes said meetings of the executive and the parliamentary group, like the Cabinet's, were confidential and he would not comment or speculate about them.
 He pointed out, however, that the prime minister had spoken publicly of their long personal friendship.
 He also pointed out that as housing minister, he had piloted the biggest housing reforms in 30 years and would continue to work hard for as long as the prime minister kept him in the post.
 He said that his 20 years as an MP and 10 years as a minister were a reflection of the way he worked among the people right from the day following every election. 
 It was the role of every MP to be sensitive to the needs of the people, including, in his case, to ensure housing affordability.
 MPs also had to be very careful to analyse the message of the voters and changing trends in society, he said.
 He said he was confident he enjoyed the confidence of the prime minister and he would continue to be loyal to him and the government.

 The Auditor General has been asked to investigate alleged abuse of public funds by the Films Commission, the Tourism Authority and Clayton Bartolo in connection with the tourism minister's wedding last weekend.

 But even before the festival was held, the facility was used for the minister's wedding. 
 The party referred to a report by The Shift News and called on the auditor to investigate what appeared to be abuse of public funds, with spending made for a public purpose having been used for a private activity.  
 The minister, meanwhile, denied the claims, saying in a Facebook post that he and his bride had paid for everything used at their civil wedding and he was saddened that the ceremony had become a political football.
  In another Facebook post on Monday, Bartolo said he looked forward to the auditor's investigation and was offering his full cooperation.
 He said he expected ADPD's administration to resign once it was confirmed he had committed no wrongdoing.

‘L’ Ors’ – a forgotten satirical paper of the 1920s,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/l-ors-forgotten-satirical-paper-1920s.1094581,07-03-2024,"004126.png,004127.png,004128.png,004129.png,004130.png,004131.png,004132.png","The 1920s witnessed a young nation exploring self-awareness and embarking on a consistent political journey towards what looked like a mirage of statehood. Before that, patriotic movements already boasted some presence, but rather unfocussed in their ideals and isolated in their action.
 Those home-grown nationalists who struggled to blossom identified more clearly with what they didn’t want than with what they wanted.
 The hordes of highly vocal Italian political exiles who found refuge in Malta in the second third of the 19th century carried to the island their baggage of strident libertarian philosophies and ideals of national dignity, which spilled over and slowly contaminated some Maltese dreamers, admittedly rather few and quite unregimented at first.
 Italian refugees published their own newspapers in Malta, extolling unification, democracy and freedom from foreign oppression, and also infiltrated some of the purely domestic Maltese dailies and periodicals. Moulding pride in national identity proved a determining catalyst.
  When, in 1921, Malta for the first time achieved a semblance of limited self-government, the political media scene blew up. Some fractures which pre-existed the liberal constitution solidified, others waned, and new fault lines appeared.
 The nationalist movement comprised two, at first unfriendly, wings; one – the Panzavecchian – moderate and ready to try and make the imperialist concessions work, another – the Mizzian – less conciliatory, relentlessly resisting the war on Malta’s historic Italian culture waged by the colonialists.
 On the imperialist side, Gerald Strickland and Augustus Bartolo believed that Malta could aspire to no finer destiny than that of remaining the colony of a great empire. A nascent labour movement solidified into an organised party under William Savona.
 The followers of Manwel Dimech, a lay visionary with a social and progressive mission, had their adherents too, but never jelled into a political party.
 Each of these blocs promoted its own newspapers, either formally or through the initiatives of (mostly volunteer) sympathisers in any of three languages – English, Maltese or Italian.
  These media represent a veritable encyclopaedia of political thought and action in those turbulent years. Some of these dailies and periodicals have been studied and the results have contributed to enrich the social history of the era.
 Not so L’ Ors. I confess I had never even heard of its existence before a friend recently showed me a few yellowed copies he had inherited. Nor had any of the cognoscenti of 20th-century political history of our islands heard of it. Not one of our prolific and excellent professional historians, like Henry Frendo, Dominic Fenech or Joseph Pirotta, has, as far as I could ascertain, ever mentioned  L’ Ors. That proved a challenge I would not even try to resist. Little could I guess how frustrating any headway would prove.
 L’Ors, a political and satirical weekly in Maltese, saw two distinct spats of life. The first issue went public on February 22, 1923. Then, after a long hiatus, it resumed publication in 1929, but with a new format and an apparently different political programme.
 The paper prided itself on its light contents “Folju tad-dahc, pulitcu u varju” fortified by a rhyming couplet: Jecc intom tcunu mdejka, ghax ghandcom xi dulur  /  L’Ors ixtru u akrauh seuua, bid-dahc tinkasmu sgur. A copy sold for one-and-a-half pence.
  Preliminary to all other questions: who was the editor of the paper? The journal itself never identified the current incumbent and all the articles are anonymous. But the press law required that the responsible editor of any periodical should first register with the police, who kept a specific register of publications and editors.  Unfortunately, the Department of Information could only locate this register starting from the 1950s. Neither the police, nor the DOI, nor the National Archives, though courteously most cooperative, could trace the earlier registers – an irreparable loss for the history of the media. Discouragingly, I had tripped on the first hurdle.
 In default of official info, I had to sleuth around for other clues. The political orientation proved the first surprise – I detected great affinities with Manwel Dimech, who had died in wretched exile in Cairo on April 17, 1921. Although never mentioning Dimech by name, the editorial policy of the paper proclaimed the following after the formulaic allegiance to Religion u Kassisin:
 “Language: Maltese is our truly beloved language above all others, and we declare war on those who want it abolished. 
 “Political party: We side with anyone who promotes the people and with all those who, through good ideas and experience, push the people forward in prosperity and education.
 “Workers: Who can be against them, if he is one of them himself? Though we may disagree with those who lead them (because we know their intention is to cheat them, as they have already done) we will still do our best in the interest of Maltese workers, and with this in mind we will insist on compulsory education and on social welfare and other favourable labour laws”. 
  A policy entirely Dimechian – a programme echoed in the guru’s own Il Bandiera tal Maltin.
  All the subsequent “serious” articles harp on pressing social issues: unemployment, soaring prices, labour exploitation, emigration, poor education. One entire editorial denounces the price of a rotolo of sugar, raised overnight by a ha’penny. Again, the Dimech hallmarks.
 For some unclear reason, the paper promoted Icilio Calleja, the Maltese lawyer who became an internationally acclaimed tenor. But the breakthrough beckoned from the very masthead of the newspaper – a polar bear on the prowl.
 It is not anonymous. On the contrary, it is signed ‘S. Astarita’. That immediately set off a loud set of chimes. Salvu Astarita was Dimech’s closest confidante and friend, the only disciple who summoned the courage to visit and bid farewell to the exile on his way to his fatal banishment to Egypt.
  Astarita (25.1.1890 – 31.7.1972) translated his admiration for Dimech into a cult. Self-taught, he was a man of considerable culture, familiar with literature, a competent painter and graphic artist. 
 Astarita had already published a pro-Dimech newspaper, Malta tal Maltin.  This makes the attribution of him being editor of  L’Ors more plausible.
 Every issue of L’Ors published two political cartoons; some proudly display the signature S. Astarita. Others included S. Agius, ToT, E. Cepardi (?), A. Dacoronia and Bos.
 Those caricatures, never reproduced before, deserve a place in an illustrated history of Maltese political humour.
 One of the many problems with political satire is that it ages rapidly. The graphics often refer to some narrative which contemporaries would immediately recognise, but the barb loses its bite the moment the transient target fades from memory. It is relatively easy to recognise the politicians satirised, much less so to identify what failing, scandal, gaffe or misdeed the cartoonist is aiming at.
 Even the name of the paper raises questions. Is L’Ors a play on words? In Maltese the word may mean either a bear or a pastime. I well recall my foreign language teacher confessing how baffled he was when he asked for a translation into Italian of the sentence: my pastime is fishing. Relying on Maltese, a student approximated:  Il mio orso è pisciare.
  The first run of L’Ors stopped publication on April 7, 1923, probably through failing popular support. A second run tried its luck again on January 12, 1929, as a  Giurnal ghas-sod u ghac-ciait. Its orientation changes drastically and it becomes openly nationalist. Very likely run by different publishers and directed by a different editor, it contains the expected uncomplimentary pen pictures of adversaries and criticism of the current Strickland government, but shorn of any political graphics.
 A favourite and frequent butt of its derision becomes the trade-unionist and politician Joseph Orlando Smith portrayed as a sorry object of ridicule, his very name turned to Burlandu – from burla, a joke. Not that the negative judgements passed by political adversaries have to be taken as gospel truth, but, many years later,
 Governor Bonham-Carter too recorded in his secret diaries how poorly impressed the Colonial Secretary Malcolm MacDonald had been by Orlando Smith, “a very lightweight” (John Manduca, The Bonham Carater Diaries, Malta, 2004, p. 256).
 I trust this brief and hurried introduction to a forgotten source of Malta’s 100-year-old political narrative will only serve as an appetiser. There is still so much to discover and to learn.

 “Together, Gozo can again become a paradise; we can make it pristine once again and make it into the heaven it should be,” the Nationalist Party leader said.  
 Grech was speaking to the party faithful in Sannat when he said the government was disinterested in the needs of Gozitans and had failed the island in healthcare, security, justice, infrastructure and the economy.  
  In regards to the health sector, Grech said since the Labour government came into power, there have been four health ministers who have failed to start works on the development of the promised new Gozo hospital. 
 Grech said that police presence in Gozo has decreased by a third while criminality increased.  
 The government also failed to build a new courthouse, he said.
 “The courthouse that exists is inaccessible to people with disabilities and those with mobility problems,” he said. “Not being able to access the court is an injustice in itself,” Grech added
 On Infrastructure, the PN leader said that only 100 roads in Gozo have been repaired. 
 “Those statics include giving a layer of tarmac or any small repairs, not that they completely changed the road from top to bottom”.

Government should not permit the extradition of Daniel Joe Meli - PN,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/government-permit-extradition-daniel-joe-meli-pn.1096822,16-08-2024,004180.png,"Updated 3.15pm
 The government should not allow Daniel Joe Meli to be extradited to the US but have him tried locally for crimes committed in Malta, the PN has said. 
 In a statement on Friday, the Nationalist Party said the government should not simply accept Maltese citizens being extradited overseas to be indicted in a foreign court when it is clear that the crimes that the person is being investigated over were committed in Malta. 
 This applies doubly when the crimes on which extradition is being requested are also crimes that exist within Maltese law, it said.
 Meli, 27, is currently fighting a request to be extradited to the US after FBI investigations linked him to alleged sales of malware on the dark web over a period of ten years. 
 He initially consented to the extradition but recanted after changing lawyers, arguing that he was not in the right state of mind when he agreed to the initial request. 
 His new lawyers, Arthur Azzopardi and Franco Debono, have filed constitutional proceedings as they seek to stave off their client's extradition.
 Opposition Leader Bernard Grech and shadow justice minister Karol Aquilina said they met with Meli’s parents and discussed the need for the state to protect the interests of Maltese citizens who are contesting procedures to be extradited overseas. 
 “It is the PN’s position that the Maltese Government should not permit the extradition of Daniel Joseph Meli. Instead, the government should ensure that Maltese authorities initiate legal proceedings against him in our courts and if he is found guilty, should serve his sentence in Malta,” they said. 
 The statement added that Meli’s case highlights a clear and urgent need to update the law to allow a person to appeal an extradition decision, even if they consented to it. 
 “The PN is ready to make itself available so that, in agreement with the Government and as soon as possible, parliament can discuss and approve the needed amendments to our laws in this regard.” 
 Their statement comes one day after the Justice Ministry, in a brief statement, said it was ""closely following"" the case. 
 Currently, a person who accepts to be extradited does not have the right to appeal that decision, under any circumstance. Meli's lawyers argue that is unconstitutional and should change.
 According to sources, both the government and the Opposition are inclined to revise the law to allow some form of appeal process.
 Reacting, the government acknowledged the PN's suggestion and reiterated it was closely following the case.
 The government on Thursday said it was taking into account the judgments already delivered by the Maltese courts, as well as the declarations regarding Meli’s health.
 In a statement on Friday, it urged the PN to understand the legal complexities of the situation, the legal parameters linked to a 2006 treaty, and Meli's acceptance to be extradited.
 The government said it was evaluating all legal parameters so that whoever broke the law in Malta faced justice here. It would also ensure stronger safeguards in the process through which a person voluntarily accepts to be extradited.

'Gafa's position no longer tenable as he lied about Ghirxi and blamed her' - PN,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/gafa-position-no-longer-tenable-lied-ghirxi-blamed-her-pn.1097246,27-08-2024,"004182.png,004183.png","Angelo Gafa's position as police commissioner is no longer tenable because he lied about Nicolette Ghirxi hours after her murder, knowing she could not speak for herself because she was dead, the PN said.
 During the press conference on Monday afternoon, the opposition's home affairs and civil liberties shadow ministers Darren Carabott and Graziella Attard Previ stopped short of calling on Gafa to resign.
 ""A few hours after the murder he felt comfortable facing the media and blamed Nicolette, saying she didn't want to sit for the risk assessment,"" Carabott said.
 ""Gafa lied to the people and worse than that, he lied about a person who was murdered whose voice he knew would never be heard again. He always sticks his neck out for the politicians - this time he's lying for them. His position is no longer tenable.""
  Carabott was referring to a Sunday Times of Malta  story which revealed that in April Ghirxi had agreed to take a risk assessment for domestic violence but told a friend and her lawyer that she was “talked out of it” by professionals when she attended her evaluation.
 Those professionals were employed by the Foundation of Social Welfare Services (FSWS). The foundation told Times of Malta that its risk assessors categorically deny talking Ghirxi out of taking an assessment. 
 Carabott said the problem was not the workers and the officers, but the system, which once again had failed another domestic violence victim.
 ""She was murdered because of a system that failed her,"" Attard Previ said.
 ""The system is using tools that lack the sensitivity to detect the complexities of domestic violence and to understand when victims are at risk.""
 Ghirxi was found murdered in her Swatar apartment two weeks ago. Her ex-partner Edward Johnston was shot dead by police hours later.
  An independent police complaints board is investigating the case but that is not enough, according to the PN MPs.
 The board investigates police operations, but the failure of the systems in Nicolette's murder goes beyond the police, they said.
 It is only through an independent inquiry that the whole truth about the different systems can come out, to ensure there is not another case like Ghirxi's, they said.
 ""The inquiry must clearly encompass all the systems at work without hindering court proceedings, and its conclusions must be debated in multiple sessions in parliament,"" Carabott said.
 ""Also, the fact that there is not one woman on the police board investigating the case shows the government hasn't yet understood the message.""
 Last week the family of Nicolette Ghirxi also called for an independent inquiry into the circumstances surrounding her murder at the hands of her ex-partner.
 Her former lawyer Joseph Borda and two members of the Ghirxi family told Times of Malta they wanted an inquiry “to establish the facts leading to her tragic death”.

Malta asked to change its EU commissioner nominee,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/malta-asked-change-eu-commissioner-nominee.1097271,27-08-2024,004205.png,"Updated 5.05pm with OPM statement
 European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen wants Malta to change its nominee for European Commissioner, Times of Malta is informed. 
 Glenn Micallef, who stepped down as the prime minister's head of secretariat last May, was nominated for the prestigious Brussels-based post last month by prime minister Robert Abela. 
 Von der Leyen is understood to be pressuring the Maltese government to nominate a woman in Micallef's stead, as she pushes for a more gender-balanced commission. But sources said the president is also targeting Malta because Micallef is among the least experienced of the nominated commissioners.
 Sources in Brussels told Times of Malta that von der Leyen has suggested keeping Malta's existing EU Commissioner, Helena Dalli, for a second term, something the government is understood to be reluctant to do. 
 They added that von der Leyen is believed to have also asked at least two other member states to swap their male nominees. 
 A spokesperson from the Office of the Prime Minister stopped short of denying that Malta's nominee is under pressure. 
 ""The engagement process is ongoing and the president is speaking to member states,"" the spokesperson said. 
 When contacted, Micallef declined to speculate.
 ""The process for appointment of commissioners is ongoing and, as expected, talks are taking place with member states,"" he told Times of Malta.
 ""Continued constructive engagement with the president-elect of the European Commission is imperative to help deliver the priorities for the next mandate."" 
 Abela eschewed Malta's tradition of nominating long-standing politicians to the commissioner post when he put forward Micallef, a 34-year-old EU policy expert, as Malta's nominee. 
 Micallef has extensive EU experience, having led Maltese government briefs in Brussels for years, and it is understood that von der Leyen is not questioning his competence on EU affairs.
 But his lack of political experience, coupled with Malta's relatively minor clout within the EU, is complicating matters for Malta's nominee.
 Von der Leyen has pledged to make the next EU Commission more gender-balanced, and publicly called on member states to each present two nominees - a man and woman - for commission posts. 
 Most member states have ignored that request, noting that no such provision exists within the EU treaties. Of the 21 nominees presented so far, 16 are men. 
 Although the deadline for nominees closes on Friday, von der Leyen has roughly another week after that date before she formally assigns portfolios to her commission-in-waiting. 
 She can use that time to negotiate with member states, as she is understood to be doing with the Maltese government and others, promising stronger portfolios to those who deliver favourable nominees and vice-versa. 
 Malta had originally nominated former deputy prime minister Chris Fearne to the post, but those plans were dashed when a court last month ruled that Fearne should stand trial for fraud over the hospitals' scandal.
 Abela's government then changed tack and nominated Micallef to the post. Times of Malta had reported that his nomination had ruffled feathers within Labour Party circles, with former and current cabinet members warning that MEPs will struggle to see beyond his inexperience.
 Malta's outgoing EU commissioner is Helena Dalli, who held several ministerial roles before being nominated in 2019. She is understood to have lobbied to be nominated Malta's president earlier this year, and was disappointed about having missed out.  
 As EU Commissioner for Equality, Dalli has had a relatively low-profile term in Brussels. 
 Von der Leyen's reported willingness to have Dalli for a second term could be a sign that she has a bigger portfolio for her in mind. 
 One diplomat who spoke to Times of Malta on condition of anonymity believes that is what is currently at play. 
 “Von der Leyen is probably promising us a better portfolio if we agree to renominate her,” the diplomat said.
 “If that's the case, the government must decide: stand by our nominee and look strong but get a weaker portfolio. Or swap nominee, look weak but get a stronger brief.” 
 But another diplomat within EU circles spoke damningly of the idea. 
 ""Dalli has had a borderline useless portfolio. She is easy for von der Leyen to control,"" the diplomat told Times of Malta. ""Having her for a second term would just ensure Malta is effectively irrelevant within the commission."" 
 Should Helena Dalli be out of the picture, government sources said Micallef's omission could pave the way for two other female candidates to be nominated to the commission: Environment Minister Miriam Dalli, or Malta's Permanent Representative to the EU Marlene Bonnici. 
 Both are familiar faces in Brussels: Dalli was an influential MEP who also served as a vice president of the S&D political grouping, while Bonnici has served as Malta's ambassador to the EU for almost a decade. 
 The process to appoint commissioners involves three separate EU institutions, as well as member states, directly. 
 Article 17 of the Treaty of the European Union states that the list of presumptive EU Commissioners must be drafted ""on the basis of the suggestions made by Member States."" 
 That list is then presented by the Council of Ministers ""by common accord"" with the EU Commission president, in this case von der Leyen. 
 Commissioners are then grilled by MEPs, who then vote on comissioner nominees as a group.  If MEPs approve the college of commissioners, the European Council - effectively the government heads of member states - appoint the commission through a qualified majority vote.

"Labour fears low turnout, poor lineup will cost party fourth MEP seat",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/labour-fears-low-turnout-poor-lineup-cost-party-fourth-mep-seat.1091656,21-06-2024,"004245.png,004246.png","Labour will officially begin its campaign for June’s European and local council elections on Sunday, as party insiders fear low turnout and a relatively poor lineup could hinder its bid to retain a fourth MEP seat. 
 The party’s campaign, which officially kicks off at the end of a General Council session scheduled for Sunday morning, will be led by a core group of insiders that also steered Labour to a record victory in the 2022 general election.
 That team includes two of Robert Abela’s closest lieutenants – adviser Aleander Balzan and head of secretariat  Glenn Micallef – as well as Malta Film Commission chief  Johann Grech.
 It also involves Kurt Farrugia, who has played a key role in all Labour campaign victories since 2012, in a significant way.
 Farrugia, who runs Malta Enterprise as CEO, declined to comment when contacted and Labour insiders downplayed talk of any one individual leading the campaign.
 “It’s the same team we had in 2022,” one source said.
 “An operation this big cannot be managed by just one person. When it comes to political strategy, for example, [Labour president] Ramona Attard and [Labour deputy leader] Daniel Micallef are also heavily involved.”
 With just over 40 days to go until the June 8 election, the party finds itself in the unusual position of bracing itself for disappointment while exerting a commanding lead over its Nationalist Party rivals.
 For while all polls suggest Labour is poised to thump the PN by tens of thousands of votes in the MEP election, they also hint at a historically low turnout. And that, Labour insiders say, will likely mean the party will lose the fourth MEP seat and slim council majorities it won in 2019.
  “The distance between the two parties remains significant, but if turnout is what it is predicted to be, then we will be the ones who suffer the most,” said a Labour MP who asked not to be named.
 Another MP said they feared many voters would spoil their ballots as a sign of protest. 
 ""I get the sense a growing number are upset about something or other. It's hard to gauge how we'll do: getting a fourth seat will depend on how votes carry, and local councils are very dependent on micro issues and specific personalities. But I'd be lying if I said I was feeling very confident,"" he said.  
 A third MP was categorical.
 “Anything below a 20,000 vote majority will be a big red card for us. Anything above that will be good, given the circumstances. And to be frank – a 20,000 margin will be a pyrrhic victory for the PN, because it means Bernard Grech will stay put. I’d sacrifice a fourth MEP seat for a general election victory,” the MP said.
 The party is expected to field more than 370 council candidates across Malta and Gozo’s 68 localities, versus the roughly 300 that the PN is likely to present.
 It also has nine candidates lined up for the European Parliament elections, though only one – Alex Agius Saliba – is a guaranteed vote-catcher. Contrast that to its 2019 lineup, which included heavy hitters Miriam Dalli and Alfred Sant as well as Josianne Cutajar, who hoovered up Gozitan votes.
 The overall feeling is that Labour sorely lacks a big name that could attract voters.
  “It’s a poor lineup,” one MP conceded.
 “In previous elections we had people like Louis Grech, Edward Scicluna and Alfred Sant on the ballot. Now our star candidate is Alex Agius Saliba.” 
 Another MP said many voters appeared apathetic or unsure.
 “When I speak to people during house visits, many are asking me: ‘who should I vote for? I don’t know these candidates’. But in general, I get the sense many people just aren’t very engaged in politics,” the MP said.  
  According to a Times of Malta poll carried out earlier in April, Labour is leading the PN by an  estimated 28,000 votes. But a large chunk of voters – as many as one in every three – say they do not intend to vote.
 While that percentage is expected to shrink as election day nears, it is still causing some sleepless nights among Labour organisers.
 In 2019, turnout reached 72.6 per cent, which was two percentage points lower than in 2014. But back then, traditionally blue districts saw the lowest turnouts.
 None of the Labour insiders that Times of Malta spoke to was bullish about the party’s prospects. Many said the party’s success in the 2019 MEP and council elections means they are now trapped in the dilemma of the perennial winner: each electoral victory is judged solely against the previous one.
 In 2019, Labour won a fourth MEP seat and also secured majorities in several councils that traditionally leaned PN, such as Mosta, Valletta and San Ġwann.
  Labour insiders say it will be hard to repeat that result.
 “We’re working towards that goal, but it will be very difficult,” said an official involved in the campaign. “And anything less than our 2019 result might be perceived as a failure.”
 A Labour MP said he would like to see more work being done to prepare the grassroots for that eventuality.
 “Of course, we will never say it out loud, but there is genuine concern. And I think we’re not spelling it out clearly enough to our supporters,” the MP said.
 The party intends to outspend its rivals in its drive to mobilise voters, and it is already putting that war chest to use: witness the billboards dotted across the country, encouraging party supporters to attend a May 1 rally in Valletta. The hope is that a large crowd will boost morale and mobilise grassroots voters who are currently disengaged.
 “Optics play a big part in campaigning, there’s an element of human psychology at play,” said a Labour veteran with years of campaign experience.
 “Don’t underestimate how influential those aerial shots of large crowds can be.”
 Robert Abela will fire the starting gun on the party’s campaign with a speech this morning that follows a series of town hall events the party has organised in recent weeks.
 In that speech, Abela is expected to emphasise the importance of MEPs working in the national interest and encourage citizens to play an active role in shaping their towns and villages – a message that seeks to encourage people to get involved in local politics, and to get to the ballot box come June 8.

 The PN observed that while the government in recent weeks had trumpeted the public service, the prime minister had blamed civil servants and public officers for the Labour Party's negative results in the June 8 elections.

The graphics that show PL losing ground across councils as PN makes gains,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/the-graphics-show-pl-losing-ground-across-councils-pn-makes-gains.1093925,14-06-2024,004326.png,"Labour has lost over 11,000 votes in the local councils counted so far compared to previous elections in 2019, shrinking the gap between the parties to 23,000 votes, as vote counting for Malta’s local council election enters its third and final day.
 This translates to a 13% gap between the two parties. This stood at 18%, or a staggering 47,000 votes, after all votes were counted in 2019.
 This gap is expected to shrink further come Friday night, with many PN-leaning towns set to be called throughout the day.
 
 Labour’s losses across virtually all localities have been matched by gains made by both PN and independent or third-party candidates, in a similar pattern to that of the MEP elections held on the same day, where the votes lost by Labour were divided between the two.
 
 
 With 44 of the 68 councils counted so far, PN has gained some 6,500 votes compared to its performance in 2019, while independent and third-party candidates have upped their votes by 4,200.
 
 Labour’s losses have been particularly heavy in some key localities. The party lost almost 1,300 votes in Żebbuġ, dropping 18 percentage points, and over 1,600 votes in Birkirkara, losing its majority in the process.
 The party also lost heavily in several localities which it held, including Marsaxlokk (down 14 percentage points), Pietá (where it dropped 18 percentage points) and Xagħra (losing 12 points to turn a once-foregone conclusion into a close race).
 PN’s gains have generally been more modest in most localities, but the party has upped its tally sharply in Pietá, Pembroke and St Paul’s Bay, amongst others.
 Labour wins 27 councils, PN takes 13
 Of the 44 councils counted, Labour has held on to its majority in 27, with PN having the upper hand in 13, including narrowly winning Msida for the first time in two decades and retaking San Ġwann after it had lost the locality in its catastrophic 2019 showing.
 No majority emerged in a further four councils – Għarb, Birkirkara, Mellieħa and Żebbuġ – where independent or small-party candidates will be key to tipping the balance of power.
 
 Although PN’s gains have not been large enough to win several localites back, the party has upped its seat tally by 14 in the localities counted so far, now holding 134 seats. Independents and third-parties are also better off, now holding five more seats than they did during the past legislatures.
 
 Labour, on the other hand, has dropped 11 seats since 2019, but, with a total of 174 seats, will still hold 40 more seats than PN.

EU Commissioner nomination ruffles feathers: ‘I hope they don’t humiliate him’,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/eu-commissioner-nomination-ruffles-feathers.1095971,30-07-2024,004401.png,"The surprise nomination of Glenn Micallef, Robert Abela’s former head of secretariat, to be Malta’s next European Commissioner has ruffled feathers within Labour circles, with former and current cabinet members warning that MEPs will struggle to see beyond his inexperience.
 Micallef’s nomination eschews the long-standing custom of nominating a politician to the role, thrusting the relatively unknown and inexperienced 34-year-old into the spotlight.
 His nomination comes just days after courts dashed Abela’s hopes to reinstate Chris Fearne’s nomination, but Thursday’s announcement appears to have rankled within Labour circles.
 Speaking to Times of Malta, one former minister described the choice to send someone who is not a politician and with such little experience as “a slap to the face of the EU”.
 
 “Other countries are sending current and former prime ministers. We are sending someone whose experience is a low-profile role,” they said.
 Meanwhile, one current minister said that although Micallef is sharp and well-versed in European affairs, he will struggle to defend his lack of experience.
  The move to nominate an untested newcomer will almost certainly lead to Malta receiving one of the least coveted portfolios within the EU cabinet, the minister argued.
 “We’re already irrelevant. We’re about to become even more irrelevant. I just hope the MEPs don’t choose to humiliate him because of his lack of experience.”
 All commissioner nominees will face the European parliamentarians for a grilling before they are formally accepted.
 Several more experienced heads had been touted as potential candidates, with one former minister telling Times of Malta that someone like Energy Minister and former MEP Miriam Dalli would have been a more apt choice. But, they admit, that move could have eventually backfired if future Electrogas-related revelations emerged, forcing her to step down.
 But the nomination was seen as somewhat of a poisoned chalice, with nobody within the cabinet group – with the notable exception of Culture Minister Owen Bonnici – believed to have been actively vying for the role.
 According to a Politico report, 10 of the EU’s 27 member states have submitted their nomination so far.
 Four of these – Slovakia, Latvia, Croatia and the Netherlands – chose to re-confirm their existing Commissioner. Of the remaining six countries, four of them are nominating either current or former ministers, with a fifth, Finland, opting for one of their MEPs.
 The only non-politician from the bunch is Slovenia’s Tomaž Vesel, a 57-year-old lawyer who spent most of the past decade presiding over the country’s Court of Audit.
 Micallef is two decades Vesel’s junior, but has seen a rapid rise within government circles, having spent the past years serving as Abela’s head of secretariat, after taking over from Clyde Caruana in late 2022 when the latter was co-opted to parliament.
 The role of head of secretariat, better known by its former title of chief of staff, effectively meant that Micallef was responsible for the day-to-day running of the prime minister’s office.
 Micallef was also tasked with leading the government’s response to the findings of the Jean Paul Sofia inquiry, coordinating a cabinet committee set up to implement the inquiry’s recommendations.
 He also represented Malta, together with Foreign Minister Ian Borg, in a Ukraine-led peace summit late last year.
 Micallef was described as “a sherpa, he goes with the Prime Minister and organises a meeting or two, but he wasn’t a diplomat and probably never set foot in an embassy in his life”.
 That is not to say that Micallef doesn’t have any experience with EU matters.
 Before joining Abela’s office, he served as the director general for Malta’s EU coordination department, a body within the foreign office that is responsible for managing Malta’s position in discussions with EU institutions and making sure European laws and policies are slotted into Malta’s political system.
 He is broadly seen to be an expert in EU policy, having also served as Abela’s advisor on EU affairs.

  Labour also released a statement saying the PL councillors elected in Żebbuġ would be supporting Zammit Lupi's bid to serve as mayor. 
 They said that an agreement was reached after discussions were held that ""prioritised the best interests of the locality"". 
 It said that it was also agreed that PL's electoral manifesto for Żebbuġ will serve to inform the council's work for the coming legislature. 
 However Zammit Lupi said that he has his own manifesto but would accept ""any idea or proposal that will do good for Żebbuġ"".

 Zammit Lupi stormed the polls in Żebbuġ during the local council elections earlier this month, receiving a whopping 2,342 first-count votes. 
 A popular independent councillor during the previous legislature, his favour among the people of Żebbuġ seemed to also have rubbed off on his mother, Lillibeth Zammit Lupi, who also ran for a seat on the same council and won.

Robert Abela wants the conclusions of the Vitals inquiry published,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/robert-abela-wants-conclusions-vitals-inquiry-published.1091768,21-06-2024,004434.png,"The conclusions of an inquiry into the Vitals hospitals deal should be made public “for the sake of transparency"", Robert Abela has said.
 “I believe that the document should be available for public consumption,” the prime minister told reporters shortly after a court heard that the inquiry is now at the Attorney General’s office.
 The probe, which began in late 2019, was tasked with looking into any criminal acts committed by Joseph Muscat or members of his cabinet in relation to the privatisation of three state hospitals.
 It is up to Attorney General Victoria Buttigieg to decide whether or not to publish the conclusions of the inquiry. Her predecessor, Peter Grech, had opted to do so when urged to publish Egrant inquiry conclusions in 2018 by Muscat, who at the time was prime minister. 
  Contracts to privatise the hospitals were annulled by a court last year, which concluded that top government officials had colluded with the concessionaires, against the public interest. 
 Muscat, who led the government at the time as prime minister, has fought tooth and nail against the magisterial inquiry, saying that the magistrate leading it is politically motivated. Abela has lent his weight to those arguments, saying that the timing of its conclusion reeks of “political terrorism” by the judiciary, as it will condition voters ahead of the June 8 MEP elections. 
 A court heard on Tuesday morning that the inquiry was concluded on Thursday, April 24 and sent to the attorney general’s office the next day. 
 Speaking on Tuesday, Abela repeated that he did not believe the timing of the inquiry weeks before the June 8 MEP elections, was coincidental.
 “In my opinion, it was a message,” he said. 
 
 When asked what he would do if the inquiry singled out former or current ministers or top civil servants for their role in the hospitals deal, Abela said his decision would depend on what the inquiry said about those individuals.
 Abela said he was speaking hypothetically but only spoke about current members of the government and civil servants.
  Castille sources later said Abela was likely referring to comments made by lawyer Jason Azzopardi on Facebook. 
 The former PN minister and lawyer has posted about the inquiry several times but sources specifically pointed to a specific status update published on Tuesday morning. 
 “In cabinet right now, it was mentioned that there is a minister who has had  criminal action ordered against him after an inquiry,” Azzopardi said. 
 Azzopardi published that post at 11.01am. At the time, cabinet was being held in public and hearing from business leaders about the country's economic policies. 
  Abela was also asked to react for comments made by the Chamber of Advocates who accused the prime minister of unleashing a direct attack on the judiciary. 
 The prime minister reacted by saying part of his job was to act as a check on other institutions, adding that he was doing so “as cautiously as possible”
 He said the Chamber of Advocates often sway towards the “establishment” if not part of it. 
 “Therefore everyone can arrive to their own conclusions,” he said. 
 He said everyone will be able to give their own analysis on event, when Malta goes to the polls. 
 Muscat had fought tooth and nail against the magisterial inquiry, saying that the magistrate leading it is politically motivated. Abela had lent his weight to those arguments, saying that the timing of its conclusion reeks of “political terrorism” by the judiciary.
 A court heard on Tuesday morning that the inquiry was concluded on Thursday, April 24 and sent to the attorney general’s office the next day. 
 Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech has slammed Abela for lashing out at the magistrate responsible for the inquiry. 
 ""They are attacking our country’s institutions, because they are working,"" Grech said.
 ""Abela and Muscat first did everything to stop us from taking our hospitals back, and now they are doing all they can to stop those responsible for this theft from paying the price. Justice must be done if you are the prime minister, an ex prime minister or a regular citizen,"" he said.

 The report tracks EU countries’ progress towards education goals.
 In Malta, a third of 15-year-olds do not have minimum proficiency in maths, reading, and science, with boys underperforming more than girls, according to the report.
 The issue spans socio-economic groups, with nearly half of students from disadvantaged backgrounds lacking basic skills. Even among students from wealthier families, under-achievement persists, with rates of 17.2% in maths, 19.9% in reading, and 14.2% in science.
 Students attending state schools struggle the most, with 40.6% of students lacking basic maths skills.
 Church schools fare slightly better at 25.5%, while independent schools perform best, with only 16.7% underachieving.
 Conversely, the highest top performance rate is found in independent schools (17.1%), followed by Church schools (7.1%) and state schools (5%).
 “These results also reflect the unequal distribution of students from disadvantaged and advantaged socio-economic backgrounds across independent, church and state schools, pointing to a stratified school system by students’ socio-economic status,” the report says. It emphasised the need for targeted support to schools with higher proportions of disadvantaged students.
 The report also highlights the link between student wellbeing and academic outcomes.
 The report says one in four students reported being bullied at least a few times a month, while only 63.6% of Maltese students feel they belong at school—the lowest rate in the EU. Those who felt a sense of belonging scored an average of 25 points higher than their peers.
 Truancy rates, however, have seen improvement, dropping by 16 percentage points since 2018.
 Nonetheless, 28.5% of students reported skipping at least one day of school in the preceding two weeks.
 Malta’s vocational education participation remains stagnant at 27.8%, far below the EU average of 54.2%. On a more positive note, work-based learning is on the rise, with 55.4% of graduates aged 20-34 having been exposed to such programmes, edging closer to the EU target of 60% by 2025.
 Higher education attainment has surged in recent years. Almost half (46.3%) of Maltese 25-to-34-year-olds now hold a tertiary qualification, surpassing the EU average of 43.1% and exceeding Malta’s 2030 target of 45%.
 Despite this success, Malta lags in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education, with only 15.4% of graduates earning degrees in those fields, compared to the EU average of 26.6%.
 Gender disparities are also notable: only three in 10 STEM graduates are women, and just 8.1% of female graduates pursued STEM qualifications in 2022.
 Progress was also seen in lifelong learning, with 39.9% of adults aged 25-64 engaged in education and training in 2022, up from 32.8% in 2016.
 However, participation remains uneven, with 65.9% of highly educated individuals engaging in lifelong learning compared to just 16.3% of adults with low qualifications.
 Malta’s labour market also faces significant skill mismatches despite high employment rates.
 “Despite a high employment rate in Malta, horizontal and vertical skills mismatches are prevalent, while there are also significant shortages in certain sectors, including transport, professional services, ICT, tourism, hospitality and retail, and manufacturing,” the report says.

Government to re-establish Commercial Court,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/government-reestablish-commercial-court.1098345,20-09-2024,"004460.png,004461.png","The Government plans to re-establish the Commercial Court as an independent entity to address commercial cases more efficiently, Robert Abela said on Friday.
 The prime minister announced the initiative during an event organised by Żgħażagħ Laburisti in Valletta, during which he fielded questions from young people.
 Abela revealed that the government will reinstate the Commercial Court as separate from the First Court.  
 “This is necessary due to Malta’s recent economic growth,” he said.
 On the judicial process and Malta’s correctional system, Abela highlighted ongoing changes, including reforms in the family court, and added that the next step towards progress is the specialisation of the judiciary. 
 Furthermore, he emphasised that Malta's penal system must continue evolving into one focused on reform, helping individuals reintegrate into society.
 He also noted that changes related to freezing orders were implemented to address areas that had been “excessive”.
 On planning, Abela insisted that the guiding principle is zero tolerance for development on virgin land that is not earmarked for construction.
 He also highlighted that changes are underway to ensure that no development works commence until a final decision is made at the appeal stage for any proposed development.
 The prime minister said that the government aims to continue promoting a policy of incentives rather than introducing new taxes.
 He emphasised the “strong” tax exemptions on vacant properties and the incentives for investing in properties within the UCA.
 On tourism, Abela insisted that the government must focus on the quality of the tourist rather than the quantity. 
 “We have to make a choice that favours the development of quality. We cannot say no to every development, but we must aim for quality tourism which stems from prudent, quality investment,” he said.
 Abela also referred to Glenn Micallef’s nomination for the European Commission which was “criticised in some quarters but welcomed by several youth groups as a positive step for the country.”
  He added that youth activism must be strengthened and reflected in the country’s decision-making.
 When questioned about mental health, Abela acknowledged that it can affect anyone and stressed the importance of more community-based services, closer to the people.
 Abela said Labour must renew itself from the government “because we want to keep making your dreams a reality, together with you.”

'Government's online translator is mediocre and a threat' - Maltese students,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/government-online-translator-mediocre-threat-maltese-students.1097209,25-08-2024,"004470.png,004471.png","A government-backed automatic translation website for Maltese and English is ""mediocre"", promotes incorrect use of the Maltese language and undermines translation and proofreading jobs, a student association has said. 
 L-Għaqda tal-Malti - Università said the traduzzjoni.mt website promoted by the government was providing substandard Maltese translations, degrading the richness of the language and threatening language professions.
 The association said it also fears the tool could negatively impact students' future prospects.
 In a statement issued Sunday, the students referred to a 30-second advert uploaded to the government's public service Facebook page (""Is-Servizz Pubbliku"") last month.
  The advert shows well-known Maltese personalities Ron Briffa and Frank Zammit watching television and comparing how they each translated a document from English to Maltese.
 Briffa describes translating the document manually as an arduous chore that took much longer than intended, while Zammit - using the government-backed website - says it was a task he quickly got out of the way.
 ""You can upload powerpoints, documents or write whatever you want and it is translated to Maltese,"" he says.
 He then directs Briffa to traduzzjoni.mt, the free, automatic translation platform introduced earlier this year.
 The students said when they tested the platform, the machine responded with shoddy Maltese translations.
 They said while the results may seem acceptable, they were not of a high enough standard and ultimately jeopardise the integrity of the language.
 ""It irritates us that the Centre for the Maltese Language, the brains behind this advert, is breaching its own founding rule: to grow awareness and good use of the Maltese language,"" the students said in their statement.
 ""It appears the centre does not acknowledge that translation work is to be taken seriously. With websites like this one, users can easily fall into the trap of translating legal, medical, economic and political texts wrongly, which could have critical repercussions.""
 The Centre of the Maltese Language was controversially set up just over a year ago and trusted under the leadership of former PBS head of news Norma Saliba, who earlier this week  threw her name into the hat to become the PL's new president.
 Times of Malta reported  last year that the chair of Malta’s National Council of the Maltese Language - a body tasked with similar goals - did not know of plans to create the new centre.
 The website performed poorly when Times of Malta tested it on Sunday.
 A transcript of the Maltese dialogue between Briffa and Zammit as seen in the advert was fed into the platform, which was asked to translate to English.
 But despite the hype, the website  was largely unable to make sense of the simple dialogue in the advert promoting it.
 It could not translate the very first word of the video - kedda (""an arduous chore""), which was left in its original form in the English translation.
  And Briffa telling Zammit he is a clever man (kemm int bravu) turned into 'brave man', completely changing the meaning of the phrase.
 The advert ends with Zammit telling Briffa: "" Qed tara? Issa taf"" (""You see? Now you know"") - which the website translated to ""Are you watching? Now you know"".
 But perhaps the most painful example was when the platform attempted to translate a Maltese expression used by Zammit to explain how efficiently the website translated his document.
 Zammit tells Briffa, ""F'kemm ili ngħidlek ħlistu"" (""I got it out of the way in no time""), only for the website to translate the phrase to: ""In how long I have been telling you I have freed him"" - wrongly interpreting the Maltese turn of phrase while mistaking the word  ħlistu for its other Maltese meaning: 'to free a man'.
 The student association went on to say that professionals who graduate in the Maltese language, proofreading and translation at the Faculty of Arts spend years equipping themselves with knowledge about the intricacies of the language precisely to make sure some meanings do not get lost in translation.
 ""It is shameful that instead of encouraging businesses to invest in human talent for their translation work, it is sending out a message that people can simply rely on a website that does mediocre automatic translations.""
 Research shows that while tools like traduzzjoni.mt can be of great help to users, human intervention is necessary and the advert for the platform oversimplifies what it takes to produce serious translation work, the statement read.

IĠM condemns Chris Cardona's 'irresponsible' criticism of court journalists,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/igm-condemns-chris-cardona-irresponsible-criticism-court-journalists.1097116,23-08-2024,004519.png,"The Institute of Journalists slammed former minister Chris Cardona's ""irresponsible comments"" criticising reporters who covered his testimony in court on Wednesday.
 On the day, Cardona told court he had not read a Memorandum of Understanding with Vitals Global Healthcare before signing it in 2014.
 In his testimony, Cardona said he signed the MOU and others like it because he was “told to do so”.
 Following the sitting, Cardona - who served as minister between 2013 and 2020 - singled out reports published by Times of Malta and  Malta Today for criticism.
 Other reports of the sitting published by Newsbook and  The Malta Independent also reported Cardona speaking similarly under oath.
 Times of Malta stands by its reporting.
 During a different hearing on Thursday, Cardona claimed his testimony had been misreported, and that he did read the document before signing.
 On Friday, the Institute of Maltese Journalists (IĠM) expressed solidarity with the court journalists, condemning his ""irresponsible"" Facebook comments in which he accused court reporters of maliciously misrepresenting his testimony.
 ""The news reports reflected his testimony and as a former politician, he should know better than sounding the dog whistle to instigate hate against journalists.

‘Defaced’ billboards and fake websites: election tricks begin,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/pn-billboards-take-swipe-labour-slogan.1091811,21-06-2024,"004545.png,004546.png,004547.png","The Nationalist Party has launched its billboard campaign, taking a swipe at Labour’s electoral slogan “Is-Saħħa lill-Maltin” (Strength to the Maltese), crossing out the first word and replacing it with “ Sraqna” (We Robbed).
 The billboards were put up overnight across Malta.
 Before the PN launched its billboard countercampaign, the PL slogan had already been targeted by social media users who played around with the word ""saħħa"".
 Some questioned the cheek of PL to include the word - which also means 'health' - following the hospitals' deal fallout, while others replaced "" saħħa"" with the similarly-sounding "" saħta"" (curse).
  At the same time, soon after the party launched its campaign slogan Għalik (For you), a new website that pinched the slogan for a new URL with the same slogan cropped up and ran an attack against the PN.
 Despite being named ghalik.com and using the PN’s branding and colours from its new electoral campaign, the website is not affiliated with the PN in any way.
  The mostly empty website is currently hosting a single video, which has targeted the PN’s new slogan and contradicts the party’s intended message.
 Flashing images of PN politicians, including Bernard Grech and Roberta Metsola, the video, which is titled “Għalihom” says “They don’t want the 8th of June for you, but for themselves”.
 It goes on to play a clip of Grech saying “we will rip them away from the seat of power” and a separate clip of him saying that the PN will be in government in three years.
 The video also features PN education shadow minister Justin Schembri who this week came under fire for equating the Indian diaspora in Malta to “filth”.
 The video ends with a picture of David Casa, Lawrence Gozi and Simon Busuttil, with the words “Għalihom mhux għalik” (for themselves, not for you) superimposed on top of them.
 According to the site’s hosting data, it was created on April 29, with the content of the site being updated on May 1 at around 11 am.
 The site creator is not publicly disclosed and no one has claimed ownership of it at the time of writing.

"Up to cabinet to decide on Muscat’s diplomatic passport, standards czar says",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/up-cabinet-decide-muscat-diplomatic-passport-standards-czar-says.1096271,08-03-2024,004558.png,"It is up to cabinet to decide whether Joseph Muscat should be allowed to retain the use of his diplomatic passport, the Commissioner for Standards in Public Life has said. 
 The commissioner made the ruling following a complaint made by independent candidate Arnold Cassola, shortly after it was revealed that Muscat had been allowed to keep his diplomatic passport as part of his severance package. 
 When he made the complaint in March 2023, Cassola said the fact Muscat retained the diplomatic passport was ""an unheard of misuse of power"". 
 He asked for Prime Minister Robert Abela to be investigated on whether it was an ethics breach to not have Muscat's passport withdrawn. 
 In his decision, the commissioner said that the investigation into the complaint could not continue because there is no indication of wrongdoing by members of the current government. 
 Additionally, the subject of the complaint, Muscat himself, could not be investigated as he is no longer under the remit of the commissioner, having resigned his seat in parliament in October 2020. 
 The commissioner pointed out that former prime minister Lawrence Gonzi had also retained his diplomatic passport. 
 It was also the cabinet's collective decision to grant the diplomatic passport as part of Muscat's exit deal, he said, and the prime minister could not unilaterally decide to revoke a decision made by cabinet, without first raising the issue within the body again. 
 Based on these considerations, Standards Commissioner Joseph Azzopardi said there is no basis for the complaint to continue being investigated. 
 However, he added that the complaint had been examined in the context of 2023 and it is up to the government to decide whether any further action is merited in light of the fact that Muscat is now facing criminal charges related to the hospitals deal.
 In 2020, the Office of the Prime Minister refused to divulge the details of the package, however, it was subsequently revealed that he had received some  €120,000 in severance pay.  
 Times of Malta also revealed that the taxpayer is funding Muscat's use of his Sa Maison office.
 The former prime minister’s severance package also includes a car with a driver as well as the use of a second car, two telephone landlines and an internet connection, a computer or laptop with a printer and scanner, a mobile phone with calls covered up to €2,330 a year, as well as a personal assistant.

"Watch: Transport minister wants ferries, fewer licences and rapid bus transit",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/minister-wants-ferries-fewer-licences-rapid-bus-transit.1098398,22-09-2024,"004612.png,004613.png,004614.png,004615.png,004616.png","Transport Minister Chris Bonett has dozens of ideas on how to ease Malta’s traffic woes but admits he will not be implementing any of them until at least April because “we must get this right”.
 In an interview with Times of Malta, Bonett said he is considering a series of ideas, including allowing people to forfeit their driving licence for a financial incentive and disincentivising young people from learning to drive.
 He is also keen on increasing the use of ferries and is mulling a bus rapid transit system.
 Speaking days before the school rush starts again, the man at the helm of the transport and infrastructure super-ministry said that after eight months in the job he is prepared to start discussing ways to implement concrete measures to ease traffic.
 “It’s time we considered schemes that would allow people to [voluntarily] forfeit their driving licence in return for a financial or tax incentive. We are considering that,” he said.
 “We’re also considering having number plates that allow you to drive your car during certain days and times or that you are charged for driving according to the distance you cover or the emissions you produce on certain days and times.”
 He is also considering discouraging young people from getting a licence in the first place by paying for a number of their cab rides, for instance.
 People hate getting stuck in traffic with Y-plate cabs, he said, but then they also appear to like the service, and the country needs to figure out how to make the best use of it.
 The PN had proposed a similar measure in its 2022 electoral manifesto by giving a €10,000 grant over five years to families who ditch their car and do not buy another vehicle.
  Bonett is unconvinced the underground metro would be the best mass transportation system. Rather, he is keener on making better use of the sea, which he described as the “biggest and most underutilised resource”.
 “Since we made the Valletta ferries free of charge, we saw the number of passengers rise beyond what we had projected. The service is very popular among locals as well as tourists,” he said.
 
 “We can extend the service to Buġibba, for instance, where we are ahead of time to complete the new breakwater project. We are constructing a ferry landing there, which will allow us to start operating the service to and from there as well.
 “And we can do that in other places along the northern and eastern coast, like Marsaxlokk and all the way up to Mellieħa.”
 The Buġibba project, which Infrastructure Malta says is 70 per cent completed, has seen the construction of a new 37-metre pier that will serve to reduce wave impact in the bay, providing increased protection for fishing boats and other small vessels that dock in the area.
 Once completed, the breakwater will also feature mooring facilities and safer platforms for passenger ferries that make use of the area.
 Marrying land and sea mass transport would also allow the government to then introduce a bus rapid transit system, a service similar to rail-based transit but operates with buses that drive in exclusive lanes, separate from general traffic.
 “They would stop at stations from where you can then take smaller, feeder buses that take you to village centres,” he said.
 But he will not roll out any measures just yet.
 He said he first needs to consult with local councils, NGOs, the opposition and all other stakeholders to make sure the measures do not impact residents, businesses, workers and employers negatively.
 This consultation process will take another four to six months before he is ready to announce the first short-term measure around April.
 “We must get this right,” he insisted when asked why he was going to let people deal with the current situation for that much longer.
 “When I was appointed minister I couldn’t just sit in my chair and start taking decisions right away. I needed to listen to people and their suggestions. I also want the opposition in this discussion.”
  One measure suggested by the Malta Maritime Forum might be quite costly, Bonett admitted, but he believes its positive social impact could be worth the hefty price.
 The measure would see cargo ships transport freight to Gozo directly from the Freeport. This would mean all goods bound for Gozo making it to the sister island without trucks having to transport them all the way from Birżebbuġa to Ċirkewwa.
 “On paper, that will be expensive. Ships are always expensive. But the positive social impact it could have might make it worth it,” he said.
 “As with all the other measures, we have to dive deep into it and see what works best.”
 During the interview, Bonett revealed the government was considering building car parks on the outskirts of the busiest localities, like Mosta, Birkir­kara, Paola, Sliema and Qormi – and provide a park-and-ride service to non-residents.
 It worked in Valletta, and there is no reason why it should not work elsewhere, he said. It would also ensure residents have more parking spaces in that locality.
 “Ultimately, I can roll out many measures to reduce cars, but if I don’t offer alternative transport, the cars will remain,” he said.
 “And there’s another thing – even if I do offer the alternatives, how do I know people will not still use their car?”
 He could not promise people will see or feel the difference of any measure on day one, and no single measure can solve all the problems.
 “We can’t implement measures in isolation. That’s the mistake we did in the past,” he admitted.
 “Hoping we will ever get to a point when we never get stuck in traffic is a fantasy. We are obsessed with cars, me included, and like everybody else, I must be part of the solution.”
  His predecessors were also keen on implementing solutions.
 In an interview with Times of Malta early last year, then-transport minister Aaron Farrugia acknowledged the bus service was inefficient, and said one solution could be to dedicate entire lanes on major arteries just for buses, drastically improving their efficiency.
 That idea was never implemented, and his successor is not keen on making it happen either.
 “I’m from Gżira, and when a bus lane was introduced for the first time there, it was chaotic,” he said.
 “I don’t agree with it in principle, because as it stands, closing existing lanes will create bottlenecks and make the situation worse.”
 Another measure that is off the table for Bonett is a traffic management strategy where vehicles with a specific number plate are prohibited from driving on certain days and times.
 In cities that implemented it, the restriction typically alternates between even and odd-numbered plates, allowing drivers to use their cars on alternate days.
 “I don’t agree with that. I think it’s unproductive,” Bonett said, shooting it down.
 With days to go before schools start again, Bonett said he is “losing some sleep” during this period, knowing the next few weeks will inevitably be challenging.
 He said Transport Malta will increase enforcement officers on the roads to direct traffic, and Infrastructure Malta will be pausing non-urgent, non-essential road works for a few weeks.
 There are other measures, however, that can be implemented relatively quickly, Bonett said.
 People often legitimately complain that the government should be better organised in roadworks, he said, and promised he would optimise his resources to achieve that.
 One of those measures is to carry out roadworks at night, which has already been implemented wherever possible.
 “We have a growing economy that we only operate for 12 hours. It’s time we explore how we spread delivery services and government works throughout the day,” he said.
 But he is not the first Labour minister to promise this. Aaron Farrugia had suggested a major overhaul of multiple services and activities that have traditionally occurred in the morning, causing traffic jams during rush hour.
 Government workers would report for duty at different hours of the morning, and hospital outpatient appointments would be scheduled throughout the day, he had pledged.
 The strategy remains largely unimplemented.
 “I knew you’d ask me that. You cannot just wake up one morning and change the way businesses work,” he said, adding he still believed it could be achieved.
 Landscaping or road cleaning does not necessarily have to happen in the early morning rush hour, he said, and not all services must go nocturnal, either.
 Praising the work of his predecessors, he said that were it were not for Ian Borg’s initiative to widen arterial roads and build flyovers, especially the Marsa junction, people would be stuck in far worse traffic today.
  However, it is now time to build roads differently, he insisted. Infrastructure Malta cannot just be the roads agency. Rather, it must become part of the government’s wider plan to make villages and public spaces greener and cleaner.
 He said he appointed former Project Green CEO Steve Ellul to head the mammoth agency because he has already worked on this vision.
 The first major measure on Ellul’s watch was rolled out last week – a €10 million fund to make streets people-friendly.
 This means that Joseph Muscat’s 2017 promise to rebuild all of Malta’s residential streets must be rethought, as people clearly want the government to tackle infrastructure differently.
 “Take the Msida creek project, which will start in November. It is often banalised as simply a flyover, but that’s only a part of it,” he said.
 “The bigger part of the project is the embellishment of the whole area – the new church square, cycle lanes, the water canal that will mitigate the long-standing flooding problem and the boċċi club, among others.”
  Bonett’s ministry has previously been plagued by corruption allegations, especially at Transport Malta.
 Asked whether he can guarantee no corruption on his watch, he said: “Two people in the garden of Eden also made a mistake, and they were just two people. I can’t guarantee that nobody in such a big organisation is doing absolutely anything wrong. Everybody begins with 100 per cent trust with me. If they start to misbehave, they start losing my trust.
 “But I learned that when there are a lot of people working in a place, wrongdoing can happen. There are 900 people working at Transport Malta and I’m disappointed to see a few of them taint the reputation of all the others who do good work and want to serve and love their country.”

Inquiries have become the only way to seek truth - Grech,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/inquiries-way-seek-truth-grech.1097208,25-08-2024,004628.png,"Opposition leader Bernard Grech has criticised police commissioner Angelo Gafà for his failure to take appropriate action to investigate the identity cards and Vitals scandals, as well as for ""lying"" about the case of femicide victim Nicolette Ghirxi.
 An inquiry into the hospitals' concession to Vitals, demanded by Repubblika and led by the judiciary but not the police, led to the arraignment of several politicians and public officials. 
 And a court found that former MP and lawyer Jason Azzopardi's claims on the fraudulent issue of 18,000 identity cards for third-country nationals merits an investigation.
 Speaking on Net TV on Sunday, Grech said the Ghirxi family's demand for an independent inquiry, to determine how and where the state had failed her, was fully supported by the Nationalist Party.
 “This is the only way in this country for anyone seeking the truth,” he remarked, referencing the public inquiry that followed the tragic death of construction victim Jean Paul Sofia.
 Ghirxi was fatally stabbed in her Swatar apartment by her former boyfriend, Edward Johnston, earlier this month.
 On Sunday, Times of Malta published evidence suggesting that while Ghirxi had agreed to undergo a risk assessment, she had informed a friend and her lawyer that she had been “talked out of it” by professionals from FSWS/Aġenzija Appoġġ during her evaluation. 
 This contradicts earlier statements by police commissioner Gafà, who told journalists that Ghirxi had been offered a risk assessment but declined in writing, claiming she did not feel at risk.
 “Now we clearly know that the commissioner lied about a person who was killed. He told us that she refused the risk assessment. Now we know that this is not true,” Grech stated.
 He also criticised Home Affairs Minister Byron Camilleri for failing to take action against the police commissioner. 
 “When a police commissioner lies, others would be ready to lie as well,” he said.
 Grech stressed that the PN would continue to insist that no one should be above the law.
 He thanked former PN MP Jason Azzopardi for his tireless efforts in exposing the identity cards racket and ensuring that an inquiry is held.
 He noted how PN MP Darren Carabott had proposed several measures to restore trust in the ID card system, including allowing citizens to verify who is registered at their property.
 Grech accused the Labour government of creating a fraudulent scheme that invaded people’s privacy and invited anyone receiving correspondence addressed to third parties to come forward and contact the PN so that all evidence could be passed on to the inquiring magistrate.
 The PN leader reiterated his calls for Camilleri’s resignation in connection with the identity card racket. “This government has lost all sense of responsibility and accountability. Camilleri must resign because he has failed.”
 Regarding the Vitals inquiry, the PN leader accused Prime Minister Robert Abela of interfering with the truth and manipulating the course of justice.
 Citing an article published by MaltaToday, Grech accused Abela of undermining the legal process and using inquiries and their conclusions for his political survival and interests.
 MaltaToday reported on Sunday that Abela had directed senior police officers not to interrogate individuals mentioned in the Vitals inquiry, and instead have them all charged in court, in a bid to ensure former prime minister Joseph Muscat is not seen as the sole figure behind the fraudulent deal.
 “This administration has reached its lowest ebb,” he argued.
 Commenting on Norma Saliba’s intention to run for the office of president of the Partit Laburista, Grech suggested that Abela was playing a game of musical chairs.
 “The prime minister pretends to make changes in an attempt to maintain control. But what he is doing will have a very negative impact on the country,” he said
 While Grech stated that he sees nothing wrong with a former PBS editor and head of news running for office within the Partit Laburista, he pointed out that Saliba had been found guilty three times of violating the PN’s rights during her tenure as head of news.
 This, he argued, shows that Robert Abela is happy to reward those who align with his agenda while serving in public roles.

 In a statement following a parliamentary committee meeting on Tuesday, Solidarjetà, Moviment Graffitti and Malta Tenant Support said the amended bill will introduce much-needed standards within the sector aimed at curbing overcrowding.
 Among others, landlords will now be limited to renting their property to a maximum of two tenants per bedroom, they explained.
 In February, tenant unions and a group of 17 NGOs had challenged the original proposal saying it would reward abusive landlords while punishing tenants. 
 Then in March, Yanika Saliba Vidal - a lawyer at the housing ministry - said proposals forcing tenants to stay in their properties for the duration of their contract or face a penalty will be scrapped.
 On Thursday, the three organisations welcomed the removal of the ""draconian clause that would have removed every flexibility to tenants in finding alternative accommodation"" during the last six months of a one-year contract.
 They thanked the Minister for Social Accommodation and Opposition members on the parliamentary committee, ""for listening to our concerns and finding a way forward that does not penalise the most vulnerable in society"".

 ""None of the recommendations of the European Commission in the preceding year’s report has been implemented in the current year. In fact the current year’s recommendations are nothing more than a reiteration of pending recommendations. This is evidence of the government’s lack of impetus to address corruption and strengthen the rule of law"" the NGOs Repubblika, aditus, SOS Malta, and The Daphne Caruana Galizia Foundation said.
 Although the European Commission had noted “some progress”, this supposed progress was nothing more than further empty promises made by the government. 
 The NGOs said they were reiterating their insistence on reforms to strengthen the independence of the judiciary and the government should stop making excuses to justify its failure to act.
 As to measures to strengthen the independence of specialised tribunals, the government was continuing to keep its intentions secret and no progress had been seen in this regard.
 The NGOs noted that the Commission stated that the government was making an effort to improve the efficiency of the judicial system however it also stated that it had seen no improvement in results.
 ""Court cases are still taking too long. We reiterate that the exaggerated delays stemming from major problems in the administration of justice and the lack of human resources, are the responsibility of the government and are in of themselves an injustice and a violation of everyone's right to a fair hearing in a reasonable time, particularly for victims of crime. The government has not yet brought about any improvement and the judicial system remains (as the Association of Judges and Magistrates has said) ""on the brink of collapse"".
 The Commission had also noted progress in the investigation of corruption and specifically referred to the hospitals’ inquiry.
 But, the NGOs said, this was not an achievement of the government. The hospitals’ inquiry came about as a result of the efforts of civil society despite the obstruction by government officials who have now been indicted. Prime Minister Robert Abela attempted to discredit the inquiry and belittle the prosecution in this case.
 The NGOs said the 'devastating observation' of the Commission that the Maltese state had not successfully convicted anyone despite rampant corruption within the government was completely accurate and remained the most compelling evidence of the weakness of the rule of law.
 Turning to legislative changes to protect journalists, the NGOs said the government had effectively ignored the recommendations of the public inquiry into the murder of Daphne Caruana Galizia. ""The government has not published the promised White Paper about legal reforms in this sector. Journalists working in Malta still face the same risks which led to a journalist being killed.""
 The NGOs also noted that as the commission had pointed out,  nothing had been done to strengthen the independence of public broadcasting, to institute transparency in the way the government spends money in the media, and that government advertising is spent fairly among different media.
 Recommendations to strengthen anti-corruption measures made by the Daphne Caruana Galizia public inquiry had also not been implemented yet. ""This is crucial, since a culture of impunity is one of the factors that enabled Daphne’s murder. 
 ""As the Commission notes, although Malta is supposed to have a National Strategy Against Fraud and Corruption, this has not been implemented yet. Changes to the Permanent Commission Against Corruption have not improved the situation: that is to say, no work of the Permanent Commission has ever led to anyone’s prosecution and conviction.""
 The Commission had also reiterated its concern about the large number of persons appointed directly as persons of trust in government, about the fact that Malta did not have a law that really protects whistleblowers, that there are great risks of corruption in the systems of public procurement, and that there are risks of corruption in the sale of passports.
 The Commission had also reiterated a long-standing recommendation for the setting up of a National Institution for Human Rights.
 ""A government that, year after year, ignores a recommendation like this is hostile to human rights,"" the NGOs said.
 They insisted that the repeated recommendations of the European Commission together with the still pending recommendations of the Daphne inquiry, the Venice Commission and other institutions need to be implemented after effective consultation and with the participation of civil society.  
 The Media Freedom Rapid Response (MFRR) coalition in a separate statement on Tuesday welcomed the publication of the (EU-wide) 2024 European Commission’s rule of law report.
 ""Despite progress made in some areas, the report shows that press freedom remains under threat in Europe,"" it said.
 Referring to sections of the report about Malta, the MFRR observed that Malta, Greece, Italy, and Slovakia had made insufficient progress towards guaranteeing the safety of journalists, both physical and against abusive lawsuits.  
 It also noted that Malta had not comprehensively improved the situation for journalists since Daphne Caruana Galizia’s assassination. Only two recommendations from the public inquiry report had been implemented, with the white paper still not being published, and the government’s proposed media legislation currently frozen in the Maltese parliament.

 A total of 721 votes were cast in the election for a turnout percentage of 95.24%, the Labour Party said in an official statement.
  Both Saliba and Sciberras campaigned on similar platforms, vowing to incorporate party delegates’ feedback into decision-making and advocating for the party’s grassroots to play a bigger part in policymaking.
 The two described each other as friends and played down talk of them serving as proxies for Robert Abela and his predecessor Joseph Muscat.
 When Saliba announced her candidacy last month, she said she did so at the encouragement of Abela and that Ian Borg and Alex Agius Saliba both backed her.
  Borg and Agius Saliba were elected as Labour’s two deputy leaders on Saturday, having run for those posts uncontested.
 John Grech was elected international secretary, beating Georvin Bugeja to that post. 
 Louis Gatt was confirmed as party vice-president and William Lewis will remain as party secretary, with both men having been uncontested for those posts.

New domestic violence centre to open in central Malta next year: PM,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/new-domestic-violence-centre-open-central-malta-next-year-pm.1096881,18-08-2024,004732.png,"Robert Abela on Sunday said the government will open a new domestic violence centre next year.
 The new facility, which will be located in a central location, will be Malta’s second centre that provides immediate protection and support to victims of domestic abuse and their children, the prime minister said during a ONE Radio interview.
 Malta’s first such hub began operating 24/7 in Santa Luċia in February.
 The prime minister will also start providing electronic tags and panic alarms for victims of domestic violence in the coming months.
 Abela was speaking at the end of a week that began with the murder of Nicolette Ghirxi. 
 Ghirxi, 48, was knifed to death by Edward Johnston, her former partner, at her apartment in Swatar late on Sunday. Johnston was later shot and killed by police in a standoff.
 Ghirxi's lawyer has criticised the police for inaction, saying Ghirxi could still be alive if the police had done their job instead of allowing her murderer to toy with them. Police have meanwhile said Ghirxi did not want them to take legal action against Johnston.
 On Sunday, Abela listed the government’s work to combat domestic violence and protect victims.
 Asked about Ghirxi's femicide, Abela said the government had increased its efforts to combat the scourge through legal, judicial and police reforms. 
 On the legislative front, Abela said the government introduced the concept of “femicide” into law, widened the definition of domestic violence, and introduced a new law that allowed people to check if their partner had a history of domestic abuse via the Victim Support Agency. 
 Abela also referred to a judicial reform whereby two members of the judiciary are dedicated to hearing cases of domestic violence. 
 “As a result, we tripled court hearings on domestic violence,” he said, adding: “The efficiency of hearings is crucial as delays can have horrific consequences”.

"'Clayton Bartolo only interested in himself’, Bernard Grech tells parliament",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/clayton-bartolo-interested-himself-bernard-grech-tells-parliament.1101206,18-11-2024,004750.png,"Clayton Bartolo is not interested in the needs of the public or the thousands of workers hired in the tourism sector but is only interested in himself, Bernard Grech told parliament on Monday.
 Grech was addressing a debate on the tourism budget estimates, a discussion that was overshadowed by the scandal involving the Gozo and tourism ministers.
 A recent standards commissioner's report found that Clayton Bartolo and Clint Camilleri abused their power and breached ministerial ethics when Bartolo's now-wife was employed in a job she was not qualified for and did not do.
 “If this was a normal country, Bartolo would not be standing in front of us as tourism minister,” he said.
 “Instead, the prime minister, who has morality, would have removed him.”
 Grech said the two ministers remained in his position because Abela had no courage or power to remove them.
 “We have a minister who, for him, qualifications mean nothing,” Grech said, referring to comments Bartolo gave Times of Malta last week as he defended his wife’s lucrative consultancy role.
 “It’s true, there are people out there who work hard without any qualifications, who wake up early every day, get stuck in traffic and try to make a living,” he added.
 “But the minister is saying we should pay no attention to the fact his wife did not go to work and had no qualifications or experience to do the work she was paid to do.”
 Grech claimed the government was dealing with internal disgruntlement and only cared about itself and its ""cliques"".
 The Opposition leader called for the Labour MPs to take a stand about what is right. He said those who supported Camilleri and Bartolo were also accomplices in the scandal.
 “You should say that what Bartolo, Camilleri and the prime minister did was wrong,” Grech urged PL MPs.
 “Otherwise you are showing how out of touch you are with ordinary people.”

Grech warns PM to ‘stop dangerous attitude’ after ‘trap’ claims,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/grech-warns-pm-stop-dangerous-attitude-trap-claims.1092811,21-05-2024,004757.png,"Bernard Grech has slammed Robert Abela for claiming the PN is planning a “trap” for Labour supporters who plan to rally in support of Joseph Muscat ahead of his appearance in court next week. 
 Such “dangerous” comments only serve to rile people up, Grech said, urging the prime minister to go to the police if his information is to be believed. 
 In comments to Times of Malta on Tuesday, Abela said that on May 28, ahead of Muscat’s court date, the Nationalist Party  was planning a “trap” for those in attendance and urged people to “keep calm and not be provoked”. 
 He did not provide any further specific information when asked to do so. 
 In an immediate response published on Facebook, Grech slammed Abela’s comments as “dangerous” and said they would only serve to inflame tensions between people. 
 “It is evident these are comments of a desperate person who has not only lost control of the Labour Party and the government but is a prime minister who instead of doing everything he can to make sure our institutions work with serenity, is not only attacking them, but is making up stories about the PN,” Grech said. 
  “Robert Abela, you must stop this dangerous attitude immediately. Your speech is intended to rile people up, to do damage and create trouble. So that’s why I am warning you to put a stop to this behaviour.”
 Casting doubt on the veracity of the claims, Grech added that nonetheless, if Abela has any information, he should go to the police commissioner and ask him to investigate. 
 “If it is true, because I am convinced you are making all of this up, since you have lost all decency, then take this information to the police commissioner and ask him to investigate,” Grech continued. 
 “Or have you now lost all confidence in the police commissioner as well?” he questioned. 
 Abela’s comments in recent weeks concerning the conclusion of the Vital’s inquiry and Magistrate Gabriella Vella have been widely criticised by NGOs and civil society and have been interpreted by such groups, including  law students, as an attack on the judiciary. 
 The prime minister has cast suspicions about the length and timing of the inquiry’s conclusion and has claimed that this was intentionally done to hurt the Labour Party at the upcoming MEP and Local Council Elections, calling it  ""political terrorism"". 
 Muscat faces charges of money laundering, corruption and bribery, among other very serious crimes related to the hospitals’ deal that saw three state hospitals handed over to the private sector. 
 Last year a court nullified that deal after finding it was ‘fraudulent’. 
 Grech appealed for people to remain cautious and responsible and to not fall for the PM’s provocations.

Maltese Labour MEPs call for action against Israel,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/maltese-labour-meps-call-action-israel.1098645,27-09-2024,004510.png,"Malta's Labour MEPs are among 48 others who called upon the EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs to put the suspension of the EU-Israel Association Agreement on the council’s agenda amid the troubling conflict in the Middle East.  
 The MEPs have also called for the implementation of an arms embargo until a lasting peace agreement is reached.
 ""These initiatives are essential to restore Europe’s international credibility and crucial for enabling serious, multilateral efforts toward a diplomatic solution,” they said.
 Among the signatories to the demands, sent to Josep Borrell, are Labour MEPs Alex Agius Saliba, Daniel Attard and Thomas Bajada.
  The MEPs argue that the Israeli government’s actions show it is not interested in a peace agreement or the release of the hostages but “to broaden the conflict in the Middle East, continue the genocide in Gaza, and provoke Iran's involvement, with serious consequences for global stability.”
 Furthermore, they accuse Israel of displaying “complete disregard for human life” and claim that this stance is evident to the entire world, as reflected in recent United Nations General Assembly votes.
 In a direct critique of European Union institutions, the letter expresses disappointment at the “complicit silence” of many EU members in response to Israel's actions, which is described as a “stark contrast” to the union’s handling of other international conflicts.
 According to the letter, this silence, coupled with “the continued supply of weapons to Israel”, undermines the EU’s credibility as a defender of “international law, peace, and human rights.”
 “We cannot undo the damage caused by European arms used to slaughter children in Palestine and Lebanon, but we can and must do everything in our power to stop this shameful and endless cycle of violence. Our people demand it, and so do we.”
 The letter was signed by 25 MEPs from The Left, 10 S&D MEPs, nine Green/EFA MEPs, three Renew MEPs, and one unattached.

Employers call for urgent MCESD meeting over PM Vitals inquiry comments,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/employers-call-urgent-mcesd-meeting-pm-vitals-inquiry-comments.1092136,21-06-2024,004543.png,"Three main employers' bodies have joined their voices to the widespread rebuke of the Prime Minister's repeated criticism of the Vitals inquiry.
 Abela has heaped scorn on a magisterial inquiry concerning the Vitals hospitals deal that triggered  criminal charges against top political figures, initially claiming the magistrate was purposely delaying the conclusions.
 Once concluded, Abela said that while he did not have a copy of the document, the inquiry was biased and that sections of the judiciary were part of an ""establishment"" that was out to destroy the Labour Party. 
 President Myriam Spiteri Debono,  law students, NGOs, a  former chief justice and politicians have all expressed concern over his comments.
 On Wednesday afternoon, the Malta Employers’ Association, Chamber of Commerce and Chamber of SMEs warned that Abela's comments posed ""a serious risk to economic stability and Malta’s international reputation"".
 Consequently, they called for an urgent meeting of the Malta Council for Economic and Social Development over the matter.
 In a statement, they said the attack on the judiciary struck at the heart of Malta’s democratic credentials and challenged basic principles of governance.
 
 ""Malta, having already suffered grey-listing, cannot afford further reputational damage,"" they said in a joint statement. 
 ""Branding individuals, organisations, and institutions as ‘the establishment’ or enemies of the state does not contribute to the cause of justice.""
 The employers' representatives warned that the ""perilous nature"" of the situation was underscored by the ""potential for destructive alienation and tension within society, posing significant threats to social and economic well-being, and weakening the rule of law"".
 They warned about an urgent need to promote public trust in the justice system and apply all legal remedies to ensure the innocent are acquitted and the guilty are held accountable.
 The employer bodies stressed the importance of transparency and accountability in upholding the integrity of institutions and the rule of law.
 ""It is imperative that the findings of the inquiry are not subject to speculative conjectures that undermine trust in judicial institutions.
 ""Any warranted criminal proceedings should happen without any political interference or threats to the judiciary. The judicial process must be allowed to take its course,"" they said.
 ""Any attempts to undermine the integrity of the inquiry only serve to erode public trust in the institutions and compromise the government’s future standing.'
 They called for prompt and responsible action to safeguard democracy and stability in Malta and also an urgent MCESD meeting to ensure the national interest is not ""undermined by partisan agendas"".

 Dozens of government announcements, measures and inaugurations, as well as cheques being mailed to people's homes have characterised the run-up to the June 8 elections. 
 Many suspect that the timing of these measures is a government attempt to use its power of incumbency to its full potential.
 But when asked if the Labour Party was exploiting its position as the governing party, Prime Minister Abela said: ""I don't agree at all. The way we have worked in the last week is the same way we have consistently worked in the last years"".
 Since Labour's re-election two years ago, the government has consistently introduced new measures and increased existing ones, such as pensions and the children's allowance, Abela said. 
  During the COVID-19 pandemic and the start of the war in Ukraine, the government implemented many measures such as restaurant vouchers and making energy bills cheaper and stable, he said. 
 So why are so many measures being announced weeks before the election?
 ""We have 1,000 proposals to implement from our manifesto and only five years to implement them; you have to move quickly"".

Watch: ‘I’m sitting before you because I have nothing to hide’,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/watch-i-m-sitting-i-nothing-hide.1097754,09-08-2024,004609.png,"Amid a barrage of allegations of identity theft and corruption, Home Affairs Minister BYRON CAMILLERI tells  Mark Laurence Zammit he is doing everything possible to curb abuse and plug holes in the many systems he is responsible for.
 MLZ:  People are claiming to have gone to state entities and told their ID card number wasn’t theirs. Others received mail at home addressed to people who never lived there. Or received calls from hospital mistakenly informing them serious surgeries were coming up. Then we learned people were registered as living in an empty hotel in Xlendi, and other cases of as many as 20 people registered as living in one flat. Jason Azzopardi is saying thousands of people obtained ID cards on the back of fake marriage certificates... What’s going on?
 BC: Let’s take them one by one.  Identità set up a compliance unit and increased checks in recent years. It went to the police whenever it suspected anyone was breaking the law and suspects were charged in court before any comment and story even made it to the media. In one case a man falsely claimed he was the partner of someone who had a residence permit. In other cases, people were found to have had fake housing contracts – and again, the state entities reported it to the police. And they didn’t stop there. 
 Identità strengthened operations and implemented measures, like notarising housing contracts, to prevent future abuse of loopholes. So, it’s incorrect to say Identità permitted abuse. It was Identità that went to the police in the first place.
  MLZ:  So, you’re saying it’s not Identità or government officials who did wrong, but lone people who abused the system? Then how do you explain all these people coming out now? Can they all be wrong? I spoke to a man who told me two years ago police knocked on his hotel room door in the middle of the night while he was on holiday in Italy to tell him his ID card was supposedly stolen.
 BC: There were several reports against people who allegedly did wrongdoing and months ago, when the cases surfaced,  Identità suspended an official suspected to have committed wrongdoing and reported them to the police.
 MLZ:  Who’s the person? What wrongdoing?
 BC: I can’t elaborate but it’s related to one of the alleged abuses we’re talking about. Unfortunately, we live in a world where some people choose to do wrong, but action was taken immediately. You also mentioned hospital and letters from Epic. Let’s not mix things up. The hospital system is independent from Identità’s system, and the health ministry has addressed those errors.
 Same with Epic – they told staff to double-check. It’s easy to blame Identità for everything. You also mentioned the Italy case. I don’t know what investigations other countries do, but we have good relations with the Italian embassy in Malta and with the Italian minister and there were never concerns about any of this.
 MLZ:  I don’t understand how the hospital wasn’t already double-checking patients’ identities. It seems obvious to me that you should double-check. How do you explain claims of people who went to a government entity and were told their ID number is not theirs?
 BC: I don’t think that’s the allegation. The issue was with foreigners’ residence permits, and I’m telling you what measures were taken against people who submitted false applications. Our job is to address every instance where people are found to have broken the law and take measures to avoid it in the future.
 MLZ:  Jason Azzopardi also alleged there were cocaine and sex parties. Do you know of these? Have you ever been to one?
 BC: People who know me know I’m not keen about parties. The last party I’ve been to was my daughter’s first birthday party.
 MLZ:  Do you think parliament should investigate whether any MPs went to these alleged parties?
 BC: You’re a journalist, you can ask them yourself. I can speak for myself. I am not afraid of any scrutiny, allegation, because that’s my style.
 MLZ:  Jason Azzopardi also made serious allegations about a LESA racket. You denied knowledge or involvement in it. Why should we believe you and not Azzopardi?
 BC: Take the auditor general’s word for it. In 2021, one of his reports highlighted concerns and recommendations in this sector. In two reports in the following couple of years he clearly notes the recommendations were being largely implemented and the concerns addressed.
 MLZ:  And yet, serious allegations surfaced again.
 BC: Anyone can make allegations whenever they want.
 MLZ:  Are you saying the alleged ticket cancellations were happening when the auditor flagged concerns, but they stopped happening since then? Because in that same year (2021) I published a story with similar allegations – a high LESA official cancelling hundreds of fines. What did you do about that since then?
 BC: I saw that article but that was a different time. When I was appointed home affairs minister almost five years ago, police would hand out tickets with a pen and paper and word on the street was the system allowed for abuse. Everybody remembers that time. I decided to digitalise that system, which meant that as soon as the fine was handed, it was registered into the system, which means any potential abuse was curbed. You think anyone who wants to abuse would take decisions like the ones I took?
 MLZ:  Can you guarantee no fines are being cancelled right now?
 BC: I don’t permit that and if I learn anyone is doing it, I’ll go to the police myself. But LESA and its CEO already denied those allegations and said they are prepared for any scrutiny because I have nothing to hide.
 MLZ:  Do you trust the people you have running LESA will not do it either? Because that’s the whole point of being the minister. It’s not enough that you’re clean – you’re also responsible to make sure corruption doesn’t happen on your watch.
 BC: People who have something to hide don’t say they are open to scrutiny. And that’s what LESA did.
 MLZ:  Can you guarantee there are no other alleged rackets happening under your nose that we’re going to learn about soon?
 BC: Nobody can give that guarantee. There are thousands of employees working in what is one of the biggest ministries. I can promise you one thing – whenever there were alleged abuses the system stopped them and reported them. That’s what always happened and will continue to happen.
 MLZ:  I often notice that government institutions avoid telling people that they found abuse within their structures. Even when the entity itself reports abuse to the police, it’s done hush-hush, and people only get to know about the abuse if the media or people like Jason Azzopardi make an issue out of it. Don’t you think people have a right to know, that Identità should tell us when it goes to the police over suspected internal wrongdoing? And the same with LESA. It’s not enough to implement measures to plug loopholes – you must also be transparent with the public about what wrongdoing led to that action in the first place.
 BC: Let’s say, for the sake of the argument, the authorities suspect you were doing something wrong. Do you think justice is best served if the authorities go public with its suspicion about you? Or would it be better if they go to the police and allow for investigations that might lead to your prosecution in court? Justice is ultimately done in court, at which point the media is also free to report to the public.
 MLZ:  What about cases that don’t make it to court? Don’t you think we should know what happened? A case in point is the inquiries into the deaths of 13 inmates found dead in prison during Alex Dalli’s tenure. Don’t you think we should know how they died, even if there was no foul play?
 BC: When we had questions from journalists, we always answered them. Anyone who asked was given all the information.
 MLZ:  After all the allegations that surfaced in the past weeks, why didn’t you resign?
 BC: I am open to all scrutiny. The allegations are not about me personally and I was very clear in my response. That’s why I’m sitting here before you and answering your questions, and I am likewise open to all other scrutiny. I always stood firm in front of wrongdoing, that’s all I can tell you.
 MLZ:  But let’s be honest – had these same allegations surfaced under a PN government you would be calling for the minister’s resignation right now. That’s what Labour did all the time up to 2013. Why is it different this time?
 BC: And seldom did we see resignations at that time, even over worse things. I am open to all scrutiny, and I have nothing to hide.
 MLZ:  Foreign workers. Have we lost control?
 BC: Since the sector was transferred to my portfolio in March, we have been working on a revised labour migration policy. For now, I can tell you it will be based on four principles and it will be soon launched for consultation. It will be a policy in favour of workers, stability and retention, worker upskilling and reskilling and a skills-based approach to identify where more workers are needed and where there are enough. Some sectors – like healthcare – need more workers but other sectors – like cabs and food delivery service – have enough.
 MLZ:  But if enough people want to take cabs, why stop more drivers coming in? Isn’t it an issue of demand and supply? And if you’re stopping cab drivers because there are too many cabs, why aren’t you also stopping construction workers coming in? We also have too many flats, no? Why are you not employing the same principle? Will the cab and courier companies be made the sacrificial lamb?
 BC: We have a duty to run market testing...
 MLZ:  Can we see that survey? Can you give it to me or tell me what’s in it? Because nobody has seen it yet.
 BC: We run market tests to see whether each sector needs more or fewer workers.
 MLZ:  What about construction? Isn’t that also saturated? Even parliament is saturated...
 BC: I love parliament work and have strong opinions about it, and I do believe there are too many MPs, but I did agree with the gender quota mechanism. That’s a discussion for another day though.
 MLZ:  OK, so what about construction? Because you only speak about healthcare, which sounds nice, but what about construction?
 BC: We will soon be publishing our policies. For now, I’m sharing our principles with you.
 MLZ:  But what does the labour market survey say about construction? You know what it says about healthcare, cabs and couriers, so you must also know what it says about construction. Or is that the sacred cow that mustn’t be touched?
 BC: We think we should introduce mechanisms there – like the skills card in the tourism industry – for every worker.
 MLZ:  We haven’t had a migrant boat arrive at our shores in a long time. What deal have you struck with Libya? Or is Libya safe now and migrants don’t need to leave anymore?
 BC: It’s not like that. I’m not happy with people dying at sea and that’s why we take decisions to reduce crossings and curb human trafficking.
 MLZ:  But are you OK with people dying in Libya?
 BC: No, let me explain. Crossings have decreased drastically due to our collaboration with Libya against human trafficking. But the central Mediterranean route is also not as active as it was up till a few years ago and there have been fewer boat departures as well. Why should we encourage people to come to Malta illegally? Why don’t we encourage them to do it legally? We already offered that to many people who came to work and live here regularly.
 MLZ:  A community of Ethiopians who have been living and working in Malta for a long time are facing deportation. Why do you deport these people? Isn’t their situation exactly like that of other TCNs who come to work here? They all want a better life for themselves and their families. It’s just that TCNs afforded to buy a plane ticket and the others didn’t?
 BC: If you’re a refugee, fleeing war or other similar circumstances, we have a duty to help you. But if you’re not, the law says you must return to your country. I understand that people who have risked their lives to make the dangerous crossing are not keen on returning to their country, but there is a bigger picture we must look at. We can’t send messages that coming to Malta illegally will eventually grant you legal rights just the same, because it would be encouraging more people to go to the traffickers and make the dangerous crossing, and I’m not comfortable creating policies that lead to people dying at sea.
 MLZ:  Is Malta safer today than it was 10 years ago?
 BC: That’s what the statistics show. But crime is shifting from a physical environment to a digital one.
 MLZ:  But is the country safer overall?
 BC: Crime rates per thousand people have reduced, yes.
 MLZ:  Then why don’t people feel it? Is it just a perception? Or is it because social media creates more hype about incidents?
 BC: Social media plays a part, yes, and others try to scaremonger and present a false picture of the situation. But there are also fewer reports of certain crimes, like thefts, and increasing reports of other crimes.
 MLZ:  When Bernice Cassar was murdered there was an inquiry which found holes in the system. You subsequently implemented several measures to plug those holes. But then Nicolette Ghirxi was murdered, and we realised there were actually other holes we hadn’t seen. When are we going to plug all the holes?
 BC: Firstly, I must send my condolences to the families of both victims. I hope I’m not misinterpreted when I say this, but is there any society that has managed to get these cases down to zero? No matter how hard we work in this sector, it will never be enough to avoid every murder, but we must keep working to stop as many domestic violence cases as we possibly can.
 MLZ:  If it were not for Adrian Delia and Repubblika, the Vitals deal wouldn’t have been stopped. Don’t you think it was the police that should have investigated the case in the first place?
 BC: I am not privy to police investigations, but I saw the police commissioner address this, and he said they acted on the report of the magisterial inquiry and are now assisting the prosecution in court.
 MLZ:  But you do realise that if it were not for Delia and Repubblika, the deal wouldn’t have been stopped, right?
 BC: I’m no prophet...
 MLZ:  It’s evident, because the state institutions did nothing to stop it. The police should have investigated the deal from the first whiff of corruption.
 BC: As a minister I’m not part and will not be part of police investigations. I don’t know what the police were doing but I can see what the police did following the release of the magisterial inquiry.
 MLZ:  Similarly, don’t you think the police should be investigating who owns (secret Panama company) Egrant?
 BC: Wasn’t there already an investigation into that?
 MLZ:  No. There was an investigation that found it doesn’t belong to Joseph Muscat, but there was no investigation into who owns it. Don’t you think the police should find out who owns it?
 BC: I think everything should be investigated, always.
 MLZ:  Even Egrant’s owner?
 BC: Don’t put words in my mouth.
 MLZ:  I asked you specifically about Egrant and you said “everything”. Does that include Egrant?
 BC: Everything. We often only mention cases related to the Labour government.
 MLZ:  Whenever they want, police may arraign officials from former PN administrations as well. So far, only Giovanna Debono’s husband was taken to court and he was acquitted... twice. Now I’m asking you about Egrant. Do you think police should find out who owns Egrant?
 BC: An allegation into Egrant has already been investigated and it turned out it was not true. My approach is – wherever there’s doubt, it should be investigated.

 In a letter Muscat sent to the principal permanent secretary, Tony Sultana, Muscat enclosed a bank draft for €16,407.72. The letter was presented as a written submission during Wednesday’s parliamentary committee session. 
 “I reiterate my innocence because, as the commissioner noted, everything that happened was in line with regulations and policies in place at that time,” she wrote. 
 She said she was refunding the money out of respect for “the institutions and laws”.
  Earlier this month Standards Commissioner Joseph Azzopardi investigation found her husband, Clayton Bartolo and Gozo minister Clint Camilleri abused their power when they gave her lucrative consultancy jobs that she never did.
 According to the report, Muscat, at the time Bartolo’s girlfriend and private secretary, was first given a tourism ministry consultancy with a salary of almost €62,000 in 2020. She was then promoted again, as a consultant to the Gozo minister, where she earned €68,000 a year.
 However the Commissioner found that no evidence that she did any work as consultant in either ministry. 
 A parliamentary committee on Wednesday ordered that she repay the €16,407 difference between the work she carried out as a private secretary and the work she did not complete as a consultant.
 The refund was calculated by the Principal Permanent Secretary. 
 
 In the letter, Muscat stood her ground, explaining that she decided to return the money because she respects the country’s institutions and is “not an admission of guilt” and that she reserved the right to defend her interests as a private person. 
  The parliamentary committee session also received written submissions from Bartolo and Camilleri. The Committee said Bartolo must make a formal apology in parliament.
 On Tuesday, Bartolo was made to resign and was kicked out of Labour’s parliamentary group by  Prime Minister Robert Abela, after  Times of Malta sent questions relating to him and his wife being the subject of an  anti-money laundering investigation.
 Bartolo began his letter by thanking the work of the Standards Commissioner. His letter highlighted the recommendations noted in the report and emphasised that the commissioner had not recommended that the matter be referred to the police or mentioned the words “fraud” or “phantom job”.
 “These words have been used by political figures in recent weeks to try and add a different spin than to what was written in the report,” Bartolo added.
  He said he had “no problem” with offering a “sincere” apology and he would accept whatever sanction the committee deemed fit. 
  On his end, in his four-page letter, Camilleri said all the correct procedures were carried out to hire Muscat, and that her employment lasted eight months. 
 “Today, it has been three years since this person worked in the Gozo Ministry, so much so that this case happened in the previous legislature,” his letter read.
 He insisted he did nothing wrong and said he had “personal reservations” about some of the shortcomings identified by the commissioner but that he accepted the conclusions. 
 “Because anyone who has had a ministerial role knows it is difficult for a politician to certify each role and function every worker has. Even because there is certain overlapping between workers, where one adopts a bigger priority in the minister and government at that time,"" he wrote.
 He said at no point did he work for any personal gain, nor any form of fraud or misappropriation.
 ""At no point was it my intention to fall short of the ethical standards expected of me,"" he wrote. ""If I let the people down, I must now work with even more diligence.""

Rosianne Cutajar rejoins Labour parliamentary group,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/rosianne-cutajar-rejoins-labour-parliamentary-group.1096565,08-10-2024,004656.png,"Updated August 10 with Repubblika statement
 Rosianne Cutajar has rejoined the Labour Party's parliamentary group, more than a year after being forced to resign.
 During a Friday afternoon meeting, Labour MPs were informed by the parliamentary group's whip, Naomi Cachia, that Cutajar would be reinstated as a Labour MP.
 The decision followed a meeting between Prime Minister Robert Abela and Cutajar at Castille on Friday morning, sources said.
 In a Facebook post, Cutajar said she was unanimously approved by the PL's executive to return to the party's parliamentary group. 
 ""My first priority will be to bring back the people who showed they were distancing themselves from us and are hurt for some reason,"" she said.
  “From today, back within the Labour family that I never abandoned and continued to love with all my heart. I look forward to using all my energy together with my friends to design and implement a policy that addresses the realities, concerns and aspirations of the Maltese and Gozitans.”
 The return became official when the party executive officially gave Cutajar the green light on Friday evening.
 Cutajar resigned from the PL parliamentary group after succumbing to pressure following the publication of hundreds of messages between her and Yorgen Fenech.
 
 Complained about being left out of cabinet, she told Fenech: “Now I’ve stopped giving a damn... I’ll become a consultant with Pierre of ITS, and pocket another wage.” 
 Cutajar then added: “I don’t care, everybody pigs out.”   
 In 2020 Cutajar resigned her post from parliamentary secretary, pending the outcome of an investigation by the Commissioner for Standards in Public Life. The National Audit Office later found her ITS job was fraudulent and irregular. 
 The former Qormi mayor remains popular in her constituency.
 In January, Abela said Cutajar had paid a high enough political price and that it was time to ""reconsider"" her position, but later added that she would need to apologise before being allowed back into the party.
 She has never made a public apology and it remains unclear whether Cutajar apologised to the prime minister or the party before Friday's decision.
 Requests for comment sent to Cutajar have gone unanswered.
 In a statement on Friday evening, the PL confirmed Cutajar will once again form part of the Labour Parliamentary Group.
 In a statement, the PN accused the Prime Minister of making another ""U-turn"" by welcoming Cutajar back.
 The PN statement read: ""After stating that she needed to apologise to rejoin the Labour Party, Robert Abela, due to his weakness, gave in and allowed Rosianne Cutajar back into the party.""
 Her return was also criticised by rule-of-law NGO Repubblika, which described it as ""another obscene example of how those close to power can do as they please, while the rest of us must pay for our mistakes.""  
 Cutajar, the NGO said, had been allowed back into Labour without making the apology to citizens which Abela had initially demanded of her. 
 
 The decision comes amid a number of personnel changes at Labour, months after it lost its super majority in the European Parliament elections. 
 Leonard McKay was appoined the party's new CEO after Randolph De Battista quit the role for unspecified reasons.

 Grech was interviewed by Times of Malta journalist Mark Laurence Zammit on a wide variety of issues when the topic came up. 
 Although Grech strongly refuted the idea that people currently in politics do so for the ""wrong"" reasons, he acknowledged that salary limitations may be a barrier discouraging competent and passionate people from pursuing a political career. 
 ""How can the prime minister, who is like the CEO running the entire country, have a salary that is about a third of what the CEO of a private company would make?"" he questioned.
 He said he would not be against raising salaries for the prime minister, ministers or members of parliament, but stressed that this would have to be coupled with robust party financing law. 
 ""I don't have this problem in my party, but let's remove all shadows and doubts from this and create proper party financing laws,"" he said. 
 Asked about his criticism of bloat in the public sector as well as 'persons of trust' positions common in government, Grech vowed to make a ""clean sweep"" of corrupt officials in public roles. 
 Referencing recent scandals involving agencies such as Identità, Grech said that those responsible for corruption would be swiftly axed and that the ""mafia"" would be purged from such entities under his watch. 
 Those who are competent at their jobs and are diligently fulfilling their public service have nothing to worry about, he went on, but if entrusted to govern, the PN would ensure that all those appointed to important roles would be trustworthy and credible. 
 ""People don't have to have the same political colour, if they are competent they can work with us,"" Grech said, adding that the PN in government would not be ignoring all of those who had been sidelined by the Labour government just because they happened to be sympathetic to the PN.
 Grech spent considerable time discussing the PN's vision of transforming Malta's economic model, saying that it would work to carve out new, non-labour-intensive economic niches and invest heavily to incentivise the private sector to create more ""high-quality"" jobs. 
 The PN leader said he would ""guarantee"" that he would be able to achieve this as prime minister while also retaining Malta's current rate of positive economic growth. 
 Conversely, he said that the government has only grown the economy by ""importing"" thousands of foreign workers every year and the failure to adequately plan for such rapid population growth has had a negative impact on communities. 
 Touching upon people's frustration with the development lobby, Grech cooled talk of slowing down construction, saying that there is still more room to develop Malta. 
 But, he said, this would be achieved by putting a higher value on sustainable buildings and whipping the industry into shape in such a way that it understands it must work in harmony with its neighbours and preserve the quality of life. 
 Speaking about reducing traffic congestion, Grech said that the issue must be looked at holistically and while improving infrastructure is part of it, incentivising people to ditch their cars and decentralising services from traffic hot spots would be the way the PN envisions paving the way forward on the matter.

Parliament approves change to General Workers Union headquarters deed,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/pn-refusal-change-1957-deed-attempt-undermine-work-gwu.1102520,16-12-2024,004705.png,"Updated 7:23pm with results of the vote
 A parliamentary resolution to change the conditions of a long-term property deed for the General Workers' Union (GWU) headquarters in Valletta passed a vote in Parliament on Monday. 
 The amendment will allow the GWU to lease part of the Workers’ Memorial Building for commercial use under certain conditions. 
 Until Monday, the property could only be used for union activities. 
 The vote passed along party lines with 41 Labour MPs voting in favour and 33 Nationalist MPs voting against.
 As the vote passed, the stranger's gallery erupted in an enthusiastic round of applause, leading the Speaker of the House Anglu Farrugia to tell those in the gallery to leave the room.
 Monday's result is likely to be seen as a victory for the union, which had not been hopeful of a positive outcome after PN MPs voted against the motion last month.
 On November 20, Opposition MPs on the Parliamentary National Audit Office Accounts Committee voted against a government motion to amend the deed.
 This was followed by another vote against the change during a plenary discussion on December 4.
 The General Workers' Union had accused the PN of trying to undermine its work by resisting a change in the deed, claiming it was ""a classic case of punitive overreach"".
 GWU general secretary Josef Bugeja said earlier on Monday that any changes to the conditions of a deed concerning state-owned land required the House’s approval.
 ""All this has come at a very significant price established by three independent architects, for the GWU to be able to sub-let a legally specified area of its South Street headquarters - a sub-basement, a basement, and limited portions of its ground floor ground - to commercial entities,"" he said.
 Most of the premises, also legally delineated, will be for the exclusive use of members, 3,800 square meters of office space that is to be used by the GWU only for its trade union activities.
 He explained that in 1957, the state’s emphyteutical deed specified that the building could only be used for the GWU’s trade union activities. In 1997, the House approved a change in the deed’s conditions, allowing the GWU to transfer its ground-floor and basement shopfronts, on condition it would be a 51% shareholder in the entities occupying that space.
 In 2014, the GWU sublet two shopfronts to a restaurant and the Energy Corporation’s billing company ARMS, in the belief that the sublet was outside the purview of the deed’s conditions.
 In 2017, the PN took GWU to court over the sub-leasing, insisting the site was government-owned, and in terms of a contract with the government's Property Division, no sub-lease could be made other than to entities in which the union had a majority stake. 
 In May this year, the court declared that the GWU had breached its contractual obligations when it leased parts of its Valletta headquarters to ARMS Ltd and Sciacca Grill Ltd.
 However, the court turned down the opposition’s request to annul the original emphyteutical concession in favour of the union, declaring that the request went beyond the parameters of the relative law under which the transfer was effected.
 Bugeja explained that the GWU had then asked the government to amend the contract at an established price, and according to established practice.
 The GWU understands it owes the state for its past sublets.
 ""Since then, the government moved amendments to the 1957 deed, to allow the GWU to continue subletting the delineated areas of the Valletta building without the previous restriction.
 ""The GWU will pay €1.99 million to the state to be released of part of this condition, a figure arrived at by an independent architect’s valuation of the real estate’s value and past sublets.
 He insisted it was government policy to support businesses, social partners and voluntary organisations to remain financially viable to continue safeguarding the rights of those they represent.
 By allowing the GWU to sublet these unutilised basement portions to commercial entities, the State would be allowing the union to safeguard its operation and uphold its historic mission to protect workers’ rights.
 “While the Opposition will be voting against this motion, the GWU fails to understand why the PN would want to undermine Malta’s largest trade union and take on the legacy of its former leader, whose desire to evict the GWU from its Valletta headquarters is a classic case of punitive overreach,” said Bugeja.
 “Does the PN view this as a truly honourable cause? Does it see this political antagonism as a worthy quality of any party that aspires to be in power,"" Bugeja asked.
 Bugeja said the government’s motion was a transparent move that puts to shame the precedents set by previous PN administrations, whose ""arbitrary decisions"" on policies benefited private interests exclusively.
 “The NAO found grievous irregularities both in the 2009 transfer of the Qormi brewery land from Marsovin to Vassallo Builders - carried out without oversight from the House - and the 2013 Fekruna Bay land-swap, under-valued by €1.1 million,” Bugeja said.
 “Nowhere did the GWU embark on any witch-hunt of former lands ministers.”
 He added that just as it had submitted itself to the court’s decision on the 1957 emphyteutical deed, the union would respect the supreme decision of the House on this motion.
 ""Democracy should no longer be a parlour game for historic grudges, or to give vent to one’s prejudice towards workers’ unions,” Bugeja added.
 “The GWU can only look to the future to strengthen its mission to further workers’ rights: for its adversaries, this is yet another steep incline on the political learning curve.”

"Politicians are using policy loopholes to visit schools, Ombudsman finds",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/politicians-using-policy-loopholes-visit-schools-ombudsman-finds.1091938,21-06-2024,"004711.png,004712.png","Loopholes in the Education Ministry’s policies are allowing politicians to visit schools and political parties to use schools for their events, the Ombudsman has found. 
 The investigation was sparked by a complaint made by independent candidate Arnold Cassola, who pointed out that PL MEP candidate Thomas Bajada had visited a primary school in Gozo. 
 Cassola also pointed out that schools in Qawra and Kirkop had been used as venues by the Labour Party to host political activities. 
 Commissioner for Education Vincent De Gaetano found that while Bajada had visited the school without express permission from the ministry, there was no deliberate attempt to give him some sort of political advantage. 
 The school had for many years attempted to obtain funds to convert some of the unused areas on the grounds for education purposes.
 A school staff member happened to know Bajada, who has worked within EU institutions in Brussels, and he was invited to advise the school on the possibility of tapping EU funds. 
 “The head of school was not aware that he was a prospective candidate for any election - local or otherwise,” the report found. 
 While Bajada did not at any point speak to children while being shown around the school, a staff member took pictures which wound up being posted on Facebook. 
 When the Commissioner asked the Education Ministry for its policies related to such matters, they replied that since 2022 the ministry has employed a policy forbidding politicians and prospective candidates from being present at a school during school hours, unless their presence is directly related to an educational purpose. 
 Even so, all requests must be approved by the ministry and, in this case, no request had been made for Bajada to visit the school. 
  From the evidence provided, however, De Gaetano said that a circular informing educators about this policy, this was only circulated after the incident in question came to light. 
 It was unclear whether heads of school or assistant heads had previously been informed about the 2022 policy. 
 On the issue of school premises being used for political activities, the commissioner found that another circular permits schools to lease out their premises against a fee, as long as it is ensured that these activities “befit an educational establishment”. 
 “How party-political activities, such as those advertised in the press and on Facebook, which took place at the Kirkop Secondary School and the Qawra Primary School can be said to 'befit a primary or secondary educational establishment' is beyond the pale of comprehension,” De Gaetano said.
 He concluded that the Ministry should “urgently address” these shortcomings.
 In a statement, Cassola said he hoped that these loopholes would now be fixed. 
 “It is sad to see that certain MEP candidates were allowed to abuse loopholes because of the unclear ministerial directive,” he said.
 “I ask myself why it always has to be me, an independent politician, to denounce these abuses by government and PL politicians. Has the PN opposition become so numb and politically impotent that it has given up on checking on government minor abuses?”

Malta tops EU in issuing new residence permits,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/malta-tops-eu-issuing-first-residence-permits.1098089,14-09-2024,004722.png,"Malta issued significantly more new residence permits last year per capita than any other country in the EU, an analysis of European data shows.
 Last year, Malta approved almost 42,000 first residence permits, according to Eurostat figures released this week.
 While some countries granted many more – Germany for example, issued more than 586,000 residence permits – Malta stands out for how many it issued when compared to the size of its population.
 A Times of Malta analysis comparing the total number of new residence permits issued by each country to their population shows that per 100,000 people, Malta issued far more permits than anywhere else in the EU
 Malta issued more than 7,400 permits per 100,000 people, the analysis shows.
 This was double the number granted by Cyprus (just over 3,700) – the second-highest country – and more than 11 times more than the 660 permits per 100,000 issued by Malta’s closest European neighbour Italy.
 Eurostat data shows employment was the main driver of new residence permits, accounting for two-thirds (almost 28,000) of first permits issued in Malta – a trend mirrored across the continent.
 “Employment remained the main reason for issuing residence permits in 2023, accounting for 33.8% (1.3 million) of all first residence permits issued,” Eurostat said.
 Meanwhile, education accounted for almost 7,300 permits issued in Malta while family reasons accounted for almost 3,200.
 In its recent release, the bloc’s statistics arm said more than 3.7 million first residence permits were issued in the EU to non-EU citizens last year, a 4.6% increase over the year before and the highest number to date. 
 
 The figures come at a time of continued debate about the country’s reliance on foreign workers and its burgeoning population which last year reached over 563,000 people, according to the National Statistics Office (NSO).
 In June, Prime Minister Robert Abela acknowledged that Malta’s “unprecedented” economic growth had introduced new challenges, putting pressure on Malta’s infrastructure and demographics.
 However, he hit back at claims the economy relied on constant population growth, calling the assertion “mistaken”.
 “In reality, it’s the economy that has brought people over, not the other way around,” Abela said, while stressing the need to “analyse how these workers are meeting our needs as a nation”.
 The following month, scores of third-country nationals (TCNS) – workers from outside the EU – saw their permits refused as the Home Affairs Ministry cracked down on worker numbers in sectors seen as having “reached saturation”.
 The link between Malta’s economic success and the number of foreign workers was highlighted last year by Finance Minister Clyde Caruana, who warned the population would have to balloon to 800,000 by 2040 to sustain an average economic growth of 4.2%.
 Figures on other ends of the political spectrum have also addressed population growth: last year, Opposition Leader Bernard Grech said, “we cannot continue to increase the number of foreign workers we have on our island”.
 The data shows that some of Europe’s smallest countries – Malta, Cyprus and Liechtenstein – proportionally gave out the highest number of permits.
 Meanwhile, some of the bloc’s largest economies, and largest countries, issued comparatively few permits compared to their population.
 France, the largest country in the EU in terms of landmass, featured near the bottom of the list, issuing just over 335,000 first residence permits while having a population of 68 million, equal to less than 500 permits per 100,000 people.
 And Spain, the second largest country and one with a population of more than 48 million issued over 1,100 permits per 100,000 people, the analysis shows.
 Meanwhile, Romania – a country more than 750 times larger than Malta and with a population of over 19 million – gave out the lowest number of permits at just less than 300 per 100,000 people.
 The analysis used figures provided exclusively by Eurostat, including population figures recorded at the start of this year and the number of first residence permits issued.

 Former PN MP Karl Gouder died on Tuesday, two days after announcing his intention to run for the post of party general secretary.
 His body was found in Valletta close to the former Customs House. The death is not being treated as suspicious. 
 PN leader Bernard Grech announced Gouder's death with a post on Facebook. He offered Gouder's family and friends his condolences and asked people to respect the family's privacy at this time. 
  Gouder, 45, announced his interest in the PN general secretary post last Sunday in comments to  Times of Malta, a week after incumbent Michael Piccinino said he would step down to become a PN election candidate.
 Gouder was chief operations officer of the PN’s media arm and was Piccinino’s right-hand man during most of his tenure.  He also played a pivotal role in organising the party's campaign for the 2024 MEP and local council elections. 
  He was previously mayor of St Julian’s and also served as a PN MP for six years across three legislatures. 
 Educated at Stella Maris and St Aloysius College, he graduated with a degree in business in 2001. As a student, he led the University Students Council (KSU) and served on the National Youth Council (KNZ). 
 Known for his jovial character, he was also a keen athlete focused on long-distance runs. 
 At the time of his announcement to contest the PN general secretary post, a party source had described how Gouder managed to bring together everyone who worked at Dar Ċentrali.
 ""He earned staff’s respect on the media side, as he was leading the team there, but he has also proven himself on the party side as well.” 
 His death came as a huge shock in political circles where he was widely respected. 
 European Parliament president Roberta Metsola said she was ""devastated"" to learn of the news.  
  In a statement, the Labour Party expressed its condolences to the Gouder family. 
 Prime Minister Robert Abela in a Facebook post also expressed his sorrow, recalling his long friendship with Gouder from their school days.
  President Myriam Spiteri Debono said she felt Gouder's nomination as PN general secretary was a positive thing for the party and the country, even though she did not know him personally.
  Speaker Anglu Farrugia also relayed his condolences to the family.
 The Malta LGBTIQ Rights Movement (MGRM) noted that Gouder was Malta's first openly gay MP and highlighted his vocal advocacy in favour of marriage equality. 
 ""We want to thank Karl for his commitment to his public office and for representing our community particularly at a time when the conversation was very different from today,"" the MGRM said as it offered Gouder's family its condolences.

 Evarist Bartolo said the prime minister could have taken “needed decisions” in his first two years in government but questioned whether he could do so now  when he can no longer afford to lose votes.  
 Labour had won a Pyrrhic victory on Sunday, dropping from a majority of 42,000 to 8,500 within five years. 
 The prime minister reacted to the result by saying that a substantial part of society chose not to vote because they are disappointed that some difficult decisions on overdevelopment, tables and chairs and women’s rights were not taken.  
 He said the Labour party needs to take necessary decisions for the country, ""even if they are not immediately popular"" in the short term.
 But on Wednesday Bartolo said that the government’s chance to take unpopular decisions has gone.  
  “A prime minister takes difficult decisions in the first two years after winning an election,” said Bartolo, who was one of the Labour government’s more outspoken figures before losing his seat in the 2022 general elections. 
 The prime minister did not take these necessary decisions after storming the general election, when he was far stronger and could afford to lose votes, Bartolo said.  
 Instead, Abela worsened the problems in some instances, or allowed them to worsen, he added.
 “How can he (Abela) take the decisions on the eve of the 2027 general election, when he is far weaker and cannot afford to lose votes?” Bartolo asked.

 Colonel Mark Mallia will be replacing Glenn Micallef as OPM head of secretariat, the government said on Wednesday.
 It is unclear whether Micallef's resignation is connected to Labour's dramatic dip in voter majority in MEP elections earlier this month, though he was part of the team that led the PL's campaign.
 That team, which also successfully led the 2022 general election campaign, included two of Robert Abela’s closest lieutenants – adviser Aleander Balzan and Micallef – as well as Malta Film Commission chief Johann Grech.
 Micallef's resignation follows that of party deputy leader Daniel Micallef, who stepped down two days after the election.
 On Wednesday, the OPM published a letter by Robert Abela in which the prime minister thanked Micallef for his professionalism, loyalty and integrity, and says he looked forward ""to continue working for and serving the country"".
  He is being replaced by Mallia, who, in February, was appointed head of Transport Malta, less than two weeks after it was announced he would take over as chief executive of the Foundation for Medical Services.
 He was previously CEO of Identity Malta, now Identità.
 In a post on Facebook on Wednesday morning, Micallef said the termination was ""planned"".
 ""PM, as always planned, I will terminate my experience as head of your secretariat satisfied with our work for Malta, grateful for the opportunity and trust that you showed - and continued to show me - and, above all, personally satisfied with my work,"" he said.
 In his post, Micallef also apologised to anyone he might have hurt or offended. 
  As an EU policy expert, Micallef is expected to continue to serve as Abela's 'sherpa', the official responsible for backroom dealing and technical negotiations at EU level.
 He is also being tipped as a successor to Marlene Bonnici, who has been Permanent Representative of Malta to the EU since July 2020 and previously held the same office between 2012 and 2018.
 If Micallef is given that role, it would mirror a previous situation under Lawrence Gonzi's government when Richard Cachia Caruana held both positions.
 Another position that is up for grabs remains Malta's nomination for EU Commissioner after Chris Fearne dropped out following fraud charges. But it would be highly unusual for that job to go to a technocrat instead of a politician. 
 
 However, time is running out for the prime minister to reveal his choice, with horse-trading for roles in the next Commission due to start soon.
 Micallef is expected to travel with Abela on Thursday when the EU will likely confirm who will its next leadership team, including the European Commission, the European Council, and the European Parliament, as well as the EU’s chief diplomat post.
 Micallef was appointed head of secretariat in November 2020, taking over from Clyde Caruana, who went on to be co-opted to parliament and appointed finance minister.
 Caruana took on the role when Abela became prime minister earlier that year. Officials occupying that role were previously called 'chief of staff' but Abela changed the title to 'head of secretariat' when he assumed office.
 The role was previously - and often controversially - held by Keith Schembri, who was Joseph Muscat's chief of staff and who now stands accused alongside Muscat, of serious corruption and money laundering charges over the hospitals deal.
 The role of the prime minister's head of secretariat is arguably one of the country's most powerful political positions.
 They are the most senior political appointee at the OPM and serve as one of the prime minister's senior aides and advisors. They also coordinate work and staff at the prime minister's office and other government departments.
 Micallef was one of the youngest people ever to hold the role. He graduated in economics from the University of Malta and was active in student political organisation Pulse.
 Before becoming head of secretariat, Micallef served as Director General of Malta's EU Coordination Department and advisor to the Prime Minister on EU affairs. That role involved overseeing the government's coordination on EU-related matters.
 But most recently, Micallef was trusted with coordinating a government committee tasked with implementing recommendations made by a public inquiry into the death of Jean Paul Sofia.
 The committee comprised Micallef and four ministers: Justice Minister Jonathan Attard, Planning Minister Clint Camilleri, Home Affairs Minister Byron Camilleri and Economy Minister Silvio Schembri.

Michael Piccinino: PN is not in developers' pockets,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/michael-piccinino-pn-developers-pockets.1100482,11-02-2024,004804.png,"Michael Piccinino has pushed back against accusations that developers influence the Nationalist Party, pointing to its efforts to improve party financing transparency. 
 Speaking at a press conference introducing the party’s theme for its upcoming General Council, “Malta Żagħżugħa,” the PN General Secretary emphasised the party’s commitment to environmental protection.
 The PN last month faced accusations from environmental NGO Moviment Graffitti about its “deafening silence” in response to revelations concerning manoeuvres to amend the Villa Rosa local plan.
 Graffitti – whose activists also interrupted the Budget speech last Monday to accuse MPs of “dancing to developers’ tune” - said the PN’s acquiescence was proof that it was “in the pocket of developers as much as the government.”
 On Saturday, Piccinino insisted that was not true. The PN has long advocated for party financing law, he said, to ensure transparency and prevent undue influence.
 “For years now, not just recently when this has become trendy or fashionable, we said there should be a law on the financing of the parties, to eliminate any doubt that there could be a financial link between the parties and developers,” he said.
 Malta introduced a party financing law, the Financing of Political Parties Act, in 2016. The law was first proposed by a PN MP, Franco Debono, who broke with the party in the run-up to the 2013 general election. 
 Piccinino also highlighted a motion the PN has previously filed, proposing that environmental protection be recognized as a fundamental human right within the Constitution, as a sign of the party’s priorities. He noted that this motion is awaiting a government response.
 Piccinino and PN Executive Committee Chair Joe Grech highlighted various key topics discussed within the general council’s various assemblies.
 Council members met in Mgarr, Fgura and Gozo this week to discuss six key themes, from education to quality of life, mental health, local councils and challenges for Gozo.
 Piccinino said that the fact the Budget speech ""completely overlooked"" both the University of Malta and MCAST indicated education is not a priority for the government.
 Nor was wellbeing, he said, adding that PN leader Bernard Grech had noted that the word was not mentioned a single time in the Budget 2025 speech. 
 Other topics raised by Piccinino and Grech included increasing the funding allocations for local councils, which they said aren't coping with rising costs, and the need for better connectivity and jobs in Gozo.

 Continuous blood glucose monitors reduce the need for finger-prick blood tests and help people with diabetes manage their condition. 
 So far, they were available to people aged under 35.
 Apart from becoming available for all those aged under 45, they will now also be available to people suffering from conditions linked to the pancreas and those who suffer from gestational diabetes.

President intervenes to call for ‘normality’,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/president-intervenes-call-normality.1093032,25-05-2024,004810.png,"President Myriam Spiteri Debono on Saturday called for “normality” to prevail in the coming days, insisting that nobody should provoke or fall for provocation, amid heightened political tensions.
 Although she did not mention it directly, the president was ostensibly referring a show of support planned on Tuesday outside court for former prime minister Joseph Muscat, his chief of staff Keith Schembri and former health minister Konrad Mizzi who are expected to be charged following the conclusion of the magisterial inquiry into the hospitals’ deal.
 Political sparks have flown in recent days as calls grew to show support for Muscat outside court. Prime Minister Robert Abela has warned PL supporters not to fall for a ""trap"", though he did not specify what he was referring to. Strong police presence is expected for Tuesday's protest.
 “Every citizen is free to act within the parameters of the rights given to him by the constitution. However, common sense and prudence dictate that in order not to fall for provocation, you should not seek provocation or, worse still, make or render yourself its agent,” Spiteri Debono said in a statement.
 She said that although she had full confidence in the ability of the police force to maintain order, it is in everyone's interest that the law enforcement forces are not faced with situations ""outside the normality of their work from one day to another”.
 Spiteri Debono, who was elected president just last month, again appealed for everyone to allow the judicial process to flow serenely.
 Our laws, she said, guarantee and safeguard the interests of all those who face charges in court. Time and again, our judiciary has shown they are loyal to the laws of the country and are capable of being impartial.
 “Nothing should be done to harm others or the country,” she said.
 On a different note, Spiteri  Debono said the major parties are urging the people to vote in the European and local council elections. Democracy starts from the vote, and the people’s will is manifested in elections. Citizens should not throw away this basic right. If they do that, they will be allowing others to decide, she said.

Inquiry launched to investigate support Nicolette Ghirxi received before murder,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/inquiry-launched-investigate-support-nicolette-ghirxi-received-murder.1097292,27-08-2024,004811.png,"The Social Policy ministry has launched an Inquiry Board under the Inquiries Act to investigate the professional support and help Nicolette Ghirxi received before her murder.
 In a statement on Tuesday, it was announced the Inquiry Board will be chaired by retired Judge Lawrence Quintano, and the board will be given a four-month period to submit its report. 
 “The board will be appointed to determine all the facts and circumstances regarding what professional help was given to Ghirxi, whenever she requested for help, or if she was referred for such assistance by domestic violence social services,"" the statement said.
 The board will also examine the risk assessment procedure. 
 The Board will also make recommendations on whether further measures are necessary for the operation of social services provided to victims of domestic violence. 
 The statement said the ministry is committed to publishing the inquiry report. The inquiry will be conducted in conjunction with the ongoing investigations by the Independent Police Complaints Board. 
 The statement was published hours after the Foundation of Social Welfare Services (FSWS) denied that its employees discouraged Ghirxi from taking a risk assessment. 
 In a statement on Tuesday, the FSWS insisted that at no point did their employees discourage Ghirxi from taking the risk assessment. FSWS published two affidavits from Jodie Baldacchino and Pavel Cuschieri, the two risk assessors present on the day that Ghirxi went to file a report.
 The denial comes after one of Ghirxi's close friends and her lawyer told Times of Malta that Ghirxi had agreed to take a risk assessment but that she had been  ""talked out of it"" when she attended the evaluation. 
 Ghirxi was found stabbed to death in her Swatar apartment on August 12. She is believed to have been killed by her former partner Edward Johnston, who was later shot dead by police. 
 Johnston engaged in a three-hour standoff with the police while pointing what later transpired to be a replica Beretta pistol.
 Ghirxi's family are calling for an independent inquiry to establish the facts surrounding her death, as well as to identify whether authorities should have been aware that she was in danger.

Arnold Cassola calls for ‘centre-green-left’ grouping: ‘Not ruling anyone out’,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/arnold-cassola-calls-centregreenleft-coalition-not-ruling-anyone-out.1093831,06-12-2024,004817.png,"Independent MEP candidate Arnold Cassola has called for the formation of a “centre-green-left” coalition after missing out on winning a seat in the recent European Parliament elections.
 Pointing to growing support for independent candidates and alternative parties, Cassola said the time was “ripe for... a centre-green-left oriented coalition,” in an opinion piece published in Times of Malta today.
 Calling the election “the birth of a movement for hope”, the independent candidate said building on its results was “the next step”, before inviting “well-meaning people” to register their interest in forming a coalition.
 Contacted to elaborate on his comments, Cassola would not be drawn into commenting on his willingness to work with specific candidates, instead saying he wasn’t ruling anyone out.
 But, in separate comments to Times of Malta, ADPD leader Sandra Gauci said she “didn’t see a coalition forming right now”.
 Reflecting on the election results in his opinion piece, Cassola wrote that despite his own personal defeat, the country’s political landscape had been shaken by a “tectonic jolt”, with 13% of voters opting for third parties and independents.
 The independent candidate missed out on a seat despite winning the third-largest number of first-count votes, an early advantage that was negated after he failed to inherit enough votes in further counts.
 Commenting on his defeat, he wrote he had found “profound solace” in the growing support for alternatives to the two main political parties, before issuing a call to set up a coalition focused on centre-left and green policies.
 Cassola told Times of Malta the coalition would be focused on creating a society based on meritocracy and halting the “spread of concrete” across the country. Asked who the coalition was open to, he said he was not ruling anyone out while stressing he believed there to be many people across the country who shared similar aims.
 When asked if he would consider joining forces with fellow independent candidate Conrad Borg Manché or ADPD, Cassola said the proposed coalition was “not exclusive... [and] open to everyone.”
 When pressed on Borg Manché, who declared he would join the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) at the European Parliament if elected – a right-wing Eurosceptic group – Cassola said  Times of Malta could “draw your own conclusions” but would not be drawn into commenting on his position.
 Responding to whether he would work with those who shared different views on controversial topics such as abortion – an issue that prompted him to resign from Alternattiva Demokratika, a forerunner to ADPD, due to differences with others in the party – Cassola stressed the coalition would allow members to exercise their right to a “vote of conscience” (free vote) on such topics.
 Challenged on whether the proposed coalition would enjoy widespread support in the context of a surge of support for right-wing parties across the continent, Cassola rebuffed the suggestion, saying he believed there to be “many level-headed people in Malta”.
 Commenting on the MEP election results, Cassola described the outcome as a loss for Labour rather than a victory for PN and stressed the importance of cross-voting, rather than simply voting along party lines.
 Asked whether he thought it was fair he lost out on an MEP seat while gaining the highest number of first-preference votes, Cassola indicated his support for electoral reform but said it was “just wishful thinking without political will” to change the system.
 Correction: An earlier version of this article said Arnold Cassola resigned as leader of Alternattiva Demokratika. He founded and had led the party but was not leader at the time of his resignation.

Justice delayed...Malta still at the bottom of EU scoreboard,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/justice-delayedmalta-still-bottom-eu-scoreboard.1093818,06-11-2024,"004825.png,004826.png","Updated 6pm with Justice Ministry reaction below.
 Malta has remained anchored at the bottom of an EU leaderboard showing the average time that a court takes to decide a case instituted against the government.
 The report, issued by the European Commission, shows that of the 25 countries surveyed in 2022, the estimated time needed to resolve administrative cases at first instance in, Malta was 2.8 years.   
 The second slowest country is Portugal. There, administrative cases take 1.7 years.
 The quickest courts to produce a first judgement in such instances are in Lithuania. There an administrative case takes just over six months on average.
 Administrative law refers to instances when people and businesses take the government to court. Tax assessments, land concessions, and tables and chair concessions are some examples of administrative law.  
 
 It has not been all bad news for Malta. In 2021, the average time before a judgment was 3.7 years.  
 The average time for a court judgement in civil cases in Malta is the third longest in Europe- 1.4 years.  
 A low number of judges may have something to do with this.  
 Malta has nine judges for every 100,000 Maltese residents - the third lowest rate in Europe. Croatia has the highest rate, with 42 per 100,000. 
 However, Malta has a relatively high number of lawyers- around 275 for every 100,000 people.
  Newly elected MEP Peter Agius commented sarcastically that Malta is the ""best in Europe for justice delayed"". Labour had, in 2013, promised to make Malta 'the best in Europe'.
 The Maltese government should ensure that the courts have the resources to ensure timely justice, Agius said. 
 Money laundering cases also take a long time, with the courts taking an average of a year and nine months. That is slightly longer than the 2021 average—a year and a half.  It is the fourth longest in the EU.  
  In a reaction, the Justice Ministry said that improving the efficiency of the justice system to provide timely decision of court cases was its top priority.
 ""The data in the EU JS 24 report is based on 2022 data. It highlights improvements in the court’s performance despite an increase in incoming civil, commercial, and administrative cases. Overall, the time needed to resolve these cases has improved. Administrative cases still take the longest to resolve, but there has been a 20% decrease in the time it takes to process these cases compared to the previous year.""
 The ministry said the push to enhance the efficiency of proceedings was also reflected in the improved rate of case resolution. In 2022, the clearance rate of civil and commercial cases increased from 78% to 87%, and the clearance rate of administrative cases improved from 70% to 95% compared to 2021.  
 The ministry said financial investment in the law courts per inhabitant had increased, and the investment in the wages of key justice professionals was among the highest across member states.

 Speaking a day after Labour won the election by an 8,400 majority over PN, Abela said the results are still a victory for the PL but acknowledged once again there had been a strong message from the electorate.
  A meeting for Labour MPs and the executive was called after the election result over the weekend, but the prime minister denied he was seeking a vote of confidence on Monday night. Earlier, multiple sources within the PL said Abela had been planning a vote of confidence by a show of hands. 
 “Anybody who asks for a confidence vote within the (party) structures is a politician who knows his time with the electorate is coming to an end. Whoever makes that decision is a desperate,” he said.
 “When the time comes when I do not have the electorate’s trust, I will heed the message and I will take the decision by myself”. 
 The prime minister said: “The people still sent a strong message that they trust the Labour Party as the party offering solutions to challenges”.
 But the electorate expects courageous decisions.
 “People do not want us to be populist... The moment has come to make decisions that can no longer be postponed,” the prime minister said. 
 A substantial part of society chose not to vote because they are disappointed that some decisions were not taken. 
 “That large chunk of the electorate is disillusioned with the political class because we focus on what is petty or what can give us short-term electorate advantage.
 ""The PL needs to take necessary decisions for the country, even if they are not immediately popular but will be appreciated in the long term,"" he said. 
 These decisions cannot be postponed further, Abela said. 
 Specifically, Abela spoke about over-development, care for the environment, civil liberties, specifically women’s rights, and overpopulation. 
 “The country had an economic formula 10 or 11 years ago to get the country out of an economic crisis. Today, the realities are different, as have people's aspirations and expectations. Because they have a better quality of life,” he said. 
 Abela also mentioned the contentious issue of restaurants putting out tables and chairs in public areas. 
 “We’re not saying there should not be tables and chairs, but there needs to be a balance between pedestrians and business owners.""
 Asked whether a cabinet reshuffle is on the cards or whether there will be resignations of people in the Labour Party, Abela said: “Those are decisions I must take at the opportune moment; I don't exclude anything naturally”.

PN calls for transparency on investigation into slime at Ħondoq Bay,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/pn-calls-transparency-investigations-slime-hondoq-bay.1096871,17-08-2024,004845.png,"Updated at 5.40pm with ERA statement
 The Nationalist Party has urged the Environment and Resources Authority (ERA) to publish the results of its investigation into the fish sludge found at Ħondoq Bay. 
 Earlier this month, Qala mayor Paul Buttiġieġ complained to the authorities and fish farm operators after slime washed up at the popular bay. He had suspected that the slime had drifted from a fish farm off St Paul’s Bay. 
 This week ERA said it will continue to monitor the ongoing cleaning at the beach by members of the Federation of Fish Farms. 
  On Saturday, the PN said ERA must identify the source of contamination and establish effective measures to prevent such incidents in the future. 
 “The priority of the Nationalist Party is to stop contamination of this kind from the source, to reduce the environmental risks and protect the health of all those who frequent the beach,” PN environment spokesperson Rebekah Borg and Gozo spokesperson Alex Borg said.
 In a statement published on Saturday afternoon, ERA said the clean-up of the slime and oil on the sand, carried out by the Federation of Fish Farmers has been ongoing for several days.
 ""ERA is considering action through administrative fines on the fish farm operator for breaching the environmental permit conditions that led to this episode,"" the statement read. 
 ""These conditions are included in environmental permits to limit environmental damage.""
 The PN statement said the slime at Ħondoq is not an “isolated incident” and recent cases of contamination in Maltese bays have “heightened the public’s concern”.
 This summer several beaches were closed due to contamination.
 In May, popular tourist spot  Balluta Bay was closed after becoming contaminated with Escherichia coli, or E. coli, and Enterococci. The closure had left visitors disappointed and  businesses impacted. 
 Earlier this week, Balluta Bay reopened to the public.
 Last week, the beach underneath Buġibba square was cleared for swimming after health authorities issued a contamination warning for the area the previous week.

Ins ‘n’ outs: Labour’s musical chairs since the election,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/ins-n-outs-labour-musical-chairs-since-election.1096979,21-08-2024,"004885.png,004886.png,004887.png,004888.png,004889.png,004890.png,004891.png,004892.png","Ramona Attard is the latest senior Labour official to leave her role in the party since it lost its supermajority in the June elections. Over the last weeks, there have been a flurry of changes to the party’s top positions. If you’ve not been able to keep up, Mark Laurence Zammit charts the moves.
  Randolph De Battista was Labour CEO from 2017 to 2020 and, again, from 2022, when he was co-opted to parliament. Earlier this month, he quit without specifying why.
 In June, Robert Abela admitted that within the party there were “differences of opinion” with De Battista. Sources say the pair had a frosty relationship in recent months but the prime minister’s faith in him appeared quickly restored as Abela made De Battista Geneva ambassador the day after he quit his party role.
 That appointment was not without controversy, however, as the PN and government critics accused Abela of using public money to control party divisions.
 Meanwhile, De Battista’s role as party CEO was promptly filled by Leonid McKay, who has himself been in and out of top seats in several public entities lately.
 
 Mckay was serving as the CEO of Jobsplus when he was moved to the PL earlier this month.
 He was previously the CEO of the Housing Authority as well as the director of the Authority for the Responsible Use of Cannabis.
 Unlike other elected roles in the party’s administration, the PL’s CEO is directly appointed by the party’s leader.
 Now it is mostly up to McKay to mend divisions within a party that was – until a couple of years ago – the strongest it ever was but which is now facing the first significant dip in voter support in more than a decade, while reeling from the criminal arraignment of its former leader.
 Another question remains: who will replace De Battista in parliament? We do not know but the government must co-opt someone to take his seat. Which takes us to...
  The latest party official to step aside is Ramona Attard, who announced on Monday she will not seek re-election as president and will not contest any other post.
 She did not elaborate on her choice, simply saying she is “ready for a new challenge after four years in the party’s administration”.
 If Abela wants to continue his musical chairs strategy, he could always co-opt Attard to parliament in the seat vacated by De Battista.
 Attard, a former ONE reporter and aide to Joseph Muscat and ex-ministers Manuel Mallia and Carmelo Abela, was elected party president in July 2020.
 It is yet unclear who could take her role.
 The party will hold internal elections on September 13 and 14, during which several key roles, including the party’s two deputy leaders, will be up for grabs.
  Daniel Micallef was the first casualty of Labour’s electoral performance last June. He resigned as Labour deputy leader for party affairs before counting agents even began sorting through the local councils’ ballots, an election in which Labour performed significantly better. Despite timing the announcement of his resignation right when Labour’s voter majority plummeted dramatically, he insisted his decision was largely unrelated to the result – he had known he would step down two years ago, he said.
 We will know who will replace him in mid-September, when the party holds its internal elections, but his role was hotly contested, at least briefly, a few weeks ago. Labour stalwart Jason Micallef initially announced he would throw his name in the hat, causing consternation within the party.
 The prime minister hinted at his dissatisfaction, saying delegates should not turn back the clock. Days later, MEP Alex Agius Saliba hinted he would enter the race. Micallef announced he was bowing out, essentially paving the way for the party’s star EP candidate to become Abela’s number two.
 Cue an announcement that Micallef would also get a new job, as ‘special delegate on the implementation of the electoral manifesto’.
 But Abela has two number twos in the party. Come September, delegates will also have to choose a replacement for former minister Chris Fearne, who stepped down from his role as deputy leader for parliamentary affairs after there was enough evidence for his criminal case over the hospitals deal to continue.
 We still do not know who will replace him but Ian Borg is considered the favourite. He confirmed his intentions on Wednesday.
  Perhaps the most high-level and significant government resignation following the election was that of the prime minister’s chief of staff, Glenn Micallef.
 Micallef, who held one of the country’s most powerful and influential positions, was part of the team that led the election campaign in May and June.
 To replace him, in comes Mark Mallia, who has barely had any time to find his feet in any of the offices he had been appointed to this year.
 In a matter of months, the former army colonel has been CEO of Identità, CEO of the Foundation for Medical Services and head of Transport Malta.
 Micallef was not left without another important appointment, however.
 When it became clear that Fearne’s criminal case had spoilt his chances of being nominated as Malta’s European commissioner, Abela announced he was nominating Micallef instead.
 A tough grilling by MEPs still awaits him later this year.
 And what about Mallia’s post at Transport Malta? That was taken over by one of Muscat’s former top aides, Kurt Farrugia, who left his role as Malta Enterprise CEO and was replaced by George Gregory just last week.
  Speaking of controversial state authorities, there is a new boss at Infrastructure Malta as well.
 Last month, Ivan Falzon – who had previously headed Mater Dei Hospital and the Water Services Corporation – announced he was stepping down in an “amicable separation” with Infrastructure Minister Chris Bonett.
 Former Project Green CEO Steve Ellul – who unsuccessfully contested the MEP election – took Falzon’s place days later.
 Since the election, the office of the prime minister lost another two of its top media people.
 One of the prime minister’s policy advisers – Aleander Balzan – resigned at the beginning of August. Claire Azzopardi, who was one of the people who handled press questions and media requests, also left.
 Meanwhile, Samuel Lucas joined the OPM’s media team after leaving his role as a reporter at ONE News.
  Ronald Vassallo was Labour’s head of communications – that is until he also stepped down almost two weeks ago.
 Again, he did not specify why he decided to leave.
 We do not yet know whether a replacement for him was appointed.
  It has been a long and arduous journey for the Qormi MP, who was forced to resign from the PL parliamentary group in April last year, after succumbing to pressure following the publication of hundreds of WhatsApp messages between her and Yorgen Fenech, who is awaiting trial for his alleged involvement in the murder of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia.
 Rosianne Cutajar’s return to the party has long been anticipated and internally debated, however.
 In January, Abela said Cutajar had paid a high enough political price and that it was time to “reconsider” her position but later added that she would need to apologise before being allowed back into the party.
 She has never made a public apology and it remains unclear whether Cutajar apologised to the prime minister or the party before rejoining 10 days ago.
 Her return was criticised by the PN and NGO Repubblika but Labour insiders hope she could help bring back disgruntled voters.

"Man accused of Dom Mintoff murder attempt was framed, relatives say",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/man-accused-dom-mintoff-murder-attempt-framed-relatives-say.1098367,20-09-2024,004901.png,"In October 1979, gunshots rang out at the Office of the Prime Minister.
 Now, 45 years later, heirs of the man who spent nine years in a mental asylum as a result of that incident are suing the state, saying their father was part of a political frame-up.
 Carmel, Francis, Joseph, John and Ann, the five heirs of Karmenu Grima, are claiming that their father had been unjustly accused of attempting to kill Dom Mintoff when he entered Castille on that October morning. 
 Grima had gone to Castille to hand Mintoff a letter with sensitive information about one of Mintoff’s top ministers, Lorry Sant, they say. But his visit ended with gunshots. 
 Word of the alleged attempt on Mintoff's life spread quickly and inflamed Labour supporters, who gathered outside the office of the prime minister. 
 From there, thugs ransacked Strickland House, the then-home of Times of Malta, and set it on fire. They then barged into the home of Opposition leader Eddie Fenech Adami, attacking his wife and children. 
 The day, a notorious one in Malta's political history, became known as 'Black Monday'.
 But judging by claims filed in court by Grima's heirs, the violence was sparked by political disinformation.
 Grima was a well-known loyal supporter and personal friend of Mintoff, who led the Labour government between 1971 and 1984. 
 The two regularly met at the Marsa stables where the then-prime minister kept his horses. 
 One day, Grima told Mintoff that he had some “sensitive information” about another minister. 
 On October 15, 1979 Grima headed to the office of the prime minister, bearing a letter with that information concerning minister Lorry Sant. 
 He entered Castille but was prevented from going to Mintoff’s office by some OPM staff. 
 So Grima waited patiently, letter in hand, keen to hand it to Mintoff in person. As he waited, he spoke to staff, including then-chief messenger Victor Pace, about the information he meant to share with Mintoff. 
 That was when the incident broke out. 
 Five shots were fired, with three hitting Grima. 
 He also needed 40 stitches after being hit in the head with a hard object. Nobody else suffered gunshot wounds, his heirs say, adding that the prime minister was in another room.  
 The press statement later issued by the Department of Information said that a man had barged into Castille at around 1:00pm, armed with a revolver, demanding to see the prime minister. He had fired at Mintoff’s chief messenger, the DOI statement said. 
 Grima’s heirs say claims of an assassination attempt were a frame-up by people who wanted to stop him from getting to Mintoff. 
 It was blown out of proportion to make it seem like a murder attempt against Mintoff when in reality, the PM was not even in the room, they say.  
 At the time, Mintoff was in a meeting with the ambassador of North Korea. 
 It was evident that someone wanted Grima out of the way, his heirs say. 
 After the shooting, Grima was rushed to hospital for emergency treatment. 
 He was kept isolated from everyone, including family. 
 But information later divulged by former Agriculture Minister Freddie Micallef indicated that there was another attempt to kill Grima while he was in hospital. 
 The plan failed because the suspected aggressor/s mistakenly targeted the patient lying in the bed next to Grima’s. That patient happened to be Micallef’s brother. 
 After an indefinite stay in hospital, Grima was taken to prison and later to Mount Carmel Hospital purportedly “for his own safety.” 
 His family was kept in the dark. 
 They were given no information about the magisterial inquiry that was conducted into the alleged incident. 
 However it later transpired that the inquiring magistrate did not conclude that it was an attempted murder. 
 In spite of that, Grima was charged in court with attempting to murder Mintoff. 
 He was eventually declared “of unsound mind” and sent to Mount Carmel where he spent nine years.  He was discharged in 1989 after the PN took over government. He died few years later in 1995. 
 He had been administered all sorts of pills, so much so that his memory was affected. 
 A second inquiry into events of that day, held during a PN administration, also concluded that there had been no attempt on Mintoff's life.
 Three copies of that inquiry are known to have been distributed. None can be located. The Grima family was never given access to either inquiry. 
 There was no murder attempt against Mintoff, Grima’s heirs claim.
 Mintoff himself when speaking about the incident in Parliament a fortnight later, never once mentioned that Grima fired at him. 
 But the chief messenger and a major who testified in the murder compilation gave a different version. 
 A story published in a former newspaper, Alternattiva, titled “Castille 15 October 1979…Framed attempt”, claimed that chief messenger Pace and major Eddie Theuma had given false testimony. 
 Pace sued the paper for libel. He lost the case. 
 The narrative that landed Grima in court was all made up to justify the violence which broke out later that day under the administration of the day. 
 A “normal man” who never needed medical treatment was made to seem “insane.” 
 He was locked away. 
 He was the “sacrificial lamb” of this political frame up, argue his heirs who are now claiming that his fundamental rights to life, to private and family life and personal freedom and security were breached. 
 They are suing the authorities for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damages. 
 The case is scheduled for a first hearing next month. 
 Lawyers Peter Fenech, Elena Fenech and Matthew Camilleri are assisting the applicants.

"Clayton Bartolo out as Labour MP, Ian Borg to become Tourism Minister",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/clayton-bartolo-kicked-labour-mp-ian-borg-tourism-minister.1101568,26-11-2024,"004904.png,004905.png","Last updated 5pm
 Clayton Bartolo is out of Labour’s parliamentary group after Prime Minister Robert Abela learnt of a new scandal involving him and his wife.
 Bartolo was made to resign as Tourism Minister and told he would no longer be allowed to represent the Labour Party in parliament, Abela told the media on Tuesday morning.
 The prime minister said the decision was made “in light of different circumstances” to those that emerged from a standards commissioner report into a job he gave his wife, Amanda Muscat.
  Those ""circumstances"" concern an FIAU investigation into roughly €50,000 Muscat received in 2023 from a company linked to a Malta Tourism Authority contractor. 
 FIAU investigators have flagged those payments to the police, saying they are suspicious. 
 A Tourism Ministry spokesperson told Times of Malta that there was no link between Muscat's work and the contractor's MTA work and that Muscat had declared all her income. 
 Deputy Prime Minister Ian Borg, who is Foreign Affairs Minister, will take Bartolo’s place as Tourism Minister. Borg is expected to also retain his current ministerial portfolio for the time being. 
 Bartolo will continue to serve in parliament as an independent MP, Abela said. 
  Abela declined to comment about the “new circumstances” that led to Bartolo being kicked out of the party’s parliamentary group but acknowledged that Times of Malta had sent questions about them some days ago.
 Abela declined to say he had ""sacked"" Bartolo. 
 ""I called for him and the decision was taken,"" he said. Bartolo would now be in a better position to defend himself, he said. 
 He said Bartolo and his wife, Amanda Muscat, would be refunding excess payments she received as a fictitious consultant in the coming days. 
 Attempts to contact Bartolo were unsuccessful. He however posted a statement on Facebook, saying he had decided to resign as his position ""is being used to harm the government’s reputation.""
 He said that he was proud to leave behind a tourism industry on solid foundations and said that under his political leadership the country’s film industry had performed excellently on an international level.
 He made no reference to allegations being made about him or his wife. 
 Bartolo has been tourism minister since November 2020 after being promoted from parliamentary secretary.

Five things to look out for as council elections vote-counting starts,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/five-things-look-council-elections-votecounting-starts.1093829,06-12-2024,"004910.png,004911.png,004912.png,004913.png","The counting of votes cast in Saturday's local council elections starts on Wednesday (today), with political parties focused on some battleground localities.
 The localities have been divided into three groups, whose votes will be counted on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. 
 Labour saw a sharp narrowing of its majority in the European Parliament elections, also held on Saturday. The counting of those votes took place on Sunday. 
 Could the councils hand Labour its first electoral defeat in 20 years? 
 PN sources say that is unlikely since the PL has traditionally fared better in local council elections in comparison to European elections.
  471 council seats in 67 localities are up for grabs - 53 in Malta and 14 in Gozo.
 Here are some things to look out for:  
 Gżira mayor Conrad Borg Manche, who ran as an independent in the EP elections and got 5,936 first-count votes, also ran for the Gżira council.  
 He was elected to the Gzira council on the Labour ticket but resigned from the party in October last year after he clashed over environmental issues. Can he win re-election as an independent? Gzira council was Labour-led before Borg Manche's resignation, with Labour having had five of the nine council seats. 
  Steve Żammit Lupi, a Żebbuġ (Malta) councillor, will be hoping for a second term on Wednesday, which is when that locality's ballots are counted. 
 This time around, he ran together with two other independent candidates for the locality's council, including his mother, Lilibeth. 
 Nationalist Party sources believe that the environmental activist's re-election is likely, and Lilibeth could also take a local council seat if she inherits enough votes from Steve. But at whose expense? The outgoing council had nine members - five Labour, three Nationalists, and Zammit Lupi as independent.  
 Other independents to look out for are Kaylocke Buhagiar , who was elected to the Birkirkara council on the Labour Party's ticket in 2019, . Once dominated by the PN, Birkirkara council has seen a Labour majority since 2013.
 Salvu Borg, was elected mayor of Fontana (Gozo) on the PN ticket five years ago but he has now run without the backing of a party.
 Can an independent become mayor? 
 The law that regulates local councils says that the office of mayor shall be held by the councillor who receives the highest number of first-count votes from the political party that obtained an absolute majority of seats in the council.  
 But if no party gets a majority, it is the council itself that appoints a mayor among its ranks.  
 In a split council, independents are king-makers and prime contenders for the role. Floriana's Nigel Holland, who is running this year, served as mayor for several legislatures when the PL and PN had an equal number of seats in that locality.    
 The PN suffered its worst-ever results in the last local council elections when Labour won 47,000 more votes than the PN.  
 The PN also lost more localities that had traditionally voted blue, such as Siġġiewi and Valletta.  
 The PN won Valletta in 2013, 2008, 2002 and 1999 but narrowly lost it in the last election.  
 Labour won 252 more votes than the PN in that election.  
 Siġġiewi has a similar history. Five years ago, the PL won by a whisker and only had 70 more votes than the PN. That victory was Labour's first ever in Siġġiewi. 
 There was controversy during the run-up to the election when 99 people changed their ID card to a new government housing block in the locality even though they hadn’t moved in yet. The PN cried foul and the case went to court, which ordered those involved to vote in their original place of residence. 
  As vote counting takes off, many eyes will be on the ballots from places like Mosta, Mellieħa, St Paul's Bay, Siġġiewi and San Ġwann. All were PN-controlled in the past but were more recently run by Labour administrations. That could change once more by the end of the week. 
 Mosta was not far from the headlines over the past month, particularly owing to a major project to revamp the square and adjoining streets. The works left many residents and businesses fuming due to delays and traffic diversions.
 The town's mayor, Chris Grech, also came under fire following a decision to cut down mature trees near the rotunda church in November.  
 The PN placed considerable focus on Mosta during the campaign and it was the venue of one of Bernard Grech's last addresses as the campaign closed. Mosta, incidentally, is Grech's hometown.  
 One of the thinnest majorities of the 2019 local council elections was in San Ġwann. Whether there will be a similarly close result on Thursday, when the counting takes place, stands to be seen, but PL mayor Trevor Fenech's popularity among residents could be a factor.  
 Some PL-leaning localities are also worth watching. Mqabba, for example, had a PN majority in 2008 before two strong Labour wins in 2013 and 2019.    
 Labour strongholds like Paola, Żejtun or the three Cottonera cities will almost certainly vote overwhelmingly red. However, PN leader Grech said his party aims to gain more votes and possibly a council seat in those localities.  
 One place the PN could make significant gains is Santa Luċija. PN councillor-led initiatives to oppose a mega block in the locality might aid the PN's result on Friday.  
 Two 16-year-olds are running on the PL ticket, both for the Fgura council. Izaak Catania De Giovanni - PL MP's Katya De Giovanni's son, and Andre Mizzi, Malta's youngest local council candidate.  
 For the PN, Nina Briffa, running for the Qrendi council, is 17 years old while Gabriel Borg Fernando is running in St Julian's.  
 For the first time, candidates under 18 can become mayors or deputy mayors.  
 Will voters look kindly on them?

Charles Michel on shipping tax's impact: Look at how much EU has helped Malta,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/charles-michel-shipping-tax-impact-look-much-eu-helped-malta.1091771,21-06-2024,"004915.png,004916.png","European Council president Charles Michel has said any impact on Malta from a new EU shipping tax should be seen in the context of European Union money pumped into the country since it joined the bloc.
 Michel was responding to questions from Times of Malta during a session with journalists held to mark 20 years since the EU’s largest enlargement in 2004. That year, 10 new countries joined the Union, including Malta.
 Asked for assurances the EU didn’t favour large countries while forgetting smaller countries like Malta, Michel stressed the European Council was interested in “taking care of all states with the same level of respect”.
 But such assurances have been brought into question in recent years amid what has been viewed as a lack of support for frontline countries on migration and new rules that have been criticised for disproportionately hitting island states harder.
 In January, the EU introduced a new EU environmental tax on shipping that a recent European Parliament report said had only served to divert cargo ships to cheaper non-EU ports, a danger the Malta Freeport warned about in advance.
 But, according to Michel, this latest measure should be seen in a broader context.
 “You mention one specific element for Malta – the tax on shipping. But we have to take into account the global picture and all the solidarity shown by the EU towards Malta in terms of economic support, development and infrastructure,” he said.
 During Monday’s session, rule of law featured prominently, a topic Michel said was a “constant concern” at an EU level.
 But with multiple countries accused of flagrant abuses of rule of law, including Bulgaria, Romania and Malta – which has featured in several European Parliament resolutions on the subject in the years following the murder of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia – can the EU really impose rule of law on member states?
 And is it really that committed to doing so while seeming to prioritise European cohesion and enlargement at all costs in the face of Russian aggression on its Eastern flank?
 “Yes, we are determined... for the European Council, it’s a condition. Rule of law is the foundation, checks and balances are fundamental, democratic values and human dignity are who we are,” said Michel.
 “But, having said that, we need to be very clear and make sure we show there are normal standards when we assess the rule of law question. The rule of law is something that should be seen – and this makes the debate sometimes difficult – in a broader context.”
 Michel stressed “not only one measure” should be used to decide if a country is democratic, arguing it was also important to examine the freedom of expression and the press and the independence of the judiciary.
  Describing further planned enlargement of the EU as a “geopolitical strategy” and “responding to the call of history”, Michel said it was against a backdrop of “geopolitical chaos” caused by the war in Ukraine and in response to it.
 But he said the EU’s attitude to prospective new members had not always been seen as reliable, admitting the union had “procrastinated a lot and probably not given a clear sign we were determined to engage with them”.
 “It was and still is difficult for them to be certain we are credible when making commitments”, he said.
 Nine countries are currently being considered for EU membership including Ukraine, the first country in the EU’s history to apply for membership while in a state of war.
 The European Council president stressed it was important to “tell the truths to the people” in the face of populism and “avoid considering there would be some taboos about which we don’t talk in the democratic conversation”.
 Turning to economic matters, Michel said around €300 billion worth of European savings were “fleeing” to the US every year, putting the Americans in a position to “buy promising start-ups and companies launched on European soil. This, he said, was “stupid, not acceptable” and required action.
 And while Monday’s discussion focused mainly on weighty issues, there was still time for humour. Asked by one journalist about the prospects of candidates from Eastern and Central European countries that joined the bloc 20 years ago for some of the EU’s “top jobs” following the June elections, Michel shot a question back.
 “You didn’t sincerely think I would answer that question, did you,” he joked.

Minister denies he sent email objecting to his own PA policy,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/minister-denies-sent-email-objecting-pa-policy.1098623,27-09-2024,004930.png,"Planning Authority officials were perplexed to discover that one of the objections to a controversial planning policy appeared to have been sent in by the planning minister himself.
 The objection, sent last June as part of a public consultation process on a policy about building heights, raised eyebrows, as it suggested that Minister Clint Camilleri had objected to the very policy that he, himself, issued for consultation.
 Times of Malta saw the objection, which was among thousands of other objections from people who fear the policy as proposed by the Planning Ministry could allow developers to squeeze in more floors in their buildings.
 The objection, signed by a “Clint Camilleri” with the minister’s government email address – clint.camilleri@gov.mt – says the objector opposes the proposed height amendments.
 “I, the undersigned, do not agree with the proposed amendment of policy P35 of DC15. The revision of policy P35 will result in an increase in the number of floors from those stipulated and deemed permissible through the local plans,” it says, before it goes on to elaborate on how it would negatively impact the character of the Maltese and Gozitan streetscape.
 It was Camilleri himself who issued the public consultation.
 In a reply to questions, the Planning Ministry confirmed that neither the minister nor any government official filed the objection on his behalf.
 “It would be surreal that the minister will be objecting to a policy update brought forward by the same ministry or authority he is responsible for,” a ministry spokesperson said.
 “If such an objection was filed impersonating the minister or on his behalf, this was completely unauthorised.”
 The objection was also tagged with the email address of conservation NGO Din l-Art Ħelwa, but it also said it did not file the objection on the minister’s behalf.
 The NGO runs an online platform that allows people to insert their email address to object to planning policies and applications. The organisation suspects that since the minister’s email address is in the public domain, someone must have filed an objection with his address instead of their own.
 The NGO’s president, architect Patrick Calleja, said this was a unique and isolated case.
 “I can confirm that this is the only query we have ever received about the matter and is probably some kind of joke,” he said.
 “However, it should also be noted that every representation would have been answered by the Planning Authority with an official acknowledgement to the email address that was indicated, in this case that of Minister Clint Camilleri. With that in mind, it is very strange that this query has only surfaced now.”
 Times of Malta also asked the Planning Ministry whether Camilleri received the PA’s acknowledgement, but the question remained unanswered.
 The PA was running the consultation process to amend a policy in Development Control Design Policy, Guidance and Standards, a controversial document commonly known as the DC15.
 Height limitations for buildings were traditionally set by the number of floors that could be built in any given area, as set out by the local plans.
 But an annexe included in DC15, Annexe 2, laid out a table in which the maximum allowable heights of buildings previously indicated as floors, had now been converted into metres.
 
 The consultation process could lead to the formalisation of this interpretation of the guidelines and conservation groups are concerned about this.
 They fear the policy could allow developers to squeeze in an extra floor into their developments, thus creating denser buildings that will increase crowding and further strain the public infrastructure that supports them.
 The public consultation process has since closed but  Times of Malta is informed the PA received thousands of objections during that period.
 In reaction to this story, the Malta Developers Association said on Friday that false objections taint the public consultation process, by placing undue pressure on policymakers.
 The MDA claimed that this is not the first time objections have been filed for a third party without their knowledge. 
 ""This practice is unfortunately common when it comes to public consultations which relate to the issuance of planning permits as well as the coming into force of new laws or policies,"" the MDA said.
 ""Presently, no verification exercise is being conducted by any authority which verifies whether submissions such as these are being done truthfully or with the consent of the party being represented.""
 ""This effectively means that the process is being tainted with a lack of transparency and inaccuracy since it gives rise to a number of false objections which cause undue pressure on the decision-makers,"" the continued. 
 The MDA urgent reform is needed to curb such ""abuse"".

New regulations mean pet boarding is likely to be much more expensive,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/new-regulations-mean-pet-boarding-likely-much-expensive.1097764,09-11-2024,004938.png,"Recent regulations limiting the number of pet boarders will likely lead to a significant increase in fees, animal rights activists and sitters have warned.
 As new rules limit the number of animals boarders can care for, industry professionals expect daily rates to rise by around 40 per cent.
 “Rates will definitely increase as pet boarders are now limited to keeping fewer animals,” Althea Galea from Vuċi għall-Annimali said.
 Her concerns are echoed by others in the sector, who believe the changes will impact pet owners and care providers.
 Steph Meilaq, owner of Muddy Paws Resort Malta, said many in the pet care business are discussing potential price hikes, citing a raise in prices by around 40 per cent, for example from a daily rate of €25 to €35.
 “The bomb hasn’t dropped yet, but it will,” she added.
 The regulations, which came into force in June, will require boarders to obtain a licence to operate. As many sitters provide services from their homes, this will mean registering their homes as businesses, which will increase their electricity and water bills as they are charged commercial rates.
 Additionally, the regulations set strict limits on the number of animals a boarder can house at any given time. A pet sitter, defined as someone who provides care at an owner’s property or in public places, can only accommodate up to four animals for a period of no more than one week.
 Meanwhile, a boarder, who provides accommodation for five or more animals, will have to meet stricter requirements, regardless of whether they are housing pets for longer periods.
 These limitations have raised concerns in the industry with many boarders and sitters feeling the regulations do not take individual circumstances into account.
 “I work from home, and changing to commercial rates just isn’t worth it for me. If the regulations aren’t amended, I’ll have to close shop,” said one pet sitter, who wished to remain anonymous.
 Times of Malta is informed that a number of operators in the industry are thinking of quitting following the announcement of the regulations.
 The operators suggested that the regulations could be improved by basing them on childcare standards, which take into account the space available and the ratio of carers to animals. They believe this would allow for a more tailored approach, rather than a one-size-fits-all model.
 “If these amendments don’t happen, we’ll see a ripple effect outside the industry,” Meilaq warned.
 She explained that demand for these services is already high, and fewer boarders could lead to more abandoned pets.
 While the operators acknowledged a necessity for a standard they said they could be more sensible to account for the needs of the industry.
 Boarders and sitters must register within six months of June and will have a year to comply with the new regulations which stipulate, among others, that grooming establishments must have one individual who holds a certificate in animal first aid, install a CCTV system, and have a plan of action in the case of an emergency.
 Alicia Bugeja Said, the Parliamentary Secretary of Fisheries, Agriculture and Animals Rights, told Times of Malta the regulations were introduced to ensure the quality of service provided to pet owners and, more importantly, to safeguard the welfare of the animals in their care.
 With regard to the possibility of a rise in the market price and the repercussions of it, she said: “The government does not regulate the costs and has not imposed any fees related to the regulations but has simply set the necessary standards to ensure responsible care.”
 The parliamentary secretary said she understood the comparison with childcare centres but stressed that “the current regulations were designed with the specific needs and vulnerabilities of animals in mind after thorough consultations with various stakeholders, including the pet sitters and boarders.”

Patient data found in Żebbuġ street belonged to PL MP Katya Degiovanni,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/pl-mp-blames-bad-intent-scattered-confidential-data-i-know-rules.1102157,12-08-2024,004944.png,"Updated 1pm with additional comments from De Giovanni
 Labour MP and psychologist Katya De Giovanni has blamed “someone with bad intent” after sensitive and voter information she dumped in garbage bags ended up scattered on the streets of Żebbug.
 De Giovanni said she threw away the data in opaque envelopes in secured recycling bags and that someone must have rummaged through her garbage and scattered the confidential information on the streets. 
 On Thursday,  Times of Malta reported how the personal details of a long list of individuals, such as names, ID numbers and mobile phone numbers, were found in bags of documents.
 The Malta Rangers Unit said the documents detailed the names of persons a “particular individual” had been in contact with before the election.
 Times of Malta later confirmed that the individual was PL backbencher De Giovanni. 
 Some documents included issues that specific voters in her district were facing, such as “problems with rent”.
 Other documents included psychological evaluations of patients. Those documents included the name and date of birth of a patient alongside commentary on “depression”, “anxiety” and “vulnerability”.
 It is not yet known how the information ended up scattered, but it could have been the result of Wednesday’s heavy rains.
 The proper disposal of sensitive documents is mentioned in the EU’s data protection legislation and the Psychology Board’s code of ethics. 
 Article five of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) says personal data should be protected against “accidental loss, destruction or damage”. 
 Article 32 says the person handling sensitive data “shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk”. 
 Article eight of the Malta Psychology Profession Board code of ethics says psychologists must “take reasonable steps to preserve anonymity”.
 It adds: “This includes but is not limited to keeping their record in a safe place, establishing an appropriate time limit for record keeping and taking provisions for the disposal of their records if the need arises.” 
 Professionals in the field told Times of Malta such records are usually kept under lock and key for at least 10 years and then shredded or destroyed in confidence through other means.
 The cost of a basic home shredder hovers at around €40. 
 Contacted on Friday, De Giovanni insisted the secured recycling bags were put on the pavement by a family member for the waste disposal trucks to pick up as she was unwell on the day. 
 “It is very clear from the photos in your article that subsequent to this, someone with bad intent rummaged through the waste, opened the bags, displaced some of them and scattered confidential information on the streets.
 ""The moment we were made aware of waste being scattered on the floor, we made the necessary arrangements for the waste to be picked up from the streets immediately.""  
 She appealed for any CCTV footage to be shared so that “the full story is brought to light” and for the authorities to act against those who have opened litter bags, and scattered confidential information on the streets.
 “I have been a warranted psychologist since 2008 and supervisor for at least eight years having also chaired the psychology board. I know the rules very well. No one in their right mind would scatter records in that manner,” De Giovanni said. 
  
 Earlier this year, De Giovanni sued the University of Malta for ignoring her call to reverse its decision to deny her promotion to associate professor. She was elected to parliament in 2022.

 He was speaking after two policemen were assaulted after issuing a parking ticket in Hamrun on Saturday night.
  Speaking in a NET TV interview, the Opposition leader said he was “shocked” by what had happened and expressed solidarity with officers who encounter dangerous situations daily to keep society safe.
 “I am shocked whenever anyone raises his hand or his voice at the police, let alone when they hit them. This is what happens in a climate of impunity when there is a lack of respect towards one another and authority.”
  He said that what happened on Saturday was a clear example of what happened when people thought they were above the law.
 “Solidarity is not enough, we must build a system where people understand their place in society,” he said. 
 During the interview, Grech said the PN was ready to push the country forward, with the main priority being the people, not the economy.
  While the Labour Party was distracted by its internal difficulties, the PN had a ‘short, medium, and long-term’ plan for the country to move ahead and to provide stability. 
 Grech said it was clear that Prime Minister Robert Abela was losing control over his party, following the recent internal party elections. He was weak because he continued to make ‘u-turns’ and give in to pressure from those around him. 
 He also referred to a report in It- Torċa, and noted how the government was leaving people behind as it solely focused on the economy.
 He said the Labour government was one of ""champagne socialists"" because it had forgotten society's most vulnerable groups. 
 He also spoke about the recent biodiversity strategy published by the Environment Ministry, and said the government continued to publish strategies which were then “left on the shelf to gather dust”.
 “This is a government that continues to destroy our environment but promises to protect the biodiversity,” he said.
 He said that the majority of fines issued by the Environment and Resources Authority (ERA) for breaking laws were imposed on the government or its agencies.

Labour MEP files EU Ombudsman complaint about Metsola 'nepotism',timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/labour-mep-files-eu-ombudsman-complaint-metsola-nepotism.1097650,09-05-2024,005024.png,"Labour MEP Daniel Attard has filed a complaint to the EU Ombudsman about Roberta Metsola, accusing her of nepotism for appointing Matthew Tabone, her brother-in-law, as the head of her cabinet. 
 In a letter to European Ombudsman Emily O'Reilly, Attard said he has deep concerns that Tabone's appointment may constitute a ""significant breach"" of the high ethical standards the EP prides itself on holding. 
 Metsola, has increasingly come under fire in recent days after a scathing Politico report argued that the European Parliament's ethics rules that bind top officials to declaring their conflicts of interest apply to everybody  but Metsola herself. 
 Tabone's most recent appointment also triggered criticism of Metsola, with Labour MEP Alex Agius Saliba calling it flat out ""nepotism"". 
 In his letter, Attard referenced the fact that Metsola had already tried to make Tabone the head of her cabinet in 2022, but bowed to public scrutiny at the time. 
 ""It is profoundly troubling to observe that President Metsola, and as such the European Parliament, is once again embroiled in a situation that echoes past controversies,"" Attard said.
 ""Despite the previous scrutiny and the resultant reversal of her decision in 2022, it appears that this was only a temporary measure to appease her critics and she has now pressed on with this appointment, thereby undermining the commitment to ethical governance and transparency in the European Parliament.""
 Tabone joined the European Parliament in 2013 as head of Metsola's office. He later met her sister and married her in 2015.

"Malta given go ahead to pay out half a billion euros in state aid to films, TV",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/malta-given-go-ahead-fork-half-billion-euros-state-aid-films-tv.1096894,19-08-2024,005041.png,"Brussels has given Malta the green light to pay out twice as much money for films and television series as it was able to until now – which means as much as half a billion euros in funding over the next five years.
 The EU Commission approved a state aid package two months ago, allowing the Malta Film Commission to give a maximum of €100 million annually through the cash rebate scheme to production houses that choose to shoot their films or television series partly or entirely in Malta.
 The scheme – which has often proven controversial – has been approved till the end of October 2028, and the EU Commission has, this time, doubled the maximum allowable amount since its previous state aid approval in 2022.
 Furthermore, Brussels has approved a separate state aid package allowing the Maltese government to pay out another €10 million annually until 2026, just for reality shows and game shows.
 
 This does not mean the government will definitely be handing out that much money, rather it means this is the maximum amount it can pay before it breaches EU state aid law.
 The EU limits the degree to which member states can inject money into private companies to preserve a level playing field for businesses across the Union.
 The ceiling approved in the previous package was €50 million annually for 2022 and 2023.
 According to publicly available figures on the EU Commission’s state aid website, the Malta Film Commission promised over €29 million in cash rebates to various productions in 2022 and over €69 million in 2023.
 The money is given as part of a generous cash rebate scheme to attract production houses to shoot their films or TV series in Malta.
 The government gives them up to 40 per cent cashback on almost their entire expenditure while they work in Malta, including on cast and crew salaries and rentals of any equipment from outside Malta.
 Large productions get hundreds of thousands, and sometimes millions of euros back. Last year, Times of Malta  revealed that the Gladiator sequel had broken an all-time rebate record when it secured a whopping €47 million in taxpayer money for filming in Malta.
 Since then, no other details of any other cash rebates granted to productions have been made public.
 In total, Malta has green-lighted more than €143 million for 54 films and television series over the past six years.
 Meanwhile, the government’s allocation for local productions has been capped at just one million euros annually until 2026, following which the government will have to ask for approval again to help its local productions or increase the grants.
 This is largely why the scheme has been controversial.
 Local film-makers have long complained that the local industry has been sidelined. Industry insiders say the generous rebate is good while it lasts but fear it is too much strain on the Maltese taxpayer and could be unsustainable.
 The government and the Malta Film Commission strongly disagree.
 They say the scheme is significantly growing the film industry by attracting top Hollywood productions, which in turn inject millions more into the Maltese economy through the hospitality industry and services sectors, create hundreds of jobs for Maltese talent as well as boosting tourism.
 In a reply to questions, the Film Commission said it was not fair to frame the scheme as a “strain” on taxpayers, as economic studies show the return on investment on the rebate has been consistently strong for as long as it has existed.
 “Independent economic analysis has consistently demonstrated a positive financial impact, and the success of similar initiatives across Europe reinforces this. In these jurisdictions, these initiatives are not only welcomed but they are celebrated for driving investment and fostering industry development,” a spokes­person for the Film Commission said.
 “The framing of this issue as a burden to the taxpayer appears to align with specific political rhetoric, which we believe detracts from an objective, fact-based analysis. We stand by the facts.”
 Asked to say whether it intends to hand out the maximum amount allowed by the EU, the Film Commission said that amount only “represents a ceiling, not an annual income”.
 “It’s crucial to note that in previous record-setting years, this threshold has not been met due to tangible limitations such as the availability of skilled crew and infrastructure capacity,” the spokesperson said, adding that all grants will be publicly listed and accessible online.
 “Similar initiatives, also approved by the EU Commission, have been implemented across Europe, further highlighting the importance of such schemes in supporting and sustaining the film industry.
 “We remain committed to attracting world-class productions that bring value to the economy, for the ultimate benefit of the industry and its workforce.”
 The Malta Film Commission spending has been largely shrouded in mystery.
 It has repeatedly refused to say how much taxpayer money it spends on lavish events like the Malta Film Awards and the Mediterrane Film Festival, and when pushed to do so it only says the spend – however big – is an investment in a better and stronger industry.
 Last year it also published a study claiming that for every euro invested in the industry, the country gets back three times as much. Times of Malta has so far been unable to independently confirm how that conclusion was reached.

"'AG, police commissioner should resign over Vitals case blunders'",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/ag-police-commissioner-resign-vitals-blunders-repubblika.1093207,30-05-2024,005047.png,"Updated 12.10pm with Agius statement
 The Attorney General and Police Commissioner should resign after “undermining” criminal proceedings in connection with the Vitals inquiry, civil society group Repubblika said on Thursday. 
 Citing procedural mistakes during the arraignment of Chris Fearne,  Edward Scicluna and others on Wednesday, honorary president Robert Aquilina said there was a very real fear proceedings could be declared null. 
 In a marathon 11-hour session in court, it was revealed that the prosecution was relying on the magisterial inquiry to lead the proceedings and there was no police investigation to back its findings. 
 It also transpired that one of the defendants representing DF Advocates, which had been charged in connection with the scandal, had not been notified of the proceedings. 
 While the circumstances of the case remain up in the air, Aquilina said the possibility of proceedings being nullified is of “great concern” and said that these “preventable mistakes” could have been avoided had AG Victoria Buttgiegieg and Police Commissioner Angelo Gafa not ""abdicated their responsibilities"". 
 “This has happened because the circumstances for them to happen were made possible,” Aquilina said. 
 He said that the logistics dictating the way the accused were being charged did not make sense, as with the sheer number of people accused, there was simply no adequate infrastructure in court to have all of them appear in the same sitting. 
 They should have been charged in batches of three to five people, with similar charges grouped accordingly, such as having politicians and permanent secretaries appear separately. 
 If this was not possible, and all the accused must be charged together, Aquilina said arrangements should have been made, even perhaps by legal notice, to find an appropriate venue to hold the sitting outside the court building in Valletta. 
 “The act of having so many people in an inadequate place is an act of sabotage on the proceedings,” he said, adding that this has led to excessively long sessions, which has even prompted the Chamber of Advocates to issue a directive to its members not to work after 10pm. 
 While Repubblika has faith in the prosecutors and public officials leading the case, it is a glaring omission that Buttigieg and Gafa were not in court in person to throw their weight behind the proceedings, he added.
 “By not being here they are undermining the prosecution and leaving [the public officials] by themselves,” Aquilina said. 
 “This is happening after years of undermining the police force and the office of the attorney general. There has been a brain drain in these two offices that past commissioners - but especially Gafa and Buttigieg - must answer for.” 
 He said that years of staff shortages and inadequate resources have brought these institutions to a place where they can no longer function properly. This clearly showed that Gafa and Buttigieg were not fit to hold the positions they did, he added. 
 Gafa has also continually failed to conduct his own investigation into the hospitals deal, despite ample evidence of corruption emerging through journalists over the years. Buttigieg and Gafa must resign in order to ensure that people in their respective institutions can continue to do their jobs properly, Aquilina said.
 Agius writes to European Commission
 Meanwhile, PN MEP candidate Peter Agius has urged the European Commission to provide solid support for the Maltese judiciary.
 ""We need more effective measures to ensure the judiciary in Malta is supported by public authorities in the collection of evidence on investigations of corruption cases. This is in the interest of Maltese and Gozitans who have been defrauded by corrupt politicians at the expense of patients and vulnerable people,"" Agius said in a letter sent to Věra Jourová, European Commission Vice-President for Values and Transparency.
 Agius referred to the European Commission's 2024 report on the Rule of Law, which will be released in a few weeks, saying that while the government has sent its submissions for this report, he is convinced that the Maltese Government is hiding the real picture in Malta.
 Citing page 1,004 of the inquiry report, Agius showed how, in cases of corruption, fraud, bribery, and money laundering involving politicians, the government authorities refused to give access to documents to the magistrate.

"Four former PN Gozitan mayors to stand as PL, independent candidates",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/four-former-pn-gozitan-mayors-turn-pl-independent.1091807,05-02-2024,005134.png,"In Gozo, three former Nationalist mayors and a sitting PN mayor are seeking re-election in the upcoming local council elections... but not on the PN ticket. Mark Laurence Zammit reports.
 Former Nationalist mayor Daniel Attard will be contesting the local council election on the Labour Party ticket in June.
 Attard, who is the mayor of Għasri, had made headlines when he publicly resigned from the PN in the heat of the 2022 general election, a day after sharing an image of himself meeting Prime Minister Robert Abela during a campaign visit to the Gozo village.
 He had also addressed a PL election rally and stayed on as an independent mayor since then, causing the PN to lose its majority in the locality. 
 In comments to Times of Malta, Attard said he was never close to the heart of PN’s power and wanted to be mayor for the people and his home town, rather than for the party. But several factors over the past years pushed him even further away from the PN. 
 He said he could not accept how the party would not stop its candidates from from foul mouthing Malta in EU institutions, and when he voiced his concern about it internally, he was sidelined. 
 “On the other hand, when I was PN mayor, the PL opened its doors to me and welcomed me. They worked with me and we completed big projects for our village,” he said. 
 “The PL is not perfect because it is made of people who make mistakes, like I sometimes do. But at least they do not try to give the impression that they are perfect because perfection is only a fantasy.”
 He said in the PL he found people committed to helping others - something that resonated with his principles and eventually drove him to contest on Labour’s ticket.
 Another former PN Gozitan mayor will also contest June’s election on Labour’s ticket.
 Nicky Saliba was the Nationalist mayor of Żebbuġ up until 2019, when he decided to seek re-election as an independent.
 He served as an independent mayor until January 2022, when he stepped down and passed on the leadership of the council to a PL mayor.
 “So, I can tell you that when I decided to seek re-election this time round, I naturally felt I should contest with the PL,” he said when contacted for comment.
 He said he had first chosen to switch to an independent because he felt his Nationalist colleagues were hindering his work.
 That is why he felt he should vote for the council to be handed to the PL when he stepped down from his role as mayor and that is why it felt “natural” that he joins the PL coming June.
 Meanwhile, Fontana mayor Saviour Borg might not have swung as far but he has also left the PN to seek re-election as an independent.
 Borg, who currently serves as Fontana’s PN mayor, told Times of Malta the party did not ask him to contest on its ticket again, but he felt he could still contribute to his locality, so he decided to seek re-election as an independent.
 He said another PN councillor was also not asked to contest.
 Questions sent to the PN about this remained unanswered.
 Għarb’s David Apap, on the other hand, was PN mayor till 2019, when he first contested as an independent.
 He has chosen to seek re-election as an independent again in June.
 Apap had not responded to a request for comment by the time of writing.
 Similarly, last year, the PL lost one of its most outspoken mayors – Gżira’s Conrad Borg Manchè – who quit Labour in October, saying he has had enough of his party.
 He did not, however, sway as far as to join the PN but will contest both the local council and the MEP elections as an independent.

The Labour Party cannot be ‘used’ for compromises with the truth - Abela,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/the-labour-party-cannot-used-compromises-truth-abela.1093782,06-10-2024,005171.png,"The Labour Party cannot be ""used"" for compromises with the truth, Robert Abela declared repeatedly on Monday in an interview on One TV.
 Reacting to the European Parliament election results which saw his party win with a sharply reduced majority, the prime minister promised reforms within the Labour Party and the government and major policy decisions which ""will be guided solely by the truth, without compromise"".
 He also warned people down the government structure that they could not expect a cushy job. He also warned those who were not serving the people in their legitimate pleas to ""move on"" before the decision was made for them.
  The people, Abela said, had expressed confidence in the Labour government, but also called for change, for a new version.
 He promised he would be ""authentic"" in what he said and did, without fear of possibly disturbing some ""small faction"".
 The government, he said, had improved living standards and as a result, the people’s expectations had been raised. The government was determined to continue to reach those expectations.  
 Tough decisions that had been pending for years needed to be taken, he said, citing in particular the construction sector and its impact on people’s lives and the environment, as well as other areas such as population, foreign workers and others.
 “The overarching principle of our decisions needs to be to defend the truth and not to compromise, and everyone knows what we mean,” he said.  
 Abela also insisted that the government in all its structures needed to be sensitive to justified and legitimate pleas by the people.
 “We have the commitment and ability to reform and stay humble and in tune with people’s realities,"" he said.
 Asked about the purpose of a meeting later on Monday of Labour’s executive and parliamentary group, he said its purpose was to chart the future for the party and the government. It was not a matter of taking a vote of confidence.
 That, he said, was requested by those who wanted to extend their presence artificially, insisting he was not ""glued"" to his chair. He still had his profession and when he felt his time was up, he would be the one to decide to go, he said.

Watch: 'Lies' about Stephen Mangion's death stoked anger towards hospital staff,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/watch-lies-stephen-mangion-death-stoked-anger-towards-hospital-staff.1097887,09-10-2024,005193.png,"Politicians and influential people who used the death of Stephen Mangion to stoke anger towards hospital staff should be held responsible for their actions, Health Minister JoEtienne Abela said on Tuesday.
 In a press conference held after a magisterial inquiry concluded that the medical staff who treated Mangion were clear of any wrongdoing, Abela said that these professionals had faced a barrage of public anger when they had done all they could to save his life. 
 Those people who ""rode on the bandwagon"" of this ""lie"" must shoulder responsibility, the minister said, because their narratives led to people insulting medical professionals on social media and even at the emergency department in past weeks.
 Mangion, a 55-year-old Valletta resident and a former police officer, collapsed and died at the Mater Dei hospital emergency waiting room last month. 
 His sudden death sparked outrage on social media with claims that he had waited for hours despite reporting chest pains, first at the Floriana health centre and later at Mater Dei Hospital.
 However, this inquiry concluded that he died from an aortic dissection and that while he had first experienced symptoms at 4 am, he delayed seeking medical attention by 15 hours. 
 “Some people used his death for their benefit. I never thought this country would stoop so low. I never thought we would come to this,” Abela said.
 “Why were opposition MPs fomenting people’s anger against the very people who are taking care of their health? Who will shoulder responsibility?”
  When asked by Times of Malta to name those whom he thought should be held responsible, he would not say. 
 Prompted with the names of Jason Azzopardi, Adrian Delia, Bernard Grech and Ian Vassallo Hagi, he stopped short of confirming his words were directed to them.
 ""Don't you think they should shoulder responsibility?"" he said.
 “An apology would be a start,” he added.
 The inquiry, which was published on Tuesday on magistrate Joe Mifsud's advice, concluded doctors and nurses who attended to Mangion did nothing wrong and are not liable for criminal prosecution.
 It revealed the victim had not been taking his prescribed medication for high blood pressure, that he delayed seeking medical help for 15 hours from the time he started feeling pain, and that he refused repeated advice from family and friends to go to the Floriana health centre.
 It also found healthcare professionals in Floriana and at Mater Dei carried out three ECG tests on Mangion, none of which indicated he was suffering from a heart attack.
 “Some comments on social media accused healthcare workers of manslaughter and lambasted them with accusations that they didn’t care if they killed people and that the healthcare system is drowning,” Abela said.
 “Why did some people use a person’s natural death to destroy the morale of our workers at a health pillar such as the emergency department?”
 He called for people and the media to be constructive when criticising the healthcare system and insisted the government is doing everything it can to fix its problems.
 He said he was also prepared to publish a ministerial inquiry he had ordered into the same case. That inquiry is still ongoing and is investigating whether the healthcare systems need upgrading to avoid deaths of this sort.
 The magisterial inquiry did not find hospital workers to be criminally responsible for Mangion’s death, but it does detail how the third and final ECG was carried out at 8.30pm that night.
 Although it did not find signs of a heart attack, following that test Mangion spent almost two more hours in the waiting room, during which he complained to nurses that the pain was intensifying, before eventually collapsing at around 10.20pm.
 Times of Malta asked Abela whether he believed Mangion should have been given more attention during those final two hours, especially because he was complaining of intensifying pain.
 “I would be lying if I told you I don’t have an opinion about that, but that’s a diagnostical medical process – the kind of process the ministerial inquiry is looking into. For now, I’ll only keep with the conclusions of the magisterial inquiry which found there was no criminal wrongdoing. I think I’m being clear enough,” he said.
 Abela also said 40 new nurses – all of whom studied and got their qualifications in Malta – started working at the emergency department as of Tuesday. He said a further number of new doctors will join them soon as part of efforts to make the department more efficient and reduce waiting hours.
 He also reiterated his plans to turn around the triaging system so that patients who go to Mater Dei’s emergency department are first examined by a consultant. 
 He has wanted to implement that system since becoming minister in January, he said, but the medical doctors association has so far resisted it, even though the government is prepared to pay extra for it.
 “We want a decision-maker to examine patients immediately so that we make the process quicker. But there was resistance from the MAM,” he said.
 Abela made his discontent with the association very clear, saying it has lately been blocking most of the ideas, initiatives and system overhauls that he believes will streamline healthcare services and make better use of human resources.

Watch: Bernard Grech backs Toni Bezzina as he slams Labour 'smear',timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/watch-bernard-grech-backs-toni-bezzina-slams-labour-smear.1101288,20-11-2024,005218.png,"Bernard Grech has said he has ""absolute trust"" in Toni Bezzina, after Prime Minister Robert Abela claimed that the PN MP does not show up for work at his government job. 
 ""I have complete trust, they have assured me that they do their work as they should,"" Opposition leader Grech said when asked about Bezzina.
 Grech said it was clear this was another deviation tactic by the Labour government and in the mould of similar, previous smears made against fellow PN MP Karol Aquilina and former MP and minister Giovanna Debono. 
 ""It is clear that when Labour finds itself with its back to the wall, it tries to distract attention by smearing others,"" he said.
 Labour raised questions about Bezzina and his work attendance as it fought back against a scandal involving two members of Robert Abela's cabinet, tourism minister Clayton Bartolo and Gozo minister Clint Camilleri.
 Both are facing pressure to resign after the commissioner for standards in public life concluded that they had abused their power when they gave Batolo's then-girlfriend (now wife) a highly paid consultancy job. 
  The Nationalist Party's call for the two ministers' resignations have been particularly loud. 
 In a Sunday Times of Malta interview last week, the prime minister alleged that Bezzina was pocketing a state salary without doing the work. 
 ""Toni Bezzina is employed with the Public Works Department and receives an annual salary of €51,000. Yet, consistently, he fails to attend his workplace and provides no service,"" Abela said. 
 Former OPM official Neville Gafa' has also filed a complaint to the Standards Commissioner on Bezzina and other PN MPs who hold public sector jobs. 
  Speaking on Wednesday evening, Grech said he had full confidence in his MPs. 
 ""There are opposition MPs who work in the private sector, and others who work in the public sector. All have their own arrangements and they all tell me that they fulfill their work obligations,"" he said. 
 ""Let’s say it was true,"" Grech said of the accusations. ""Why didn’t the government take disciplinary action? After all, it is Labour ministers who lead the public entities where these MPs work."" 
 ""That shows that they are only doing this to deviate attention,"" he said. ""They want to imply that all politicians and parties are the same. And it’s not the case.""
 Grech said he would not speculate on what he would do if standards probes into Bezzina and other PN MPs employed with the state were to find them in breach.
 “The only thing I know for sure is that the standards commissioner found that both Clayton Bartolo and Clint Camilleri breached ethics. I expect the standards committee’s Labour members to vote to approve the report.”
 The committee is due to meet on Thursday afternoon at 4pm to discuss the report into Bartolo and Camilleri's abuse of power.

Bolt says it lost fifth of drivers due to rejection of work permits,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/bolt-says-lost-fifth-drivers-due-rejection-work-permits.1096323,08-05-2024,005220.png,"Bolt said on Monday its cab fares 'automatically' increased after it lost a fifth of its drivers when renewals and applications for new work permits were rejected. 
 The spikes also came about due to increased demand by service users, while a number of drivers were leaving the industry of their own free will, a spokesperson told Times of Malta. 
 Last month the government said new applications - or attempts to change employer - by third-country nationals for cab driving and food courier work permits were being turned down because the market had ""reached saturation"".
 Soon after, service users complained that Bolt's cab fares and waiting times had increased. In response, the ride-hailing platform claimed that the prices increased because of the government's clampdown on work permits.
 But Employment Minister Byron Camilleri immediately warned cab operators to stop inflating prices in an attempt to continue with their practice of importing workers ""haphazardly"".
 This tactic, introduced just days after the government imposed certain limitations, failed to make sense, he said last week.
 Reacting, Bolt on Monday refuted ""concerning allegations"" that it had intervened to increase waiting times and pricing mechanisms as some sort of retaliation.
 It said in a statement that like other platforms in the industry, Bolt used 'automated surge pricing' that matched customers’ demand with drivers’ supply, to make sure that the service worked properly. This meant drivers were incentivised - through higher earnings - to service high-demand locations at specific hours, preventing long wait times for customers.
 While higher prices due to higher customer demand during tourist peak season are common, over the past week, Bolt's average ride prices were approximately 10% higher compared to the same period in 2023.
 ""This was due to a 19% decrease in the number of available drivers on our platform linked to the rejection of temporary work permits of hundreds of drivers, as reported in the media.
 ""This is further compounded by an endemic 7.9% average turnover of personnel a month within the transport industry, according to Central Bank of Malta statistics.
 ""Conversely, demand for rides has increased by 23%, which is higher than what we have historically seen at this time of year. These dynamics have led to more frequent price spikes,"" Bolt said.
 The spikes in prices and the impacted waiting times observed over the past few days were therefore linked to increased customer demand and a shortage of drivers, it added in the statement.
 When asked for clarification, a spokesperson said the 19% drop was the result of a combination of rejections not just of new applications, but also renewals of work permits.
 Bolt has additionally received reports that drivers' temporary permits have been revoked while others are proactively leaving the industry because of concern about their future employment opportunities, the spokesperson added.
 Bolt also announced that throughout the past seven months, it had ended collaboration with 28 fleets that were not up to standard.
 Last month, minister Camilleri warned that companies accused of exploiting food couriers would be barred from hiring workers until investigations into exploitation claims were carried out.
 On Monday, Bolt said its goal was to provide a reliable and affordable electronic platform where transportation services were made available to passengers while ensuring fairness for those who formed part of the marketplace.
 ""In 2024, Bolt ended collaboration with 28 fleets that did not meet Bolt’s standard of engagement.
 ""Bolt will continue to terminate its agreements with any fleet or individual operators if they are found to be in breach of the law or are involved in any kind of malpractice in breach of their contract.
 Our team regularly engages with fleet operators to champion fair and transparent work conditions and is committed to doing more to ensure that all fleet operators using the Bolt platform uphold the highest legal and ethical standards, addressing drivers’ and couriers’ concerns,"" Bolt added.
 Bolt said since it started operating in Malta in 2015, it has provided earning opportunities to thousands of drivers and couriers, and over 1,400 restaurant partners. 
 In 2023 it invested more than €25 million in the Maltese economy, it added.

Roberta Metsola gets 100% of vote as EPP candidate for parliament president,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/roberta-metsola-gets-100-vote-epp-candidate-parliament-president.1094176,19-06-2024,005285.png,"Roberta Metsola has been officially nominated as the EPP Group’s candidate for President of the European Parliament.
 Metsola was the group’s unanimous choice and obtained 100% of votes cast by EPP MEPs in a closed meeting, sources said.
 The vote confirms Metsola’s assertion, made last week in a Times of Malta interview, that she had secured enough support to be the grouping’s nominee.
  The EPP, or European People’s Party, is the European Parliament’s largest political grouping, with 188 elected MEPs. It emerged even stronger from this month’s EU-wide European Parliament elections, increasing its vote share while seeing that of its main rivals, the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats, fall.
 Metsola spoke with pride following the vote.
 “Running to be your candidate for re-election as President of the European Parliament is a responsibility that I take seriously; that I understand is a decision that weighs heavily on all of us,” she told EPP MEPs.
 “I am proud to be a politician. I am proud to be an unashamedly pro-European, MEP. I am incredibly proud to represent you as President. For a girl who grew up on an island in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea, it is the privilege of a lifetime.”
 Having secured her grouping’s backing, Metsola must now win the backing of a majority of MEPs in the European Parliament to secure a second term as president.
 If she succeeds, she will become only the second MEP in history to serve as EP president for two terms, and the first woman to do so.
 Metsola was first elected EP President in January 2022, following the shock death of the previous president, Davide Sassoli. Within weeks of assuming the key role, Europe was plunged into crisis as Russia invaded Ukraine. 
 The European Parliament faced further trouble later that year when a Belgian police investigation revealed indications that the governments of Qatar, Morocco and Mauritania had funnelled cash to MEPs, lobbyists and their families.  
 That scandal, dubbed Qatargate, prompted Metsola to suspend all European Parliament work with Qatar. In September 2023 the European Parliament introduced new codes of conduct for MEPs. 
 Metsola was reelected as an MEP in this month's elections, winning more votes than any other candidate in Maltese MEP electoral history.

 Gouder, the chief operations officer of the PN’s media arm and a former MP, was found dead in Valletta on Tuesday morning. He was 45 years old.
 Gouder played a pivotal role in organising the party’s campaign for the 2024 MEP and local council elections, and had announced his interest in the PN’s general secretary post just days before his death. 
 Known for his upbeat and jovial character, he was previously mayor of St Julian’s and also served as a PN MP for six years across three legislatures. 
  Hundreds of people attended the funeral, including President Myriam Spiteri Debono and former president Marie Louise Colerio Preca, Prime Minister Robert Abela and his wife Lydia, Opposition leader Bernard Grech and his wife AnneMarie. The speaker of the House, Anġlu Farrugia, also attended the funeral.
 There were also numerous PN MP members and members of the PN media present to pay their final farewell to Gouder, including former PN leaders Lawrence Gonzi, Adrian Delia and Simon Busuttil. European Parliament president Roberta Metsola also attended the funeral. 
  Many others watched the funeral live on NET FM.
 As his casket was carried into the parish church by family members and PN members, namely Piccinino and PN deputy leader Alex Perici Calascione, the winning singer of the Konkors Kanzunetta Indipendenza, Karei, sang her winning song “ Nistħajlek Hawn’, as a tribute to Gouder.
 Gouder had handed out prizes at the competition on Sunday, two days before his death. 
 In his homily, Mgr Claude Portelli described Gouder as a person full of unity and love who was known to always lend a helping hand to others. 
 He recalled how in the Gospel, Jesus told people to not be confused by their emotions. 
 “Lord we are trying, but how can we not be confused,"" said an emotional Portelli, a personal friend of Gouder.  
 ""How can we not be confused when there are so many questions that have passed through our minds since Karl’s death? How many times we thought we could have been more aware, more present... for those who knew Karl, we all find ourselves lost.”
  He recalls how Karl’s father, Frans, told him that if it were not for his faith, these situations would be more difficult. 
 He said throughout his life, Karl worked to unite people together and he said he continues to do so even after his death. 
 “Karl’s death has united us, regardless of beliefs or politics,” he said.
 He went on to praise Gouder as a “humble man” and one who constantly encouraged others and was always ready to help others. 
 Portelli also shared anecdotes from Gouder reaching out to him when he was given new responsibilities. 
 “Kuraġġ, you can make it,' he recalled Gouder telling him. ""That was Karl.”
 Portelli also took a moment to address the politicians and urged them to address Malta’s mental health crisis, which he described as a “plague affecting our society”. He also encouraged them not to neglect their mental health. 
 
 “Many times we see hateful comments on social media trying to break a person. We must take care of one another. We said this so much during the pandemic, but as our lives have become more hectic and frantic, we have forgotten how important it is.”
 He also thanked Gouder's parents for raising their children with beautiful and strong values that “moulded” Karl into the man they knew and loved.
 “Thank you, Karl, thank you kapo,” he concluded. 
 “Karl used to say ‘life goes on’, and we will try to continue this journey, but it will be difficult kapo.”
  Following the mass, the funeral procession passed by several locations that symbolised Gouder's life and the many services he performed throughout his life. 
 These include places in St Julian's, where he served as mayor and the PN Headquarters (Dar Ċentrali) where the party leadership, PN staff and NET Media employees gathered to honour him.
  Throughout the week, numerous tributes for Gouder were shared, and many more came on Saturday ahead of the funeral. 
 European Parliament President Roberta Metsola recalled fond memories of growing up with Gouder, and recalled how they were born “four months apart” and their families lived a few roads away from each other. 
 “We laughed, we fought, we cried, we hugged, all our lives. In June, I was with him in the counting hall as the result of the European Parliament election filtered through. He was so proud of what we achieved, of how far we’d come,” she said.
  Former PN leader and MP Adrian Delia also paid tribute to Gouder. 
 ""Rest, you peaceful soul, you gentle soul who left so soon, whilst we take time to grieve and cry but nigh forget.”
 “It is with an unspeakable sadness that we have to now face the future without him""
 Former PN communications director Alessandro Farrugia also took to social media to share memories of Gouder. 
 “He taught us how important it is for us to not focus on destroying one another. In politics, between friends, in the workplace and family. We are all people, whatever our background or where we come from.”
  He called for the St Julian’s local council and mayor Guido Dalli to name a street in Karl’s memory.

ADPD leader Sandra Gauci: I was too timid in run-up to MEP elections,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/adpd-leader-sandra-gauci-i-timid-runup-mep-elections.1094037,22-06-2024,005310.png,"The leader of Malta’s green party believes her leadership was “too timid” in the lead-up to the elections.
 Reflecting on the recent MEP and local council election results, ADPD leader Sandra Gauci told Times of Malta she believed her leadership should have left more of an “imprint” on the campaign.
 Gauci also said ADPD could have “packaged” its stance on migration differently and conceded there was a “problem with foreigners and overpopulation”.
 And while stressing that the party’s two seats in the local council elections was “significant”, she reiterated her intention to rebrand ADPD, saying the party needed to “rethink everything”.
 ADPD fared slightly better in the local council elections than it did in the MEP contest, winning seats in St Paul’s Bay and Attard. 
 While she was unhappy the party didn’t gain more representation, it was a good start, she said.
 “I inherited a party with zero seats, so going from zero to two is significant,” she said.
 On the failure to win more votes, Gauci said she took “full responsibility” but was “still learning” after only one year as leader.
  “My mistake as leader was not giving the campaign my imprint as much as was needed... I admit my leadership was too timid.”
 But with controversial far-right firebrand Norman Lowell receiving double the first count votes of ADPD in the MEP elections, is she concerned the party’s policies don’t match the priorities of voters?
 “I’m not happy about it, but let’s stop giving him importance. He got more votes than us, but it doesn’t mean we [ADPD] shouldn’t be there,” she said.
 However, Gauci said she believed Malta had “lost control” of immigration, describing the country as having a “sense of claustrophobia”.
 “There is a problem with foreigners and overpopulation, which maybe ADPD didn’t tackle that properly... we need to package that better,” she said. 
 “The country has lost control of immigration, with lots of foreigners coming and going,” said Gauci, adding the government was sending mixed messages to foreign workers.
 “They bring in Y-plate drivers then restrict them, bring in construction workers then introduce licensing, bring in tourism workers then introduce the skills card... There’s no plan.”
 In the lead-up to the elections, Gauci told an audience at an MEP candidates debate that while “we can’t ridicule or demean” migrants who came to Malta to work, the haphazard manner in which people were brought to Malta was “a mistake” and “increasing the population by 120,000 in five years is a shock”.

European Commission cabinet announcement delayed,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/european-commission-cabinet-announcement-delayed.1097866,09-10-2024,"005313.png,005314.png","European Commissioner President Ursula von der Leyen is delaying the announcement of the Commission’s new cabinet, amidst an ongoing struggle to appoint a gender-balanced commission, according to a Politico report published on Tuesday.
 Von der Leyen was scheduled to meet the leaders of the European Parliament’s different groupings on Wednesday. A public announcement effectively handing out portfolios to each country’s European Commissioner nominee was expected shortly afterwards.
 The nominees would then undergo grilling by the European Parliament before being confirmed in their role.
 But, according to Politico, the announcement has been pushed back to next week to allow Slovenia to confirm their nomination of former ambassador Marta Kos.
 Von der Leyen is known to have made a gender-balanced commission one of her key goals for the upcoming legislature, asking countries to nominate both a man and a woman to the role when selecting their nominees.
 However, most countries ignored her request, with only Bulgaria submitting two names, meaning that two-thirds of the names proposed across the bloc were men.
 Von der Leyen is believed to have been exerting pressure on several countries to switch out their male nominee for a woman, with mixed results.
 Malta’s nominee, Glenn Micallef, has found himself caught up in the turbulence, with von der Leyen reportedly asking Malta to withdraw his nomination and propose a woman in his stead.
 Micallef’s lack of political experience is believed to have complicated matters and placed him in the firing line.
  Sources in Brussels suggested that von der Leyen was eyeing a second term for sitting commissioner Helena Dalli, a move that the government is believed to view with reluctance.
 Both Micallef and the government have remained tight-lipped in recent weeks, only saying that talks are taking place.

Planning Authority acts like it is above the law - PN,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/planning-authority-acts-like-law-pn.1096949,20-08-2024,005339.png,"The government has divested the Planning Authority of all decency and has left it toothless to make quality planning decisions, the Nationalist Party said on Tuesday. 
 Shadow ministers Stanley Zammit, Rebekah Borg and Julie Zahra said the PA has been transformed into a ""Permits Authority"" that has reached a level of arrogance in which it feels as if it is above the law. 
 Such is the case, they said, that the PA breaks the law, ignores the Ombudsman, humiliates other entities like the Superintendence of Cultural Heritage, goes against the advice of its own experts and even defies sentences meted out by the Maltese courts, which have declared certain developments illegal, absurd and that breach the PA's own policies. 
 The Labour government has dismantled from the PA the capacity and competence necessary to make quality decisions, they said and remains complacent in the face of bad decisions and actions which go against court judgements. 
 ""This situation is fertile ground for corruption and for those who are most powerful to continue sowing,"" they said. 
 Robert Abela's government, they continued, is placating with empty promises and a lack of action that confirm that atrocities happening in development, promotes a culture of sanctioning that allows those who abuse the system to enjoy the fruit of their labour through simply paying a fine. 
 ""The solution to these planning and environmental atrocities is a change in the country's leadership, leadership that talks less and acts more and doesn't resort to changes in half measures that only leads to a bureaucratic system that rewards the powerful and punishes the weak,"" they said. 
 The PN, they continued, will continue to do everything in its power so that people can fight the unjust systems and policies by making the environment a fundamental right for all. 
 ""We need serious, transparent and consistent decisions that inspire trust and put people's minds at ease,"" they said.

 Data provided to the NSO by Jobsplus shows that, over a period of one year, the labour supply (excluding part-timers) increased by 7.2 per cent, reaching 285,537. This was mainly attributed to a year-on-year increase in the full-time registered employment (19,287) and a decrease in registered unemployment (15). 
 During January 2024, Accommodation and food service activities and Administrative and support service activities contributed most to the increase in full-time employment, when compared to January 2023. Registered full-time employment in the private sector went up by 18,284 persons to 232,490. Public sector full-time employment increased by 1,003 persons to 51,990. 
 The number of persons registered as full-time self-employed rose by 804 when compared to January 2023, while the number of persons registered as employees increased by 18,483. Full-time employment for men and women went up by 7.5 per cent and 6.9 per cent, respectively over 2023 levels.

PN hits out at government decision to deport Ethiopians who contributed to Malta,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/pn-hits-government-decision-deport-ethiopians-contributed-malta.1097210,25-08-2024,005348.png,"The government should make an exception for an Ethiopian community who face deportation, considering the group has integrated into society and contributed to the economy, the Nationalist Party said. 
 The statement came after Times of Malta reported how the Ethiopian community is “in shock” and “living in fear” as dozens of people, who have been living and working legally in Malta for up to 19 years, are being arrested. They are then sent to detention and told they will be sent back to Ethiopia. 
 The Home Affairs Ministry said persons arriving in Malta irregularly who do not qualify for international protection are offered a voluntary return package.
 In a statement, Home Affairs shadow minister Darren Carabott slammed the government's decision and said it should make an exception for the ""20"" Ethiopian nationals facing deportation. 
 He said an exception should be made for them after the significant time they have spent in Malta, where they have integrated into society, started families and contributed to the economy. 
 Carbott acknowledged the individuals initially entered Malta illegally, but insisted that the lengthy delay in processing their application for international protection warrants special consideration. 
 He criticised the government’s handling of immigration, describing it as inconsistent and contradictory. 
 “While the government has issued residence permits to thousands of individuals from third countries over the past decade, it is now moving to deport long-term residents who have integrated into Maltese society,"" he said.
 Carabott also highlighted the need for the government to invest in improving the processing of international protection applications, to prevent similar cases from occurring in the future. 
 “The situation reflects a broader failure in the country’s immigration system, where the lengthy wait times for decisions on refugee status are a key issue,"" he said.
 He underscored the importance of a humane and fair approach to immigration, particularly in cases where individuals have established deep roots in the country. 
 He urged the government to adopt a new economic model focused on quality over quantity, criticising the current approach as unsustainable and poorly planned.

 In an interview on NET TV, Grech said the prime minister’s attempts to sweep the scandal under the carpet would fail.
 A probe by the Standards Commissioner found the tourism minister together with Gozo minister Clint Camilleri abused their power and violated ministerial ethics by securing a lucrative public position for Bartolo’s wife, Amanda Muscat.
 Muscat was paid as a top consultant while continuing to do secretarial work, the commissioner concluded. 
 Bartolo has apologised for the scandal but denies breaking any rules. Camilleri has said he did everything by the book. 
 Abela has ruled out sacking the ministers.
 Speaking ahead of a PN protest outside parliament on Monday, Grech urged people to turn up in droves to show the prime minister that the situation is not acceptable.
 “We have to show them ‘sorry’ is not enough,” Grech said.
 Grech contrasted Abela's response to this scandal with how former cabinet members Justyne Caruana and  Rosianne Cutajar were both sacked on the back of reports by the Standards Commissioner.
 The Opposition leader said Abela only seems to throw his weight around when women are involved.
  In this case, because they are men, the prime minister did not act, Grech accused.
 Grech pledged that a PN government would do things differently.
 He said a PN government, unlike Labour, would have its heart in the right place.
 “No one will be given jobs they are not qualified for. That is how bad decisions are taken, when you place people who are not qualified in these roles.”
 Grech said a PN government will ensure the rules apply to everyone. Thus, everyone will have an equal chance at success, Grech said.
 On the traffic jams caused by the Sigma conference, Grech said it is the government that should be blamed, not the organisers.
 He said the lack of planning and investment has now driven Sigma away, as their main conference next year will be held in Milan.
 Grech said as a result, Malta is losing opportunities for foreign investment due to the government’s failures.

Malta's farmers need EU funding to help cope with systemic drought - Peter Agius,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/malta-farmers-need-eu-funding-help-cope-systemic-drought-peter-agius.1101239,19-11-2024,005371.png,"Maltese farmers need additional EU funding to help them cope with what is becoming Malta’s endemic drought, MEP Peter Agius has said. 
 ""Farmers are losing crops due to the severe drought in Malta and are spending large sums on purchasing water. At this rate, Maltese agriculture cannot compete. Europe needs to understand this and adapt its criteria to ensure Malta can continue to produce fresh, local products,” Agius said. 
 Speaking in the European Parliament’s Agriculture Committee, Agius called on the European Commission for direct assistance to tackle the drought in Malta.
 Many Maltese farmers were spending large amounts of money on water to save their crops, he said, making agriculture less economically viable and putting Malta’s food security at risk. 
 Agius noted that Malta received just 249mm of rainfall in 2023, meaning the country’s climate was technically within the definition of a desert. The European Commission had to step in to compensate Maltese farmers for this drought, he said. 
  The MEP’s intervention came during a committee meeting focused on EU efforts to allocate funding to farmers who suffer losses due to natural disasters. 
 The proposed new EU regulations would give member states flexibility to compensate farmers for crop losses. 
 However, the proposed regulation is focused on events deemed “extraordinary”. Agius fears this will exclude Malta’s drought – which is becoming a yearly event – from qualifying for emergency funding. 
 He asked the committee whether the regulation was flexible enough to cover encouraged the Maltese Government to apply this regulation, which would allow farmers to receive up to €42,000 in compensation for losses incurred due to drought. These funds would come from unallocated EU resources that would otherwise be lost.

PL canvasser suggested Mansueto's name to 'skip the driving test queue',timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/pl-canvasser-suggested-mansueto-name-skip-driving-test-queue.1097832,09-09-2024,"005378.png,005379.png","A woman who was found guilty of bribing a Transport Malta official insisted that she only contacted former director Clint Mansueto to “speed up the process” to help her nephew obtain his driving licence. 
 Maria Assunta Camilleri took the witness stand on Monday in proceedings against Mansueto and two of his former subordinates, Raul Antonio Pace and Philip Endrick Zammit, who stand accused over their alleged involvement in the driving licence racket.
 All three are pleading not guilty. 
 Just over two months ago, Camilleri was placed under probation after admitting to the bribery charges.
 On Monday, she was summoned to testify in the ongoing case explaining that she first contacted Mansueto after Labour canvasser Jesmond Zammit dropped his name during a house visit to her mother-in-law. 
  Zammit said Mansueto could lend a hand when Camilleri mentioned the upcoming driving test of her nephew, Marcus Galdes. 
 “I did so it wouldn’t take long,” she said, insisting that she only texted Mansueto so that he could speed up the process. 
 Her nephew first applied for a licence to drive trucks. 
 Mansueto advised her that the candidate was to sit for the CPC (certificate of professional competence) test first. The test was an initial qualification for candidates applying for category C or D licences, namely those covering trucks, coaches, mini-buses and buses. 
 Her nephew was not successful at first and Mansueto would tell her to pass on the message, “tell him to put his mind to it”.
 Questioned by AG lawyer Abigail Caruana Vella, Camilleri said that through Mansueto’s intervention her nephew could “skip the queue”.
 For instance, instead of waiting for six months for his test, he was scheduled for an appointment within two weeks. 
 Although she rarely phoned Mansueto, she regularly texted him, to inform him about her nephew’s application for the theory and driving tests, even after a date had been set for the test. 
 When Marcus sat for his coach driving licence, he failed the first time around. 
 Mansueto told his aunt he would have to re-apply. 
 
 “Good morning Clint. Marcus Galdes ok. Thanks a lot for everything,” she texted when her nephew finally made it. 
 “Why did you thank him?” asked the prosecutor.
 “Perhaps because he went for his test and passed,” replied the witness. 
 But when the prosecutor pointed out that applying for a driving licence was the candidate’s right and why had his aunt thanked Mansueto, Camilleri replied, “I don’t know.” 
 “I’m Maria, Marcus’s aunt… tomorrow he has his theory test for mini-buses [licence] at 8.30am… so that they help him a bit please and I’ll see you as usual,” ran another of Camilleri’s messages to Mansueto.
 Asked what sort of help she was referring to, Camilleri said that since her nephew could not read and write, he needed assistance during the test. 
 “I had applied for a helper… I just wanted to make sure they would not forget about the helper,” she sought to explain.
 But she insisted that she only handed over money to Mansueto three times, each time visiting his TM office to give him €50.
 Other messages read out in court indicated that Camilleri would announce her visit. 
 Yet, she insisted that she had given him the money as a token for his help in speeding up the process. 
 “No, I don’t want it,” Mansueto told her. 
 “No, take it as a thank you,” Camilleri replied after her nephew finally got his licence. And Mansueto kept the €50.
 Camilleri had intervened to help two other candidates. One was an Arab national who applied for a motorbike licence. 
 “Tomorrow that Arab is having his theory test for a motorcycle... if they can help… if he passes, he’ll take care of you as usual,” she texted Mansueto, ahead of the candidate’s test. 
 She returned to his office with another €50 token when the result was successful. 
 She followed the same pattern with a third candidate on behalf of whom she intervened, seeking Mansueto’s help. 
 Other messages dating back to February 2020 were linked to her nephew’s second application for a coach licence. 
 After the driving test, Mansueto texted her that “he [Marcus] had failed over one or two errors. Next week we’ll give him another appointment.” 
 Camilleri asked Mansueto to “book” her nephew for his next attempt “to speed up matters"".
 “At last we’ve made it,” Mansueto messaged when her nephew passed his theory test. 
 “Thank you very much,” Camilleri texted back. “See you tomorrow.” 
 Marcus passed both tests for a truck and coach licence but his aunt insisted that she only gave Mansueto one €50 payment. 
 The witness sounded rather unconvincing when asked about a message three days after her nephew’s theory test. 
 “Tomorrow he has his other one please,” she messaged Mansueto.
 “What arrangement did you have?” asked presiding Magistrate Rachel Montebello.
 “If you already had the date for the driving test, what help did you need?” 
 “So that they helped him with his theory test,” replied the witness. 
 But that answer prompted a warning from the magistrate that the witness was under oath. 
 “You’ve already been convicted. No need to fear. You’re here as a witness to tell the truth. If you don’t, the court may order action against you for perjury,” warned the magistrate. 
 “Was it [to help him] with passing [the test]?”
 “Yes,” said the witness, referring to help during the driving test.

Randolph De Battista to be made Geneva ambassador after quitting as Labour CEO,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/randolph-de-battista-take-role-ambassador-geneva-pm-says.1096577,08-10-2024,005382.png,"Updated August 10 with PN reaction
 Randolph De Battista will no longer remain an MP after accepting to take on the role of ambassador to Geneva, Prime Minister Robert Abela said on Friday. 
 De Battista resigned as the Labour Party's CEO on Thursday and was replaced a day later by  Leonid McKay. At the time, Debattista quit the job for unspecified reasons. 
 Leaving Labour's general conference on Friday evening, Abela said those who will no longer occupy a role in the Labour Party still have something to give, either to the party or the government. 
 ""On the CEO of the Labour Party (De Battista) I can confirm he will take up the role of ambassador to Geneva,"" he said.
 Geneva, in Switzerland, serves as the European headquarters of the United Nations and also hosts several UN institutions. 
  Asked to clarify if De Battista will remain an MP, Abela said, ""the nature of that role speaks for itself"". As a rule, ambassadors cannot also be members of parliament.
 Abela denied that De Battista was being sidelined and said this was a role he was offered and accepted. 
 Abela and De Battista have reportedly had a frosty relationship in recent months. Last July, Abela admitted to having a ""difference of opinion"" with his then-CEO. 
 De Battista was also party CEO between 2017 and 2020 when Abela sacked him a few weeks into his tenure as prime minister.
 Reacting on Saturday, the Nationalist Party said it was clear Robert Abela was willing to do away with the national interest in favour of quelling internal conflict within his political party. 
 Making Debattista an ambassador was a ""slap in the face"" to diplomats who were far more qualified for the role, said PN MP Beppe Fenech Adami.
 News of De Battista's departure from parliament comes on the same day as Rosianne Cutajar's re-appointment to the PL parliamentary group. 
 Earlier this year, Abela publicly demanded an apology from Cutajar if she wished to rejoin the Labour parliamentary group.
 When asked if Cutajar had finally apologised, the prime minister said: 
 ""She spoke with me clearly before the parliamentary group earlier today, she made those declarations, and I was satisfied with what she said and addressed what I had spoken about earlier.""
 Abela did not answer when asked if Cutajar should make a public apology. 
 Cutajar resigned from the PL parliamentary group after succumbing to pressure following the publication of hundreds of messages between her and Yorgen Fenech.
 Complained about being left out of cabinet, she told Fenech: “Now I’ve stopped giving a damn... I’ll become a consultant with Pierre of ITS, and pocket another wage.” 
 Cutajar then added: “I don’t care, everybody pigs out.”   
 In 2020 Cutajar resigned her post from parliamentary secretary, pending the outcome of an investigation by the Commissioner for Standards in Public Life. The National Audit Office later found her ITS job was fraudulent and irregular. 
 The former Qormi mayor remains popular in her constituency.
 In January, Abela said Cutajar had paid a high enough political price and that it was time to ""reconsider"" her position, but later added that she would need to apologise before being allowed back into the party.
 As she left the general conference Cutajar was also asked if she would apologise publicly, but did not answer saying instead ""I have paid the highest political price"".
 During the extraordinary general meeting, the Labour Party executive agreed to change the statute to allow MPs to contest for the deputy leader role on Friday.

ADPD gets a council voice as Sandra Gauci is elected in St Paul's Bay,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/adpd-gets-council-voice-sandra-gauci-elected-st-paul-bay.1093881,06-12-2024,005386.png,"Sandra Gauci became ADPD’s first councillor in five years on Wednesday after she was elected to the St Paul’s Bay local council on the fourth count.
 Gauci, who leads the Green Party as its chairperson, obtained 557 first preferences in the local council election.
 St Paul’s Bay is Malta’s largest locality by population but saw a relatively low turnout – 28.57% versus the 59.47% national average.
 Elections there proved to be the day's high water mark for the Nationalist Party, which took back a council majority thanks to a dominant performance by former minister Censu Galea.
 Galea got 2,151 first preference votes, more than double that of his nearest rival, incumbent Labour mayor Alfred Gima.
 But it was a similarly memorable night for Gauci and the Greens, who said her election reflected a broader trend of people being fed up with PL/PN politics as usual.
 In her first comments as an elected councillor, Gauci said she intended to prioritise cleanliness and open spaces.
 “There is too much unsustainable development and the take-over of our coast by private interests is unacceptable,” she said.
 She indicated she also intended to focus on recycling and zero waste efforts and intended to implement various waste reduction strategies for St Paul’s Bay – a densely populated area that sees high volumes of tourists and has a massive overseas population.
 The locality’s foreign population may have been a contributing factor towards low turnout in the elections – all areas with large non-Maltese populations experienced low turnout – but Gauci believes she can help residents connect with their council.
 
 “I do not only want to be the voice of residents, but also foster spaces where residents themselves will be able to bring their ideas in a direct and structured way - to us the local council,” she said.
 ADPD fielded candidates in five local councils for the 2024 council elections.
 Vote counting is taking place over three days, with Wednesday marking the first of those three.

 Speaking under a large marquee in Żabbar on Sunday, Abela said: “You in the south know who is the establishment and what decisions they took. For them, the south was only good for dump sites”. 
 Alluding to pre-2013 Nationalist Party governments, Abela said that the “establishment” built a power station run by heavy fuel oil and a recycling plant that smelled so bad that people could not even open a window. 
  It was the people who kicked them out, he said. 
 His speech made no direct reference to the Vitals inquiry or the political events of the past week, which have stirred up Labour grassroots support while also rocking the party internally. 
  Since Monday, Abela and  members of his government have repeatedly claimed that an inquiry into the Vitals hospitals deal was timed to damage Labour's electoral prospects ahead of the June 8 MEP elections. 
 Abela claims that the timing is a ploy by the “establishment” - a phrase that he has used in an apparent reference to the Opposition. 
 The Vitals inquiry was tasked with assessing whether government members involved in the now-annulled hospitals privatisation deal committed crimes in relation to it. 
 
 Former Prime Minister Joseph Muscat, current Deputy Prime Minister Chris  Fearne, former ministers Konrad Mizzi and Edward Scicluna and Muscat's former right-hand man Keith Schembri are said to be implicated in the magistrate's findings. 
 Abela said the government will not stop implementing budget measures during the electoral campaign. That includes sending tax rebate cheques to homes, he said. 
 The tax rebate cheques are a government pledge but critics say they are used by the government to leverage an electoral advantage. The Abela-led government sent one round of cheques weeks before the 2022 general election, earning itself criticism from the OSCE.
 Abela dismissed that criticism, saying “election or not, you receive that cheque every year. When the PN was in government you didn't get a cheque, you got higher bills."" 
 Abela said parents whose children continue into post-secondary education will soon also receive a €500 cheque - the first of three.
 The prime minister and Labour leader told the crowd that he wanted to work towards a united country - even as he attacked the Opposition and 'establishment' that he said was intent on destruction. 
 “Don’t let anyone divide us – our country is strongest when it is united,” he said, before adding, “for them, lust for power comes first.  For us, Malta comes first, before all else.""
 All nine PL MEP candidates, as well as the Żabbar PL local council candidates attended the event that the PL dubbed “a mass rally”. 
 MEP candidates and many members of Abela's cabinet circled the prime minister as he spoke to a crowd that filled the marque and filtered out into Triq is-Santwarju in the southern Labour stronghold. 
  In an opening speech, Economy minister Silvio Schembri recalled Maltese revolutionary Manwel Dimech and those who were interdicted by the church in the 1960s during Dominic Mintoff’s tenure as Labour Party leader. 
 He said the “establishment” had also gone after them, too. 
 “They sent Manwel Dimech to exile and let him die away from his country and family because he was in favour of the people,” Schembri said.

PN 'extremely concerned' about drug situation in Malta,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/pn-extremely-concerned-drug-situation-malta.1102408,13-12-2024,,"The PN on Friday said it was ""extremely concerned"" about the drug situation in Malta, and the recent discovery of dismembered body parts in a suitcase in Gżira only heightened this worry.
 The party said that while it fully respected the judicial process, the published facts suggested that the case was linked to a drug trafficking ring operating in Malta.
 ""The PN’s concern also arises against the backdrop of reports indicating that both the presence of drugs in our country and the demand for them are continuously on the rise.
 ""Naturally, this has negative consequences on individuals, families, and ultimately society as a whole,"" the party said.
 Thanking security officials and professionals working on this case, the PN said the incident was proof of the dangerous networks present in Malta.
 In a report on organised crime in EU member states, published by Europol in April under the title ‘ Decoding the EU’s most threatening criminal networks’, Malta appeared on an unfavourable list, exposing the shortcomings of our authorities in the fight against organised crime, the PN added.
 ""Our country enjoys the advantage of natural borders and is supposedly in control of what enters and leaves the country.
 ""However, it seems that this advantage is not being utilised in the public interest to ensure security within our borders.""
 It urged the government to demonstrate it was genuinely addressing such issues and to send a clear message that there was no room or tolerance for organised crime in Malta.
 PL: PN is populist and shallow
 Reacting, the PL said instead of commending the police for arresting a suspect within 72 hours of the gruesome discovery, the PN had expressed its concern about the case.
 ""Populists, shallow, and partisans. The police are doing their best to fight crime and its causes to keep Malta safe.
 ""The Labour government comes down hard on organised crime and drug traffickers, unlike previous PN governments that allowed them to go back to their country (Brazil, remember?) as free men,"" the PL said.
 ""Could it be that the PN is using this case as a diversion from the internal trouble it currently has with one of its deputies?""

 Tabone will assume that role in addition to his existing role, head of her private office and public relations.
 The two roles will now be merged into one, a spokesperson from the European Parliament president’s office said.
 Tabone joined the European Parliament in 2013, as head of the MEP’s office, and is one of her top advisers. He is also her brother-in-law, having met and married her sister after joining the MEP's office. 
 In recent years, Metsola has entrusted him with managing a major transparency reform of EP procedures following the Qatargate scandal and coordinating her engagement with the European public in the run up to the European Parliament elections last June.

MPs debate gender 'X' bill allowing official recognition of non-binary people,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/mps-debate-gender-x-bill.1094451,25-06-2024,005366.png,"A Bill to provide for the legal recognition of non-binary genders started being debated in parliament on Tuesday.
 If approved, the bill will amend the Gender Identity, Gender Expression and Sex Characteristics Act to formally recognise and legally entrench the gender 'X' on all state documents for people who feel they are neither a man nor a woman.
 Equality and Reforms Junior Minister Rebecca Buttigieg told parliament this was a natural step towards the recognition of the rights of all people, no matter their gender identity.
 ""I'm sure there will be people listening to this debate who will argue we are taking things too far to accommodate a minority of people,"" she said.
 ""They will only argue this way until someone in their own family needs this law. Then they will understand and appreciate how important it is.""
  In a Facebook post later on Tuesday she said the law will ensure all civil documents carry the correct gender of these people, without discrimination.
 The opposition said it supports the amendments.
 Graziella Attard Previ, who is the PN's civil liberties spokesperson, said the law was needed, but many people on the streets remained oblivious to the realities of non-binary people.
 More education and awareness was needed, and the government could do more to offer a wider range of services to the LGBTIQ+ community, she added.
 Non-binary people feel their gender identity doesn't fall neatly into the categories of ""man"" or ""woman."" It's an umbrella term for a wide range of gender experiences that exist outside of the gender binary.
 They can feel like a mix of masculine and feminine genders, identify with neither of the traditional genders, or feel their gender identity changes over time.
 The Gender Identity, Gender Expression and Sex Characteristics Act (GIGESC Act) was enacted in Malta in 2015.
 It is a law that protects and recognises the rights of transgender and intersex individuals to choose their own gender identity. The law gives them the right to request a change to the gender listed on their official documents to reflect their self-identified gender.
 The law also made it simple for people to change their gender. It does not require them to provide any medical evidence, such as proof of surgery or hormone therapy, to change their gender.

Judiciary’s concern over privacy stalls planned road safety bureau,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/judiciary-concern-privacy-stalls-planned-road-safety-bureau.1097503,09-02-2024,005373.png,"The delay in setting up a road safety bureau, proposed by the government in 2022 amid a  record number of fatal accidents, has been put down to the judiciary’s hesitancy to share the contents of magisterial inquiries.
 Sources said the judiciary’s concern is over maintaining the confidentiality of investigations and the privacy of those involved.
 It is understood that the government and the judiciary are working towards a compromise on this issue.
 The news comes after three people died in separate road accidents last Tuesday.
 Malta recorded its deadliest year for road fatalities in 2022, with 26 people losing their lives amid calls for more action to be taken to improve road safety.
 Sixteen people died last year, while three fatalities last Tuesday have raised the death toll to nine so far in 2024.
 The government first announced plans to establish a road investigation bureau in December 2022 as part of a wider reform to consolidate air, sea, and road safety investigations under one Transport Safety Investigation Commission.
 The transport ministry, then under Aaron Farrugia, set a deadline to establish the commission by December 2023. There is still no sign of the commission.
 If established, the road safety bureau would not apportion blame but would help identify any shortcomings, issues and patterns with a view to amending safety policy.
 It would do that by tapping into the information gathered by magisterial inquiries, according to the white paper which proposed the commission.
 “It is being proposed that a bureau will be set up such that it may have access to this information, thereby avoiding duplication of efforts in order to analyse the data gathered during such inquiries in terms of road safety,” the consultation document said.
 The bureau could publish its recommendations upon completing a safety investigation.
 Currently, magisterial inquiries and police investigations are the only methods of investigating road accidents in Malta.
 These inquiries determine civil or criminal liabilities, and their conclusions generally remain confidential.
 When asked about the progress towards setting up a bureau last year, a spokesperson for the transport ministry had said that the legal details were still being finalised before being presented to the cabinet and parliament.
 “The work at this delicate stage involves refining the legislation to ensure that the safety investigation process does not compromise magisterial inquiries, and vice versa. This process (and related consultations with involved parties) is expected to extend beyond December 2023,” the spokesperson had said at the time.

EP under pressure over ‘loophole’ allowing Metsola to not declare conflict,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/ep-pressure-loophole-allowing-metsola-declare-conflict.1097608,09-04-2024,005473.png,"The European Parliament is facing calls to plug a loophole in its members’ code of conduct that allows Roberta Metsola to refrain from declaring any conflicts of interest.
 The pressure comes in the wake of a damning report published by Politico on Wednesday which argued that ethics rules requiring top European Parliament officials, including vice-presidents and quaestors, to declare conflicts of interest applied to everybody but Metsola herself.
 The report argues that this allowed the role of Metsola’s husband Ukko – the vice-president of the Royal Caribbean Group, one of the world’s top cruise line companies and a registered EU lobbyist - to go “largely unnoticed”, even on the rare occasions where she issued public statements about the maritime industry.
 Why the rules don’t bind Metsola to declare conflicts of interest in the same way as other top EU officials is unclear.
 A spokesperson for the EP told Times of Malta that “the President has always followed all Parliament’s rules on declarations, and conflict of interest rigorously, both in the spirit and the letter of the rules,” insisting that her husband’s employment “is neither new nor has it been revealed today”.
 Metsola, the spokesperson said, “has always used her office for the sole reason of representing the interests of the European Parliament. Parliament refutes, in the strongest possible terms, any conjectures alleging otherwise”.
 What’s more, the spokesperson said, the ethics rules were drafted and approved by MEPs, not Metsola herself.
 But Metsola appears to have had few qualms in taking credit for the reforms, introduced in the wake of the Qatargate scandal that rocked the European Parliament early in her mandate.
 In early January 2023, she posted to X, saying that she had presented “a set of proposals to reform, re-build and re-affirm the European Parliament as a modern and open institution”.
  The 14-point plan was eventually adopted later that year, pledging to introduce improved rules on declarations of conflict of interest. and giving authorities greater powers to decide “whether MEPs with conflicts of interest should hold specific positions”.
 While the loophole does not mean that either Metsola or her husband engaged in any improper behaviour or sought to inappropriately influence legislation in any way, transparency watchdogs told Politico that “there’s no reason why President Metsola — or any president — should be exempt from filing such a declaration”.
 Reacting to Politico’s report, PL MEP Alex Agius Saliba said that he would be requesting action during a meeting of the S&D group.
  This is not the first time that Metsola has faced criticism linked to a potential conflict of interest.
 Just last week, she came under fire for appointing her brother-in-law, Matthew Tabone, as her head of cabinet, with Agius Saliba, amongst several others, describing the appointment as a case of “rampant nepotism”.
 Tabone, who married Metsola’s sister in 2015, two years after joining her office, was initially touted for the role in 2022, but it eventually went to Spaniard Leticia Zuleta de Reales Ansaldo.
 Ansaldo’s predecessor, Italian Alessandro Chiocchetti, was named the EP’s secretary-general upon leaving Metsola’s office, amidst accusations of cronyism and horse-trading designed to win support for Chiocchetti.
 Chiocchetti was elected after two S&D members allegedly broke ranks with their political group to back his nomination.
 Bringing the matter full circle, one of the rebel S&D MEPs, Greece’s Eva Kaili, was arrested by Belgian police on corruption charges just a weeks later, sparking the Qatargate scandal that would eventually inspire the EP’s code of conduct reforms.

Malta under Labour 'unrecognisable' - Bernard Grech,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/malta-labour-unrecognisable-bernard-grech.1098374,21-09-2024,005560.png,"Malta has become ""unrecognisable"" under the leadership of the Labour government due to the widespread corruption that has become the order of the day, Berard Grech said on Friday. 
 The PN leader was addressing a mass meeting at Pjazzi Tritoni this evening as part of the party's programme of events celebrating 60 years since Malta gained its independence. 
 Paying tribute to former prime minister George Borg Olivier, Grech said independence granted Malta the freedom to forge its own destiny and with it, our forefathers built strong foundations for the Maltese state to keep growing. 
 But despite this, the Malta the Maltese are living in today is ""unrecognisable"" from the inheritance promised to us by independence, Grech said. 
 The impact of foreign workers on people's quality of life, the country resembling a permanent construction site and the police failing to protect the rule of law and good citizens are some of the reasons Grech said the country has strayed from its original vision for self-governance. 
 But chief among these, he continued, is corruption that has overshadowed the Labour government to the point that it has become part of its operating system and most worrisome of all, that the government has lost the will and the spine to fight it. 
 ""Robert Abela cannot fight corruption as he promised you because he is part of a system that creates and protects it at your expense,"" Grech said. 
 ""Abela cannot do genuine politics in the national interest because corruption is the new normal and he has become a hostage of the compromises he has made."" 
 Grech said the stench of corruption in the country is not only stagnant at the top but has seeped down to every level of society where people are even willing to corrupt themselves in exchange for a few measly euros. 
 ""If those at the top are corrupt and do everything in their power to defend it from being dismantled, we can expect those underneath them do act and think the same way,"" Grech said. 
 ""Instead of working to fight corruption, the government is caught in its political trap.""
 Conversely, he said that the PN has a past that it is proud of and can look back with its head held up high. It is on this solid foundation that it also has the confidence to be a government of certainty and stability again. 
 A PN Government would improve the quality of life by investing in public spaces, and cleanliness, and ensuring that health services and construction standards are of the highest level, Grech pledged. 
 Under Robert Abela, he continued, the country is no longer shocked when it hears of a new corruption scandal and is left surprised when something is actually done properly.
 ""People of all political colours are suffering under this government and while their beliefs may differ I believe what they have in common is their lover for their families and their country,"" Grech continued. 
 ""So to you, whoever you are, I ask, is this the life you voted for? is this the Malta that you want to live in?"" 
 The PN leader said that ""time is up"" for the government and while Labour remains tangled in corruption and incompetence, the PN is standing out as the party of hope and change.

 But Bartolo’s stint in cabinet was far from uneventful, spanning pandemics, tourism booms and controversies, one of which eventually brought him crashing down.
 We trace the steps back through some of the highlights and lowlights of his time at the ministry’s helm.
 1. Guiding Malta’s pandemic-wreaked tourism industry through its darkest days
 A one-time Mellieħa deputy mayor, Bartolo rose through Labour ranks, eventually joining cabinet as a parliamentary secretary in Abela’s first cabinet back in early 2020.
 By the end of the year, he had made the step up to full-blown minister, inheriting the tourism portfolio from Julia Farrugia in a November 2020 cabinet reshuffle, just as Malta’s beleaguered tourism industry was trying to fumble its way through the wreckage of pandemic lockdowns and travel restrictions.
 Bartolo, together with the health authorities, performed admirably, gradually bringing tourist numbers back up with relatively few hiccups along the way.
 Malta was one of the first countries in Europe to issue digital vaccine certificates the following May, allowing it to finally reopen its doors to tourists, although it narrowly missed out on making it onto a  green list of destinations for UK travellers.
 By the end of the year, tourism arrivals were picking up pace, with the operators in the sector hoping for a full recovery over the next few years.
  2. And, boy, were they right. Tourist arrivals go through the roof
 In defending his legacy, Bartolo will be quick to point to the sheer wave of people who have holidayed in Malta over the past few years.
 Malta welcomed almost a million tourists in 2021, despite the industry being on its knees for much of the year, before bouncing back to 2.3million arrivals in 2022, only slightly less than pre-COVID numbers.
 And things really took off in 2023, with tourist arrivals topping three million for the first time in the country’s history, a year before the tourism authorities planned to hit that particular milestone.
 Things haven’t slowed this year, with Malta on track to receive some 3.2m tourists by the end of the year.
  3. “Things will be different” – promises to solve Comino deckchair chaos fall flat
 The influx of tourists brought a renewed spotlight on the impact of tourists on Malta’s towns and landscapes, particularly in tourist hotspots.
 This was most stark in Comino, where a viral Times of Malta video viewed millions of times the world over showed deckchair operators’ illegal takeover of the Blue Lagoon in the summer of 2021.
 By the time summer 2022 rolled around, activists had had enough, descending on the bay to manually remove deckchairs and umbrellas themselves, while demanding drastic changes to how the site is managed.
 “Things will be different next year,” Bartolo promised at the time, pointing to ongoing talks over a management plan for Comino.
 Only, they weren’t.
 By the following summer, Bartolo had renewed beach concessions for the site, reneging on a promise to publish a tender for the service, saying that the government was yet to finalise its management plan.
 Meanwhile, he refused to publish information about the concessions, arguing that they were commercially sensitive, and rebuffed allegations claiming that he and Gozo Minister Clint Camilleri had a conflict of interest into the concessions.
  4. Skills card for foreign hospitality workers
 One of the flagship reforms that the Tourism Ministry introduced under Bartolo’s watch, the skills card promised to drastically improve the quality of Malta’s hospitality sector.
 Bartolo described the move as a “bold” reform which would ensure that anybody working in the hospitality sector has the necessary skills.
 After some teething problems, the card was eventually introduced in March 2024, three months after initially planned.
 The jury is still out on the scheme’s success, with initial reports showing that half of the candidates who applied for a skills card failed to make the grade.
  5. Film industry glitz, glamour and controversy
 While tourism may have been Bartolo’s bread and butter, he was also responsible for the infinitely more glamorous matter of Malta’s film industry.
 Throughout his tenure, Bartolo (and film commissioner Johann Grech) were dogged by persistent questions about Malta’s extravagant spending on everything from a controversial cash rebate scheme (€143 million over five years) to a film festival ( €3.9m this year) and accompanying promotional  short film (another half a million euros).
 The pair frequently defended these expenses, arguing that the expenditure is needed to attract film productions to these shores, and pointing to the money that these films leave in Malta’s coffers, much to the scepticism of economists.
 But there’s little doubt that several reputable international film productions shot their films in Malta in recent years, most recently Ridley Scott’s Gladiator 2, with Bartolo reportedly planning to turn part of the film’s set into a  Popeye village-style tourist attraction.
 And while it pointed to a lack of transparency and good governance, Bartolo is likely to have felt vindicated by a recent report from the auditor general, which found that the government’s calculations on the film industry’s return were largely spot-on.
 6. Embarrassing gaffes and Manchester United shirts
 Bartolo has had to contend with a parade of self-inflicted gaffes throughout his time as minister.
 One bizarre instance involved Bartolo’s inexplicable decision to turn up to a match between Birkirkara and Manchester United’s women’s team kitted out in the English side’s signature jacket, drawing ire and ridicule in equal measure.
  Bartolo’s well-documented affection for all things Manchester United had previously raised eyebrows when the Tourism Ministry renewed a multi-year sponsorship deal with the club to promote Malta as a tourist destination.
 But while Manchester United may get his pulse racing, we learnt that Bartolo is less keen on PN MP Rebekah Borg, after an embarrassing hot mic blunder was caught on a parliament livestream.
 Not realising that his microphone was still turned on, Bartolo was heard telling fellow minister Roderick Galdes “oh god, I detest this one with a passion, man”, as Borg rose to speak.
 And Bartolo’s stint as a member of the parliamentary accounts committee also met with a series of missteps, not least when Bartolo was caught sending questions to a witness before he testified, prompting calls for his resignation from the committee.
 “It seems I made a mistake”, Bartolo sheepishly admitted after he was rebuked by speaker Anġlu Farrugia.
  7. From a lavish wedding to consultancy scandal
 Bartolo had barely finished rebutting claims that he and his wife Amanda Muscat had abused public funds to stage a lavish Manoel Island wedding when the pair found themselves embroiled in another scandal.
 With the couple’s wedding still under the auditor general’s spotlight, a standards commissioner report had found that Bartolo had conspired with Gozo Minister Clint Camilleri to give his then-partner and secretary Muscat a fake €68,000 consultancy job in the Gozo Ministry.
 Amid widespread calls for their resignation, Bartolo and Camilleri were admonished by a parliamentary ethics committee, with Muscat grudgingly returning over €16,000.
 Hoping to get off with a slap on the wrist, news that Bartolo and Muscat were the subject of an FIAU investigation into alleged kickbacks proved to be the final nail in Bartolo’s coffin.

Robert Abela dismisses talk of calling a snap election,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/robert-abela-dismisses-talk-calling-snap-election.1098120,15-09-2024,"005633.png,005634.png,005635.png","Robert Abela has dismissed rumours that he is planning a snap election, saying that Labour’s promise to slash income tax for middle classes builds on the party’s previous budgets.
 Speaking at the close of a Labour Patrty general conference on Sunday, Abela said the upcoming budget, the third of this legislature, “will be better than the previous one and the one before that’.
 “There is no election coming, I can assure you,” he said.
 Abela has pledged to unveil the “biggest tax cut in history”  in October’s budget for 2025, saying tax bands will be widened to benefit middle classes.
 That pledge sparked rumours in political circles that Labour was thinking of calling a snap election, just over halfway through its legislative term.
  Having poured cold water on those rumours, Abela said Labour Party members were right to expect more of their party, and pledged to deliver on those expectations.
 Abela linked Maltese society’s expectations to Maslow’s hierarchy of needs – a theoretical framework that ranks indviduals’ needs from the most basic and urgent to more aspirational ones.
 “People know we did a lot of good. Now there are new challenges,” he said. “They want quality over quantiy, green spaces, cleaner air, road enforcement and housing affordability.
  “We will not look away from these things, we will tackle these challenges.”
 The Labour Party would be setting up internal party fora to discuss these challenges and how to address them, he said, as he urged delegates to “look ahead to the future, not to the past”.
 Abela pledged to work to refocus Malta’s economy to deliver high-quality, jobs that guaranteed a good standard of living, were ethical and needed by society.
 The priority was to find and develop industries which are not labour-intensive, have a minimal impact on national infrastructure and lead to a high value-added benefit to the economy, he said, citing engineering initiatives as an example. 
 Finance Minister Clyde Caruana has made similar calls, saying the country must find ways of generating ""more with less"".
 Abela also reflected on the death of PN MP Karl Gouder, urging people to speak responsibly and “rise above personal attacks”.
 “Such attacks contribute nothing to society,” Abela said, as he blamed an unnamed “small clique” of people he said was working to “advance hidden agendas and destroy good people.”
 Abela accused the Opposition of being the party of austerity, saying the PN would work to liberalise electricity distribution networks if elected into government.
 
 “And that would mean one thing: higher bills,” he said. “They are the party that wants to leave the market to run itself. That is the easy path,” Abela warned.
 He cited the government’s decision, announced last week, to subsidise private schools to help cushion the impact of rising educators’ salaries.
 While Labour genuinely wanted to help Malta’s middle classes, the Opposition thought otherwise, he said.
  “Don’t you think that the Opposition backed up on this initiative,” he said of the private school investment. “It was total silence. They just sat and watched.”
 Abela congratulated and thanked the party’s two new deputy leaders, Ian Borg and Alex Agius Saliba, as well as the  party’s new president Alex Sciberras and all other party members elected during Saturday’s elections.

"Malta's finch trapping for 'research' is illegal, EU Court of Justice rules",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/maltese-finch-trapping-declared-illegal-court-justice-eu.1098264,19-09-2024,005663.png,"Updated 1.45pm
 Malta's trapping of protected finches for ""research purposes"" is illegal, the European Union's top court has ruled.
 The European Court of Justice judgement is final and Malta risks paying penalties should it fail to comply.  
 “The finches project does not establish a genuine research purpose and hence cannot be considered as being justified” the European Court of Justice said on Thursday.
 In a reaction to the ruling, the government said it remained  ""resolute in defending the lawful practices of hunters and trappers"".
 It was currently examining the judgement in detail to plan a way forward.
 The Opposition meanwhile called for a ""serious dialogue"" to find a way for bird trapping to be carried out ""sustainably"" and through a plan that ensures the trappers' interests are protected while avoiding any breach of the EU Birds Directive.
 Malta was given a few years to ban finch trapping when it joined the EU in 2004.
 It had done so by 2009 although enforcement against the practice was weak. 
 In 2014, Malta made Finch trapping legal again:  back then the government banked on a provision in the Birds Directive that allowed the capture of protected birds in “small numbers”.  
 However, the government had to repeal that provision after the government lost a court case raised by the Commission.
 The trapping of wild finches using nets and cages was then forbidden under the EU’s Birds Directive in 2018, however, the Maltese government has long tried to keep the practice alive.
 
 In 2020 the government said it was allowing the trapping of seven species of wild finches, claiming the EU directive allowed the practice “for the purposes of research and teaching, of re-population, of re-introduction and for the breeding necessary for these purposes”. 
 Hunters were allowed to catch the birds, ring them and re-release them as part of the ""study"".
 The government had insisted the capturing of wild finches answered the scientific question: “Where do finches that migrate over Malta during post-nuptial (autumn) migration come from?” 
 The European Commission disagreed, saying Malta’s argument was a “cover-up” to continue the practice of trapping as a hobby. It subsequently launched a court case against the government.  
 The court on Thursday sided with the Commission saying Malta’s finches project had no genuine research purpose and the government had therefore failed to align with European law.  
 ""The court finds that by adopting a derogation allowing the live capture of individuals of seven species of wild finches... Malta has failed to fulfil its obligations,"" the court said in a statement following the ruling. 
 The court noted that finch trapping in Malta was not based on scientific methods, was inappropriate for attaining the government’s declared scientific goal and pursued an objective that did not contribute to the conservation of wild finches.  
 ""It appears that the declarations of 2020, 2021 and 2022 authorising the trapping of finches of the species concerned during the ‘research periods’ of 2020, 2021 and 2022 do not contain any precise and adequate reasoning as to why there is no such solution and do not even mention other scientific research methods currently used in the ornithological field.""
 Activists have long slammed the so-called research, with the Committee Against Bird Slaughter calling it ""poaching under the cover of pseudo-science"".
 In a statement, the government acknowledged the ruling, adding that a detailed analysis of the judgment was underway to assess the way forward.
 ""The government remains resolute in defending the lawful practices of hunters and trappers and will continue to engage with all relevant stakeholders to ensure their concerns are appropriately addressed, in full respect of EU law and this judgment,"" it said.
 Minister Clint Camilleri, responsible for hunting among others, was present at the Court of Justice in Luxembourg to witness the delivery of the ruling.
 The Federation for Hunting and Conservation - Malta (FKNK) meanwhile thanked the government - in particular Camilleri - for their ""determination and commitment to continue to defend the legal practices of hunters and trappers to adequately address their concerns"".
 The FKNK said it would continue offering its expertise and resources to the government to find a satisfactory solution for a way forward.
 BirdLife Malta expressed satisfaction with the ruling, saying it brought the end of finch trapping in Malta.
 ""The idea that trappers would catch finches and release them back immediately, after checking if they were carrying any scientific rings on them, was a farce that led the EU Commission to once again challenge this practice before the EU court – a process which ended today with the clear sentence.
 ""This ruling sends a clear message that decisions related to birds and nature should be based on solid science,"" the NGO said in a statement.
 Birdlife's Nicholas Barbara said members of the ORNIS committee needed to be able to understand science to be able to give the right advice to the government.
 ""BirdLife Malta was the only member on this committee that had voted against this derogation as it was clear from day one that this was nothing but a smokescreen and had no scientific or conservation value. The European Court of Justice today vindicated our reasoning and advice.”
 The eNGO's CEO Mark Sultana called on the government to respect the ruling and declare the end of finch trapping ""once and for all"".
 ""We remind the government that we had been giving it the right advice all along including during Ornis committee meetings,"" he said.
 ""It is a pity that we were not listened to and that it had to end up in court. Now the government has no choice but to listen and obey the EU Court sentence.”
 ADPD meanwhile slammed the government for being ""willing to do anything to side with the hunting and trapping lobbies to the detriment of tarnishing Malta's reputation"".
 The party said it was the only one that has consistently remained in favour of the island's natural environment.
 The ruling, it said, showed that the EU favoured Malta's natural environment. 
 The party's chair Sandra Gauci warned that the European court will not be taken for a ride and that the government should abide by the ruling rather than look for loopholes to keep hunters and trappers happy. 
 The ruling, she added, was a win for Malta.
 In a statement, the PN said it was worth recalling that Thursday's was the second such ruling after in 2018, Malta was ordered to completely stop bird trapping.
 Subsequently, the government opened a season under the pretext of research, and the European Commission immediately understood that this was merely a smokescreen, reopening infringement proceedings against the Maltese government, it added.
 ""Today's decision shows that the Maltese government falsely raised hunters' hopes that they could continue bird trapping.
 ""Even worse, the government ignored warning after warning from the EU, leading to Malta being taken to court and having to face the consequences, losing the case with all related costs.""
 The PN called for a ""serious dialogue"" with the European Commission and bird trappers to find a way for bird trapping ""to be carried out sustainably and through a serious plan that ensures the trappers' interests are protected while avoiding any breach of the EU Birds Directive"".
 ""We now have a situation where thousands of trappers in our country cannot practise their hobby due to the government's wrong decisions, which have resulted in the court once again ruling to stop bird trapping.""

Abela: Labour committee MPs can draw their own conclusions about job scandal,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/abela-labour-committee-mps-draw-conclusions-job-scandal.1101290,21-11-2024,005708.png,"Labour’s two representatives on parliament’s standards committee can draw their own conclusions about a report into two of their colleagues’ abuse of power, Prime Minister Robert Abela has said.
 Abela declined to say whether MPs Jonathan Attard and Andy Ellul, who sit on the committee, have been told how to vote when they meet later on Thursday to discuss a damning report into ministers Clayton Bartolo and Clint Camilleri.
 “It would be prudent to wait for the outcome of the committee meeting and allow the individual members to reach their own conclusions,” Abela told Times of Malta on Wednesday evening.
 The parliamentary committee will be meeting at 4pm. It is effectively government-controlled, as the committee has two members from either side of the House with the Speaker holding a casting vote.
  The scandal revolves around a fake job as a ministry consultant given to Bartolo’s wife, Amanda Muscat.
 Muscat, who met Bartolo when she was his secretary, was made a consultant and given a hefty pay rise before being transferred, on paper, to Camilleri’s Gozo Ministry.
 The transfer – and job – were effectively fictitious, the standards commissioner concluded. Muscat continued to work as Bartolo’s secretary while employed as a consultant and never did any work for the Gozo Ministry.
 Both ministers abused their power in granting her the €68,000-a-year job, the commissioner said as he referred them to parliament’s standards committee for sanction.
 According to the Standards in Public Life Act, the committee can choose to adopt the report’s conclusions, reject them or request further information.
 If it adopts the report, ministers Bartolo and Camilleri will be given the opportunity to present submissions to the committee, which will then be empowered to sanction them.
 Sanctions can range from a simple admonishment to demanding an apology of an MP, demanding repayment of any money that was “improperly used” or recommend “any other measure” it deems fit.
 Abela has already made it clear that he has no intention to sack Bartolo or Camilleri.
 In a Sunday Times of Malta interview, he insisted that he saw no reason for the two ministers to resign, though he also emphasised that it was his decision to sack Muscat from her lucrative consultancy job.
 Abela also sought to downplay the scandal during that interview, saying the issue centred on Muscat’s job title and a “€16,000” salary discrepancy. In reality, the discrepancy was of roughly €22,000, with the prime minister citing Muscat’s salary net of taxes.
 Bartolo and Camilleri have both insisted they did nothing wrong.
 The tourism minister has said calls for him to resign are based on political “spin” and that his wife had the necessary experience to serve as a top ministry consultant. The Gozo minister has insisted that no government policies were breached.
 Speaking outside parliament on Wednesday evening, Abela placed emphasis on a secondary conclusion of the commissioner’s report – that a public sector manual on hiring persons of trust does not include criteria for appointing consultants or their salaries.
 Abela said he wants that manual, the Manual on Resourcing Policies and Procedures,  to be amended to include the commissioner’s recommendations irrespective of whether or not the parliamentary committee adopts the report.
 He said he has instructed the principal permanent secretary, Tony Sultana, to prepare legal amendments to revise the relevant section of the manual.

 Speaking during a meeting with the Malta Council for Economic and Social Development (MCESD), Grech stressed the importance of reliable infrastructure for the well-being of citizens and the country's economic growth.
 ""It is unacceptable not to have the stability of basic and essential services,"" Grech said, highlighting urgent issues with road infrastructure, electricity and health services.
 Grech pointed out the adverse impact on workers and businesses, arguing that the current situation could have been avoided with better planning and foresight.
 ""Workers and businesses are suffering, and these crises could and should have been avoided,"" he said.
 He called for immediate action to improve infrastructure and move forward positively. "" Our country needs to have good infrastructure, be credible, and be able to anticipate future challenges with actions that start being taken from today itself,"" he added.
 He outlined the Opposition's vision for a sustainable economy that provides a wide range of well-paying jobs, regardless of individual skills.
  During the meeting, Grech underscored the MCESD's role in the country's success.
 The MCESD, an advisory council, provides opinions and recommendations to the Maltese government on economic and social relevance matters.
 Grech also addressed the council about one of their members, the Central Bank Governor, Edward Scicluna, urging the MCESD to join the Opposition and the government in calling for Scicluna's resignation.
 Scicluna, along with former deputy prime minister Chris Fearne and 13 others, is facing charges of fraud, misappropriation and fraudulent gain related to the privatisation of Gozo, Karin Grech and St Luke’s hospitals. A court on Wednesday said there was enough evidence for the accused to stand trial,
 Last Friday, Scicluna was officially axed from the Malta Financial Services Authority board. He has so far refused to resign as governor of the central bank and insists the central bank has its  “own rules.”

39 prosecuted for smoking cannabis in public since law was changed in 2021,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/39-prosecuted-smoking-cannabis-public-since-law-changed-2021.1102137,12-10-2024,005744.png,"A total of 39 people have faced prosecution for smoking cannabis in public spaces, Home Affairs Minister Byron Camilleri told parliament.
 And just one individual has been prosecuted for smoking in the presence of children since Malta’s landmark legalisation of recreational cannabis in 2021.
 Camilleri provided the figures in response to a series of parliamentary questions posed by Nationalist MP Ivan Bartolo.
 He revealed that 30 people had been arrested for cultivating more than four cannabis plants in their homes. Of these cases, three involved households where children were present. Meanwhile, nine individuals were arrested for possessing more than 50 grams of cannabis for personal use, with two of these cases involving minors in the household.
 Malta became the first EU country to legalise the recreational use of cannabis in 2021. Under the law, adults aged 18 and over are permitted to possess up to seven grams of cannabis and cultivate up to four plants at home. However, smoking cannabis in public or near minors remains prohibited.
 The law also allows for the establishment of licensed cannabis associations, which operate as non-profit organisations to cultivate and distribute cannabis to registered members within legal limits. Currently, cannabis consumption is restricted to private spaces, typically within homes.
 In October, the Cannabis Authority’s CEO announced plans to explore designated areas for public consumption and the potential sale of other cannabis products through licensed associations. This move aims to address the persistent issue of illicit trade in cannabis-related products, which remain accessible only on the black market.

"'We lost our homes, and all they did was tell us to find a place to sleep'",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/we-lost-homes-tell-us-find-place-sleep.1091977,21-06-2024,"005812.png,005813.png","Fourteen families stood in the street, concerned and confused. It was June 2019, and they had all been evacuated from their own homes after a wall adjacent to a construction site next door collapsed.
 “The CEO of the Building Regulations Office gathered us in the street and told us: ‘now you need to plan where you’re going to sleep tonight’,” Janet Walker recounted on Sunday.
 “I remember telling him: ‘Is that why you came here? To divide families? Why didn’t you come when I filed a complaint about the construction?”
 Walker was one of the victims of that Guardamangia construction site collapse. It would be three long years before she and her family would be  able to return home. 
 The Guaradamangia resident is now running for a spot on her hometown’s local council, running on the ADPD ticket.  She was speaking at an ADPD event held outside parliament on Sunday, focused on demanding justice for victims of construction sector calamities.
 The ADPD wants clear rules that will lead to, among other things, errant contractors being stripped of their licence to practice; significantly increased fines; local councils to be consulted when high-rises are planned in their localities; and permits for invalidated buildings to be struck off after three months.
  “There were 1,300 new building permits issued in 2023, and they expect 14 OHSA inspectors to keep up wiht that. Why create an institution and render it toothless? Now they’re promising 55 more. Is it a pre-electoral promise? Didn’t they know before that 14 inspectors is not enough?” ADPD chairperson and MEP candidate Sandra Gauci noted at the event.
 Walker addressed the event before Gauci. In her speech, she recalled how she had done all she could to warn authorities about the dangerous works going on next door.
 “I  spoke to the OHSA, and they told me they’re only focused on work safety issues. I spoke to the Planning Authority, and they told me to speak to the Building and Regulations Office (BRO, now superseded by the Building and Construction Authority). I spoke to the BRO and they told me to hire an architect and lawyer,” Walker said.  
 “I got myself an architect and a lawyer. The architect advised the developers next door not to excavate flush with my wall. They ignored the architect and lawyers’ letters and dug right beneath us,” Walker said.
  Six weeks later, her worst fears would come true.
 “A noise shook the entire place. I heard a commotion in the kitchen, where my mother, sister and seven-year-old niece were... there was yelling across the entire apartment block. My sister literally carried her daughter outside and told her ‘whatever happens, keep running outside’. Then she helped our mother get out.”
 In that case, everyone was evacuated safely, and nobody was hurt. Other construction site tragedies that would follow in the ensuing years would prove more fatal.
 Following a public inquiry into the most recent construction collapse death – that of 20-year-old worker Jean Paul Sofia – the government has pledged to overhaul construction site regulation. Some regulators have resigned.
 Walker said it’s not enough.
 “If the way forward is to just have people resign, then things are not going to get better,” she said on Saturday.
 The event was also addressed by Raphael Borg, a citizen who asked to speak in impromptu fashion. 
 His grandparents, he said, had suffered a similar fate, with their property “drowning” because of neighbouring construction by large-scale developers back in 2005. 
 “Did changing our flags from blue to red really change anything? The bigshots still control everything,” Borg said. “I never intended to speak before a microphone, but I have to make myself heard,” he said.

Mount Carmel starts closing down: first 100 patients relocated 'within weeks',timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/mount-carmel-starts-closing-down-first-100-patients-relocated.1092733,21-05-2024,"005824.png,005825.png,005826.png","Some 100 patients will be relocated from Mount Carmel to other psychiatric homes and services in the community within the next few weeks, Health Minister Jo Etienne Abela said on Monday.
 The move is the first in a three-part plan to phase out and close down Mount Carmel as a mental health hospital within the next four years, in what is expected to be one of the boldest and most significant moves in Malta's modern healthcare.
 Abela first announced plans to close the hospital last week.
 He told parliament the 19th-century building was not fit for purpose and that every government in history has some blame to shoulder for not investing in the mental health infrastructure, which has led to the current reality.
  He said that a committee of experts had recommended that mental health services should be provided in the same place where physical health services were provided.
 The often controversial hospital periodically makes headlines for housing patients in run-down wards, and former prime minister Joseph Muscat admitted on television a few weeks ago that he regrets never visiting it as prime minister.
 The hospital is currently home to around 230 patients.
 The first group to move within the next weeks will be people with the mildest and most stable conditions. They will be relocated to other government-run psychiatric services in the community or homes that are licensed for psychiatric use and run by other mental health NGOs.
 ""That way these people will be a step closer to being reintegrated into the community,"" Abela said.
 By the end of this year, the government plans to activate phase two of the plan, when it reopens Mater Dei's psychiatric unit, which was closed during the pandemic and transformed into a ward for COVID patients.
 That ward will host a further 30 patients from Mount Carmel.
  The third and final phase is also the biggest project in modern mental healthcare - the construction of a new, acute psychiatric unit within Mater Dei, which the minister plans to open within four years, subject to planning permits and building timelines.
 Plans are already in hand for the unit that would eventually cater for another 128 clients and will be built with the funds previously earmarked for a new, acute psychiatric hospital close to Mater Dei.
 Those plans were scrapped weeks after Abela took office earlier this year.
 In less than six months since he took over the health ministry, he completely turned the country's mental health strategy around.
 In March he scrapped plans for the long-promised new mental health hospital, and then again last week he announced he would close down the long-stigmatised Attard hospital.
 This is a great step forward in removing once and for all the stigma around Mount Carmel and people with mental health problems, Abela told Times of Malta on Monday.
 This way, mental health would truly come to be treated just like any other illness or condition - in hospital, he added.

 ""Psychiatric care and physical care are already integrated in this way in Gozo, and it's a model that works really well,"" he said.
 Thanks to several government initiatives, the number of patients at Mount Carmel has decreased from 700 to around 230 in the last decade, he added.
 The government also plans to transform Mount Carmel into a facility that serves other medical purposes, unrelated to mental health.
 Meanwhile, the relocation of social cases and prisoners (forensic cases) at Mount Carmel is yet to be discussed between Abela and the home affairs and social policy ministers.
 On Monday, Abela also stressed that staff at Mount Carmel will be moving with the clients and there will be no changes to their working conditions.
 ""The government will guarantee every employee will keep their position, their salary and all working conditions, and there won't be comprises in that regard,"" Abela said.
 ""We also don't want people to take the impression that we're going to close the hospital down overnight. It's a cautious process but one that needs to be done.""
 In a statement on Monday afternoon, the Nationalist Party said mental health care was not truly a priority to the government.
 The statement did not refer to Mount Carmel or its phasing-out process.
 The PN said that despite its weeks-long call for ""an urgent dialogue"" on mental health in the context of the latest number of suicides, the government has not kicked off a discussion on the matter yet.
 ""While the PN remains proactive in this sector and has put forward several proposals to address the issues long-term, the government continued to ignore the urgency of a meeting and the sensibility of mental health in our country,"" it said.

 The PN leader also called for Robert Abela to revoke Fearne’s nomination as the next EU Commissioner to replace Helena Dalli.
 Speaking during a news conference on Wednesday, Grech said if Fearne and Scicluna do not resign, the prime minister should remove them from their posts ""immediately"". 
 “The longer you (Abela) hold back from doing this, as every hour passes, it means that you are against Malta, and you show that you are choosing your interests over the people’s. We will not tolerate this; the people will not tolerate this.”
  Fearne, Scicluna, three top civil servants and nine others are to face criminal charges in connection with the hospitals’ deal, Times of Malta revealed on Tuesday.
 Fearne served as parliamentary secretary for health when the Vitals hospital deal was signed, and Scicluna was finance minister at the time. Nationalist MEP David Casa has already called on Scicluna to resign from his post. 
 During a news conference on Monday, before the charges were made public, Abela said it was too early to consider the resignations of Fearne, Scicluna or other public officials.
 Echoing his call for all public officers accused in the Vitals case to resign, Grech also called for the Economy Permanent Secretary Ronald Mizzi to resign from his position. 
 Mizzi also faces criminal charges in relation to the hospitals deal. 
 Grech once again called for the Attorney General to publish the inquiry report in its entirety. He said the PN ia ready to take further legal action if the report is not published.

 The 45-year-old currently holds the role of chief operation officer of the PN’s media arm and has been Michael Piccinino’s right-hand man during most of his tenure. Piccinino announced last week he was stepping down as PN general secretary to stand as a candidate in the upcoming general election. 
 Contacted for comment, Gouder confirmed his intentions to take on the coveted role. 
 “This is an election, and everyone starts from zero. However, yes, over the past few days I have had many discussions with Bernard Grech and other members of the party and came to decision that I should contest the election,” he said.
 No date has yet been set for the election. 
 A former mayor of St Julian’s and PN MP between 2010 and 2013, and between 2015 and 2022, Gouder said: “We all have the duty to stand up and do something at a time when the government is running roughshod over everyone. I feel my duty is to work hard within the Nationalist Party to convince people that the country can be a much better place.”
 He said the challenges were big as the government has taken over all the institutions and is using them to its advantage.
 Gouder served as the PN’s campaign manager during last June’s MEP and local council elections, which saw the Labour Party suffer a haemorrhage in its huge majority. 
 PN sources confirmed he is the leadership’s “favourite candidate” to succeed Piccinino.
 One source said: “Karl manages to bring together everyone who works at Dar Ċentrali. He earned staff’s respect on the media side, as he was leading the team there, but he has also proven himself on the party side as well.”
 The general secretary is essentially the party CEO and is responsible for finances and the day-to-day running of the organisation and is often also involved in political strategy and policy drafting.
 The general secretary is elected through an election within the PN executive committee.
 
 It is unclear when the election will be held, with more candidates potentially throwing their names in the hat.

Disability benefits system to become 'airtight and available to more people',timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/disability-benefits-system-airtight-available-people.1097334,28-08-2024,"005906.png,005907.png,005908.png,005909.png","The disability benefits application process has been overhauled to prevent abuse in response to a massive benefits racket that was unearthed this time last year.
 At the same time, it will open eligibility to people with so-called invisible disabilities such as fibromyalgia, ME and autism, who so far had no access to benefits. 
 The government announced Wednesday the entire application process will migrate online and the current medical panel will be replaced by a board of professionals from various fields.
  The new board will evaluate all disabilities using a new WHO-approved model, which means that invisible disabilities and other disabilities that were previously deemed ineligible for the benefit may now become eligible.
 The new system will launch on September 2, and will also govern the application process of all disability benefits offered by the state.
 ""This is truly a win-win situation,"" Social Policy Minister Michael Falzon said in a press conference.
 ""With this reform, we are implementing all the recommendations of the probe [led by retired judge Antonio Mizzi] while improving the service and making it accessible to more people.""
 The benefits racket scandal largely unfolded around this time last year, when Times of Malta revealed hundreds of people were fraudulently receiving disability benefits they were not entitled to.
 Evidence indicates popular family doctor and ex-Labour MP Silvio Grixti provided fake medical documents to help people receive monthly payments averaging €450 for disabilities they did not suffer from.
 Further investigations revealed the racket ran even deeper and took a life of its own when other individuals began faking medical documents for scores of people, with some applicants claiming they were asked to pay kickbacks in return for a lifetime guarantee of benefits.
 Since then hundreds of applicants have been arrested, arraigned and are paying back their ill-gotten gains. Grixti and four others were charged in court with playing a key role in the racket that is believed to have cost taxpayers as much as €6 million.
  On Wednesday the government said the new scheme implements the recommendations of an independent probe led by retired judge Antonio Mizzi who was appointed to investigate the system in the wake of the scandal.
 The Social Security Department's director general of compliance - George Cremona - explained the revamped online application will become ""end-to-end digital"" and every doctor or medical professional must submit the application on behalf of the patient through their e-ID, which ensures medical tests and certificates are truly originating from the doctor who signs them.
 Patients must seek a medical evaluation from a doctor. The doctor will prepare a medical report and submit it electronically using their e-ID.
 ""Upon receipt, the Social Security Department will verify the application against the medical registry; once verified, both the doctor and patient will receive official confirmation,"" Cremona said.
 ""The application will then be forwarded to the inter-professional board's secretary, who will schedule an interview with the patient. During the interview, the board will assess each disability using a new model to determine eligibility.""
  Permanent Secretary Mark Musu said the new system will widen eligibility for more people with disability, using an internationally recognised evaluation model known as the ICF.
 The International Classification of Functioning (ICF) is a framework developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) to describe the consequences of health conditions, including disabilities. It provides a standardised language and classification system for health, disability, and related concepts.
 The framework will help the board to objectively rate each case to determine whether the patient deserves the benefit, which means some disabilities - often invisible ones - that were so far deemed ineligible, may now become eligible.
 This may offer a ray of hope to the significant number of racket fraudsters who were not eligible for the disabilities they applied for but truly do suffer from other disabilities that happen not to be included in the list of eligible disabilities.
 Musu said the reform also fulfills one of the government's 2022 electoral pledges.
 The inter-professional board will consist of:
 The new board members are professionals who applied following a public expression of interest.
 Musu said every professional who applied was accepted - given they had the necessary qualifications - and enough professionals applied for the government to be able to set up two boards that will work in rotation.
 Minister Falzon said that for the sake of fairness and transparency, the board was not appointed.
 ""It was a public call and every professional who showed interest was welcomed on board,"" he said.
 Falzon would not say, however, what action was taken on the medical board doctors who approved the fraudulent applications.
 There was an independent internal investigation, he said, but would not say what came out of it and insisted that the important thing was that the system had been changed.
 ""The recommendations were taken on board,"" he said.
 ""I'm not in a position to discuss what happened to medical professionals. From our end, whatever is recommended that we improve, we will improve.""
  Disability minister Julia Farrugia Portelli said the reform will assist people who suffer from disabilities that were often overlooked because they are invisible or affect the patients for a few hours or days during the week.
 ""This is a beautiful, positive day that is opening a window of care and love,"" she said.
 ""With this reform, we can evaluate people as whole individuals, not just on paper.""

 The probe by commissioner Joseph Azzopardi found that the energy minister breached the ministerial code of ethics by allowing the ""partisan"" statement to be issued.
 In a report published on Friday, the commissioner agreed with a complaint filed by the Nationalist Party in February over a press statement issued by Dalli’s ministry via the government’s Department of Information (DOI).
 The statement hit back at criticism by the PN about projects led by Dalli’s ministry.
 “Contrary to this government, Nationalist administrations abandoned the Cottonera area and never truly looked to provide environmental projects in these localities,” the February statement reads.  
 Dalli argued that the statement was meant to provide factual information about various projects in the south of Malta, and comparisons were drawn with the situation under PN governments.
 She apologised if the ""tone"" of the statement had been viewed as partisan.
 In his report, Azzopardi highlighted recommendations made by his predecessor George Hyzler on the need for a policy governing DOI statements.
 The commissioner said the DOI should be able to refuse to publish government statements that go against this policy.

Record number of independents are running for MEP,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/record-number-independent-candidates-running-mep-elections.1091738,21-06-2024,005937.png,"An unprecedented 13 of the 39 candidates vying for one of Malta’s six seats at the European Parliament in the June 8 elections will be running on an independent ticket.
 The election will feature nine PL and eight PN candidates.
 The list includes former AD chair Arnold Cassola, comedian James Ryder, cult favourite Żaren tal-Ajkla and former PL Gżira mayor Conrad Borg Manchè, a surprise late addition to the list.
 Along with candidates from several smaller parties, they will be hoping to appeal to the growing number of voters who say they could abstain on election day.
 The nominations for the two main parties feature some familiar faces, such as frontrunners Roberta Metsola and Alex Agius Saliba, alongside several newcomers to the political scene.
 Some names were notable by their absence, most prominently Joseph Muscat, who hinted at his possible candidacy in recent weeks.
 Of Labour’s four sitting MEPs, only Agius Saliba will be seeking re-election.
  The PN’s two MEPs will both be on the ballot, with Metsola expected to be a shoo-in. Malta’s longest-serving MEP, David Casa, will also be hoping to hold on to his seat.
 
 ADPD has four candidates, including newly-elected leader Sandra Gauci. Other small parties also find their way onto the ballot sheet. ABBA and Imperium Europa are nominating two candidates each. Volt has one nomination, bringing the number of candidates up to 39.
 Correction: Abba and Imperium Europa has two candidates running for the EP election not one as erroneously reported. The error is regretted.

"Paternal leave to be extended to the self-employed, Abela says",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/paternal-leave-extended-selfemployed-abela-says.1098410,22-09-2024,005942.png,"State-funded paternity leave is being extended to self-employed fathers or the second parent, Robert Abela announced on Sunday morning.
 His announcement came days after he announced 100 days of state-funded leave to self-employed parents undergoing IVF treatment.
 Speaking in St Paul’s Bay, the prime minister also hinted at potential amendments to IVF legislation.  
 Without giving much away, he suggested that despite important reforms introduced by his government, certain restrictions remain in place and need addressing because the law as it stands does not reach all couples.
  In 2022 parliament enacted reforms allowing doctors to perform genetic testing on embryos and indefinitely freeze those carrying rare and severe diseases.  The law passed with only three MPs voting against. 
 In announcing the extension of paternity leave, he said such initiatives were further steps in the government’s efforts to support all families, ensuring that no parent was left behind.
 The prime minister also announced that the competence of the Commercial Court, the re-establishment of which was announced a few days ago, would also include maritime cases.
 He said the court would be composed of two judges and would operate from a separate building.  This would ensure timely and efficient decisions, he continued, insisting that the court was required because of the country’s economic growth.
 Malta’s commercial court was abolished in 1995 but in 2018 the government granted the first hall of the civil court additional specialised jurisdiction and assigned one judge.
 Abela also spoke about the opening of the new scholastic year and wished students and teachers a successful year, while pointing out that educators are benefiting from 'the best' financial package they had ever had, thanks to the collective agreement signed at the start of the summer.
 He said the government's focus is on improving the people's quality of life.
 He referred to a new €10 million fund for local councils and NGOs to improve public spaces and squares.
 “The choices ahead — whether to introduce more pedestrianisation, whether to create spaces that were more accessible to people, and how to regulate vehicle use, were crucial decisions that needed to be taken, he said.
 ""We must engage in discussions with you before making any critical decisions in favour of sustainable mobility at the heart of our communities,"" he said.
 Abela said that through its progressive reforms, the government intends to improve efficiency while reducing bureaucracy.
 He referred to last week’s Labour general conference and reiterated that the party renewal process represents a new chapter but not a new book in the history of Labour.
 He emphasized the importance of unity in overcoming any challenges that lie ahead, stating that standing ""shoulder to shoulder"" would allow the country to overcome its challenges.
 ""That’s why it’s crucial that we remain united to tackle the realities of the people, so that in the upcoming budget, we can offer solutions, not discouragement. Our focus is on ambition, enthusiasm, and love—not personal attacks,"" he said.
 He assured the public of the government's continued commitment, saying, ""You know us. With us, you know where you stand. We will continue to renew ourselves to become a better version of who we are.""
 Earlier in his speech Abela expressed solidarity with all members of the police force, following Saturday night’s incident in Ħamrun.  
 He said disrespect and attacks against the Police Force by people holding important positions were irresponsible and could trickle down society. ""I expect respect and support for our institutions and the individuals who serve in them,"" he said.
 He emphasized his expectation that the courts would deliver justice according to law and fairness. 
 Labour’s political activity was also addressed by new party CEO Leonid McKay who insisted the government must do more to address domestic violence against elderly parents and the exploitation of foreign workers.

 In a statement on Saturday, PN MPs Ryan Callus and Claudette Buttigieg said that they believe the legal notice runs counter to recommendations made in a 2019 report on local research.
 “This legal notice does not address the problems our country has in this sector. It is certainly not the solution our country needs,” they said.
 Callus and Buttigieg said they would be tabling amendments to the legal notice in parliament to achieve cross-party agreement on how to improve research and innovation – a sector they described as “a primary pillar on which we need to base Malta’s economy”.
 The MPs did not provide details about the amendments they intend to table.

GWU backs restrictions on work permits for third-country nationals,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/gwu-backs-restrictions-work-permits-thirdcountry-nationals.1096349,08-05-2024,005995.png,"The General Workers’ Union on Monday backed the government's decision 'to streamline' the granting of work permits for third-country nationals and insisted that such workers should not suffer poor working conditions.
 Times of Malta reported last week that the government had turned down hundreds of applications by workers applying to work as cab drivers and food app couriers. One of the affected companies, Bolt,  said on Monday that its cab fares 'automatically' increased after it lost a fifth of its drivers when renewals and applications for new work permits were rejected. 
 GWU Secretary General Josef Bugeja said in a statement that the fact that such companies had a high turnover of workers was indicative of poor working conditions, leading to workers leaving their jobs for better and more dignified work.
 “The GWU agrees that workers should not be brought in from third countries unless there is an actual need for them, otherwise they risk being exploited. The GWU supports the government’s strategy on this matter and does not believe that this policy direction affects the operations of these companies as they claim,” Bugeja said.
 “The first step these companies should take is to take responsibility for their workers’ conditions, as happens in other sectors,"" he said. (The companies do not directly employ the workers but engage them through other agencies)
 Bugeja said taxi drivers and food couriers who had spoken to the GWU had confirmed they were unhappy with their working conditions, particularly their low wages and costs for protective clothing and the rental of motorcycles for  food delivery. 
 “All of this leads to a continuous turnover of workers, as many leave at the first opportunity for better work,” Bugeja said.  
 He said the GWU was calling on their private employers to improve working conditions and thus reduce the need for new workers.

 The protest will be held by several student organisations and follows a statement on Monday where 21 University student NGOs condemned remarks made by Prime Minister Robert Abela in the wake of the publication of the Vitals magisterial inquiry report.
 The protest, which will take place at 8pm, will express support for the rule of law and solidarity with the judiciary which, the society said, had been a victim of attack and vilification.  
 In their statement on Monday, the University student NGOs said the rule of law requires that the judiciary is allowed to function without undue pressure. ""Comments made by the highest government officials which devalue the work and tarnish the reputation and integrity of the judiciary have no place in a parliamentary democracy founded on the rule of law,"" they said. 
 The students were supported by the Faculty of Social Wellbeing, which criticised ""insinuations of bad faith on the part of the judiciary"" over the timing of the inquiry's findings. 
 ""This rhetoric is dangerously provocative, undermining public confidence in the judiciary and depriving it of the serenity with which it must be allowed to conduct its work,"" the statement said.

 The vote was taken at an extraordinary general conference at the Labour Party headquarters. 
 Sources told Times of Malta the majority of delegates voted in favour of the statute change, while six voted against it.
 Previously, the party statute said a person who forms part of the party's parliamentary group, which includes MEPs, is not allowed to submit their nomination for the post. 
 The change will likely pave the way for MEP Alex Agius Saliba to run for the job, who earlier this week teased he would possibly contest for the role.
 His announcement came after VCA chairman Jason Micallef dropped out of the race.
 The race is to fill former deputy leader Daniel Micallef's post, who resigned from the role back in June.

 “I appeal to the Opposition to stop these scaremongering campaigns and lack of truth, because if nothing was being done, people would have not had electricity back within an hour,” she said. 
 Dalli briefly addressed Sunday evening’s nationwide power outage during the winding up of a parliamentary discussion on the income and expenditure of the Environment and Resources Authority (ERA).
 On Monday morning Enemalta said the Malta-Sicily interconnector was switched off on Sunday morning for maintenance works on the switchgear at the Magħtab terminal station. 
 During testing of the switchgear at Magħtab, several distribution feeders tripped at 6.08pm. Subsequently, a number of machines at Delimara also tripped. The tripped distribution feeders were switched back on, and full supply was restored by 7.26pm. 
 Dalli said the emergency power plant in Dellimara was examined by ERA and is in line with IPCC directives. 
 Dalli slammed the Opposition for saying little was being done in the energy sector. 
 “It was indeed the Nationalist Party government that planned the interconnector. However, the work on it was done by the Labour government,” she said.
 Earlier, PN MP Darren Carabott said that Sunday's power cut was proof the country was fully dependent on the interconnector that had been installed during a PN administration. 
 “Where is the energy mix promised by the Labour party government? Does this mean that the country is dependent on an interconnector? And that, if it is switched off, we do not have the resources to run without it?"" he asked. 
 He asked for the government's vision and proposals for the island's energy sector. 
 ""Yesterday's was a clear example of how this government has failed our country when it comes to the provision of energy,"" he said.

'Robert Abela is the establishment' - Bernard Grech,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/robert-abela-establishment-bernard-grech.1091972,21-06-2024,"006078.png,006079.png","Robert Abela likes to speak about the ""establishment"" but is unable to tell journalists who that is because the establishment is himself, Bernard Grech told supporters on Sunday, 
 ""The establishment is he who has been in government for 11 years and remains gripped to power, he who used to earn €17,000 monthly for a part-time job with the government, he who uses power to regularise law infringements in  some villa he snatched from a couple, he who controls what is meant to be a public broadcaster,"" Grech said.
 ""The establishment is he who competed with a mother who simply wanted to know the truth about her son's death, he who covers up information and controls the police and the AG. The establishment is those who were found responsible for  creating a culture of impunity that led to the assassination of a journalist.""
  Grech's address begins at 08:06.
 Grech was taking a dig at Robert Abela's repeated accusations this week that the ""establishment"" had taken over the courts and was trying to  smear Joseph Muscat and other Labour politicians with crimes they did not commit, to damage the party on the eve of two elections.
 
 The PN leader was speaking at a party rally in Valletta, as the campaigns for next month's elections are now in full swing.
 He said not only was the PN not the establishment, but it was the PN who pushed the Labour establishment to give back to the people three public hospitals that it had given to Vitals and Steward Healthcare.
 ""The establishment is he who has access to the conclusions of the magisterial inquiry on the biggest fraud in history, even though it has not been published yet, and is using it to make political manoeuvres that serve only himself,"" Grech said, not once mentioning Abela's name while making it clear he was referring to him.
 ""He is the head of the establishment, the personification of it. He is the incarnation of the establishment.""
  If people in government truly did nothing wrong and have nothing to fear, why is Abela controlling and hiding the truth, Grech asked.
 Abela knows who did what and is now trying to obscure the truth and mislead people about the timing of the inquiry, he added.
 ""And now he's attacking those who seem to have found the truth and will expose it,"" Grech said.
 ""That's why the magisterial inquiry should be published immediately. People have the right to know the truth now and we need to make sure the police and the AG are following the magistrate's recommendations.""
 The truth might take time to come out, but it will come out eventually, he said, and only the truth can free the people from the establishment and bring about the much-needed justice.

Unsure how to vote in the European elections? This online tool could help,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/unsure-vote-european-elections-this-online-tool-help.1092745,20-06-2024,006091.png,"With the European elections just weeks away, election fervour is ramping up and political parties and their candidates are clamouring for your vote.
 There is certainly no shortage of choice on the ballot paper: a staggering 39 candidates have put their names forward to represent the country.
 Knowing who best represents your views can be challenging, especially with so many independent candidates and smaller parties in the running in addition to the two main political parties.
 But who should you give your vote to?
 Enter EU&I – a free online tool which helps match your views to the positions of the main local and European parties.
 
 Times of Malta has partnered with the European University Institute in Florence to offer access to EU&I in English and Maltese on selected articles on its website.
 To use the tool, simply answer 30 questions about your views on a range of topics including migration, finance, foreign policy, EU decision-making, rule of law, same-sex marriage, AI, agriculture and green technologies.
 Once completed, you will be presented with results showing how closely your views match those of the Labour, Nationalist and ADPD parties, as well as their larger European counterparts and even national parties in other countries.
 While EU&I will not show you how your ideas align with those of independent candidates and smaller parties like Volt, it could help indicate how closely your political views align with the main parties in the race.
 When asked why more parties and independent candidates were not included in EU&I, the team behind the tool said it only included parties represented in national assemblies or the European Parliament and those achieving at least one per cent of the popular vote in recent polls.
 EU&I also shows you where it thinks you are on the political spectrum and how your views compare to political parties on specific policies such as state intervention, migration and environmental protection.
 “Politicians – especially those from the larger parties – are often reluctant to clearly state where they stand on various issues. That makes it difficult for voters to know what they are truly voting for”, said Times of Malta online editor Bertrand Borg.
 ""This tool clears some of that fog while encouraging people to think more deeply about what matters to them. The option to see which parties in other countries are closest to your worldview is especially interesting.”
 EU&I may be accessed from selected Times of Malta articles or the official website.

"'Biggest tax cut in history' for middle class in next budget, says Abela",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/biggest-tax-cut-history-middle-class-next-budget-says-abela.1097206,25-08-2024,006127.png,"Malta's middle class is in for a pleasant surprise, according to the prime minister, as the government is planning to announce ""the biggest tax cut in the country's history"" in October's budget.
 In an interview on the PL's radio station on Sunday, Robert Abela said the measure will especially benefit the middle class through better tax rates. He said tax bands will be widened in a way that incentivises this growing cohort of people.
 ""We're envisaging the biggest tax cut that was ever granted in the history of our country that will be announced in the budget,"" he said.
  He did not elaborate but said he would be mentioning the budget a few other times during the interview as he was excited about what the government had to offer come October.
 ""We wanted to target the middle class to support it and encourage it, seeing it is so hard-working and motivated to improve.""
 Most people nowadays feel they form part of the middle class, he said, which is a testament to Labour's economic achievement.
 But the lower class will not be sidelined, he added.
 ""If we're really proud of being socialists we must continue to offer the greatest support to the lower class,"" he said.
 Abela also said the food prices scheme Stabbiltà will remain in place for as long as needed, and so will energy, fuel, cereal and animal feed subsidies.
 He also indicated that other schemes, such as that offered to first-time home buyers, will also be retained, saying the government needed to work a lot to shoulder these burdens and relieve families from them.
 He also weighed in on the foreign worker situation, saying a Jobplus labour market profiling study revealed which sectors need to be supported with more foreign workers and which are saturated.
 ""There are sectors like healthcare in which we need foreign labour to complement local staff, but other sectors are saturated. There are enough foreign workers in them,"" he said.
 ""Two of these sectors are food couriers and Y-plate drivers. That's why we implemented measures to stop employers from bringing in any more of these workers, despite the complaints of some employers who were bringing in many more workers than were needed.""
 The government is not eliminating these services, he clarified, but the excess number of people and vehicles is not a good thing either.
 Not just that, he added. Investigations revealed the sector was rife with abuse. Workers were being exploited at every stage, in their accommodation, in their salaries and working conditions. And the exploitation was stark in those temping agencies that registered a high turnover of workers.
 ""The moment these foreign workers enter our country we must treat them with dignity and give them good working conditions, because high turnover is not an option anymore,"" he said.
 Abela was asked about an incident this week in which an ambulance found tables and chairs obstructing its path in a Valletta street. He said it was understandable for businesses to try to maximise their profits, but not at the expense of pedestrians or emergency vehicles.
 ""Lately we intensified enforcement on excess tables and chairs in public spaces. We are first issuing warnings to those businesses who are not sticking to the parameters of their concessions,"" he said.
 ""Most businesses are respecting that warning. The few who ignore it face enforcement. Thirdly, we follow up, to ensure everyone is respecting their concession over time.""
 And this also applies to the construction sector and sound levels in bars, he added. It's ultimately an issue of balance between economic growth and citizens' needs.
 Abela also said that part of the government's plan to prioritise quality over quantity in the economy includes investing more in industries that innovate, especially those that employ few but high-skilled workers.
 ""About 96% of our graduates find a quality job immediately, essentially everyone. It's the highest rate in the EU,"" he said.
 ""We also want to invest in startups. These are often young people who have a dream and start it out in their home, and then venture out in new technologies and innovation.""
 As the deadline for submissions for the PL's top posts closed during the interview, Abela said he was impressed by how many people showed interest in joining the party in its top positions.
 ""We're managing to renew and strengthen ourselves while we're in government. When you're in governemnt and you're winning elections you're often tempted to think that you don't need to change. But we're not doing that,"" he said.
 He also congratulated Alex Agius Saliba and Ian Borg on their nominations, both of whom are set to become the party's two new deputy leaders, replacing Daniel Micallef and Chris Fearne.

 Lorenzo Vella, the head of the European Commission Representation in Malta has died aged 43 following a short illness.
 Foreign affairs minister Ian Borg and prime minister Robert Abela broke the news on Facebook on Sunday morning, offering condolences to the family of the father-of-two.
 Borg said Vella suffered a lot before dying at such a young age. 
  Abela thanked the former PL youth activist for his ""impeccable service"" to the country.
 Former PL deputy leader Daniel Micallef said he had known Vella for 20 years. 
 ""We worked together from a young age within the Żgħażagħ Laburisti, where he also served as Secretary General,"" he added, saying he was deeply saddened by his death.
  Other politicians, including ministers Owen Bonnici, Clyde Caruana and former MEP Cyrus Engerer also paid tribute to Vella.
 Engerer said Vella was one of the most loyal friends and a mentor. 
 ""A person whose wise words guided many of us. You were always the person I called for hours on the phone and you were always there to listen and guide. They say that only the good die young...and good is an understatement when it comes to you,"" he added.
  The Żgħażagħ Laburisti and PN paid tribute in separate statements.
 PN said Vella always served his roles with the diplomacy and care required of such posts. 
 European Parliament president Roberta Metsola said she was ""heartbroken"" at the news. 
 In all his roles - whether as deputy permanent representative to the EU or head of the European Commission in Malta - he distinguished himself as a leader, a diplomat and a committed public servant, Metsola added.
 ""I've known him since his days as an activist at university, arguing student motions and counter-motions to make this world a little bit better for everyone.
 ""In all our conversations since, he never lost sight of that aim, working tirelessly to bring people around the same table. He fought hard and bravely - always. I will miss him. Malta will miss him. Europe will miss him.""
  Vella took on the role of head of the European Commission in Malta in March of last year.
 His career saw him fill top European affairs roles as well as key civil service positions, including that of Permanent Representative of Malta to the Council of Europe in Strasbourg.
 
 Prior to that, he served as deputy Permanent Representative of Malta to the EU in Brussels.
 He also worked within the European Commission’s directorate-general for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion.

Fact-check: Is a power cut deadly to someone with sleep apnoea?,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/factcheck-is-power-cut-deadly-someone-sleep-apnoea.1097726,09-10-2024,"006178.png,006179.png,006180.png,006181.png,006182.png","Claim: Someone using a sleep apnoea machine could die if their machine turns off during a powercut.
 Verdict: Going without a sleep apnoea machine for a night may be deeply uncomfortable, but is not fatal. In severe cases, ventilators have batteries and backup mechanisms that kick in once it loses power. But not using a sleep apnoea machine for long stretches on end could eventually lead to fatal complications.
 A recent interview between opposition leader Bernard Grech and LovinMalta journalist Tim Diacono was brought to an abrupt halt by an increasingly common occurrence – a power cut.
 The incident rightly raised exasperated chuckles from the pair.
 “Do you see what problems the country has?” Grech said when the power eventually returned. “You can’t even carry out a simple interview because the power goes out”.
 “We can laugh it off, but if you’re at home, asleep, and you use a sleep apnoea machine on which you depend to breathe and if it doesn’t work you could die, then when it’s time to sleep you are afraid that the machine could turn off in your sleep because of a power cut, then it’s not a joke,"" Grech added. 
  This is not the first time that Grech has spoken of the dangers of power cuts to people with sleep apnoea.
 On 19 July, as several localities across Malta and Gozo were left in the dark for as much as 20 hours, Grech posted a video to his Facebook page, sharing a story of a person with sleep apnoea who feared going to bed each night lest a power cut stop their machine from functioning.
 A few days later Grech went a step further, telling the Nationalist Party’s TV and radio stations that “someone with sleep apnoea can die: if their machine stops working, they will get less oxygen in their blood, which can kill them”.
 Several people wrote to Times of Malta in the following weeks questioning whether this was true and whether they should be concerned for their loved ones who suffer from the condition.
 To put it simply, sleep apnoea is a sleep breathing disorder in which a person’s breathing repeatedly stops and starts, often leading to symptoms such as loud snoring, gasping for air while asleep, poor sleep and headaches or irritability once awake.
 Different types of sleep apnoeas exist, with the most common being obstructive sleep apnoea, where the throat muscles tend to relax and prevent air from flowing into a person’s lungs.
  Sleep apnoea is far from uncommon, even in Malta, where thousands of people are believed to have the condition in some form or other, with numbers increasing in recent years. Until recently, doctors estimate, around 90% of sleep apnoea cases went undiagnosed.
 Untreated sleep apnoea can lead to more serious health problems, including cardiac issues, strokes and higher risk of diabetes over the longer-term.
 People who have the condition typically use devices known as CPAP machines to aid their breathing while asleep. This device, which straps over a person’s nose or mouth, uses mild air pressure to keep a person’s airways open while they sleep.
 Those with more severe forms of sleep apnoea (known as central sleep apnea) are likely to use a more complex device known as a BiPAP machine.
 This is highly unlikely.
 Sleep apnoea experts who spoke to Times of Malta say that this is virtually unheard of amongst CPAP users, pointing out that several of their patients frequently sleep without the device altogether because it irritates them, much to their doctors’ frustration.
 Others, they say, often go to bed wearing the device only to remove it in the middle of the night.
  Nevertheless, a CPAP machine losing power in the middle of the night can be a deeply unpleasant experience for some people.
 Doctors say that the person is likely to wake up (sometimes gasping for air) and might find it difficult to go back to sleep. Meanwhile, the condition’s symptoms – headaches, irritability, lack of focus, sleepiness – are likely to return.
 But a machine losing power does not mean that a person will be unable to breathe. CPAP masks have built-in safety mechanisms, air vents and exhalation ports that allow users to breathe regularly even if their power supply is cut off.
 Speaking to Times of Malta in the midst of the 2023 cut crisis, respiratory expert Martin Balzan  said that spending a night or two without a CPAP machine may be uncomfortable, but it will not ultimately be fatal.
 Nevertheless, experts say that going for days or weeks on end without using a CPAP machine could potentially lead to more serious complications and, eventually, death.
 This appears to be the conventional wisdom across medical circles.
 Addressing a series of myths about CPAP machines, the renowned Mayo Clinic describes the suggestion that a person could suffocate if the power goes out as “false”.
 “Since the CPAP machine doesn't help you breathe or provide oxygen, you won't suffocate, even if the power goes off. However, without the stream of air propping up your airway, it may feel like you can't breathe, as well,” the clinic says.
 Other clinics and services specialising in sleep disorders have a similar take, with some describing it as “extraordinarily rare” for a person to die because of a malfunction or power interruption to their device.
 Although far more rare, there are believed to be dozens of people in Malta who suffer from more severe forms of sleep apnoea, including those brought about by conditions such as obesity hypoventilation syndrome and neuromuscular disorders like ALS.
 In these cases, patients depend on more complex machines such as BiPAP devices or non-invasive ventilators.
  These patients, doctors say, are likely to suffer far more severe, and possibly fatal, consequences if their device stops working.
 But, they add, this is why these devices are typically fitted with batteries and backup mechanisms that kick in once the power goes out.
 These batteries tend to last for several hours, enabling the patient to safely get through the night even in the case of a blackout.
 People with the most common form of sleep apnoea, who use CPAP machines at night, need not worry unduly. Although it might be deeply unpleasant to have their machine suddenly turn off at night, the chances of it having fatal consequences are negligible.
 Longer-term stretches (usually weeks on end) without using a device, on the other hand, could lead to more serious, and in some cases, fatal consequences.
 Power outages could potentially be more dangerous, or even fatal, for people with severe forms of the condition, who use more complex ventilation machines. But in these cases, ventilation devices are typically fitted with batteries and backup mechanisms that act as a safeguard in case the device loses power.
 The claim is therefore mostly false as the evidence generally refutes the claim, although some minor aspects of the claim may be accurate.

'Blatant lie': OPM on social benefits fraud claims by one of alleged ringleaders,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/blatant-lie-opm-social-benefits-fraud-claims-one-alleged-ringleaders.1094349,23-06-2024,006197.png,"The Office of the Prime Minister on Sunday refused claims by one of the alleged ringleaders of a social benefits fraud who said he was told he would not be prosecuted if he fired his lawyer Jason Azzopardi.
 On Saturday, Roger Agius told Andrew Azzopardi on RTK103: ""I got a message from the OPM. They told me ‘get rid of your lawyer, Jason Azzopardi. We will get you a lawyer and you won’t be charged"". 
 He also claimed that one of Minister Michael Falzon's people of trust made money from the racket.
 Agius, who served as the official driver to junior minister Andy Ellul, is one of five people accused of having perpetuated a massive, years-long fraud that saw people being falsely classified as disabled to be granted monthly benefit payments.
 His lawyer Azzopardi meanwhile told the radio programme that his client’s experience with the OPM tallied with what he heard from another client of his, who is one of the people charged with having received fraudulent benefit payments.
  But on Sunday the OPM ""categorically and vehemently"" denied the allegation, with a spokesperson saying it was ""nothing but a blatant lie which Agius is perpetrating to try divert and obstruct the course of justice in the proceedings pending against him"".
 They added that a number of people accused of participating in the organisation of the alleged offences, assisted by lawyers other than Azzopardi, were also arraigned in connection with this case and no alleged organiser of these offences was spared the course of justice. 
 They insisted it was OPM itself that had ""immediately, without any fear or favour"", reported the alleged offences to the police.
 ""Azzopardi and his client should stop playing media stunts, and if they are indeed convinced of what they are stating, they should bring to the attention of the presiding Magistrate or the Executive Police the name of the alleged individual.
 ""Until they do so, and substantiate their allegation, they both remain complicit in trying to divert the course of justice. This is how justice should proceed, and not with media stunts intended to skew and manipulate public opinion.""

 Answering a parliamentary question by PN MP Claudette Buttigieg, prime minister Robert Abela said the video, called Miegħek f’kull ħin, was viewed by 300,000 people and had 8,000 interactions. 
 The video, he said, was aired on the national TV station and at annual conferences. 
 The video follows the storyline of a woman who goes into labour on a bus, while her partner gets stuck in an elevator at work. 
 Passengers on the bus help the woman contact emergency services and she is eventually rushed to Mater Dei.
 In the video, the various actors refer to public services and government initiatives such as those dished out to parents and the elderly.
  Buttigieg asked for a breakdown of the cost of the video and, separately, how much was spent through a public call and a direct order.
 Abela said of these, €4,500 was paid to the actors, €5,000 was spent on filming and €4,800 on post-production work.

 Norma Saliba has resigned her €72,000 post as CEO of the Centre for the Maltese Language, to become the Labour Party's new head of communications and spokesperson. 
 Her new job within Labour comes weeks after she unsuccessfully sought election as party president. 
 Saliba, who was previously head of news at Public Broadcasting Services, spent just over a year as CEO of the Centre for the Maltese Language - a state entity that was set up one month after she was forced out of her PBS job. 
 She was appointed to lead that entity while seconded from PBS. Sources told Times of Malta she is no longer on their books. 
 In a statement, the Labour Party emphasised Saliba's 25 years of media experience and wished her all the best in the role. It also thanked Saliba's predecessor Ronald Vassallo, who resigned last month.
  The Culture Ministry thanked Norma Saliba for her ""immensely good work"" in favour of the Maltese language as CEO of the Centre for the Maltese Language.
 Saliba said she was looking forward to a ""new chapter"" in her career and would approach the job ""with hard work and dedication"". 
  The ministry said Maris Camilleri has been appointed acting CEO of the Centre.
 She is a visiting research fellow at the University of Essex after having worked as a lecturer in the Languages and Linguistics Department at the same University.
 Camilleri was also a casual lecturer at the Institute of Linguistics at the University of Malta.

 Izak Catania De Giovanni was elected to Fgura local council on a Labour party ticket late on Thursday. 
 The teen secured his seat in the Labour stronghold on the fourth count, with 729 votes. 
 Catania De Giovanni continues a political dynasty of sorts: he is the son of MP Katya De Giovanni and the grandson of the first Fgura mayor Anthony De Giovanni. 
 Speaking to Times of Malta, the new councillor said being elected to the council felt “fantastic”, stressing being involved in local politics had “always been a dream” of his.
 He said he wanted to use his position to raise the profile of Fgura, which he said was often overlooked and wanted to address cleanliness issues in the locality, pointing to reports of some streets being skipped during refuse collection days.
 And while he might be the youngest local councillor in the country’s history, this year’s elections saw two other 16-year-olds be elected. Gabriel Borg Ferrando in St Julian’s and Nina Skye Briffa in Qrendi were both elected on the PN ticket.
 “It’s important there is balance in local councils and youths are good at bringing out new ideas... We need a fresh voice for Fgura,” De Giovanni said.
 He said he had been inspired to campaign for a seat on the council by his mother and grandfather.
 He added that he wanted to congratulate fellow 16-year-old candidate Andre Mizzi, who failed to get elected.
 “It’s brave to campaign in the local elections and he was under the same pressure as me,"" he said.
 His election comes at an interesting time as a law passed last year means 16-year-olds can become mayors, although none of those elected so far have received enough votes to do so.
 Catania De Giovanni said that outside of politics he intended to study law at university and wanted to pursue his interest in DJing.
 Counting for the local elections will finally conclude on Friday after a marathon third day.

"'Baseless, lies' - Abela, Camilleri hit out LESA racket claims against them",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/byron-camillieri-says-allegations-lesa-racket-baseless.1097424,30-08-2024,006268.png,"Updated 5.30pm
 Byron Camilleri and Robert Abela on Friday denied allegations against them in a major court application claiming a ticket infringement racket filed by lawyer Jason Azzopardi.
 The home affairs minister said the claims were “baseless and unfounded”, while the prime minister said the claim that he knew about the irregularities and did not act on them was a heinous lie.
 The two were reacting following the publication of new legal proceedings filed by Azzopardi, in which he alleged a complex racket involving LESA officials that saw tourists being unknowingly fined for traffic contraventions committed by local drivers. 
 The application called for an urgent magisterial inquiry to investigate the alleged racket, which Azzopardi claims saw millions of euros swindled from public coffers and into the pockets of top LESA officials and private car hire companies. 
 In the application, Azzopardi claims that Camilleri who is politically responsible for LESA, and Abela were aware of the racket but did nothing to stop it.
 He also alleges that Camilleri’s niece was engaged as a summer worker at LESA but instead spent the summer at her uncle’s ministry in Valletta. 
 “This coordinated and desperate attack against me continued today with totally baseless and unfounded allegations,” Camilleri said on Friday in a terse Facebook post. 
 “These are aimed at tarnishing my reputation and attacking my integrity. Those who know me know how I've always acted and so I look forward to these allegations being investigated.”
  In a statement, the prime minister meanwhile categorically denied the allegations.
 ""This is a lie and a most heinous fake declaration... and blatant abuse of the safeguards allowed by a judiciary document,"" the statement reads.
 Abela added that whoever maliciously used the legal system - making false allegations and mud-slinging while benefitting from the secrecy of an inquiry - was a coward. 
 The statement reiterated that Abela had led governance reforms that strengthened the institutions in a bid to prevent irregularities. 
 In a statement, spokespeople for home affairs and transport Darren Carabott and Mark Anthony Sammut said every entity within Camilleri's remit was linked to criminal rackets.
 ""These cannot all be coincidences. Byron Camilleri is either corrupt or incompetent. Whatever he is, his position is no longer tenable and he should resign.
 ""If he cannot take this decision himself, then Abela should remove him from a minister.""

"'I didn't know Karl Gouder, we never spoke': Neville Gafà denies threat rumours",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/neville-gafa-denies-threat-rumours.1097917,09-11-2024,006272.png,"Neville Gafà has denied rumours that he threatened Karl Gouder, saying he never met, spoke or messaged the late former MP. 
 Gafà, a former OPM official who now runs an eponymous blog, published a post on Tuesday in which he described Gouder as ""the mascot to pigging out"".
 Gouder was found dead the following morning in Valletta close to the former Customs House. His death is not being treated as suspicious, police sources say. 
 Blogger Mark Camilleri subsequently alleged that police had questioned two people in connection with having threatened Gouder. Camilleri later  named Gafa, claiming the former OPM official had sent Gouder threatening text messages. 
 Malta Skills Agency CEO and former PN MP Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando also claimed that Gouder had received threats, but stopped short of naming names. Pullicino Orlando said he had reported what he knew to the police. 
 Meanwhile, Gouder's grieving family has asked the public for any information about his actions or whereabouts in the days leading to his death. 
 On Wednesday, Gafà distanced himself from the threat claims and said he had not been spoken to by the police.
 ""I never knew the late Karl Gouder. We never met, never spoke and never exchanged messages or emails,"" he said. 
 Gafà said he had taken his blog post about Gouder offline out of respect for a man who had just lost his life, and not because there was anything wrong with it.
 Gafà's blog post targeted Gouder in connection with the latter's bid to become the PN's general sectary - a bid he announced just days before his death. 
 Gouder had twice been coopted into parliament, Gafà wrote, and was therefore a huge beneficiary of PN government favouritism and ""pigging out"".  
 ""The post was simply a political commentary based on facts,"" Gafà wrote in another blog post on Wednesday.
 ""It was a fair comment and I'm considering re-uploading it to shut down malicious speculations, so it's clear to everyone that it was a fair comment on a political figure.""
 Gafà was also asked whether he believed the words ""pigging out"" were too harsh and could have created significant mental distress on Gouder.
 ""Not at all. There will come a time when people will know exactly what happened,"" he said.
 ""The words 'pigging out' have been used for a long time in politics.""
 It is the second time in as many weeks that Gafà's writing has attracted scrutiny. 
 Just last week, writers' NGO PEN Malta said it was concerned that one of Gafa's Facebook posts was intended as a threat towards blogger and author Mark Camilleri.
 In the post, Gafà told Camilleri - who lives abroad - that he knew where he was living and that he would be visiting him for coffee and a chat.
 Gafà had also been previously charged in court for threatening an Italian journalist.
 Italian journalist Nello Scavo had testified that Gafà had threatened him when he had warned him: “Stop your dirty business. If not, we will be stopping you.”
 But speaking to Times of Malta on Wednesday, Gafà implied Mark Camilleri was the true culprit that was about to drive a person to her death.
 ""Ironically, the man who is stoking hatred towards me by saying I threatened Gouder, is the same person who, months ago, almost led another person to the edge of losing her pregnancy and committing suicide,"" he said.
 ""And he did it with a ferocious attack on her private life. Again, I relay my condolences to the family of Karl Gouder.""
 Although he would not mention names, it is understood he was referring to Camilleri's blog posts about Labour MP Rosianne Cutajar's chats with Yorgen Fenech at a time when she was pregnant earlier this year.

 Their statement follows after the Environmental Health Directorate issued two warnings for bathers not to swim in Balluta Bay due to contamination that may pose a risk to human health. 
 The authorities noted the presence of E.coil and I.enterococci and said they were investigating the source of the contamination. 
 PN environment spokesperson Rebekah Borg said the two warnings come a week after a similar warning was issued in St Paul’s Bay. The same warning was lifted on Wednesday.
 She pointed out how beaches in Buġibba, Tigne Point, Birżebbuġa,  St Paul's Bay, and  Xemxija were closed off to bathers last year due to sewage leakages. 
 She was speaking during a press conference held at St George’s Bay, along with PN St Julian’s local councillors and PN MEP candidate Peter Agius. 
 She referred to how the European Commission has already taken Malta to court over the dumping of sewage into the sea. 
 The speakers pointed out how Labour MEP candidates want to keep the European standards on paper because they prefer to cover up for their government, instead of protecting the interests of the public. 
 They pointed out how Environment Minister Miriam Dalli never answered questions on whether the drainage problem is caused because the drainage system is not up to scratch. 
 Borg compared the situation with the drainage system in the country to the inadequate electricity infrastructure, and how last year the country suffered consecutive power cuts. 
 The speakers said the Ta’Barkat sewage treatment in Xgħajra, which was built under a PN government worked well until recently residents noticed sewage in the sea most of the time.

 The MP has stood by  comments he wrote under a ONE News Facebook post showing Prime Minister Robert Abela meeting with staff from the cleansing department and Project Green.
 He said ""the government has turned Malta into a dump"" and that the country was ""full of filth, shabbiness and Indians"".

 Rule of Law NGO Repubblika said it condemned his comments ""without reservations"". 
 ""Those who embrace racism do not have a legitimate political role in a democracy,"" it said in a statement on Tuesday. 
 “Nobody should be considered as 'dirt' or be compared to it just because they are of a particular race or any other group,” the NGO added.
 It said that similar comments made by a private person are the fruit of ignorance coming from racial prejudice but that they are much worse when repeated by a politician and aspiring education minister.
  “The comments of Justin Schembri are discriminatory, racist, and an explicit threat,” the NGO said.
 Neil Falzon, director of human rights NGO aditus foundation, also criticised the comments. 
 ""Mr Schembri, your racist populism is not only repugnant but also detrimental to the fabric of our society. Kindly exit the stage and spare us your toxic presence.""
 It encouraged party leader Bernard Grech, who has yet to comment on the issue, to ""take note"".
 ""We would like to stress that bigotry, discriminatory and divisive politics have no place in our society, in our parliament,"" it said.

 Bonett was asked by his Opposition counterpart to provide details about four separate road works projects across Malta.
 In each case, PN infrastructure spokesperson Joe Giglio asked the minister to state when the project began, when it ended, how much it was originally expected to cost and how much was actually spent on the works.
 On each of those four occasions, the minister provided a boilerplate reply that divulged none of that information.
 Each of those projects, Bonett told parliament, “is part of the government’s plan to invest an unprecedented €700 million over seven years to improve road infrastructure. Infrastructure Malta continues to carry out one project after another to prepare Malta for the future; projects that pre-2013 governments did not have the will or vision to carry out.”
 Giglio sought information about works to resurface the Malta International Airport ring road; Triq Manoel de Vilhena/Triq Carlo Manche in Gżira; Xatt ta’ Tigne in Gżira; and Triq San Ġwann, Ħamrun.
 All four projects were carried out by Infrastructure Malta using taxpayer funds.
 The seven-year period that the minister made reference to in his boilerplate reply technically ended this month; the €700m project was the cornerstone of Labour's campaign for the June 2017 general elections. 
 Erskine May, the UK parliamentary rulebook that forms the basis of parliamentary conduct and procedure, explicitly states that ‘ministers should be as open as possible with Parliament, refusing to provide information only when disclosure would not be in the public interest.”
 A section of that book which guides ministers on how to reply to parliamentary questions also notes that “replies should be helpful and clear and not simply refer to material on an official website.”
 Bonett, however, is unlikely to run into any trouble for having ignored the parliamentary questions asked of him: Speaker Anġlu Farrugia has repeatedly concluded that the Speaker of the House has no power to compel ministers to answer parliamentary questions, or to regulate the content of ministers’ replies to such questions.

 In-Nazzjon meanwhile publishes news from court, where a man was arrested after threatening he would ""eliminate"" his wife. Separately, another man was remanded in custody after being found in possession of several packets containing cocaine.
 L-orizzont leads its front with a photo of the prime minister, who on Sunday said that a collective agreement will be signed for civil workers this week.
 The newspaper also publishes comments by GWU's Josef Bugeja who welcomed the government's promise of strengthening social dialogue and the role of the MCESD.

Sidelined councillor claims internal PN faction trying to oust Bernard Grech,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/councillor-claims-internal-pn-faction-oust-bernard-grech.1091965,05-04-2024,006106.png,"A former PN local councillor claims that his bid to re-contest the upcoming elections was blocked through the “malicious” manoeuvres by an “internal faction” bent on toppling party leader Bernard Grech.
 The claim was made by James Cauchi, who has been a member of the Nationalist Party for 35 years and contested on the party’s ticket in Cospicua for the past 25 years.
 Yet despite his long and active role within the party, even as a member of its topmost organ, the Executive Committee, Cauchi’s nomination as candidate for the June 8 local council elections remained in limbo. 
 After being approached by the party’s Secretary General Michael Piccinino in January to re-contest the election, Cauchi willingly accepted and sent an email to confirming this on January 16.
 He received personal acknowledgement of that email from Piccinino himself. 
 Cauchi said that he regularly communicated with the party’s Secretary General on various matters while he was waiting for his nomination to be discussed and greenlit by the Executive Committee.
 In the meantime, Cauchi claimed he was contacted by a “person close to the PN” who asked him to join an internal faction that was “gradually preparing to push forward a new candidate to replace the current leader Bernard Grech.” 
 That faction appeared to have garnered “majority support” to such extent that it could successfully manoeuvre a no-confidence vote against Grech, Cauchi claimed, in a judicial protest filed against the PN, its Secretary General and Electoral Commission.
 If approved by the Executive Committee, Cauchi would automatically be entitled to vote at the party’s General Council and join that majority preparing to oust Grech. 
 That majority believed that the current leader had various shortcomings and “did not deserve to lead the party at the next general election.”
 However, Cauchi refused to join that faction. 
 He waited for the final official confirmation of his nomination from the Secretary General but it never materialised.
 As time went on, Cauchi continued to chase his nomination within the party. 
 A “well-known figure” also intervened as a mediator between Cauchi and the party in an attempt to help him get a clear answer. 
 But all proved futile. 
 He had never faced any disciplinary procedures and no shadow had ever been cast upon his reputation, the disgruntled Cauchi claimed. 
 Moreover, he felt that he had betrayed loyal Cospicua voters who had always supported him. 
 The term for submitting his nomination lapsed and still he received no approval from the party. 
 In fact, he later found out that his nomination had never even reached the Executive Committee. 
 All this simply because he refused to join that internal faction, argued Cauchi.
 There were persons within the party, including its Secretary General, who were “internally manoeuvring in a subtle manner to pave the path for a prospective candidate or candidates” he said. 
 Such “malicious” behaviour was to the detriment of the party and its voters who were deprived of choice.
 And that explained why, over successive elections, problems within the PN kept growing rather than being solved, Cauchi concluded.
 The judicial protest filed in the First Hall, Civil Court was signed by lawyer Ishmael Psaila.

Watch: Ministers avoid saying if they support Jason Micallef for deputy leader,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/watch-ministers-avoid-saying-support-jason-micallef-deputy-leader.1096338,08-05-2024,006125.png,"Ministers and parliamentary secretaries on Monday refused to say whether they support Jason Micallef's bid for Labour deputy leader, sticking to the prime minister's statements on the matter and insisting it was now up to the party delegates to decide.
 Speaking to Times of Malta as they walked into a cabinet meeting in Castille, none of the MPs would say whether Micallef's bid was a good idea. They would neither say whether they would support him if he were to be elected deputy leader in the September elections.
 But they said delegates have historically always made the right choice and any wish they express democratically must be respected.
  Micallef - a Labour stalwart and former party general secretary - announced he was running for the post of Labour Party deputy leader for party affairs on Friday.
 The announcement was met with mixed reactions from Labourites and party delegates. Hundreds supported him while others - although less manifestly - expressed concern that he is ""highly opinionated"" and ""tribal"", made several enemies in his political life and could cause friction in the party.
 Robert Abela himself was not too enthusiastic about the possibility before Micallef even announced he was running.
 Asked about Micallef’s possible return during a Lovin Malta interview last week, Abela said Micallef still has a lot to offer to the party but also said delegates should not “turn back the clock”.
 ""You asked me about a specific person, but I think my reply counts in general - when your time is up and you've given your contribution, don't come back,"" he told the interviewer.
 On Monday, a few ministers insisted Abela was not referring to Micallef.
 ""He did not make a statement on Jason Micallef. What he meant was that for any party to renew itself and remain a winning party, we must always have new people who bring new ideas,"" Transport Minister Chris Bonett said.
 Asked whether he supports Micallef for deputy leader, Bonett said that was up to the delegates.
 Gozo and Planning Minister Clint Camilleri had a very similar reply, insisting Abela's was just a general statement.
 He also would not say whether Micallef would make a good deputy leader, saying he has to see the final list of candidates before making up his mind and that he had no doubt delegates would make the right choice.
 ""We now wait for a democratic process and leave it up to the delegates. I will support any candidate they choose. I believe they will be making the best choice,"" Social Dialogue Junior Minister Andy Ellul said.
 Finance Minister Clyde Caruana said the delegates are mature enough to make the best decisions, and if they choose Micallef, then the party must work with him as it always has with other people.
 ""Every party member is eligible to contest - whether or not they're fit for the role is up to the delegates,"" he said.
 Education Minister Clifton Grima, Housing Minister Roderick Galdes, Home Affairs Minister Byron Camilleri and Reforms Junior Minister Rebecca Buttigieg echoed very similar sentiments.
 Health Minister JoEtienne Abela and Fisheries Junior Minister Alicia Bugeja Said simply said they support what the prime minister said, but colleague Keith Azzopardi Tanti perhaps came the closest to a clearer answer.
 ""I've been involved in the party since I was 16. Today I have this role but I already know, even though I'm 40, that there will come a time when I should stop,"" he said.
 ""Maybe not stop completely from the party but remain active in different roles. I'm speaking for myself here, and I think that is clear enough.""
 Micallef, who currently sits as the chair of the Valletta Cultural Agency, and who served as Labour general secretary under Alfred Sant, had said the party needed to work on its “coherence and energy” following the result of June’s European parliament elections.
 This followed an uptick in him being publicly critical of the way the party has handled certain matters.
 The Labour Party will be holding its general conference between September 13 and 15, during which it will elect a new administration, including replacements for Chris Fearne and Daniel Micallef, the latter of which Jason Micallef hopes to succeed.

Grech requests police protection for Vitals magistrate targeted by Labour,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/grech-requests-police-protection-vitals-magistrate-targeted-labour.1091792,21-06-2024,006142.png,"Bernard Grech has asked the police commissioner to protect a magistrate who has been targeted for criticism by Robert Abela, Joseph Muscat and Labour media.   
 Grech said he wants Police Commissioner Angelo Gafa to protect Magistrate Gabriella Vella, who led an inquiry into the Muscat-era deal to hand three state hospitals to Vitals Global Healthcare. 
 “The magistrate is being attacked not only by the prime minister and others in Labour but also by Labour Party media - they published a photo of her, and that is dangerous,” Grech told journalists on Tuesday evening.  
 “We are in an unprecedented situation, the judiciary is under threat and that is unacceptable,” Grech said.  “It is very dangerous that the prime minister does not understand that he cannot attack the judiciary but has an obligation to protect it”.  
 The Opposition leader said he had asked Gafa, in a letter, to protect ""all Nationalist Party members, but especially the judiciary and in particular"" Magistrate Vella.  
 Magistrate Vella concluded the inquiry last week, a court heard on Tuesday. Although its contents remain secret, Muscat has said that he has ""no doubt"" he will end up facing criminal charges as result of it, saying the probe is a ""political vendetta"". 
 Prime Minister Robert Abela has also hit out repeatedly at the magistrate for concluding her inquiry weeks before MEP and local council elections in June. 
  Speaking on Tuesday, Abela said he did not believe the timing of the inquiry was coincidental. 
 “In my opinion, it was a message,” he said. 
 
 Abela sought to frame the inquiry as a political issue, saying people would decide on June 8 if they wanted to grant power to the ""establishment"" he claimed portions of the judiciary belong to. 
 He also argued that there was nothing wrong with him singling out a magistrate for public criticism, saying that was part of the ""checks and balances"" role he had to fulfil as prime minister. 
 Privately, Labour Party insiders say the party is worried about a lack of enthusiasm among core voters and fear that weak turnout will cost them their fourth MEP seat come June 8.

 It remains unclear what personal reasons led Falzon to step down from her post.

Jason Micallef given new role in Labour after dropping out of deputy leader race,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/jason-micallef-given-new-role-labour-dropping-deputy-leader-race.1096478,08-08-2024,006157.png,"Updated 3.26pm with PN reaction below.
 VCA chairman Jason Micallef has been appointed to a new role within the Labour Party, two days after he dropped out of the race for deputy leader of party affairs. 
 In a brief statement on Tuesday, the PL said Micallef has been appointed as the administration’s 'special delegate on the implementation of the electoral manifesto' and that he will report directly to the party's central administration. 
 Minister Stefan Zrinzo Azzopardi already holds the portfolio of 'Implementation of the Electoral Programme' as part of his ministerial duties.
 It is not known how the two roles will overlap.
 This comes a day ahead of the party convenes an extraordinary general conference, in which it is expected to discuss changes to the statute that will allow members of the parliamentary group to hold the deputy leader role. 
 Although several people in Labour's orbit had expressed interest in the role, Micallef had previously been the only person to  publically declare his intention to throw his hat into the ring.
 However, the move caused division within the party. 
 
 After Prime Minister Robert Abela encouraged party delegates not to ""turn back the clock"" with their votes, support suddenly coalesced around Alex Agius Saliba. 
 The party's statute presently prohibits Agius Saliba, a sitting MEP, from contesting for the role. However, this hasn't stopped him from teasing his interest, saying on Tuesday that he would support efforts to change the statute, in a social media post that included a picture of himself with the prime minister's arm slung over his shoulder. 
 It appears that things are likely to go his way, as the party is set to ""discuss"" the required changes that would allow him to hold both the deputy leader role and remain an MEP. 
 However, the manoeuvring to ease the way for Agius Saliba has also failed to go down well with all, with former MEP Josianne Micallef coming out against the move. 
 The elections for deputy leaders and other appointments in the Labour administration will take place between 13 and 15 September.
 Nominations for all positions will open on August 23 and remain open until August 25.
 The Nationalist Party in a statement said Abela was so taken up with the Labour Party's internal problems, that he could not focus on the country's needs.
 In this case, in a supposed effort to solve a crisis, he had appointed Micallef to a position above the ministers. In so doing, he was shifting the Labour Party's problems to the government, to the detriment of the people, the PN said.

 But Labour remains comfortably in the lead, securing a majority in 27 out of the 43 councils counted so far, with the remaining third to be tallied on Friday.
 After two out of three days of vote counting, the gap between the two big parties is of 23,000 votes. 
 In percentage terms, Labour has 54% of the vote, PN 41.3% and independents and third parties have just over 4% of the vote.
 The Naxxar counting hall erupted after PN won San Ġwann, one of the most hotly contested of the 21 seats counted on Thursday while Msida turned blue after almost two decades.
 While PN won the majority of votes in Birkirkara, it did not win the majority of councillors, after independent candidate Kaylocke Buhagiar was elected.
 Labour meanwhile made history in Cospicua by becoming the first party to completely dominate a council.
 But in a visit to the counting hall, PN leader Bernard Grech said the message sent out in the European elections, which saw Labour lose its supermajority, is being reflected in the council elections.
 ""Figures are showing that the PN has increased its vote in practically all localities, while Labour has lost votes in several,"" he said. ""People are moving away from the politics of deceit and PR and embracing the truth.""
  The significant gains for the PN meant it won extra seats in Sliema, Lija and Msida. 
 
 
 Of the 21 councils decided on Thursday:
 By Friday evening, counting for all 471 council seats spread across 67 localities (53 in Malta, 14 in Gozo) will be concluded. 
 9.30pm Thank you for joining us today. The live blog has ended and a short summary of today's results is above. 
 We'll be back again tomorrow for the results of the final third councils. 
 9.22pm Birkirkara councillor Kaylocke Buhagiar, who ditched Labour to run as an independent says he will ""work with anyone"" and that ""unity will be the priority"" for him. 
  8.53pm Kaylocke Buhagiar celebrates as he becomes the kingmaker in Birkirkara. His chants of 'Birkirkara, Birkirkara' are almost drowned out by Labour chants of 'Viva l-Labour'. 
  8.44pm The last council of the night has been confirmed and it's a big one. There is no seat majority on Birkirkara with PN 6, PL 6 and Independent Kaylocke Buhagiar 1. 
 PN have the majority of votes with 48%, to Labour's 42%. Buhagiar got 8% while ADPD emerged with 2%.
 8.35pm PN has retained Sliema and increased its majority from 70.7% in 2019 to 78.6% a seat. It now has an extra seat, winning a majority of 11-2.
 8.30pm As expected, PN has retained Mġarr while Labour has held Żabbar.
 8.20pm  Bernard Grech says the message sent out in the European elections is being reflected in the local elections. Figures are showing that the PN has increased its vote in practically all localities, while Labour has lost votes in several, he said.
 ""People are moving away from the politics of deceit and PR and embracing the truth,"" he said. 
 8pm PN leader Bernard Grech has just arrived in the counting hall. It's shaping up to be a good night for his party. 
  8pm One from earlier, Labour has won Fgura, a party stronghold. But we still don't know if the party's youngest candidate, Andre Mizzi, has made it through. 
 7.42pm Independent candidate Kaylocke Buhagiar is on track to be elected but it's still unclear which party will get a majority of councillors or whether Buhagiar - a former Labour councillor - will be the kingmaker. 
 It is looking like PN might make it, with the slimmest of majorities. 
  7.34pm Another big win for the PN. They have taken back Msida after almost two decades under Labour. PL won the majority in 2006 and it was always a closely fought constitnuency. Labour won it with a slim 50.97% majority in 2019.
 7.30pm Labour keep Paola but with a new mayor. Jason Silvio has been elected, beating party colleague and incumbent Dominic Grima to the post. 
 7.15pm Both PN and PL officials are banging the perspex now. 
 Celebrating their '5-0' win in Cospicua, PL officials have been chanting ""you will never get into Castille, allelujah"" while PN officials, rejoicing over regaining San Ġwann, are singing the official party anthem.
  7pm The counting hall erupted with PN officials chanting 'Ole, Ole, Ole' when San Ġwann returned to the Nationalist Party.
  6.56pm This is a big one. PN have taken  back San Ġwann, one of the most hotly contested seats being counted today. The party traditionally controlled the seat, but it went to Labour by a slim margin in 2019. 
 6.50pm PL sources say they expect to emerge from today with a 13% majority. To put that in to context, that would be a drop from the 18% majority they had over the PN in 2019.
 But, it's still early days with this marathon count continuing into tomorrow, where the final third of councils will be elected.
 6.39pm Another 30 years of Boxall? Labour has retained Għaxaq and its mayor is Karl Boxall, the son of long-running Vittoriosa mayor John Boxall.
 John Boxall was elected 30 years ago at the age of 41, which is exactly the same age as his son now.
  6.35pm Labour keeps Marsascala. Mario Calleja looks likely to stay on as mayor. But his colleague Janice Falzon is close.
  6.24pm Labour's Sandro Craus has now arrived at the counting hall and is celebrating being re-elected in Rabat. 
 His party colleague Philip Vella has also been elected - as Sannat mayor.
   6.07pm Labour holds on to its majority in Marsaxlokk and its mayor, Steven Grech, is re-elected. 
 6pm Labour has retained Cospicua and they'll have a clean sweep, taking all five seats. Mayor Marco Agius is elected mayor. 
 Because Cospicua's population decreased, the number of available seats reduced from seven in 2019 to five this year.
 He had replaced former mayor and now parliamentary secretary Alison Zerafa Civelli, the prime minister’s sister in law, who stepped down during her term in office to become an MP.
 5.54pm We were told it was 'neck and neck' earlier but Labour has won Xagħra, Gozo.  Victor Curmi is the new mayor.
 Xagħra's former mayor Christian Zammit, last year quit politics and the Labour Party but returned to the party to run these elections.
 Labour says it won the council with a 300 vote advantage over the PN. 
  5.49pm Labour has retained its majority in Rabat, Malta. Sandro Craus will remain as mayor but we don't think he's at the counting hall.
 5.44pm Labour has retained Pieta. Stefano Savo is the newly elected mayor. 
  5.40pm PN officials are boasting of increased votes across four localities: Gudja and Kalkara, which were won by Labour and Marsaxlokk and Sliema, which have not been announced. 
 So far the (unofficial) results of five councils are in, but we've had no big surprises at this stage.
 5.37pm The PN holds its majority in Gozo's main town.  Brian Azzopardi has been elected mayor.
  5.27pm Labour holds Gudja but there's a new sherrif in town. Romeo Baldacchino will take over from his party colleague Marija Sara Vella Gafa, who ran, unsuccessfully, in the MEP elections. 
  5.21pm Labour holds party stronghold Kalkara with Wayne Aquilina to continue as mayor. 
  5.10pm Lija stays blue as the PN increases its majority, with 71% of the vote. Mayor Anthony Dalli will stay in his post and the party will probably get an extra seat on the council, bringing its tally to 4-1. 
  5.03pm The first result is in and it's not surprising. As projected, Labour has held Sannat, Gozo. 
 4.52pm No results yet but there are some projections coming in for Gozo. These projections show Labour is likely to hold on to Sannat, Għarb will probably continue with no majority due to two strong independents and Victoria is expected to remain PN.
 But there might be something interesting going on in Xagħra. We're hearing it's close, which would be remarkable given Labour had 66% of the vote in 2019. 
 It might be something to do with this guy, Christian Zammit, who quit Labour over overdevelopment in Gozo but returned to the party to contest the June election. 
  4.14pm There's dedication and then there's dedication. 
  4.04pm Counting has begun. But just before it started, we asked Roderick Galdes about reports he was singled out for criticism by the prime minister over Labour's dismal European election performance.
 He avoided comment but did not deny it, saying parliamentary and executive group meetings are confidential.
  3.48pm We've spotted Kaylocke Buhagiar, who is hoping he won't be punished for  ditching Labour and running as an independent in Birkirkara. 
  3.45pm The sorting process has come to an end and counting is expected to start at 4pm.
 3.20pm The counting hall is beginning to fill up and there are a few cabinet members among the crowd. One is culture minister Owen Bonnici, who will no doubt be checking the result for Marsascala, where he was once deputy mayor. 
 Another is Housing Minister Roderick Galdes, former Qormi mayor and the minister responsible for a campaign debacle in Siġġiewi that saw magistrates reversing an order to register 99 voters in unfinished flats ahead of the election.
 That locality will be decided tomorrow.
  2.30pm Vote sorting is underway at Naxxar, which is good news for those of us with evening plans. Yesterday, the process was delayed until 4pm. 
  2.07pm The counting hall opened a few minutes ago and party agents have been finding their stations. Among the first to arrive is one of the youngest candidates, 16-year-old Andre Mizzi, who is hoping to get a seat in Labour stronghold, Fgura.  
  2pm Good afternoon and welcome to our live blog for the 2024 local council elections. We’re already a third of the way through this marathon count as votes for 23 councils were decided on Wednesday.
 You can read all about that here.Today, a further 21 will be decided at Naxxar counting hall. We’ll let you know the results as they come in.

 Speaking on Net FM, the Opposition leader said the scandal has created shockwaves both in Malta and internationally.
 Ex-Prime Minister Joseph Muscat, his chief of staff and two former ministers are among those charged in connection with the scandal.
 It was confirmed during a court hearing on Tuesday that the police had failed to carry out any investigations of their own into the scandal.
 Grech urged Police Commissioner Angelo Gafa and Attorney General Victoria Buttigieg to put their duty towards the country and the constitution first during these delicate times.
 He said any attempts to obstruct justice would be a disservice to the country.
 Grech said the country is in desperate need of proper leadership during these tense times.
 “It is clear Robert Abela has even lost all moral authority over his own party, let alone the country. This is the biggest tragedy. The country needs solid leadership. Apart from economic growth, people also need peace of mind,” Grech said.
 Grech urged all Labourites who want to send Abela a message to vote PN during the European Parliament elections.
 Touching on the incident outside Labour’s headquarters on Thursday morning, Grech urged the police to identify whoever may have been behind it.
 An explosives team was called to the Ħamrun building at around 8am after security personnel spotted ""a small device"" outside it. 
 Grech said he had also asked the police to conduct a search around PN’s headquarters as a precaution.

Malta Chamber questions government silence on ID card racket allegations,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/malta-chamber-questions-government-silence-id-card-racket-allegations.1096582,08-10-2024,006188.png,"A leading business lobby fears that the government’s continued silence about an alleged ID card racket “raises suspicions about the severity of the scandal”.
 The Malta Chamber of Commerce, Enterprise, and Industry said it was “deeply concerned” by the allegations, which it said would further erode Malta’s standing as a credible jurisdiction if true.
 It also expressed alarm at the way in which the lines between the government, public sector and political party in power were being blurred, saying the lack of transparency and frequent turnover of public entity CEOs and chairs was undermining public trust.
 In a statement on Saturday, the lobby group said that the government had consistently ignored various good governance recommendations made by the Chamber over the years in two separate reports. It demanded immediate action to restore good governance. Doing nothing “could be devastating for Malta's international reputation, business environment and public confidence,” it said.
 “Without urgent reforms, the nation risks further damage to its reputation and undermining the foundations of its success.”
 The Chamber’s statement comes on the back of allegations of widespread identity fraud, made by lawyer and former Nationalist Party MP Jason Azzopardi.
 Azzopardi has alleged that the fraud was facilitated by top officials at state ID entity Identita and saw as many as 18,000 fraudulent documents issued. He has presented a 59-page court application to substantiate his claims. In it, he alleged officials were bribed and invited to cocaine-fuelled parties to issue false, fast-tracked documents for foreign workers.
 The Malta Chamber said that ethical businesses were the ones to suffer in such cases, as they sought to obtain legitimate paperwork for their workers and ended up facing higher commercial risk as a result of suspicions about falsified documents.
 The lobby group’s warnings also follow a tumultuous 10 days for the governing Labour Party, during which several key figures resigned, were reintegrated or were shifted from one role to another.
 Randolph Debattista, who until last week served as Labour CEO, is to move to Geneva to serve as Malta’s ambassador to UN institutions there; his position within the Labour Party will be filled by Leonid McKay, who exits his role as Jobsplus CEO just months into the job.
 Malta Enterprise executive chairman Kurt Farrugia, who formerly served as Labour’s head of communications, is now the top official at Transport Malta, filling a post vacated by Mark Mallia, who shifted from the transport regulator to become Robert Abela’s head of secretariat.
 Meanwhile, the Labour Party on Friday voted to amend its statute to allow MPs and MEPs to serve as deputy leader for party affairs – a role vacated by Daniel Micallef, who quit shortly after the MEP and local council elections.

"'Crucial' for the people to stay calm, prime minister says",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/crucial-people-stay-calm-prime-minister-says.1093111,27-05-2024,006196.png,"It was ""crucial"" that people remained calm and did not fall for provocation, the prime minister said on Monday when asked about his concerns in the wake of the Vitals inquiry.
 Speaking while campaigning in Naxxar, a day before the arraignment of Joseph Muscat, Robert Abela said the Vitals magisterial inquiry had angered people and raised political tensions especially because of the timing of its conclusions, which many viewed as a ""planned coincidence"" to influence a political campaign. 
 His government had reduced political tensions and replaced it with a situation where people and families of divergent political views could have mature discussions, Abela said.
 ""God forbid"" that tomorrow or any other day, Malta returned to a situation where people needed ""to bang"" to get their views across. He believed the people understood and would respect the appeals for calm.
 Abela said a strong vote next month was not needed to influence the judicial process. But it was needed as a reply to those who thought that the judicial process could be used to influence a political timeline. Justice could not look at faces or political connotations, he insisted.
 Asked if he was worried about the impact of the inquiry on investment and Malta's standing, Abela said the country enjoyed a good reputation, buoyed by the credentials it had earned in the rule of law reforms carried out since 2020, including the implementation of almost all the Venice Commission recommendations. They included the way the judiciary and the police commissioner were appointed.  
 Malta had also made substantial and credible reforms in the wake of its financial greylisting, from which it emerged in record time.
 Responding to claims by the opposition of ""complicity"" in the Vitals fraud because the government was warned in 2021 by Steward Healthcare that the Vitals concession deal was fraudulent, the prime minister said the government had acted immediately within the context of its contractual obligations.
 The State Advocate had replied in detail to that letter and a legal firm was also engaged about the matter, headed by a person who was now a member of the judiciary. Was the opposition now saying that this member of the judiciary was also complicit?
 Fielding other questions Abela said his government would retain the subsidies on water, energy and fuel in the long term.
 “Reverting to market-driven prices as the opposition wants would drive the country into a wall,” he said.
 Abela said that while the new European Commission was expected to continue to pile pressure on Malta to stop the subsidies, Malta would argue that this was a national prerogative and the subsidies were needed to counter disadvantages which Malta had.

PN motion for police commissioner's appointment to require two-thirds majority,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/pn-motion-police-commissioner-appointment-require-twothirds-majority.1094685,30-06-2024,006216.png,"The opposition will move a motion in parliament for the appointment of the police commissioner to require a two-thirds majority in parliament, PN leader Bernard Grech said on Sunday.  
 He slammed the prime minister's decision to renew the four-year term of current commissioner Angelo Gafa', saying the commissioner had failed in his duties to the people and in terms of the constitution on several levels.
 The commissioner, Grech told an interviewer on the PN's radio, was not serving the national interest, and the fact that the prime minister was failing to heed that widely-held view belied his claim after the June 8 elections that he would heed the message of the people.
 Grech said the police's failure to independently investigate the Vitals hospital deal was a clear example of Gafa not fulfilling his duties. Even though the court annulled the contract because it was fraudulent, the police had repeatedly ignored multiple appeals to act.
 Gafa's claim that the magistrate did not give the police relevant documents did not suffice as an excuse, it only showed that the magistrate didn’t have confidence in the police, a good enough reason for the commissioner to resign, Grech said. 
 There were many suitable people who could assume the police commissioner's job, and the method of appointment by two-thirds majority could work, as shown in the appointment of the President. 
 Grech also referred to a court decision last week, striking down a €600m tender for a waste-to-energy plant because of conflicts of interest by members of the adjudicating committee.
 It was unacceptable, he said, that Energy and Environment Minister Miriam Dalli acted like nothing had happened. Her position was untenable.
 Indeed, there seemed to be a scandal in everything the government touched. The government should have ensured that the committee adjudicating this contract did not have conflicts of interest. And yet again the police were not investigating, Grech observed.
 He said a future PN government would therefore investigate all contracts awarded by the government.
 Referring to remarks by Finance Minister Clyde Caruana in an interview to The Sunday Times of Malta, Grech said that the interview amounted to a vote of no confidence in the government, but then how did this minister continue to approve shady government deals?
 In five years, he observed, Prime Minster Robert Abela and Clyde Caruana had run up a national debt of €5 billion, which was equal to all of Malta’s debt for the previous 55 years, and they had nothing to show for it, no major projects.
 The first thing Abela needed to do was to stop subsidising corruption. And the government needed to stop squandering of public funds which, for example, saw roads being dug up as soon as they were resurfaced.
 Grech insisted that the PN needed to stay close to the people in order to recognise the challenges that society and individuals faced.
 The PN also needed to prepare for the next general election, to be ready for it whenever it came. The first set of election candidates would be announced during the PN’s Independence celebrations in September. This year’s celebrations were particularly significant since Malta would be celebrating 60 years of statehood, Grech said.

'People should ask why inquiry treated Muscat and other officials unfairly' - PM,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/people-ask-inquiry-treated-muscat-officials-unfairly-pm.1092038,21-06-2024,006250.png,"Joseph Muscat and other officials who face criminal charges in court over the hospitals' inquiry are innocent until proven guilty and there is no reason why they should be kicked out of their positions, Robert Abela said on Monday.
 The Vitals magisterial inquiry is riddled with unjust accusations, said the prime minister, who insisted, however, he had not seen the inquiry which sparked a political earthquake.
 In a press conference shortly after it was confirmed that criminal charges were filed against former prime minister  Joseph Muscat and almost 20 other individuals and companies, Abela stopped short of saying the inquiry does not hold water because it was unfair on these people.
  Charges were recommended against people who were not allowed to defend themselves, while others did not even know they were the subject of the investigation. Others, it seems, will be charged just for serving under Labour, Abela claimed. 
 And court experts were paid too much in “direct orders”, he added.
 During a 90-minute tense press conference, Abela again unleashed attacks against the ""establishment"".
 Voters will make up their minds about the way the inquiry was carried out once they have seen it, he said. But they should ask why things were done that way and why the magistrate decided to close the investigation and send it to the Attorney General on the day when nominations for MEP candidates opened.
 Then, they should send out a message through their vote in the June elections. Until then, everyone should remain calm, not fall for provocation and observe and analyse what happened.
 Muscat is suspected of having committed crimes in connection with the deal to privatise three state hospitals. Minister Chris Fearne and Central Bank governor and former minister Edward Scicluna are also expected to face charges.
 But Abela said he sees no reason why he should ask them to resign their posts – nor does he think he should kick Muscat out of the party. He first wants to see the inquiry and analyse whether their prosecution is justified before deciding on whether to sack them.
 “For me, Fearne was a shoulder to rely on during the pandemic and together we braved great health and financial challenges. He was always loyal to the government and the people and he did his duty with utmost correctness,” Abela said.
 The same goes for Edward Scicluna, he added.
 
 Abela also said he has no intention of asking Muscat to leave the party or sack him, insisting he is still innocent and the courts are yet to determine whether he ever did anything wrong and whether any of his rights were breached.
 Abela also said he expects legal challenges to the inquiry and the way it was carried out, and shot down suggestions that Muscat has had €30m worth of assets frozen.
 Abela, again, continuously said all of this was the work of the “establishment” and, again, failed to specify to identify the people behind it, at one point even suggesting some of the reporters’ questions were influenced or fuelled by the so-called “establishment”.

'Stoking flames in an illegal manner': court slams Vitals inquiry leak to media,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/stoking-flames-illegal-manner-court-slams-vitals-inquiry-leak-media.1093079,27-05-2024,006299.png,"A court on Monday voiced “great displeasure” over the leaking of the Vitals inquiry report by people it said were “stoking the flames in an illegal manner”, but said the media was right to publish it once leaked. 
 The judge made those statements as he rejected a fresh bid by the Opposition to have the document produced in evidence in its case against the State Advocate.
 The Opposition’s request was made in court on Monday morning in the wake of the publication of the 1,200-page plus report by Malta Today on Sunday. 
 “This is truly a case of ‘Everybody Knows',” remarked Mr Justice Toni Abela, citing the title of a popular song when Opposition lawyer Edward DeBono voiced the request at the start of the session in the presence of the Prime Minister, the Justice Minister, the Opposition leader and PN MP Adrian Delia. 
 
 DeBono explained that since the inquiry report had been published by Malta Today, the Opposition felt it should repeat its call for “such an important document” to be inserted in the records of this case. 
 “Did you put a formal request to the Attorney General [for the document]?” asked the judge. 
 PN general secretary Michael Piccinino stepped in, saying the party had written to the AG some two or three weeks ago to no avail, and then followed that letter with a judicial protest last week. 
 State Advocate lawyer James D’Agostino said he was objecting to the request just as he had done at the previous sitting. 
 Back then, the court had turned down the Opposition’s request and also reserved strong comments in its decree about the “illegality of how certain criminal acts were being leaked”. 
 In its decree, the court also observed that the inquiry report had no relevance to the subject matter of this case where the Opposition was requesting the court to order the State Advocate to take action to recover the defrauded funds on the now-annulled hospitals concession.
 “And even if all Malta can read it [the report] because a newspaper chose to publish it, that does not mean that it is lawfully in the public domain,” went on D’Agostino. 
 Nothing had changed in the circumstances since the court’s refusal of an identical request by the Opposition.
 “It’s totally useless to have a copy of the proces verbal in the acts of this case,” argued the lawyer on behalf of State Advocate Chris Soler who was also present in court. 
 Lawyer Ian Borg, on behalf of the government as intervenor in the suit, said that they had made a public appeal for the publication of the inquiry report. 
 But the court had already decreed on the matter and since then nothing had changed in the circumstances of the case. 
 That statement prompted DeBono to point out that the government appeared to have changed its stance on the matter.
 “Last time, the government [unlike the State Advocate] did not object,” said DeBono, arguing that the Opposition was being deprived of putting forward the best evidence. 
 Mr Justice Abela declared the court “would not let the media lead it by the nose” and strongly condemned those who were leaking this information to the media. 
 However, he said that if the published document was “the formal inquiry report”, then newspapers had a duty to publish it.
 As it said in its previous decree, whatever the inquiry says does not appear to impinge upon this case, the court said.
 “The court is highly displeased that this inquiry is doing the rounds and everyone pretending not to know what its contents are when in fact all know about it.” 
 The judge voiced concern about a “mere handful of individuals, some half a dozen, who were stoking the flames in an illegal manner”.
 This matter should have been investigated to discover who “this small circle of people” were. 
 “If the state does not have the proper structure to solve this, how will it solve far more serious cases?” Judge Abela heatedly remarked. 
 “I will not be led by the newspapers but by you,” said the judge, addressing the parties. 
 “If I were to take note of what the newspapers say, I would be complicit in the illegality. Whoever wants to continue with this dirty game can do so, but if caught, all must answer,” wrapped up the judge, rejecting the Opposition’s request.
 The court deferred the case for judgment on July 11.

PM 'weak': PN leader slams Abela for 'allowing' Scicluna to retain salary,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/pm-weak-pn-leader-slams-abela-allowing-scicluna-retain-salary.1096130,31-07-2024,006301.png,"Bernard Grech on Wednesday slammed Robert Abela for ""allowing"" Edward Scicluna to retain his ""exuberant"" Central Bank Governor salary, saying the prime minister was ""weak"".
 ""It is such an unjust that Scicluna remains governor. In theory, he is suspended, but he will continue earning €11,500 a month,"" Grech said.
 The PN leader's was being interviewed on F Living TV a day after the government said Scicluna had agreed to suspend himself with pay instead of resigning.
 
 Grech noted the prime minister had approached cabinet with the idea of axing Scicluna, but he was so weak that only a few of the cabinet members agreed with him. 
 ""Many of the ministers went against Abela's proposal,"" Grech claimed.
 ""The prime minister is weak, and because of that, the country is suffering,"" Grech said.
 Abela should have backed the PN's proposal and held a special parliamentary sitting to discuss Scicluna, Grech added.
 ""The prime minister could have had a unanimous parliamentary motion calling for Scicluna's resignation.""
 Grech's comments follow a statement by Graham Bencini and Jerome Caruana Cilia, who, at a press conference at the PN headquarters berated the suspended central bank governor.
 ""Scicluna does not care about the national interest. If he had the national interest at heart, he would have resigned as soon as he was accused. If he cared about the national interest, he would not have continued pocketing €11,500 a month,"" Bencini said.
 During the hour-long TV interview, Grech said the PN wanted more open public spaces in Malta.
 Earlier this month, the PN-led Mosta council announced they wanted to reverse the pedestrianisation of Mosta Square, which, for some weeks now, has been closed off to traffic on weekends.
 The PN leader defended that decision, saying the pedestrianisation project was done without foresight.
 
 ""In an ideal world, we agree with pedestrianisation, but this needs a plan,"" Grech said.
 He said quiet streets in Mosta that usually saw no cars were now seeing increased traffic over the weekends because of the square's pedestrianisation. At the same time, bus trips were being delayed by about 25 minutes.
 He said that the project also negatively affected businesses in the area.
 ""The square will be closed off to traffic whenever there is an activity,"" Grech said. ""That is something that used to happen before the pedestrianisation project.""

PN MPs: ‘Stop lying about  us to shift attention from pay scandal’,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/pn-mps-stop-lying-us-shift-attention-pay-scandal.1101212,19-11-2024,006368.png,"Nationalist MP Toni Bezzina has rejected Robert Abela’s claims that he failed to show up for work, accusing the Labour Party of fabricating allegations to shift public focus from the ministers' job scandal.
 “These are all invented allegations coming from the Labour Party to divert attention from the fraud of Clayton Bartolo and Clint Camilleri,” Bezzina said when contacted.
 In an interview with Times of Malta, the prime minister made it clear he will not ask for the resignation of ministers Clayton Bartolo and Clint Camilleri, despite the standards commissioner finding them guilty of breaching ethics.
 The report by retired chief justice Joseph Azzopardi revealed how Bartolo and Camilleri were both found to have abused their power and breached ministerial ethics when they gave Bartolo’s partner Amanda Muscat a job as a highly paid consultant.
 In the interview, Abela slammed the Nationalist Party for its “hypocrisy” for organising a protest about ministerial abuse when their MPs exploited the system for years.
 “Toni Bezzina is employed with the Public Works Department and receives an annual salary of €51,000. Yet, consistently, he fails to attend his workplace and provides no service,” Abela said.
 Neville Gafà, a former OPM official, filed a complaint with the commissioner for standards against Nationalist MPs, including Bezzina, Ivan Castillo and Justin Schembri.
 Bezzina, the shadow minister of agriculture, said Labour is trying to shut him up from doing his work by defending the rights of fishermen and farmers.
 He said the same stories were “invented” by the Labour Party when it had its back against the wall when the auditor general had found former Labour MP Rosianne Cutajar’s employment as an ITS consultant to be “fraudulent” and “irregular”.
 “There are so many lies the Labour Party government has spun for the past 11 years and has never taken any form of action. It’s clear proof that they are fabricated.”
 Defending Bartolo and Camilleri, two of his closest cabinet allies, Abela also pointed his guns at other PN MPs.
 Abela said deputy parliamentary speaker David Agius spent years without reporting to his workplace. For over 30 years, Agius worked as an HR manager at the Malta Freeport Corporation.
 But contacted yesterday, Agius said: “This is not a phantom job, I go to work. I have permission from the freeport to not report to work when I have parliamentary duties.
 “Everything is done according to the book. I abide by the rules.”
 The former PN whip’s employment had come under the spotlight back in 2020 when then-standards commissioner George Hyzler found he and other opposition members frequently did not show up for work.
 Hyzler said that Agius’s role constitutes a “grey area” in terms of whether or not his frequent absences from work were justified.
 This came after Times of Malta reported that several opposition MPs had been told to start showing up for work or be shown the door.
 
 Agius said he never faced any issues with work regarding his parliamentary duties and that the Labour Party was “recycling” a story to divert attention from the scandal surrounding ministers Bartolo and Camilleri.
 He argued he was appointed as deputy speaker with a full vote by the whole house, including the prime minister.
 “I do my work seriously, so I prepare my work seriously,” Agius added.
 Castillo, who works as a principal technical officer at Enemata, echoed his colleagues’ words and slammed the accusations as “fabricated”.
 “I cannot understand how they spread such big lies with no form of proof,” Castillo said, adding he always attended work and, when he failed to show up, he was not paid.
 “This claim is a false lie. It is a pity that these allegations are happening now when we have two ministers who have their backs against the wall,” he added.
 Castillo said he would present all proof to the parliamentary ethics committee.
 “I can confirm 100 per cent the claims are not factual but invented and are lies.”

"Clayton Bartolo's wife suspected of receiving €50,000 kickback for MTA deal",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/clayton-bartolo-wife-suspected-receiving-50000-kickback-mta-deal.1101574,26-11-2024,"006383.png,006384.png","Clayton Bartolo’s wife received tens of thousands of euros from a private firm which financial investigators suspect was a kickback for a Malta Tourism Authority contract.
 Those “suspicious” payments have been flagged to the police by the FIAU, Malta’s anti-money laundering body.
 Sources said the payments, which are in the region of “€50,000”, were made to Bartolo's wife Amanda Muscat by a company linked to an MTA contractor over a period of roughly six months. 
 Prime Minister Robert Abela took the decision to force Bartolo out as a minister and Labour MP after  Times of Malta sent questions querying the matter last week.
 The FIAU investigation centred on work Muscat did for a company linked to Italian cyclist Valerio Agnoli in 2023. 
 Agnoli was hired by the Malta Tourism Authority (MTA) in 2021 on an “ad hoc” basis to promote cycling tourism.
 The arrangement was formalised last year with Agnoli being put on what a Tourism Ministry spokesperson described as an” all-inclusive remuneration of €20,000 per annum”.
 Muscat was hired by an Agnoli-linked company in mid-2023, roughly 18 months after her job as a ministry consultant was terminated.
 Her work at the Agnoli-linked company ended in December of that year, a Tourism Ministry spokesperson told Times of Malta.
 Reports by the FIAU are only sent to the police when there is a reasonable suspicion of money laundering.
 Investigators suspect the payments to Muscat could be a kickback for the MTA contract.
 Questions sent to Bartolo by Times of Malta last week triggered his resignation on Tuesday. Bartolo was also  made to resign from Labour’s parliamentary group and will now serve as an independent MP.
 Abela said that would allow Bartolo to “be better placed to defend himself” from allegations, which he did not specify.
 The Italian cyclist describes himself on social media as Visit Malta’s head of sponsorship, a claim refuted by the MTA. 
 ""Please be advised that Agnoli is engaged with the Malta Tourism Authority on a contract of service for the provision of professional services within the Marketing and Product Directorates. He is, therefore, not Visit Malta’s head of sponsorship,"" the spokesperson said. 
 The MTA said details about the value of Agnoli's contract had already been given to parliament.
 A spokesperson for Bartolo confirmed that his wife was “given work on an assignment basis” by an international company connected to Agnoli.
 The work consisted of Muscat “assisting” in a number of cycling related international initiatives in Equatorial Guinea, Italy, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, the spokesperson said.
 “This assignment had absolutely nothing to do with Malta and bore no relation with the work being done by Agnoli for the MTA.
  “Muscat was not employed with the said company, but was providing an assignment-based service, as every private citizen has a right to do.
 “Indeed, she fulfilled her tax obligations in accordance with her income,” the spokesperson said.
 The Tourism Ministry spokesperson said Agnoli provides his professional services in the product and marketing directorates at the MTA, mainly focusing on cycling tourism.
 “He has been pivotal in Visit Malta’s strategy to penetrate the cycling world, notably the Giro D’Italia. He lends his expertise to the MTA in managing its branding partnership with the professional cycling team Eolo-Kometa,” the spokesperson said.
 The spokesperson said Agnoli’s brief includes the organisation of an annual training camp in Malta, coordinating the activities between the MTA and Vatican Cycling, coordinating the activities relating to the Giro D’Italia, advising the authority on the international cycling world, and assisting the MTA with the development and implementation of cycling tourism product within the Maltese islands.
 Times of Malta has sent questions to Agnoli.
 The revelation came as Bartolo was already in hot water for a different job given to Muscat.
 In 2020, Bartolo made his wife and then-girlfriend a ministry consultant. Muscat was his secretary at the time.
 In March 2021, she was transferred to Clint Camilleri’s Gozo Ministry and given a pay bump, shifting her salary up to €68,000 a year.
 But in reality, Muscat continued to work as Bartolo’s secretary throughout, while earning a consultant’s salary – including a €20,000-a-year “expertise allowance” that regulations state should only be given in “exceptional circumstances”.
 In a report published earlier this month, the Standards Commissioner found no evidence that Muscat – whose sole qualifications were a couple of A levels and whose previous job experience focused on secretarial work – did any consultancy work for either ministry.
 Bartolo initially offered a conditional apology for the breach, saying “no one is perfect” and saying calls for him to resign were based on “political spin”.
 He did not respond to a request to comment on the most recent allegations but posted a statement on Facebook in which he said he was the one to resign and that the tourism sector had made great strides under his leadership. 
 The statement made no reference to allegations concerning him or his wife. 
 Reacting to the news, PN leader Bernard Grech said Bartolo's resignation was a good first step but ""not enough"", renewing his calls for Camilleri to go too. 
 The rule of law NGO Repubblika on Tuesday wrote to the Attorney General and the Police Commissioner demanding court action against Muscat and Agnoli for criminal association and conspiracy to commit corruption, trading in influence and money laundering.    
 The NGO earlier this month also called on the police commissioner to charge Bartolo, Muscat, and Gozo minister Clint Camilleri with misappropriation, fraud, money laundering and embezzlement of public funds as public officials over the consultancy jobs handed to Muscat as shown in the report by the Standards Commissioner. 
 Lawyer Jason Azzopardi signed the letter on behalf of Repubblika. 
 The Maltese Cycling Federation said in a statement following the Times of Malta revelations that it was never involved in the agreement between the Maltese Tourism Authority and cyclist Valerio Agnoli.

 Bezzina has been under scrutiny following claims by Prime Minister Robert Abela that he regularly fails to show up for his job at the Public Works Department.
 Over the past few weeks, Abela has repeatedly claimed that several Nationalist MPs have neglected their government jobs, often singling out Bezzina, the PN’s agriculture spokesperson, who is employed as an architect at the Public Works Department.
 Replying to questions by Times of Malta, Bezzina said the claims were a “cheap” and “desperate” tactic to divert attention from the “phantom consultant” scandal involving ex-minister Clayton Bartolo and Gozo Minister Clint Camilleri.
  Bezzina said that as is the case with other architects, he has permission to carry out private work.
 Any such work carried out during office hours is taken from his leave entitlement, Bezzina said.
 “Please also note however that in this private work, the briefs are handled not only by me but by 10 other architects, consultants and assistants who provide their services for the same office”.
 Bezzina said any absence from work due to his parliamentary duties is covered by a directive applicable to all MPs who are public officers or employed by government agencies.
 The PN MP said that to date, he has not been informed of any investigation by the Public Works Department into his conduct.
 Abela claimed last week that the government is investigating his absenteeism.
 “This in itself is a clear indication of the lengths of abuse and disrespect of rights which the prime minister would go to in order to divert attention from the case involving ex-minister Bartolo; his wife/personal assistant/professional consultant and Minister Clint Camilleri,” Bezzina said.
 Bezzina said he would be replying to a complaint about the alleged absenteeism lodged by ex-OPM employee Neville Gafà with the Standards Commissioner.
 Ex-Standards Commissioner George Hyzler once described giving government jobs to MPs as “fundamentally wrong.”

Abela: Time will tell whether magistrate kept police out of Vitals investigation,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/abela-time-tell-magistrate-kept-police-vitals-investigation.1093222,30-05-2024,006453.png,"Time would tell whether it was the inquiring magistrate who shut the police out of the investigations in the Vitals hospitals case, Prime Minister Robert Abela said on Thursday.
 He was replying to questions after it was revealed during court sittings on Tuesday and Wednesday that no police investigations had been made. It was also revealed on Wednesday that no police report had even been filed.
 Magistrate Gabriella Vella concluded a four-and-a-half-year investigation into the scandal earlier this month and former prime minister Joseph Muscat was among senior figures arraigned on Tuesday to face charges of money laundering, corruption and criminal association.
 Central Bank Governor Edward Scicluna and former Health Minister Chris Fearne were in a second group taken to court on Wednesday to face charges of misappropriation and fraud. The second arraignment was declared null because of procedural issues.
 Replying to reporters' questions on Thursday  Abela defended Scicluna's track record, a former finance minister, who, he said, had made a leading contribution to Malta’s economic revival.
 Scicluna has refused to resign despite the criminal charges, insisting that no government, Opposition party or NGO can force him out of his role since the Central Bank is governed by the statutes of the European Central Bank.  
  Abela said Scicluna had helped revive Malta’s stagnant economy in 2013 and brought public finances back on track.
 “People know how their lives improved since 2013. Scicluna was one of the main contributors to this”, Abela said.
 He brushed off questions about whether Labour deputy leader Chris Fearne was receiving the same backing by Labour as former Prime Minister Joseph Muscat.
 “Rest assured we will stand by Chris Fearne”, Abela said.
 Hundreds of Labour supporters turned up outside the law courts on Tuesday to support Muscat, as he was arraigned and charged.
 But the scene was more muted on Wednesday, when only a handful of supporters showed up to support Fearne. Tuesday's gathering was organised by associates of Joseph Muscat, but the PL did not dissociate from it.
 Abela refused to be drawn into specifics about the ongoing court cases, insisting it was now up to the courts to decide. 
 He however dismissed questions about whether Justice Minister Jonathan Attard had stepped out of line with his comments about Muscat’s case.
  Attard said on Wednesday that a so-called “gagging order” request by the Attorney General was disproportionate.
 Magistrate Rachel Montebello upheld the request on Tuesday and ordered the former prime minister and his co-accused, including former chief of staff Keith Schembri and former health minister Konrad Mizzi not to make any public comments about any testimony or evidence in the proceedings.
 The prime minister said on Thursday that Attard’s comments were made in a “prudent” and “educated” manner.
 This, he said, contrasted with the constant attacks on the Attorney General and Police Commissioner by Opposition members and NGOs, Abela said.
 On the lack of police investigations into the hospitals scandal, Abela said time would tell whether it was the inquiring magistrate who shut the police out of the investigations.
 Questioned about former Labour MP Rosianne Cutajar’s appearance on the campaign trail (to support a Labour candidate), Abela said her request to rejoin Labour’s parliamentary group was still “pending”.
 Abela said he would not try to “muzzle” Cutajar by putting a stop to her campaign appearances.
 In March, Abela demanded an apology from Cutajar before she is re-admitted into the Labour fold.
 Cutajar was forced to resign from the PL parliamentary group in April 2023 after chats between her and Yorgen Fenech were published.

Bernard Grech urges victims of identity fraud to report it to PN,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/bernard-grech-wants-victims-identity-fraud-report-pn.1097064,22-08-2024,006496.png,"Anyone who has any information on identity fraud should speak to the Nationalist Party, Bernard Grech said, as claims of a racket within Identità grow.
 “If you live in a property and have received letters addressed to someone who doesn't live there, come forward,” the PN leader added.
 “Do not let this fraud go on; help us and help the country,” he said on Thursday.
 Claims of a racket within Identità have been raised by lawyer and former PN MP Jason Azzopardi, who said the government entity has knowingly been issuing Maltese ID cards based on forged documents.
 The lawyer said the alleged racket is “the biggest corruption scandal in this country by a government agency or department"".
 
 The scam also involved the theft of many people's addresses, he said.
 A court found Azzopardi’s claims sufficient to merit an investigation and so opened a magisterial inquiry.
 On Thursday afternoon, Grech said the Nationalist Party would forward the information it received to the inquiring magistrate.
 People with information should contact an MP, visit party headquarters, or send evidence to pnsupport@pn.org.mt.
 He also said that a system should be established to allow people to check if anyone unknown is registered at their property.
 Speaking via phone, Grech also reiterated his party's support for an independent inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the murder of Nicolette Ghirxi.
 Her family have called for an inquiry to establish the facts that led to the death of Ghirxi, at the hands of her ex-partner, who had been harassing her for months.
 “Only through that can the truth fully come out, and can lessons be learnt,” Grech said.
 The PN leader said the legislation to prevent femicides needed strengthening.
 “The government needs to understand it must seriously invest and implement measures as soon as possible to prevent avoidable killings,” he said.
 Grech again called on Home Affairs minister Byron Camilleri to resign over the alleged ID card racket and Ghirxi's murder.

PN wants expert task force to address suicide,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/pn-wants-expert-task-force-address-suicide.1091382,27-04-2024,006498.png,"The Nationalist Party wants parliament to appoint a task force to come up with a plan of action to address the ‘alarming’ suicide rate.
 It is asking two parliamentary committees to meet and urgently discuss bringing together a group of professionals in the field who would be tasked with drafting recommendations and coming up with a plan of action, cure and prevention to address the issue that is causing “serious concern”.
 “The PN feels this plan is necessary, not only for people who are at risk of attempting suicide now, but for the population at large, and while it should provide long-term solutions, it should also address the issue in the short-term, because the situation has become “urgent”.
 Shadow ministers Albert Buttigieg, Ivan Bartolo, Graziella Galea, Stephen Spiteri, Ian Vassallo and Adrian Delia tabled the request in parliament, urging the social affairs committee and the health committee to meet urgently.
 “Also, in light of the fact that this not a partisan issue, the PN has no doubt government MPs will agree to a mature discussion,” they said. “This situation is of serious concern.”
 The latest report by the mental health commissioner found that 34 people died by suicide in 2021, they said, with the youngest being 14 years old and the eldest 73.
 Parliamentary questions also reveal there were 24 people who died by suicide in 2022 and 27 last year.
 Moreover, 126 suicide attempts were recorded last year – a figure which does not include attempts that went unreported – and there were already four suicides registered in January and February this year.
 Experts in Malta often urge caution over interpreting local suicide data as the numbers are too small to derive significant conclusions, but many mental health professionals and members of the public are growing concerned nonetheless.
 PN family spokesperson Albert Buttigieg addressed the issue in parliament yesterday, telling MPs that even though traditional media refrains from reporting suicides, the news still seeps and spreads through social media.
 “This is seemingly causing other people who are going through a difficult time to believe that suicide is a solution,” he said, adding that six out of the 34 people who died by suicide in 2021 were aged less than 25 and three were over 65.
 “The majority of people who died by suicide were men, which means we [men] are more vulnerable, despite trying to show otherwise,” he said.
 “Other people attempted suicide or seriously considered it but remained silent, and others inflicted self-harm, which could also lead to suicide.”
 Several factors drive a person to consider suicide, he said. Among them, lack of mental health and stress coping skills, low self-esteem and emotional and financial problems.
 It is precisely due to the complexity of the problem that the PN MPs are calling for a task force of professional people, he said.
 “Every suicide is not just a loss of a person or a trauma for their loved ones – it is also a warning to society, a message we need to understand.”
 “To us politicians, I say, let us go beyond political bickering and work together for the cause.”
 If you are feeling depressed and need support, or need guidance on how to help someone who is suicidal, call 1579. You can also call Richmond Malta’s helpline on 1770. One can also type OLLI.chat on their desktop, mobile or tablet browser to chat with a professional. If you have been affected by suicide you can call Victim Support Malta on 2122 8333 or info@victimsupport.org.mt.

Malta turns 60: What was it like to capture independence from behind the lens?,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/malta-turns-60-what-like-capture-independence-behind-lens.1098375,21-09-2024,"006499.png,006500.png","Have you ever wondered what it must have been like to witness the day Malta declared itself Independent from British rule? 
 Former Times of Malta photographer Frank Attard has shared two photographs he snapped from the frontlines of St George’s Square on September 21, 1964, depicting prime minister George Borg Olivier and Prince Philip unveiling the plaque commemorating Independence Day outside the Grandmaster’s Palace in Valletta. 
 Attard, who is 96 years old, said that while covering the event he managed to snap his favourite picture from the entire day. 
 “Prince Philip had unveiled the plaque and had let the cloth that was covering it fall to the ground. Seconds later, Borg Olivier had bent down to pick it up,” he said. 
 Attard said that his chance snape of the prime minister pending to pick up a piece of cloth was strangely endearing to him. 
  “It was such a unique and odd photo, to see the prime minister bend to pick something from the floor. From my encounters with Borg Olivier, I knew him as the greatest of gentlemen and I’m very fond of this photo, it's probably my favourite from the many I took that day.” 
 While he remembers most of the country expressing positive feelings about independence and joining the many celebrations, Attard said that for him and the other journalists, the day was the culmination of months of hard work. 
 
 “For us independence had been months down the line. We were constantly accompanying delegations to the UK and observing meetings with dignitaries,” Attard said. 
 “On that day, I had already photographed a ceremony in Floriana and a thanksgiving mass. Everywhere was packed with people. And sometimes after midnight, I remember the fireworks going off and I snapped a picture of them posed above the Triton fountain. It was very busy.” 
 He also recalls the mood for celebration was widespread around the country. 
 “People came out to celebrate big time,” Attard recalled. 
 “They packed the Fosos and the square, there were carcades on all of the main roads - with the big trucks coming out to blare their horns, all the vessels in the Grand Harbour kept its light on to celebrate and every road in Malta had been decorated. They strung lights up on every tree from Valletta to Rabat,” he said. 
 
 From the exuberance of the day to taking one of his most favourite photographs, Attard said he will never forget that memorable occasion. 
 “It was a very special moment that I witnessed and I’m very proud of my work and the responsibility I felt in being able to document an important piece of Malta’s history.”

 Speaking during her visit to New York for the United Nations General Assembly, the European Parliament President emphasised that moral superiority and ignorance are not the ways to counter these challenges. 
 Instead, she called for practical solutions to address the real issues faced by people worldwide.
 ""I believe that the only way to defeat populism, to push back against extremism from taking hold so quickly, is not by claiming moral superiority or ignoring it. It is with solutions. Real, practical solutions to the challenges that people face,"" she said. 
 ""This is the balance that we must find while reclaiming the political centre.""
  Metsola highlighted the need for compromise while insisting that values must remain uncompromised. 
 She rejected the notion of politics being a zero-sum game, saying that industries, environmental protection, safety and innovation, and growth and compassion can go hand in hand.
 “We can harness all the benefits of digitalisation and Artificial Intelligence while ensuring our people are safe online and protecting freedom of speech. We can manage our borders without losing our compassion,"" she said. 
 ""We can adopt policies that are ambitious enough to address climate change and lower energy prices while still ensuring that crucial de-carbonisation policies work for our industries, our families, and our farmers. We’ve done it before. We can do it again. Better. Faster.”
 President Metsola also emphasised the importance of transatlantic cooperation, calling for renewed collaboration between the European Union and the United States in reinforcing global democracies.
  ""Distinct but together is the only way forward,"" she said.
 Looking ahead, Metsola outlined the European Union’s top priorities, focusing on fostering economic growth, competitiveness, and innovation. 
 She stressed the need for both public and private investments to meet the challenges of tomorrow, particularly in clean tech, pharmaceuticals, transport, and microchip production.
 ""Our top priority will be reinvigorating our industries by fostering economic growth, competitiveness, entrepreneurship, and creating quality jobs that show people that democracy means tangible solutions,"" she said.
 ""It means we must be ready for public funding to match private ambition. It also means reducing red tape for companies that operate in Europe, and eliminating silos that have long held us back.""
 Metsola is expected to participate in the opening session of the United Nations General Assembly, followed by a keynote speech during the Clinton Global Initiative Spotlight Session.

"Malta House in central London costing €41,393 monthly in rent",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/malta-house-central-london-costing-4139369-monthly-rent.1099197,10-09-2024,006528.png,"Updated 1.50pm
 The Foreign Ministry is paying €41,393 monthly on rent for the building housing its high commission in Piccadilly in London and almost €30,000 a month in rent in Indian capital New Delhi, information given in parliament shows.
 London's rental bill is by far the highest monthly cost for a rented diplomatic building. On an annual basis, rent costs reach just under €500,000. 
 The ministry, however, pays that Piccadilly rent to Malpro, a Maltese government agency set up in 1985 to manage the Malta-owned building, a ministry official said.
 Malpro, in turn, pays a percentage of rental income to the previous owner, Crown Estates. 
 Arguably the more controversial rent concerns the second most expensive overseas embassy - the High Commission in Indian capital New Delhi.
 Malta forks out €28,560 per month for that property - just over half the London rental price, despite property prices in New Delhi being almost 10 times cheaper than London's.
 Paris comes in third at €17,778, Cairo at €16,766, Dubai at almost €13,000, and Tel Aviv, Abu Dhabi and Madrid at just over €10,000 each.
 The Casablanca Consultate and Lisbon embassy are at the lower end of the scale at some €2,700 per month, Foreign Minister Ian Borg told Beppe Fenech Adami in reply to a parliamentary question. 
 Malta has 39 rented properties abroad for diplomatic purposes.

Justice Minister writes to EU General Court to rebut Repubblika claims,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/selection-process-eu-court-judge-ongoing-government.1094479,26-06-2024,006575.png,"The selection process for a candidate for the post of Judge of the General Court of the EU is ongoing, the government told the Court of Justice of the EU on Tuesday.
 Justice Minister Jonathan Attard told the court in a letter that interviews for candidates were planned for the coming weeks.
 Attard's letter follows a separate letter by Repubblika president Vicki Cremona who on Monday called on the court to turn down the nomination of former justice minister Edward Zammit Lewis to the post of judge.
 Earlier this month,  Times of Malta revealed that, according to sources, Prime Minister Robert Abela planned on nominating Zammit Lewis to the post.
 Zammit Lewis, who served as Malta’s justice minister for two years, now serves as a backbench MP and chairs parliament’s Foreign and European Affairs Committee.
 His possible nomination has been slammed because of his reported friendship with business magnate Yorgen Fenech, who stands accused of complicity in the murder of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia.
 Malta's candidate would replace Judge Ramona Frendo, who has moved to the EU’s higher court, the European Court of Justice, following the retirement of Judge Peter Xuereb.
 Nominees to the EU’s General Court must be approved by a panel of experts before they can serve on the court. Judges serve six-year terms.
 In the letter Attard sent to the Registrar of the Court of Justice of the EU, he said the selection process had been made public at the end of April through a notice in the Government Gazette.
  ""It is regrettable that whilst the letter purports to defend the rule of law, yet its thinly veiled purpose emerges clearly as being that of conducting a personal attack intended to undermine a possible Maltese candidacy for the post of Judge of the General Court.
 ""I will not enter into the merits of the content of the letter at this state, but I will merely restrict myself to registering my objection to this misguided and convoluted letter being considered as objective information from an independent source,"" Attard said. 
 The minister urges the panels that will ultimately decide on Malta's candidate, to treat all candidates - ""whether the person mentioned in the letter"" or any others - fairly.
 It also asks the court to keep it updated on any decisions it takes about Repubblika's letter.

Watch: PN left dissatisfied with committee sanction of Bartolo and Camilleri,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/watch-pn-left-dissatisfied-committee-sanction-bartolo-camilleri.1101640,27-11-2024,006576.png,"Nationalist MP Mark Anthony Sammut was left dissatisfied with Standards Committee decisions about MPs Clayton Bartolo and Clint Camilleri on Wednesday, saying the two merited tougher sanctions. 
 But Sammut's PL counterpart and fellow committee member Jonathan Attard said the sanctions given to the two MPs were appropriate. 
 Parliament's Standards Committee, which includes Sammut and Attard, decided to admonish Clint Camilleri and Clayton Bartolo on Wednesday. 
 The committee also resolved that Bartolo must formally apologise in parliament and refund the excess money his wife earned as a fake consultant. 
 Sammut, a PN member of the committee, was speaking as he left parliament after the committee made its decisions. 
 ""There should have been more severe sanctions for such severe shortcomings. The minister's wife received a salary for work she was not qualified for and did not do,"" Sammut said. 
  Sammut said Camilleri, who is Gozo Minister, should return all the money his ministry gave to Muscat because she ""did no work, sent no emails, did not attend work and did not give any advice to the Gozo ministry"".
 The two PN MPs proposed that sanction during the committee meeting on Wednesday morning, but were voted down by the government's two committee members and the speaker's casting vote. 
 They were also voted down when they proposed that Camilleri should formally apologise to parliament, be suspended from the House and resign as minister. 
 ""Instead of apologising, Camilleri pointed the finger at the Manual [of resourcing, policies and procedures, which regulates the hiring of ministerial consultants],"" he said. ""As if you needed a manual to tell you that your consultants should do their work and be qualified,"" Sammut said.
 
 Sammut noted that Camilleri breached manual provisions when he gave Muscat an expertise allowance which, according to the manual, should only be given in ""exceptional circumstances"". 
 Sammut said that Camilleri's shortcomings were worse than those Bartolo, who was sacked as tourism minister on Tuesday after Times of Malta asked questions about him facing an anti-money laundering probe over separate and unrelated payments to his wife. 
 Muscat did no work at all at Camilleri's Gozo ministry, Sammut noted. 
 ""To safeguard the standards in this country, the prime minister should ask Camilleri to resign, and if he doesn't do so, he should be removed,"" Sammut said. 
 Sammut was standing beside fellow committee member and PN MP Ryan Callus.
 Callus said that only some of the money wrongly given to Muscat was returned by the Standards' Committee decision on Wednesday. 
 ""The money she was given when employed as a Gozo ministry consultant has not been recovered,"" he said. 
 Asked to explain his reasoning, given that Muscat continued to perform secretarial work for the government while ostensibly paid as a consultant, Callus said: 
 ""Muscat was transferred to Gozo after she started a relationship (with Bartolo), so she couldn't have done any work for minister Clayton Bartolo as a secretary when she was already in a relationship"". 
 Sammut said he feared this scandal was not an isolated incident, but rather just the only one that came to light. 
 ""Whenever we ask parliamentary questions about who the appointed consultants are for the ministers, they always say that everything is done according to the manual. If this is the way they appoint people, we have a lot to worry about,"" Sammut said.
 PL MP and Standard's Committee member Jonathan Attard also gave his reaction to the sanctions. 
 He said admonishment was an appropriate punishment for Camilleri. 
  ""The decision was based on the fact that Camilleri recognised the report and the spirit of its conclusions"". 
 Attard added that Camilleri has shown motivation to work as a member of the government so that the employment manual is revised according to the conclusions of the Standards Commissioner. 
 Asked if Camilleri should resign, Attard said that the conclusions of the report did go to the ""extremities"" that merit a resignation. 
 Standing beside fellow PL committee member Andy Ellul, Attard said that the Committee has shown that it takes its job seriously. 
 The committee and office of the standards commissioner would not even exist were it not for the ""courageous decisions"" of a PL government to introduce them into law, he said.

Wasteserv: Court did not find fault with way we awarded waste-to-energy tender,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/wasteserv-court-find-fault-way-awarded-wastetoenergy-tender.1094332,22-06-2024,006607.png,"A court decision to strike down a waste-to-energy tender award decision had nothing to do with the way Wasteserv selected the winning bid, the company said on Saturday.
 Wasteserv said its adjudication procedure to rank bidders was fully transparent and carried out with the help of waste management consultants COWI A/S and audited by UK-based firth Frith Resource Management. 
 The court decision which cancelled the tender decision this week “concentrated solely on what it deemed as perceived conflicts of interest within the Public Contracts Review Board, which heard the losing bidder’s appeal,” Wasteserv noted. 
 “At no point did the Court of Appeal question the detailed technical or financial scoring of WasteServ’s adjudication process. The Court, however, annulled the Public Contracts Review Board decision on grounds of perceived conflict of interest,” it said. 
 The statement is Wasteserv’s first public reaction to this week’s court decision to annul the award decision.
 That court ruling is likely to significantly delay an already-delayed process to build a waste-to-energy incinerator. Malta requires such a plant if it is to reach EU-mandated waste management targets, with the facility having the additional benefit of generating energy to pump into Malta’s strained national grid. 
 The lucrative contract was awarded to a consortium made up of French waste management giants Paprec and local contractors Bonnici Bros. One of the bidders that lost out, a consortium involving Hitachi and Zosen, appealed the decision.
 When their appeal was dismissed by the Public Contracts Review Board, the applicants took their objections to court.
 This week, a court ruled that two members of the PCRB – its chairman Kenneth Swain and member Vincent Micallef - had conflicts of interest that should have precluded them from deciding on the tender appeal. 
 Furthermore, the court said that Wasteserv’s tender adjudication committee was irregular because one of its members, Wasteserv manager Stephanie Scicluna Laiviera, was a substitute PCRB member. 
 In its statement on Saturday, Wasteserv said Scicluna Laiviera “played absolutely no part in the PCRB appeal hearing” and that she had immediately advised the PCRB she would play no part in any proceedings involving the bid. 
 She was not part of the PCRB board that decided on Hitachi’s appeal. 
 Wasteserv said it was issuing the statement because “false claims and malicious accusations” were circulating in sections of the media, implying that the court decision concerned its adjudication process. 
 “Sections of the media have either misunderstood or are deliberately misconstruing the court decision so they can cast WasteServ in a bad light,” it said. 
 “WasteServ condemns such destructive behaviour, which seems solely intended to further stall and destabilise its efforts to deliver a vital infrastructural project in the hope that a losing consortium — with an offer that would have cost taxpayers €200 million more — will get a second chance.”

 Labour Party operatives are approaching Tuesday’s arraignments with apprehension, as hundreds are expected to gather in support of Joseph Muscat, who faces criminal charges in court.
 A high-ranking party source told Times of Malta there is concern that events in Valletta in the morning could derail weeks of campaigning.
 “We’ve run a strong campaign so far and poll numbers – both internal ones and those published by the media – are looking good. But things could still turn sour,” they said.
 Muscat and his confidantes will appear at the Valletta law courts to plead not guilty to charges of bribery, corruption and money laundering in relation to the hospitals privatisation  deal they piloted during their time in government. 
  But while the arraignment is of significant concern within Labour HQ, it is events outside the courthouse that are their primary worry.
 Labour firebrand Manuel Cuschieri has encouraged party supporters to show up outside court, for what he has termed a “solidarity meeting” for Muscat. 
 Both Muscat and his successor, Robert Abela, have sought to downplay the event and urged people to prioritise voting Labour on June 8 instead. 
 Their concern, Labour sources say, is that tensions could spill over and taint the entire party. 
 “It only takes one bad apple,” a Labour minister confided.
 “I’m confident it will be a peaceful demonstration and that it will end well, but I’d be lying if I said there isn’t an undercurrent of concern.” 
  Two cabinet members also played down concerns, saying the hype fuelled on social and traditional media is bigger than the actual risk of commotion, and the likelihood is that all will go relatively smoothly.
 The police are certainly not taking it lightly.
 People in Valletta should expect considerable police presence, and security officials will also be accompanying the dozens of journalists, photographers and camera people who are expected to cover the historic event from inside and outside the courthouse.
 ""It's going to be quite tense,"" another well-placed Labour source said.
 ""It is probably the PN's last chance to really swing things their way this election. The criminal prosecutions have happened and the inquiry text is out – this is the one real wild card left now. 
 ""To be honest, this gathering has left us between a rock and a hard place. Because we would have preferred not to have this situation to deal with, but on the other hand we can hardly tell people not to show up.""
 Another Labour Party insider said he feared Tuesday's meeting will probably attract potential troublemakers - ""the worst of the worst"" - and that moderates are likely to stay away, knowing the seriousness of the accusations being made. 
 The same source acknowledged that many moderates know that a big show of support for Muscat could potentially backfire on the prime minister. 
 Another Labour source who is highly involved in its electoral campaign echoed Abela’s statement that they fear a Nationalist Party “trap”. 
 “They are smelling blood and will stop at nothing to not only paint Labour as corrupt, but also violent. They gave us a heads up with Bernard Grech’s reference to the 1980s,” the source said. 
 Grech said last week that the Labour government was a threat to democracy and gradually reverting to the autocratic style with which it governed in the 1980s.
  Other Labour sources pointed to a post published to Facebook by a member of Grech's security team to justify their concerns about a PN 'trap'.
 Kurt Gatt wrote on Monday: “leave booked for Tuesday tnku [thank you] boss. Invictus”, followed by emojis of a carrot and a banana. 
 He later deleted the post.
  ""Everyone knows who Gatt is and what he represents. If he and others like him intend to show up on Tuesday it will probably not be to have a polite conversation,"" a Labour Party delegate said.
 But shortly afterwards, Gatt himself commented under ONE News’ report of the post, saying he had no intention of booking leave or going to Valletta and that the comment was sarcastic and a joke.
 Meanwhile, the British Foreign Office issued an alert on Monday in connection with the demonstrations near the Courts of Justice in Republic Street under the 'Warnings and insurance' page.
 ""Demonstrations in Malta are rare and generally peaceful. In the event of a demonstration, visitors should take sensible precautions and avoid crowds,"" the UK government said. 
 The Italian government said that due to the possible demonstrations that could occur in the vicinity of the court building, maximum caution is recommended and Italian nationals are invited to follow the instructions provided by the Maltese police authorities.

PM urges withdrawal of foreign forces from Libya at UN General Assembly debate,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/watch-live-robert-abela-addresses-un-general-assembly-debate.1098710,27-09-2024,006687.png,"Updated 8.30pm
 Prime Minister Robert Abela on Friday called for the immediate withdrawal of all foreign forces from Libya as he addressed a UN General Assembly debate in New York.
 In his address, Abela said helping Libyans find a lasting solution to their institutional crisis would benefit the wider region.
 Abela was participating in the annual debate which this year discussed solutions to global challenges to advance peace, security, and sustainable development.
 
 He said Malta had a unique political and geographical position: it was a bridge between Europe and North Africa, and at a crossroads between Europe and the Middle East. The island was a full member of the EU, but with neutrality enshrined in its constitution, he added.
 ""We are acutely aware of the responsibility this position brings. Two words sum up the role I believe Malta can and does play: Honest broker.
 ""From hosting peace talks to brokering difficult dialogues, we aim to harness our position to bring those in conflict together to at least try and find a way forward,"" he said.
 Abela added that, understandably, much of the world’s attention has been on the Israel/Gaza conflict since October 7 - a conflict that has ""expanded to a dangerous and deeply worrying escalation in Lebanon"".
 He called for ""decisive steps"" to resolve this conflict before it was too late while urging the global community not to lose sight of the killing of civilians in Sudan, Yemen, Syria and Ukraine.
 ""Let me turn to another country in conflict. Malta’s southern neighbour – Libya.
 ""Helping the Libyan people achieve a genuine and lasting resolution to the institutional crisis - for which they have paid too high a price for too long – is a key priority for Malta,"" he said.
 Abela said such a resolution would not only benefit the Libyan people but also the country's neighbours and the wider region.
 ""Only with a single functioning government - supported by citizens across the whole country - can Libya play its full part in addressing the migrant crisis which puts so many lives at risk.
 ""As friends and neighbours of Libya, we can and must help. But for the process to truly succeed, it must be Libyan-led and Libyan-owned,"" he warned.
 ""We unequivocally call for the immediate withdrawal of all foreign forces, fighters and mercenaries from Libya. Malta re-emphasises the need for a full implementation/impletion of the Libyan arms embargo in line with all the relevant Security Council resolutions.""
 Referring to climatic challenges, Abela said Malta knew just how much small island nations could be impacted by increasingly warm oceans and rising sea levels.
 ""We, small island nations, are among the lowest emitters of greenhouse gases, but we are at the frontline of the climate emergency.
 ""The impact of climate change will be felt by all our citizens. It is our duty to them to do all we can to minimise that change and maximise our resilience to the changes already being felt. Delay and prevarication simply aren’t options. Climate change must remain at the top of the global agenda.""
 Solidarity, he said, meant actions, not just words.
 The Islands for Islands initiative was central to the island's foreign policy, he said, adding the initiative provided concrete, practical assistance to Small Island Developing States.
 ""That’s why Malta has jointly taken the lead in developing the Climate Vulnerability and Resilience Index – a practical resource to help small islands identify and prepare better for the effects of the changing climate.
 ""As sea levels become an ever greater concern, so does the health of our seas and oceans become ever greater a priority. Malta remains, and will always remain, at the forefront of efforts to protect our oceans,"" he said, adding that, among others, Malta had successfully launched a shore-to-ship initiative that allowed cruise liners to plug into Malta’s electric grid when docked at the main harbour.

"People still want Labour, they just want a better version of it – Norma Saliba",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/people-still-want-labour-want-better-version-norma-saliba.1098018,14-09-2024,006717.png,"People still want Labour, but they are looking for a better version of it, according to party president hopeful Norma Saliba.
 Analysing the cause behind the PL seeing backsliding support during the June MEP elections, Saliba said it was normal for the government to see a dip in popularity during mid-term elections, though the party should still carefully analyse the cause behind the significant dip in support.
 “The peoples’ message was clear: They want Labour, but they want a better version of it,” Saliba told Times of Malta. 
 Saliba declined the offer of an in-person interview. 
 “The Prime Minister heeded that message and lost no time in embarking on a wide and deep renewal of the Labour Party. In the coming days, there will be a new party administration and two new deputy leaders,” she said.
 The message was also clear that the party must put greater emphasis on listening to its grassroots and involve them more deeply in decision-making.
 It is also critical for the party to pay close attention to environmental sustainability, quality of life, overpopulation, and work-life balance, she said.
 “These issues are increasingly important to our constituents and addressing them effectively is essential for our continued relevance.”
 
 And how would she go about achieving this as party president? Saliba said her first step would be to strengthen the party’s internal structures for more efficient organisation.
 She would also focus on bringing the more diverse aspects of the party, including veterans, youth and women, into committee structures to ensure inclusive representation at party level.
 Critically, she said that delegates’ feedback will be incorporated into the party’s strategy and decisions, while also working on an overhaul of the party’s communications.
 Saliba, a veteran broadcaster and former TVM head of news, is vying for the party’s senior job along with lawyer Alex Sciberras. But her candidacy hasn’t been without its opponents.
 Addressing the idea that some within the PL were aggrieved when they felt discouraged by the party from contesting these internal roles, Saliba dismissed this as “PN spin”.
 “In my daily encounters with delegates and party activists, I can vouch that they are all eager to participate further within the party and its structures and the doors are wide open,” she said. 
 “Of course, there may be various perspectives on how certain roles within the party are filled. However, the process is always guided by a commitment to fairness, transparency, and the overall strength of the party.”
 And what of chatter that she is Robert Abela’s chosen candidate and Sciberras is Joseph Muscat’s?
 “Ours is a contest among friends,” Saliba said. 
 “I am contesting because I believe in what we can achieve together. My sole focus is that of serving the party and its members. I am committed to working with everyone, to ensure we continue moving forward as a united team.”
 Saliba again dismissed as “PN spin” criticism that her candidacy was proof of bias from TVM in favour of the government, and conversely against the opposition.
 “They seem to be very uncomfortable that a woman, with nearly 30 years of experience in broadcasting and communications, is contesting for a top post within the Labour Party,” she said.
 “I can confidently say that throughout my tenure, I was committed to upholding journalistic standards and ensuring that TVM served the public interest.”
 She said that under her watch TVM always sought balanced and fair coverage and that during the 2022 election campaign, the station received no complaints from the PN or any other party.
 “My candidacy for this position is grounded in my extensive experience and commitment to public service, rather than any perceived biases.”
 Saliba said that she had previously been a PL party member but suspended her membership while heading the PBS newsroom.
 “My commitment to the values and principles of the Labour Party have always been clear. My decision to seek this position is driven by my desire to serve and to ensure the party remains strong, united, and forward-thinking,” Saliba said.
 “I am confident that my experience, both inside and outside the party, puts me in a good position to take on this huge responsibility.”
 Asked what she intends to do differently from her predecessors, Saliba says sitting president Ramona Attard left a strong body of work to build upon, but again stressed the need to involve the grassroots more deeply in party operations.
 “We need to create more opportunities for members to be actively involved in shaping the party’s policies and direction. This means creating a culture of open dialogue, where ideas from all levels of the party are considered and acted upon,” she said.
 At a time when the public demands more openness from political institutions, Saliba also said she will strive for a stronger emphasis on transparency and communication.
 Saliba said her personal goal for the role is to leverage her experience to grow the party and strengthen its cohesion.
 “I grew up within this party and witnessed its evolution, therefore I am deeply committed to seeing it united and strong once again,” she said.
 “My goal is to build on our collective strengths, address any challenges head-on, and ensure we present a unified and forward-looking vision to the electorate.”

"Council elections: PN retakes Siġġiewi, Mosta, but Labour wins by 20k votes",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/live-blog-final-round-local-council-election-counting.1093965,15-06-2024,"006720.png,006721.png,006722.png,006723.png,006724.png,006725.png,006726.png,006727.png,006728.png,006729.png,006730.png,006731.png,006732.png,006733.png,006734.png,006735.png","Updated 9.30pm
 The Nationalist Party retook local councils in Mosta and Siġġiewi and significantly ate into Labour’s majority in a number of other councils during a final day of vote counting on Friday.
 Labour celebrated its overall win in the elections – it won roughly 20,000 more votes with a 52% majority and controls a significant majority of councils – but the party was shaken as it haemorrhaged votes in multiple localities across Malta and Gozo.
 In previous council elections held in 2019, Labour won by a record 47,000 votes. 
 It was the second time in a week that Labour saw its electoral lead slashed, though the scale of the swing in council elections was smaller than that registered in MEP elections, which it won by just 8,400 votes. 
 Speaking on Friday evening, Nationalist leader Bernard Grech said the party had achieved its targets and that it was clear that “people are clamouring for change”.
 Labour leader Robert Abela noted that his party had won a 52.1% overall majority but acknowledged that voters were displeased.
 “People want the Labour Party, but they want a renewed Labour Party,” he wrote on social media.
 
 
 ADPD’s Ralph Cassar nabbed a seat in Attard and independent candidates Conrad Borg Manche and Nigel Holland were elected in Gżira and Floriana respectively, as independent and third-party candidates increased their vote share.
 The PN gained a seat in Santa Luċija, a Labour stronghold, and managed to flip Żebbuġ (Gozo) to blue. It also increased its share of votes in various other towns and villages, including Qala, Munxar and Għargħur.
 Victory in Siġġiewi, which had flipped to Labour in 2019, was greeted with cheers and placards bearing an image of social housing minister Roderick Galdes with the tagline 'Prosit Ministru! (Well done, Minister!). Galdes was responsible for an embarrassing relocation debacle in the town that left Labour with egg on its face during the campaign. 
 Labour secured an additional seat in Kirkop, which is now split 4-1 in its favour, and also retained its majority in Gżira despite Borg Manche, Gżira’s former mayor, quitting the party. While he was elected, the seat he gained came at the PN’s expense.
 
 Floriana, which in 2019 went Labour’s way 3-2, will be a hung council: the two parties managed two seats apiece as independent candidates, led by Holland, ate into the vote.
  Mtarfa voted for a 20-year-old mayor in Labour's Dale Hayman. Mayors in Swieqi, Attard, Ħamrun, Qormi, Senglea, Xgħajra and Safi were all reelected. 
 It was another night to remember for Luqa mayor John Schembri and Vittoriosa mayor John Boxall, two of Malta’s longest-serving councillors. The two have served for 27 and 30 years respectively.
 
 Boxall's son, Karl, was elected mayor of Għaxaq on Thursday. 
 And in Naxxar, a new political dynasty could be in the making after Chris Deguara, the son of former PN MPs Louis and Maria Deguara, stormed to the mayorship with a majority of the votes.
  Please refresh for constant updates
 These are the 23 councils decided on Friday:
 9.11pm This live blog will end here, though our electoral coverage won't. We'll be bringing you a full breakdown of the results and our analysis of them in the coming days. 
 Thank you for having joined us over the past week.
 8.50pm Robert Abela is being interviewed on Labour TV station ONE, and he spoke soberly about the elections. 
 ""People still trust Labour to advance progressive politics. Now we have a responsibility to be the best possible versions of ourselves,"" he said. 
 But Abela said it was clear that people had shown that ""its themes, not parties that they want to see discussed"". He also spoke positively about the overall sense of respect that was maintained between parties throughout the campaign and vote-counting process. 
 8.35pm Both parties have confirmed it to us: Floriana's council will be split 2-2-1, with former mayor and independent candidate Nigel Holland as the fulcrum around which all will turn. Labour won most votes but it could not get that crucial third seat. 
 Last time round, the council went Labour's way. 
 8.31pm They say all publicity is good publicity, and that seems to be the case for Swieqi's Jordan Galea Pace. 
 The young candidate made headlines for all the wrong reasons when he ended up with broken arms following a cycling mishap. But that's all behind him now - Galea Pace will serve as Swieqi's deputy mayor, we're told. 
  8.24pm Assuming that Floriana will end with a hung council, that means Labour has won a majority in 39 local councils versus the 24 that will be PN-led. 
 Four councils ended without any single party getting a majority of seats. 
 Correction 9.01pm: We previously miscalculated and reported that Labour won 40.
 8.09pm Robert Abela has also offered his views, via social media.
 ""The people have once again decided and gave PL an absolute majority of 52.1% . Every locality has given us an opportunity to listen to its message. Despite this strong result, PL will remain close to the people.  People want the Labour Party but they want a renewed Labour Party.""
  8.03pm PN leader Bernard Grech returned to the counting hall on Friday evening and said he was pleased with the way results had gone. 
 ""PN has reached its target and reduced a PL majority of 47,000 votes in 2019 to around 20,000. We need to continue working towards freer elections. People are clamouring change,"" he said. 
 7.57pm The two big parties dominate the headlines, but there were quiet and significant gains for independent candidates and third parties, too. 
 It appears their vote share has gone up from 2.2% in 2019 to 3.6% this time round. 
 7.54pm We're still waiting for official results, but both parties are now concurring: Labour got roughly 20,000 more votes across all local councils, but the PN has massively cut the 2019 gap (which was its worst-ever showing in council elections). 
 The gap between parties now stands at 7.8%, versus the 18.1% registered five years ago. 
 7.49pm Official tallies are not yet out, but PN sources say that in Mosta - its biggest coup of the night - the party turned what was a 341-vote deficit last time round into a 1,512 vote victory this time round.
 The scale of that swing becomes evident when you keep in mind that around 12,000 people voted there. 
 7.41pm Earlier, in the rush to report we did not mention the mayors of Swieqi and Attard (both PN). 
 Noel Muscat and Stefan Cordina have been reelected mayors in both those localities respectively.
 7.39pm Vote counting is still going on in Floriana, which is looking increasingly likely to end up with a 2-2-1 split. As we mentioned earlier, Nigel Holland could end up as kingmaker. 
 7.36pm Sources within the Labour Party tell us that they believe they have won the local councils elections with a 52% - 44% split. 
 In vote terms, that amounts to a roughly 20,000 vote gap. 
 By way of comparison, in 2019 the gap stood at 58%-40% and 47,000 votes.
 7.31pm Labour has retained its majority in Ħamrun, with Christian Sammut reelected mayor. In 2019, Labour won 62% of the vote and five out of seven available seats here. 
 7.27am We were told democracy was a dignified form of government. Whoever made that claim never made it to the Naxxar counting hall. 
 It's all degenerated into something more akin to a football stadium here, with both sides chanting at the other as police officers watch with bemusement. 
   7.23pm Labour has held onto Qormi, which it won in 2019 7-4 with 65% of the vote. 
 Joseph Masini Vento has been reelected mayor there.  It seems an attempt to damage his campaign by leaking a video of him calling Miriam Dalli an ""incompetent clown"" fell short. 
 7.22pm Chris Deguara, who will serve as Naxxar's new PN mayor, is the son of Louis and Maria Deguara. Both his parents served in parliament as MPs, with his father having also been health minister. 
 7.14pm Finally, it’s official: PN has retaken the Mosta local council. After its Siġġiewi rout, it’s another significant and symbolic win for the PN.
 It seems Joseph Gatt will serve as Mosta mayor. 
 The party has won both battleground localities being decided today and taken control of Żebbuġ (Gozo) so far – and there are still a few councils to be adjudicated. 
 As happened on Wednesday and Thursday, PN delegates erupt into cheers of ""It-tsunami, it-tsunami ħej ħej"", mocking former Labour PM Joseph Muscat, who likened himself to a ""tsunami washing away a castle built on sand"". 
  7.06pm Earlier (see our 6pm entry) we reported that Labour has once again won a majority in Santa Luċija. What we did not tell you is that it lost a significant amount of votes there - enough for it to lose a seat to the PN. 
 Its council, which in 2019 was split 4-1 in Labour's favour, will now be a 3-2 one. 
 7.03pm PN has retained its majority in Għargħur, which it also won in 2019 (3-2, with 54% of the vote). And it looks like it has increased its share of the vote.
 Helen Gauci, the incumbent mayor, has been reelected.
  7pm We keep hearing from various PN sources that the party has won a majority in Mosta, reversing its 2019 disappointment there. But officially, delegates are still being cautious and have not yet formally called it. 
 6.58pm Labour has retained its majority in Luqa. No surprises there. John Schembri (father of Economy Minister Silvio Schembri) will continue to serve as its mayor, as he has done for the past 27 years.
 In 2019, the town went Labour's way 5-2, with 74% of the vote.
 6.53pm We reported that PN has retaken Mosta. That is incorrect (at this stage): the party has held onto Naxxar, as it was expected to do. Chris Deguara will serve as mayor, taking over from Anne Marie Muscat Fenech Adami, who did not run this time round. 
  6.42pm Good news for the Greens: ADPD's Ralph Cassar will be an Attard councillor. He joins party leader Sandra Gauci as an ADPD voice in local government. Gauci was  elected to the St Paul's Bay council on Wednesday.
 6.41pm As tension rises around the Mosta desk, we can confirm that the PN has retained its majorities in both Attard and Swieqi, as it was expected to do. 
 6.32pm We've got it from the horse's mouth: Conrad Borg Manche will return to the Gżira local council. He has been reelected, this time as an independent candidate. 
  6.29pm A bit of good news for Labour: it has held onto its majority in Gżira. Neville Chetcuti will serve as mayor. 
 Back in 2019, Labour won a 5-4 majority in the town. But its star candidate at the time, Conrad Borg Manche, subsequently split from the party and was on the ticket as an independent candidate this time round.
 We still don't know if Borg Manche has been elected this time round. 
 6.26pm There’s lots of activity around table 5, where votes for the Mosta local council are being counted. Initial indications, based on samples, are that the PN could take this battleground locality. 
 In 2019, Labour snatched the council off PN, winning it with a 341-vote margin. But it’s had a torrid time running it, with that Mosta Rotunda controversy really throwing a spoke in its wheels. 
 Incumbent Chris Grech will be watching his back after Labour fielded its equivalent of a star candidate there in former junior minister Anthony Agius Decelis. 
 The PN has placed considerable focus on the town, though, and it was the venue of one of Bernard Grech's last addresses as the campaign closed. Mosta is Grech's hometown.
 6.19pm Xgħajra remains Labour-led, as was expected. And Neil Attard has been reelected mayor.  
  6.13pm Labour has held onto Qala council, with Paul Buttigieg reelected mayor. But it was closer than they would have liked: we still don't have official vote tallies but it's clear it was a close race. 
  6.05pm John Boxall was first elected mayor of Vittoriosa in 1994. Thirty years later, he's still at it: Boxall got the most votes and will serve as mayor for a record ninth term.
 ""The work speaks for itself,"" he said in his first comments. 
 It's a good week for the Boxall family: yesterday, Boxall's son Karl was elected mayor of Għaxaq.
  6pm Labour has retained control of Santa Luċija, and Charmaine St John is to be reelected mayor. 
 And PN has kept control of Kerċem, with Mario Azzopardi as mayor. 
   5.56pm Labour delegates appear to be especially pleased with having retained a majority in Mtarfa. So pleased, in fact, that some of them banged so hard they broke some of the counting hall perspex. 
  5.53pm Safi remains a Labour council and Johann Mula has been reelected mayor.
 Labour also keeps hold of its majority in Mtarfa. Dale Hayman will be its mayor. Aged just 20, he will be one of the country’s youngest. 
  5.48pm More gains for the PN: it looks like it has secured a majority in Żebbuġ (Gozo). Clive Baskal Saliba will be mayor.
 In 2019, both major parties got two seats apiece, with the fifth seat going to an independent candidate, Nicky Saliba.
 Saliba subsequently switched to Labour (he was on the Labour ticket this time round), so this makes it an especially sweet victory for the PN. 
  5.45pm It was never in any doubt: Senglea has gone for Labour, which retains its 4-1 seat majority there. Clive Pulis has been reelected as mayor. 
  5.38pm Labour celebrates its first win of the day: four out of five seats in Kirkop have gone its way, meaning it has widened its margin over 2019, when the council was split 3-2. Matthew Agius Zammit, 28 will serve as mayor. 
 He told us he was ""extremely surprised"" by the result. 
  5.35pm PN sources tell us that they expect to have won Siġġiewi by a roughly 1,000-vote margin - a huge chunk given that there are only around 8,000 voters in the town. 
 It looks like the PN was expecting this, though. Delegates came prepared with a poster of Roderick Galdes with the tagline Prosit Ministru! (Well done, Minister!). As social housing minster, Galdes was responsible for that relocation debacle we mentioned earlier. 
  5.30pm A big win for the PN: it has retaken the Siġġiewi local council, having lost it to Labour by 70 votes in 2019. It looks like Julian Borg will serve as mayor.
 Siġġiewi was one of a number of key swing localities that the party was targeting. Labour was desperate to retain it, too: so desperate that it tried to register 90 people as residents there before their homes were habitable. That backfired, badly. 
  5.25pm Floriana is shaping up to be one to watch: three independent candidates seem to have collectively swooped up roughly a quarter of all votes. 
 The best performer of those three appears to be Nigel Holland, a former mayor of Floriana. But Holland’s reelection is not a foregone conclusion, as it all depends on where inherited votes will end up. 
 In 2019, Floriana went Labour’s way with a 3-2 seat split. 
  5.13pm Qala native Clint Camilleri must be sweating bullets: with three boxes of votes to go, Qala remains too close to call.
 Context: in 2019 Labour won it with more than 70% of the vote.
 5.04pm No surprises here: the PN has a majority in San Lawrenz. The party won more than 70% of the vote in the Gozitan village in 2019 and it looks like it will retain its 4-1 majority, with mayor Noel Formosa reelected.  
  4.50pm The PN has called Munxar: it says it has confirmed its majority in the Gozitan town, with Damian Spiteri reelected mayor.
 It looks like Spiteri might have won more than 50% of the town's vote. He told us he's honoured and humbled by residents' vote of confidence. 
 The PN won a 3-2 majority in Munxar in 2019 by 35 votes (out of just under 900). It looks like they’ve done significantly better this time round and could well be snatching a council seat from Labour. 
  4.05pm And we're off. Counters bring out the first batches of votes and show each ballot to eagle-eyed party agents. Some of those take samples. Others keep an eye out for dubious votes. 
 3.58pm It's not just Labour figures: we've spotted PN MPs Robert Cutajar, Claudette Buttigieg and Beppe Fenech Adami here too. 
 3.45pm Minister Owen Bonnici, whose portfolio includes local councils, is here. He was earlier seen rallying the PL's troops at the party quarters at the Naxxar complex. Gozo Minister Clint Camilleri is also in Naxxar. Yesterday, a cross-legged Camilleri was the beating heart of Labour's sampling efforts for Gozitan councils, with the PL's agents running to him with their vote sample chits.
 Camilleri will play a similar role today: there are five Gozitan localities whose councils will be determined. 
   3.32pm Party agents are slowly filing in to take their places behind the perspex. We're less than 30 minutes away from the start of today's (final) vote counting session. 
 In some of today's localities (Safi, Attard), the outcome is pretty much a foregone conclusion. 
 In others (Mosta, Siġġiewi), it's much closer. Both those councils are currently Labour-led, but that might well change by tonight. 
 2.40pm Some of the most prominent candidates are gathering at the Naxxar hall. Among them is controversial Mosta mayor Chris Grech who is hoping to hang on to his seat. But the Nationalist Party has been hedging its bets on flipping the battleground locality.
 Also present is Gżira mayor Conrad Borg Manche, who also contested the European elections. 
  2.20pm Our fact-checker Neville Borg compiled the gains and losses of the two main parties on Friday morning. The figures shows Labour losing ground across the vast majority of councils, with the PN making gains in many. 
 You may read his analysis here. 
 2.10pm The Nationalist Party took back San Ġwann and Msida councils and increased its vote across most localities in the  second day of counting for the 2024 local elections. We had drama in Birkirkara after an independent candidate took the lion's share of the vote. 
 But Labour remains comfortably in the lead, securing a majority in 27 of the 43 councils counted so far, with the remaining third to be tallied on Friday. After two out of three days of vote counting, the gap between the two big parties is 23,000 votes. 
 2pm Good afternoon and welcome to our live blog for the 2024 local council elections. We're on the third and final day through this marathon count.
 The ballot boxes are being opened and electoral commission agents are putting them face down. Counting is expected to start around 4pm.

Josianne Cutajar will not contest PL deputy leadership post,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/josianne-cutajar-contest-pl-deputy-leadership-post.1097207,25-08-2024,006741.png,"Labour’s former MEP Josianne Cutajar on Sunday confirmed she will not be contesting for the position of Labour’s deputy leader for party affairs. 
 Her announcement came on the day the nominations for Labour's executive roles closed, leaving only one candidate to run for the post, Labour MEP Alex Agius Saliba. 
 The internal party elections will be held on September 13 and 14.
 In a Facebook post, Cutajar thanked all those who supported and approached her to contest for the role in the past few weeks. While not directly stating that she will not be contesting for the role she said:
 ""After having considered all the circumstances at length, as well as the decisions taken concerning this process, I choose to continue my commitment in favour of what I believe in a different manner.""
  Earlier this month, the former MEP came out against the proposed changes to the party’s statute to allow sitting MPs or MEPs to occupy the role of deputy leader for party affairs. 
 She previously told Times of Malta she believes the deputy leader for party affairs should devote their undivided attention to the party “without favouritism related to [matters concerning their] current or prospective districts.”
 The proposed change was approved during an extraordinary general conference at the Labour Party headquarters at the beginning of the month. 
 In her post, she provided a few words of advice to those who will be elected to the top party posts, such as ensuring the party stays true to its “socialist roots” and to focus on the interests of the electorate.
 “Ensure there is space for living and constructive debate within the party’s structures, and avoid ‘rubberstamping’,” she continued. 
 She said there must be space to those who share the party’s stated principles, and highlighted there are many “genuine people” who wish to contribute to the party. Cutajar added the party must focus on the real inclusion of people with different backgrounds and not simply “tokenism”.
 She said there must be work on the progress and renewal of the way politics is conducted and the way the political message is delivered to address the current realities of the party and government. 
 On Saturday, former TVM head of news Normal Saliba announced she is to run for the post of Labour Party president.
 Saliba said she was urged to contest the post by Labour leader Robert Abela and had the backing of Ian Borg and Alex Agius Saliba, the two confirmed candidates for the party’s two deputy leadership posts.
 
 Lawyer Alex Sciberras, the son of the late judge Philip Sciberras, said on Friday that he would be contesting the post.
 The party’s two deputy leadership posts, on the other hand, appear likely to be uncontested affairs. Foreign Affairs Minister Ian Borg will run for deputy leader of parliamentary affairs and is rumoured to have the backing of Labour’s MPs to do so. If elected, he will become deputy prime minister.

Watch: PL faction wanted Sant to back EU membership after 2003 referendum,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/watch-labour-dilemma-20-years-on-to-arab-european.1091983,05-06-2024,006769.png,"Twenty years after Malta joined the EU, some of the key players interviewed for a Times of Malta documentary tell Mark Laurence Zammit about the tension and excitement in the air as those historic events were unfolding.
 A sizeable movement of people within the Labour Party wanted Alfred Sant to turn in favour of Malta joining the EU after the 2003 referendum and just before the election that year, according to Joseph Muscat.
 “It was not just a few people, and they were arguing that the PL should acknowledge that the Maltese wanted to join the EU and that the party should change its policy ahead of the general election a few weeks later,” he recalled.
 “The opposing movement within the PL was arguing that would be too radical of a U-turn and would lose us all credibility. I was among those insisting we should recognise what the people wanted but at the same time acknowledged our credibility would have taken a hit with such an overnight change in policy.”
 Muscat, who then worked for the PL media arm and was part of the party’s administration, was speaking in an interview for a documentary on the 20th anniversary of Malta’s accession into the EU.
 In the 18-minute Times of Malta documentary, former prime ministers Alfred Sant, Lawrence Gonzi and Joseph Muscat, then journalist Miriam Dalli and then campaigner Simon Busuttil, and Times of Malta editor-in-chief Herman Grech recall the intense yet exciting historic referendum and election campaigns, while psychology professor Gordon Sammut and economist Marie Briguglio look back on how Malta has changed in its 20 years as an EU member state.
  Much of the intense fight over whether Malta should join the EU was about people’s desire to feel European, as opposed to Arabs, former country leaders, key campaign players and analysts have said 20 years on.
 This was not necessarily right or even true, but it was a major driving force nonetheless, they told Times of Malta when interviewed for a 20th anniversary documentary on one of the most intense periods in Malta’s history.
 Former prime minister Lawrence Gonzi said when people voted for Malta to join the bloc, they were strongly declaring that they felt European and wanted to be part of Europe’s values and principles.
 “For some moments there were people who wanted us to be part of the Arab world,” he said. “But that vote closed that debate once and for all.”
 Researcher and associate professor of social psychology Gordon Sammut is convinced that what drove us to that decision was “our desire to be anything other than Arab”.
 “Our attitudes were more positively inclined to what was happening in Europe, which was made up of developed, democratic and capitalist countries, rather than to what we were seeing in dictatorial regimes, authoritarian systems and developing countries [in Africa],” he said.
 “Countries to our north were more affluent and it doesn’t hurt to be on the side of the ones who have the means.”
 For the man who spearheaded the entire partnership campaign, however, that should have never been made the issue.
 Reminiscing on those times, Alfred Sant told Times of Malta the Maltese did not need to join the EU to be Europeans – they were Europeans already.
 “That’s why back then we would fight the rhetoric that was being pushed, that we would be ‘joining Europe’. We would not. We would be joining the European Union, we used to say,” he recalled.
 “The inferiority complex in some sections of society back then drove the population’s enthusiasm to join the EU.”
 Former prime minister Joseph Muscat – who back then worked for the PL media and was in the party administration – said the PN’s strategy was leading people to believe they were choosing whether they wanted to be Europeans or Libyans, even though that was not what the choice was about – a tactic he described as “genial”, but “below the belt”.
 “In the minds of many people the choice was between a Christian Europe with liberal values or something else, and many people needed to be in the EU to feel European,” Muscat said.
 “It’s part of a post-colonial mindset, I believe, where people feel like they need to be part of something to feel that they are someone.”
 But the PN wrongly sold EU membership as a utopia and failed to acknowledge the problems it would create, he added.
 Gonzi said irrespective of the arguments for or against, history proved the Nationalist Party right 20 years on.
 “Today we look back, smile, and say, ‘You see? We were right’. The country got all that it was promised from its full membership in the EU and even more,” he said.
 “That historic moment 20 years ago might have been as significant as gaining independence in 1964.”
 Sant is not at all convinced, and 20 years on, he still believes Malta would have been in a much better place had it negotiated a partnership deal.
 He wanted to make Malta a Switzerland in the Mediterranean, and look at Switzerland now, he said – it is doing better than the EU.
 “The EU is not the only benchmark of success. It has done some great things, such as unite global economies and eradicate war from central
 Europe, but let’s not delude ourselves that’s it’s some Nirvana,” he said.
 “I was never against the EU. It’s a good concept and we need to have the best relationship with it, in a way that would give us the greatest benefit without forcing us to abide by rules that just don’t work for small island states like us.
 “Just look at what we’re doing best at – financial services, gaming and tourism – the sectors that are least regulated by the EU. Then look at agriculture and industry, for instance, where EU regulation is heaver. Those sectors are ailing. I think that argument stands on its own.”
 Joseph Muscat admitted, however, that the PN was stronger than Labour because it was offering people a vision into the future – a vision “that couldn’t be challenged”.
 “It’s no surprise, then, that the last time the PN got a majority of votes in any election was in that year. It hasn’t managed to get a majority of votes since then,” he said.
 “Back then, Labour also miscalculated the economic effect of EU membership. The party was too focused on how much money we would get from the EU and how much money we would need to fork out, but that’s not a good argument. EU membership attracts investment to the country, and that’s what matters. Labour did not give that enough importance, Sant was mistaken there.”
 Anyone who was involved, even in the slightest way, in campaigning and reporting at the time admits it was a very intense and divisive period in history, but exciting nonetheless.
 Times of Malta editor-in-chief Herman Grech had just joined the organisation as a reporter when Sant rose to power in 1996 and froze Malta’s application to join the EU.
 “We were witnessing one drama after another, especially when, two years later, he was kicked out of government and the PN was re-elected to power,” Grech recalled.
 “We were close to journalists from other newsrooms – I remember Miriam Dalli and Julia Farrugia Portelli back then – but as the years went by and the campaign got more intense, the atmosphere became increasingly emotional and it was harder to find issues on which we agreed. For the first time I began to notice cracks in journalists’ friendships.
 Minister Miriam Dalli – back then a ONE news reporter – also recalled the intense atmosphere and said the emotions were “a bit charged, on both sides”.
 “It was very intensive. I was never against Malta joining the EU, I was simply unconvinced the we were prepared for it,” she said.
 “In hindsight, we joined, we’ve been through our own journey and I must say that from my time there I could observe that all Maltese MEPs punch way above their weight, compared to the other MEPs.
 “Just look at the president of the EU parliament – she’s Maltese. I think that speaks volumes about what the Maltese can do, no?”
 Former PN leader and MEP Simon Busuttil was a young, avid campaigner for the ‘yes’ camp back then and said that period was needlessly divisive.
 “People were divided on an issue that should have never divided them. So much so that today, everybody accepts that it was a good decision to join the EU,” he said.
 “Our country made strides forward, not least because our families are now also EU citizens. We have a better economy, better infrastructure and so many more rights and opportunities.”
 Muscat said the period leading up to the referendum was one of the few times people in the streets and in their homes were genuinely engaged and interested in a political discussion that went beyond the politicians.
 “It was one of the only times when politics really went to the people,” he said.
 Grech and Dalli also recalled where they were when they heard both parties had declared victory in the EU referendum in 2003.
 “It was a very long night in the counting hall and when the results started to come out it was clear that the ‘yes’ vote had won. But as I drove back to the newsroom from the counting hall I got a call from my editor who told me to rush to Marsa where Sant was going to declare victory,” Grech said.
 “I was very confused as to what was going on. The atmosphere in Marsa turned intense and it could have become very dangerous.”
 Dalli had just returned home from the counting hall and was watching television with her mother.
 “I began to hear that both the sides won, and I thought to myself, ‘this cannot be true, right? One side must have won. They couldn’t have both won,” Dalli recalled.
 Sant explained why he had declared victory.
 The party was an underdog, he said. All resources were controlled by the government and the situation was stacked against the partnership campaign, as the PN designed the referendum question unfairly.
 “The referendum asked people: this is the package the government negotiated. Do you want it or not? Whereas the question should have been – do you prefer PN’s membership or PL’s partnership? That’s different,” he said.
 “So, we argued that for the ‘yes’ vote to be valid, the PN had to obtain, not the majority of votes cast, but the majority of all the votes there are. That is why I, for instance, did not vote and made it public. Those who did not vote or spoiled their vote were declaring they were not in favour of the PN membership package.”
 The PN did obtain the majority of votes cast, but not the majority of all votes that could have been cast, and that’s why Sant decided it was fair to call it a win.
 Looking back, Muscat said he was not surprised that it happened. Labour had long been warning it would interpret the result this way and Eddie Fenech Adami was wise enough to ignore those arguments and call a general election immediately after the referendum result.
 That is when a sizeable movement in the PL began to push Sant to acknowledge the people’s will and change its policy, while an opposing movement feared the overnight U-turn would be too radical and would lose the party all credibility.
 “I don’t regret any of it because after the election, Labour was not heard-headed, accepted the people’s decision and moved forward. And this was credit to Alfred Sant,” he said.
 “Labour was seriously risking being deeply divided had it not been steered in the right direction back then.”
 He added that for the PN, however, steering Malta into the EU was – as professor Joe Friggieri described it – opening a window into a new era and getting swept away by the wind that enters.
 “Steering Malta into the EU brought about a wave of liberal ideas that created deep, existential conflicts within the PN that the party is still struggling to resolve,” he said.
 Professor Gordon Sammut said 20 years on, the social fabric has greatly changed, but in many ways has not changed at all.
 “We’re still stuck in traffic but the roads aren’t broken. A lot of people are at the bottom end and were struggling, and are still struggling in different ways today. The difference in the past was between the ‘have’s’ and ‘have nots’, whereas today it is between the ‘have’s’ and the ‘have mores’,” he said.
 “We have leapt from developing to developed, but we haven’t necessarily espoused the values of developed countries. And this is creating a discrepancy between what we value as Maltese Europeans and what the rest of Europe values.”
 Economist Marie Briguglio, who back then ran a series of TV programmes on the EU, said “there is nothing that remained untouched by the EU, because when you’re affecting the way a country is governed, you’re affecting everything.
 “You can really appreciate what the EU does by looking at what it doesn’t do. In those areas where the EU doesn’t have a remit, you feel the difference,” she said.
 “The EU regulates air and water quality monitoring and treatment of sewage water, for instance, and in all those areas we’ve seen a huge positive change. Conversely, an area the EU does not have a remit over is noise, for instance, and we still struggle with it. We still have loud petards, neighbourhood noise, industry and households trying to co-exist... it’s a very noisy country.”
 Sammut said the Maltese have a good understanding of their past and where they are at the moment, but do not really know where to go from here.
 “We’re still a very young nation who are still trying to build ourselves from the calamities of our colonial history. One day or another we’re going to have these issues. How we resolve them determines what kind of people the Maltese are going to be 20 years from now.”

 Furthermore, he was among the ministers who a public inquiry had found politically responsible for the Caruana Galizia murder, the NGO said. 
 Rather than being handed a cushy job, Zammit Lewis should be excluded from public life because he was totally unsuited.

Health Minister disappointed in vaccine uptake,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/health-minister-disappointed-vaccine-uptake.1101209,18-11-2024,006839.png,"This year's uptake of the free influenza and COVID-19 vaccines is below expectations, Health Minister Jo Etienne Abela told parliament on Monday.
 “We had hoped for a higher uptake of the vaccines,” Abela said, adding that the vaccines were the best way to combat disease and avoid deaths, as well as alleviate pressure on the hospital.
 He was replying to a parliamentary question by Labour MP Katya De Giovanni, who asked for information about the vaccine uptake.
 Apart from the influenza and COVID-19 vaccines, which are available for all those aged over six months, senior citizens aged 65 and over are also eligible for vaccination against pneumococcal infections, through a vaccine known as PCV 20.
 All three vaccines are being offered free of charge at health centres across Malta and Gozo.
 Figures provided by the health minister's spokesperson to Times of Malta show that 33,417 people have taken the influenza vaccine so far, while 12,247 have taken the pneumonia vaccine.
 Just 6,610 people took the COVID-19 vaccine.
 “We urge people - especially the vulnerable and the elderly - to take not one or two of these vaccines, but all three of them,” Abela said.
 He said that while the uptake of the flu vaccine was “encouraging”, that of the COVID-19 vaccine had been negatively impacted by “bad press in social media” and the spread of conspiracy theories.

 Speaking on Net Television, the PN leader said that he achieved two of the three goals he set for himself when he became leader of the Nationalist Party four years ago. 
  “The first aim was to unite the party, and the second was to reduce the government’s majority,"" Grech said.
 “Our next goal is to present ourselves as an alternative the people deserve.”  
 The PN leader said that the party surpassed expectations on Sunday. Its aim was to gain a third seat in the European Parliament and half the 39,400-vote Labour majority from the 2022 general election.  
 “Not only did the party win back the third seat, but the gap is now just over 8,000 votes,” he said. 
 Sunday’s result sent a strong message to the government that people were tired of divisive politics, spin and talk of 'timing' and war.
 Grech was referring to Labour Party campaign talking points that the Vitals magisterial inquiry was purposely concluded to coincide with the European Parliament election. It had also been claimed that EP president Roberta Metsola was a warmonger.
 “People want authentic politics, dialogue and a genuine interest in people” Grech said. 
 He urged people to go to the PN and even write to him personally and said the party was committed to be with the people.
 People should feel themselves more at liberty to speak their mind without fear of retribution, he said. Referring to the local council elections and vote-counting due to start on Wednesday, Grech said his party is hoping to win new majorities in several localities. 
 He did not mention any of them, but observers have pointed to Siġġiewi and Mosta as localities that could swing back to the PN.
 “Whatever the result, we will continue listening to the people and their message,” he said.

Clayton Bartolo resigns as Tourism Minister as second scandal emerges,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/clayton-bartolo-resigns-tourism-minister-following-jobs-scandal.1101565,26-11-2024,"006847.png,006848.png","Updated 12.40pm
 Clayton Bartolo resigned as Tourism Minister and as a Labour MP on Tuesday, weeks after a Standards Commissioner report concluded that he abused his ministerial power by giving his wife a top-paid consultancy job she did not do.
 Prime Minister Robert Abela said he spoke to Bartolo, 37, on Monday evening and again on Tuesday morning, when that decision was confirmed.
 He said the decision was taken in light of a second scandal that emerged concerning Bartolo and which Times of Malta asked questions about some days ago. 
 Times of Malta  exclusively revealed on Tuesday that the police have received a report into suspicious payments that Bartolo’s wife received over a six-month period in 2023.
 Those payments, which totalled around €50,000, were made from a company linked to a Malta Tourism Authority contractor. Investigators at the FIAU, Malta’s anti-money laundering body, suspect the payments were a kickback for the contractor getting MTA work.
 A Tourism Ministry spokesperson denied any link between the two. 
 The prime minister said Bartolo would remain in parliament as an independent MP and that he and his wife, Amanda Muscat, would also be refunding excess payments she received for being falsely listed and paid as a consultant. 
 Bartolo would now be in a better position to defend himself, Abela said. 
 A former Mellieħa councillor and deputy mayor, Bartolo was first elected to parliament in 2017 and appointed junior minister for financial services in January 2020, when Robert Abela assumed office as prime minister.
 In November that year he was promoted to full minister, taking over the tourism brief.
 As tourism minister, Bartolo oversaw a record post-pandemic recovery in tourist arrivals but also various controversies over excessive – and skewed – spending by entities under his watch, most notably the Malta Tourism Authority and  Malta Film Commission.
 Bartolo found himself in the eye of a political storm last month when parliament's standards commissioner concluded that he and fellow minister Clint Camilleri abused their power by making Bartolo's wife (then girlfriend) Muscat a ministry consultant. Muscat was his secretary at the time.
 In March 2021, she was transferred to Camilleri’s Gozo Ministry and given a pay bump, shifting her salary up to €68,000 a year.
 But in reality, Muscat continued to work as Bartolo’s secretary throughout, while earning a consultant’s salary – including a €20,000-a-year “expertise allowance” that regulations state should only be given in “exceptional circumstances”.
 The Standards Commissioner found no evidence that Muscat – whose sole qualifications were a couple of A levels and whose previous job experience focused on secretarial work – did any consultancy work for either ministry.
 Bartolo initially insisted offered a conditional apology for the breach, saying “no one is perfect”  and saying calls for him to resign were  based on “political spin”.
 But anger about the scandal showed no sign of abating and fresh calls for him to resign were still being made as recently as Monday, when multiple University of Malta student organisations said he had to go.
 Bartolo is just one of two ministers embroiled in the scandal. Clint Camilleri, the Gozo Minister who fictitiously employed Muscat for most of 2021, was also found guilty of abusing his ministerial power.
 Camilleri has insisted he did nothing wrong and followed all rules and procedures throughout. 
 In written submissions to the Standards Commissioner, Camilleri insisted Muscat was selected by his ministry's permanent secretary, not himself. 
 The Commissioner found that hard to believe, noting that persons of trust (as Muscat was) must resign when a minister is changed and saying it was ""inconceivable"" that such a person is selected without the minister's blessing.
  Camilleri's lawyer also told the commissioner that the minister knew what Muscat was working on and never had any issues with the quality of her work as a consultant - work there is no evidence Muscat did. 
 ""One can debate if a minister should be held responsible for the actions of their persons of trust,"" the Standards Commissioner concluded. ""But if a minister defends those actions and to do so even makes statements that are not factual, there is no doubt he is assuming personal responsibility for those events,"" he said of Camilleri.  
 In a statement that did not address the reasons behind his resignation, Bartolo said that he had decided to step down as his position was being used to harm the government’s reputation. 
 “When I was appointed to cabinet I had given my word that if during my tenure I became a reason to attack the work of the government or the Labour Party, I would take political responsibility,” he said. 
 He said that he was proud to leave behind a tourism industry that is now built on solid foundations and said that under his political direction, the country’s film industry had performed excellently on an international level.

 A big Labour victory would give the prime minister the freedom to continue attacking the courts and attack journalists, and Abela will only remember the electorate when the time comes for a general election, the opposition leader said. 
 Grech was speaking to radio show host Andrew Azzopardi on RTK 103, with the discussion mainly focusing on the hospitals inquiry report. 
 Azzopardi said Abela was invited to the programme to debate with Grech, but the host did not receive any response from the prime minister's team.
 “The Prime Minister is comfortable where he can control the situation,” Grech said. 
 All eyes will be on court on Tuesday, when former Prime Minister Joseph Muscat will be criminally charged in connection with the hospitals scandal. 
 Muscat is among a group, which includes his former chief of staff Keith Schembri, and former minister Konrad Mizzi, charged with money laundering, corruption, and bribery.
 “I don’t take pleasure seeing our former prime minister in court,” Grech said. 
 Grech accused the prime minister of panicking, especially after Abela accused the PN of planning a ‘trap’ for Labour supporters who plan to gather outside court in support of Muscat on Tuesday.
 “I don’t like to say it, but we have a ridiculous Prime Minister who does not realise the tragedy he is leading the people into.""
 He said Abela's comments are dangerous and antagonising people against the PN.
 “Days have passed, and he did nothing because he knows what he said is made up,” he said when asked if he filed a police report on the 'trap' comment.
 Grech claimed Abela made the comment to dissuade people from supporting Muscat on Tuesday.

PN calls Monday protest over Vitals case,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/pn-calls-monday-protest-vitals-case.1092155,21-06-2024,"006932.png,006933.png","Updated: 12.50pm
 The Nationalist Party has called a public protest linked to the Vitals hospitals scandal on Monday.
 It will be held outside parliament and follows a declaration by opposition leader Bernard Grech on Wednesday that his party would resort to 'parliamentary disobedience' after two rulings by the speaker denying requests for urgent debate on issues stemming from the Vitals inquiry and the subsequent filing of charges.
 Last week the opposition sought an urgent debate on a motion calling for the publication in full of the Vitals inquiry report submitted by Magistrate Gabriella Vella. On Wednesday it sought a debate on its call for Deputy Prime Minister Chris Fearne and other co-accused in the Vitals case to step down.
  The PN is calling its protest Nagħtu s-saħħa lill Maltin (Giving power to the Maltese), a play on Labour's European Parliament and local councils electoral slogan  Saħħa lill-Maltin.
 Its protest poster features Prime Minister Robert Abela and five of the accused in the Vitals case – former prime minister Joseph Muscat, Fearne, Central Bank Governor Edward Scicluna, former minister Konrad Mizzi and former chief of staff Keith Schembri.
 In a recorded address to the nation, Grech said that this was an “unprecedented time in our country’s history”, with top public officials both past and present facing charges of money laundering, corruption and fraud.
 Grech said that instead of ensuring that justice was administered, Prime Minister Robert Abela “unleashed a vicious attack on the judiciary to save his skin”. 
  Accusing Abela of knowing what the inquiry contains, Grech said that he is using its contents to “attack journalists and all those who don’t sing from the government’s hymn sheet”.
 Grech also had harsh words for the police force, saying that this investigation should have been carried out years ago, “when many, including PN, were pointing to the corruption in this deal”.
 Meanwhile, Grech said, the state broadcaster remains “a censorship tool in favour of the government, despite losing one case after another”. 
 “Everyone who was named in this case and holds public office must resign,” he said. 
 The Vitals case has dominated headlines since the magistrate concluded her four-year inquiry into the government's grant of a concession for the management of three state hospitals to Vitals Global Healthcare in 2015.
 Vitals later transferred the concession to Steward Healthcare and the concession was declared null by Malta's highest court in February after finding fraud. 
 
 Charges in connection with the case were filed in court on Monday but no arraignment date has been announced yet.

Council elections day 1: Labour holds onto Valletta as PN flips St Paul's Bay,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/local-council-elections-vote-counting-begins-23-localities.1093861,13-06-2024,"006950.png,006951.png,006952.png,006953.png,006954.png,006955.png,006956.png,006957.png,006958.png,006959.png,006960.png,006961.png,006962.png,006963.png,006964.png,006965.png,006966.png,006967.png,006968.png,006969.png,006970.png","Updated 9.10pm
 Labour retained control of the Valletta local council but the Nationalist Party flipped St Paul’s Bay, on the first day of vote counting in the 2024 local council elections.
 With roughly one-third of all local council elections concluded, Labour appears comfortably in the lead, capturing one-third more votes than the PN and securing a majority in 14 out of the 23 localities at play during Wednesday’s count.
 But there were significant gains for the Nationalist Party, which apart from winning St Paul’s Bay added a seat in the Dingli, Qrendi, Birzebbuga, Fontana, Xewkija and Żurrieq local councils, while coming within just seven votes of flipping Pembroke. 
 
 The PN said that they had halved the vote deficit in the councils determined on Wednesday (from 20,055 in 2019 to 11,757 now) and slashed the gap in seats from 28 to 13, when factoring in independent candidates.
 A Labour source noted that the gap between the two parties in these elections so far stands at 14%.
 Labour breathed a sigh of relief at having kept hold of Valletta, flipping Għasri and avoiding routs in Mellieħa and Żebbuġ (Malta), where strong performances by independent candidates left councils in the balance. 
 It was a good night for ADPD leader Sandra Gauci, who secured a seat in St Paul’s Bay, and a thumping return to politics for former PN minister Censu Galea, who trounced all other candidates in that town to drive the PN to victory.
 
 Valletta will get a new mayor in Olaf McKay, who beat the incumbent Alfred Zammit by 32 votes. In Qrendi, 16-year-old Nina Briffa will serve as a PN councillor.
 In Mellieħa, the two big parties elected four candidates apiece, leaving independent candidate Matthew Borg Cuschieri as kingmaker.
 And over in Gozo, 19-year-old Serena Refalo – the daughter of Labour minister Anton – stormed to the Xewkija mayorship.
 Arguably the best story of the night, however, belonged to the Zammit Lupi family in Żebbuġ.
 Steve Zammit Lupi, who served as an independent councillor in the previous term, was the most popular candidate in the town’s election this time round and could well end up serving as its mayor.
 His popularity rubbed off on his mother, Lillibeth Zammit Lupi, who ran for a council seat for the first time. She, too, was elected, meaning Żebbuġ’s council will have four Labour councillors, three PN ones and two independents who are mother and son.
 Labour saw a sharp narrowing of its majority in the European Parliament elections, held on Saturday together with the local elections, which left people wondering whether the councils could hand Labour its first electoral defeat in 20 years.
 The counting process in 67 localities – 53 in Malta and 14 in Gozo – has been divided into three groups, contunuing on Thursday and Friday. A total of 471 councillors will be elected.
 There was no election in Mdina as only five candidates applied to contest the election, the same number of councillors needed. There are four PN candidates against the Labour Party’s one.
 The PN suffered its worst-ever results in the last round of local council elections in 2019 when Labour won 47,000 more votes. The PN had also lost localities that had traditionally voted blue, such as Siġġiewi and Valletta.
 The PN won Valletta in 2013, 2008, 2002 and 1999 but narrowly lost it in the last election.
 Siġġiewi has a similar history. Five years ago, the PL won by a whisker and only had 70 more votes than the PN. That victory was Labour’s first in Siġġiewi but tables might change this year when the votes are counted tomorrow.
 
 There was controversy during the run-up to the election when 99 people changed the address on their ID card to a new government housing block in the locality even though they had not yet moved in. The case went to court, which ordered those involved to vote in their original place of residence.
 Other hotly-contested councils include Mosta and San Ġwann. All were PN-controlled in the past but were more recently run by Labour administrations. That could change once more by the end of the week.
 San Ġwann will be determined on Thursday while Mosta will be decided on Friday. The town’s mayor, Chris Grech, is trying to hold on to his seat after coming under considerable fire following a decision to cut down mature trees near the rotunda church in November.
 Labour strongholds like Paola, Żejtun and the three Cottonera cities have almost certainly voted overwhelmingly red. However, PN leader Bernard Grech said his party aims to gain more votes and, possibly, a council seat in these localities.
 
 8.44pm The counting hall is empty. You could hear a ballot paper drop. The election is now on pause, to be resumed tomorrow. And so too is this live blog: we're ending it here, though check back soon - we'll have a summary of the day's key events available at the top of this article very soon. 
 Thank you for having joined us. 
  8.34pm Day 1 of vote counting in these local council elections is done, and the outcome in 23 localities has been settled. Two more days remain - there will be further counting tomorrow (Thursday) and Friday. 
 So far, Labour is comfortably in the lead in the overall vote, with virtually twice as many votes going its way versus the PN. It's a similar story in percentage terms, with the vote falling 59% Labour to PN's 33%. 
 However, there's still a lot at play, including some major battlegrounds like Birkirkara and San Ġwann (tomorrow), Mosta and Siġġiewi (Friday). 
 8.31pm The PN's hopes of flipping Valletta appear to have been built on thin air: the party got 370 votes  fewer than it obtained there in 2019, when the council swung Labour's way. 
 Not that Labour has much to celebrate: it also lost votes when compared to 2019, albeit 78 of them.
 Olaf McKay beat Alfred Zammit to mayor by just 32 votes. 
 8.28pm Proof that a single family can swing it: Labour retained its majority in Pembroke by just seven votes. It's a bitter pill to swallow for the PN, especially given turnout was just 57% (similar to the national average for council elections). 
 8.19pm Santa Venera remains Labour, but only just. It’s 4-3 in the party’s favour, with Gianluca Falzon to be its mayor. 
 8.15pm St Julian’s remains firmly PN, with a 6-3 majority. Guido Dalli will remain its mayor.
 8.13pm The PN has retained Iklin and Dorian Sciberras remains mayor, but Labour has a new minority leader in Mario Fenech. 
 8.10pm Nina Briffa, 16, has been elected in Qrendi on the PN ticket. She was  one of the youngest candidates to be running in these elections. 
 8.02pm Here's one we missed earlier: Ta' Xbiex will remain Labour-led, with Max Zammit as its mayor. 
 7.55pm Żebbuġ independent councillor Steve Zammit Lupi has been reelected, and he says it looks like he will be the town’s new mayor. He says residents have prioritised the town over partisan politics. 
 Zammit Lupi’s mother, Lillibeth, was also contesting, and she has also been elected. It looks like she’s taken a seat that was previously Labour’s.
  7.44pm We caught up with PN's Thomas Mizzi, who told us he's stunned to discover he will be Fontana's new mayor. 
 Aged 24, Mizzi will be one of Malta's youngest mayors. He takes over from Saviour Borg, who ran Fontana's council for 20 years but exited council politics under a veil of controversy. 
 Mizzi has pledged to start working ""from tomorrow"" to take the Gozitan village forward.
  7.41pm Labour has lost its majority in Mellieħa, but the PN has not benefitted. Unlike general elections (where it’s votes that count), in council elections, it’s all down to the seats a party secures. And the PN did not get enough votes to elect another seat in Mellieħa, because many votes went to independent candidate Matthew Borg Cuschieri, who will be elected. 
 That means the council will be split 4-4-1. 
 We don’t yet know who will be Mellieħa mayor.
 7.37pm PN councillors will remain in a minority in Dingli, Xewkija, Żurrieq and Qrendi, but sources tell us the party has taken a seat off the majority Labour council in each of those localities. 
 7.31pm Labour wins Tarxien, as it was expected to do. No surprise there. 
 7.30pm Aged just 19, Simona Refalo might end up being Malta's youngest mayor once this election's dust settles. We caught up with the new Xewkija mayor for a quick comment.  She told us she never expected to win as many votes as she has. 
 ""Xewkija needed some new young blood,"" she said. 
  7.28pm Two foregone conclusions for Labour: they have held onto their majorities in both Birżebbuġa and Żejtun. There's a new mayor in Żejtun, though - Joan Agius.
  7.24pm Big news for the PN: they’ve flipped St Paul’s Bay.
 And it looks like they’ve done it on the back of a commanding performance by former PN minister Censu Galea, who dusted off his political mitts to give local politics a go. Chants for Galea and applause fill the counting hall. 
   7.16pm Good, albeit expected, news for Labour in Marsa: the party will continue to lead the local council there. 
 Marsa residents will be getting to know a new mayor, though: 24-year-old Luke Farrugia has secured the most votes. 
  7.08pm Back to Mellieħa, where Labour edged it by just 77 votes in 2019. 
 The PN is hoping to reclaim a majority there, but there’s a fly in its proverbial, and his name is Matthew Borg Cuschieri. 
 Borg Cuschieri, an independent candidate, appears to be doing well and is poised to get a seat. And that means there’s a good chance that both Labour and the PN will end up with 4 seats each, with Borg Cuschieri the kingmaker. 
 7.01pm It's now confirmed: Labour has held onto its majority in Valletta. But the capital city will have a new mayor: Olaf McKay has beaten Alfred Zammit to the post. 
 Valletta residents have made it clear in the past years they're unhappy with loud music, restaurant tables and chairs taking over streets and litter filling street corners. But despite those complaints, the incumbent party will keep control of the local council. 
  6.56pm Many PN delegates – among them MPs Adrian Delia, David Agius and Robert Cutajar - have gathered behind the perspex at table 8, where votes for Mellieħa are being counted.
 The word in the counting hall is that they might flip the council, winning it with a slight majority. 
 It would be a significant win for the party, after the disappointment of falling short in Pembroke and most probably Valletta. Like those two councils, Mellieħa was one of a number of swing localities the party was targeting this election. 
 6.51pm The PN has secured a majority in Balzan, one of its traditional strongholds. There’s some good news for it there – it looks like it has widened its gap from 3-2 to 4-1. 
 6.46pm A significant setback for the PN: Pembroke will remain a Labour-led council.
 The Nationalist Party was hoping to capitalise on disquiet within the council – its outgoing mayor complained he was little more than a “village policeman” and its deputy mayor  ended up in court – to swing the locality its way. 
 But it looks like the party fell short, as Labour has held onto the council. Kaylon Zammit will serve as the town’s new mayor. 
  6.40pm Labour has secured its majority in Żurrieq, with incumbent mayor Rita Grima reelected by ""a large margin"", sources tell us. No surprises there. 
  6.38pm Labour might be celebrating a majority in Xewkija, but there's a caveat: it looks like the party has lost a good chunk of votes in the Gozitan town, which is traditionally a Labour stronghold. 
 We're told the council, which went 4-1 Labour's way in 2019, is now likely to end up with a 3-2 split. 
 6.35pm Some good news for the Greens: ADPD chairperson Sandra Gauci will get a seat in the St Paul's Bay local council. The party confirms as much on its  Instagram page.
 St Paul's Bay - Malta's largest locality by population - is a key battleground in these council elections and was one of seven localities where ADPD fielded a candidate. 
  6.33pm Labour has held onto its majority in Xewkija, and the election could be the start of a new political dynasty: the mayor will be Simona Refalo, daughter of Labour minister Anton Refalo.
 The Refalos made headlines during the campaign following reports that they had shifted their address to Xewkija to boost the newcomer’s electoral prospects. 
 6.26pm No change in Dingli, where Labour has secured a majority. And it's a good night for mayor Raymond Schembri, who will be re-elected. 
 An emotional Schembri, who is at the counting hall, pledges continuation of the past five years. 
  6.24pm Some minutes ago, we reported that Qrendi and Mqabba had remained red. Now we can confirm that their respective mayors, David Michael Schembri and Grace Marie Zerafa will also keep their posts. 
  6.19pm The PN has secured a majority in Għajnsielem, as it was expected to do. And it looks like incumbent mayor Kevin Cauchi is heading for another term. 
  6.15pm Two more wins for Labour: Mqabba and Qrendi. It has secured majorities in both those councils. 
 Mqabba was a hot locality for Labour after rumblings of discontent about a tarmac plant being planned there. Robert Abela then stepped in and said he was against that. Weeks later, the applicants dropped the plan. 
 6pm It looks like Labour has managed to hold on to its majority in Valletta, the capital city. PN delegates insist it's still in the balance, but multiple sources say it's clear PL has edged it. 
 ""It looks like we have quite a clear majority, barring any miracles,"" a well-placed Labour source told us.  
 Even those sources say, however, that it's still to be seen whether mayor Alfred Zammit will retain that post. 
 Either way, it's a big win for Labour.  Valletta has historically served as a bellwether locality, with trends there reflecting the national outcome of local council elections. 
 5.34pm The vote counting process is well under way but there's still a long way to go - we've got three (unofficial) results out of 23 localities. 
 Here are some images from the Naxxar counting hall. Swipe right to see more photos. 
  5.24pm Another Gozo win for the PN - it has secured a majority in Nadur. 
 That is not surprising, given its historic dominance in the village.
 Nadur, keep in mind, is the stronghold of former PN ministers Giovanna Debono and Chris Said.
 Said's brother, Edward, has been Nadur mayor for the past nine years. And PN sources tell us Debono worked to help the PN reach disgruntled voters in the locality. 
 What will be worth keeping an eye on is the gap between the two parties, but it's too early to know whether that has widened or narrowed.
  5.02pm Tit for tat. 
 The Nationalist Party has secured Fontana, sources tell us. It also won the Gozitan village council in 2019. 
 Fontana's council also made the news in the run-up to the election over conflicting claims about the political fate of its long-time mayor Saviour Borg. 
 The PN said Borg had refused to recontest the election; Borg claimed he was never asked. 
 4.25pm The first results are in, and they're a small piece of Gozitan political history. 
 Labour has won a majority in Għasri for the first time in its history. 
 Reminder: in 2022, Għasri mayor Daniel Attard [no relation to the MEP] resigned from the Nationalist Party, one day after he publicly met with Robert Abela. Attard contested this election  on the Labour ticket.
  4.20pm Gozo Minister Clint Camilleri - a former mayor of Qala - and Culture Minister Owen Bonnici, who served as deputy mayor of Marsascala before entering national politics, were both spotted at the counting hall, helping Labour delegates. 
 Vote sorting, which was originally scheduled to begin at 2pm, was delayed and only began at 4pm.

Lawyer asks court: summon PM to explain pardon to benefits fraudsters,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/lawyer-asks-court-summon-pm-explain-pardon-benefits-fraudsters.1091829,21-06-2024,007000.png,"A lawyer assisting a number of people facing charges in the social benefits fraud racket wants to summon the Prime Minister to explain the implications of the recently announced presidential pardon.
 The pardon, he told court, was likely to impact “hundreds of cases”. 
 The government's announcement about the pardon appears to have cast prosecutors and lawyers alike in a state of uncertainty, not knowing the extent of the pardon on those facing charges in court for allegedly defrauding the state coffers. 
 A number of people turned up in court on Thursday morning for a first hearing over their alleged involvement as beneficiaries in the racket. 
 
 But before the hearing got underway, defence lawyer Jason Azzopardi informed presiding Magistrate Caroline Farrugia Frendo that he had something to say. 
 Eight days ago, the lawyer got to know through a newspaper report that was subsequently confirmed by Robert Abela, that the Head of State had signed a presidential pardon exonerating those beneficiaries who were reimbursing the Social Security Department the amounts defrauded.
 However, since then, the pardon has not been published and thus, not knowing the details thereof, he could not advise his clients on the way forward, explained Azzopardi, while the court deputy minuted his explanation. 
 “I must emphasise that the prosecuting officers are also in the dark because they too have not been informed of the details of such presidential pardon affecting hundreds of cases,” went on the lawyer. 
 In light of such lack of information, the lawyer requested the court to adjourn the cases so that the Prime Minister might be summoned immediately to explain to the court what the pardon says.
 Thursday’s was the first hearing since news of the pardon emerged. 
 “Seven days later, we’re still in the dark,” said Azzopardi.
 Lawyer Anita Giordmaina, representing the Social Security Department, informed the court that there would be no objection to such request for adjournment. 
 The court upheld the request and adjourned each of the cases in turn, minuting that this was being done so that each of the accused could clarify his or her position. 
 “For the sake of the best administration of justice, the court conceded such adjournment so that hopefully the court too would be informed as to what was to be done with these cases.” 
 Other lawyers, assisting a number of people facing similar charges, followed suit. 
 Lawyer Jose’ Herrera observed that according to an official press release by the Prime Minister, President Myriam Spiteri Debono was advised to exercise her prerogative and issue a pardon in favour of those who had defrauded the Social Security Department. 
 That statement appeared to imply that people charged or investigated in relation to the fraudulent racket, had the faculty of applying for such a pardon. 
 Unless they petitioned the President, such pardon did not apply, said Herrera, noting further that the main reason behind such pardon was to ensure that benefits unduly paid out by the department, would be reimbursed. 
 His client had, in fact, filed a petition to the President of the Republic four days ago. 
 In his case, the client had already settled the full amount due to the department. 
 Lawyers Lennox Vella and Noel Bianco, assisting other fraudulent beneficiaries, likewise asked for an adjournment in light of current uncertainties triggered by the announcement of such pardon. 
 While remarking that the court would not summon the Prime Minister, the Magistrate suggested the pardon could be published to clarify matters.

"Grech: Were it up to Abela, he would leave Edward Scicluna as bank chief",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/grech-were-abela-leave-edward-scicluna-bank-chief.1095992,28-07-2024,007002.png,"Prime Minister Robert Abela is making a U-turn in wanting Central Bank Governor Edward Scicluna to resign, and were it up to him, he would keep him in the post, PN leader Bernard Grech said on Sunday.
 The prime minister had been defending the Central Bank chief and had not asked him to step down until pressure built up, not least from the PN, Grech told a Net FM interviewer.
 Malta, he said, had a 'government by crisis' moving from one crisis to another whether it was in the energy sector, or the state of the infrastructure, to being unable to choose what was right and wrong for the country.  
 Scicluna, along with former deputy prime minister Chris Fearne and 13 others, is facing charges of fraud, misappropriation and fraudulent gain related to the privatisation of Gozo, Karin Grech and St Luke’s hospitals. A court on Wednesday said there was enough evidence for the accused to stand trial,
 On Friday, Scicluna was officially axed from the board of the Malta Financial Services Authority. He has so far refused to resign as central bank governor, and insists the central bank has its  “own rules”.
 Grech last week demanded the recall of parliament to discuss Scicluna’s position. The prime minister had described the call as 'a stunt'.   
 “The Opposition and the government should stand together to ensure Scicluna does not stay in his role,” Grech said, adding that retaining Scicluna in his position would damage Malta’s financial reputation.
 He noted that when Fearne resigned from the Cabinet as soon as the charges were filed, two months ago, Abela said he would have liked him to stay on.
 “If it were up to Abela, both Fearne and Scicluna would remain in their posts,” Grech said. 
 The Labour government has created a ""climate of impunity"" and Scicluna now believed he could do what he liked. 
 Grech referred to a Times of Malta's report on how three computer science students were suspended from a national cybersecurity contest because of a police investigation started two years ago, saying this was a case of being strong with the weak.
 The students had been arrested after they found and exposed a security weakness in Malta’s largest student app, FreeHour.
 ""So these students are being investigated, and the investigations have stopped them from moving forward in the competition, but then what about Abela's clique? They do what they like,"" Grech said.
 Moving to other subjects, Grech said the country was lacking planning in every sector and the people were paying the price. 
 ""Abela said we will not have power cuts, and that a temporary power station will stop such power cuts,"" he said. 
 ""But, people have now ended up with diesel-fuelled generators outside their windows,"" he said, showing that Abela has lied to the people.
 ""He (Abela) also blamed the power cuts on the shore-to-ship system and electric vehicles, but one of the people behind the shore-to-ship system caught Abela on his lie. The system has hardly been used so far. And what is the government planning to do about electric vehicles, stop investing in them after having promoted them?""
 Grech ended the call by pointing to what a Nationalist government would do in its first 100 days, including addressing the cost of living crisis, making the environment a fundamental Constitutional right and taking court action to recover the €400 million stolen for Vitals/Steward Healthcare.

Watch: New policy to align migration with labour market needs – Byron Camilleri,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/watch-new-policy-align-migration-labour-market-needs-byron-camilleri.1097763,09-11-2024,007028.png,"A new economic migration policy will aim to better align migration with the actual needs of the labour market, Byron Camilleri said.
 The policy will strengthen employment rights, ensure fair working conditions for all, and reward employers who invest in upskilling their workers, regardless of nationality, the home affairs and employment minister told Times of Malta in an interview.
 The initiative comes amid concerns of a massive increase in third country national workers in Malta, especially in the last decade.
 The government’s policy is built on four key principles: prioritising the needs of those already contributing to the local economy, safeguarding the dignity of all workers, promoting stability and retention, and encouraging the upskilling and reskilling of employees, he said.
 It will be the government’s latest effort to crack down on worker exploitation while preventing the influx of foreign workers in saturated industries.
 “It will be a policy in favour of workers, it will push for more stability and retention in all sectors, it will invest in worker upskilling and re-skilling and adopt a skills-based approach that identifies which industries need more workers and which have enough,” Camilleri said.
 “Some sectors – like healthcare – need more workers but other sectors – like cabs and food delivery services – have enough, and this policy will help Jobsplus identify where and when workers are needed.”
  He emphasised that economic migration will only be permitted to address labour or skills shortages identified in the labour market.
 For example, even if the ride-hailing sector requests more foreign workers, Jobsplus may reject applications if its analysis indicates the sector is already saturated.
 A consultation on the policy’s key principles and recommendations will start in the coming weeks.
 The government first indicated it would tackle excess foreign worker employment earlier this summer, announcing that new applications by third-country nationals for cab driving and food courier work permits were being turned down because the market had “reached saturation”.
 But Camilleri would not elaborate on the specific changes and would not say what other sectors Jobsplus believed were saturated.
 When asked whether construction – like the cab sector – had also reached a saturation point, he would only say the policy will likely oblige construction workers to get a skills pass, similar to the one introduced in the tourism industry last year.
 Camilleri said he also recently intervened to stop children of third-country national workers from being forced to return to their home countries.
 The children had come to Malta legally, benefitting from a family reunification policy, but when circumstances around the employment of their parents changed, they could not legally continue to live in Malta.
 “We ran assessments, identified genuine cases and took the decision to make sure the children are not made to go back to their countries. Some were even born here,” he said.
 “Our aim is to help these people improve their livelihoods in our country.”
 Malta’s family reunification policy permits family members of individuals legally residing in Malta to join them if the individual has the financial means to sustain them and is able to provide them with adequate housing.

Community faces deportation after almost 20 years in Malta,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/ethiopian-residents-deported-treat-like-criminals.1097176,24-08-2024,006768.png,"The Ethiopian community is “in shock” and “living in fear” as dozens of people, who have been living and working legally in Malta for up to 19 years, are being arrested at their place of work, sent to detention and told they will be sent back to Ethiopia. 
 “I was 16 when I came to Malta by boat in 2005. I was an unaccompanied minor. I don’t know Ethiopia. Malta is my home. We have worked, paid our taxes and not caused trouble. Now we are being treated like criminals. Like animals,” said a member of the Ethiopian community, who is fearing a knock at his door by the police.
 He is scared because five of his friends were arrested while at work and taken into detention. 
 They were told that their application for refugee status has been rejected. 
 Until now, they had temporary protection status and had a yellow book that allowed them to work legally. Some even had their own businesses.
 Another man who came to Malta in 2005, and now has a family in Malta, explained that about 100 Ethiopians were being told they had to leave.
 
 “We are all confused. Some have been here for 15, 16, 17 and even 19 years. We have children. Malta is our home. We are integrated. Our children go to school here. We are shocked. We are very peaceful people,” he said. 
 Lawyer Gianluca Cappitta, as well as other lawyers who work with migrants, said that, whenever people of a particular nationality are rounded up, it typically meant that a delegation from that country is on the way to Malta. 
 The delegation would typically include government officials who would facilitate deportation by providing travel documents after verifying the origin of the people in detention.
 “What I disagree with is that, weeks before the delegation arrives, these people are rounded up and put in detention. And, sometimes, the delegation comes later than planned or does not come at all. This, I believe, is in breach of their fundamental human rights. 
 “We are talking about law-abiding people who were always compliant. They should not be treated like this,” he said, adding that this case echoed a 2017 case involving nine Malian people. 
 The Malians were kept in detention for three months pending the arrival of official documents so that they could be returned to Mali but the documents have not been delivered yet.
 The nine were originally in a group of 33 arrested in November 2016 for deportation to Mali, reportedly as part of an EU initiative.
 The sudden arrest, a few weeks before the Christmas festivities, had shocked the migrant community.
 Cappitta had filed a constitutional case challenging the validity of the arrest and detention and any eventual deportation. The court had upheld all challenges but the appeal court reversed the decision on the deportation.
 Replying to questions sent by Times of Malta the home affairs ministry said persons arriving in Malta irregularly who do not qualify for international protection are offered a voluntary return package.
 
 “If they refuse the voluntary return scheme, are then subject to forced return, depending on the level of cooperation by the country of origin.
 “The Ethiopian nationals you are referring to have been detained in order to safeguard their return to Ethiopia, following positive signals from the Ethiopian authorities related to cooperation on the safe readmission of their own nationals,” the ministry said. 
 It added that this course of action follows a decision at EU level to step up readmission efforts with Ethiopia following an assessment carried out by the European Commission.

‘I am not Joseph Muscat’s proxy’: Alex Agius Saliba,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/i-joseph-muscat-proxy-alex-agius-saliba.1096574,08-09-2024,006899.png,"Alex Agius Saliba rejected questions about whether he was a ""proxy"" of Joseph Muscat, insisting he will continue to push in the interests of the Labour Party. 
 “I am no one's proxy, the only proxy I am is of the people who voted for me, of the leader of the Labour Party and the members and delegates of the party who have always shown their faith in me,” the MEP said on Friday.
 The MEP is known to be close to the former prime minister, and was among the first to be endorsed by Muscat during the European elections campaign.
  Agius Saliba was speaking to journalists on Friday afternoon, ahead of an extraordinary general conference at the Labour Party headquarters. 
 The conference is set to discuss whether the party should allow parliamentary group members to contest for the role of deputy leader of party affairs, likely paving the way for Agius Saliba to take on the role.
 Presently, the party statute prevents members of the PL's parliamentary group from contesting for the post. 
 “I will be pushing for the interest of the party, and its members to ensure that the Labour Party will once again win the next general election with a huge majority,” he said.
 Jason Micallef said the Labour Party is renewing itself to ensure it will win the next general election again.
 He was speaking a day after being appointed as the administration’s 'special delegate on the implementation of the electoral manifesto'. 
 He would not comment about Robert Abela's veiled remarks that he did not wish Micallef to contest the post of deputy leader for party affairs.
  Instead, Micallef told reporters he feels privileged that the prime minister said he felt he still had a lot to contribute to the party.
 Asked repeatedly whether he was a “proxy” of Joseph Muscat, Micallef did not reply.
 Rosianne Cutajar, who rejoined the Labour Party's parliamentary group earlier on Friday, also attended the meeting. 
 When asked if she apologised to Abela, she did not reply.
 Friday's meeting comes after the party lost its deputy leader Daniel Micallef, while several resignations in the office of the prime minister have also been announced in recent days. 
 Robert Abela's former chief of staff Glenn Micallef resigned in June, before being nominated as Malta's pick for European Commissioner. 
 Aleander Balzan, one of the PM's policy advisors, also resigned last week, followed by the PL's head of communications Ronald Vassallo, who resigned on Thursday.

 Repubblika said the revelations by Times of Mata were 'shocking'.
 It said it was 'amazed' how 'coincidentally' as soon as Joseph Muscat resigned as prime minister, he was handed a consultancy by this Shaukat Ali company.
 It was also disgusting how Prime Minister Robert Abela had not said a word about the latest scandal.  
 The group recalled that the Court of Appeal had found collusion between Steward Health Care and government officials or agencies. In other words, the government was not a victim of corruption but an agent that participated in this corruption, Repubblika said.   
 The hospitals case was corruption in its worst form, involving not only the theft of taxpayers' money but also undermining medical care.

'Byron Camilleri has lost control of the situation': PN calls for resignation,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/byron-camilleri-lost-control-situation-pn-calls-resignation.1098545,25-09-2024,006944.png,"The PN on Wednesday slammed Home Affairs Minister Byron Camilleri for spending a summer absent from public fora and resurfacing with no solution for the several scandals exposed over the past months.
 Calling for his resignation, PN spokespeople Darren Carabott and Claudette Buttigieg said the minister's ""well-rehearsed copy and paste replies"" to journalists only showed he continued to hide from the media and the public ""while shifting the blame onto everyone but himself"".
 
 In two interviews he gave to journalists from Times of Malta and  MaltaToday, Camilleri failed to provide any solutions, they said.
 ""It is becoming increasingly clear he has lost control of the situation and of nearly every department under his responsibility.""
 The two were referring, among others, to an alleged scam which saw the government's identity agency Identita' issue Maltese ID cards on the basis of forged documents. In August, a magistrate upheld an application by Jason Azzopardi for the holding of a magisterial inquiry into the matter.
 That same month, Times of Malta revealed how  dozens of people claimed to have discovered that their medical files contained upcoming appointments for serious tests and surgeries they did not need, data about hospital admissions they never underwent and medication they were never prescribed for illnesses they never had.
 Meanwhile, tourists driving rental cars while on holiday in Malta were unknowingly fined for traffic contraventions committed by local drivers in an alleged complex fraudulent racket operated by LESA officials, swindling millions of euros out of public coffers.
 Camilleri should have addressed allegations about the Identity Malta scandal, the chaos created in the hospital records system and other government entities as soon as they were exposed, the shadow ministers said.
 He should also have explained how authorities allowed social benefits to be issued to people registered under false addresses, and say what steps were taken regarding the allegations about LESA.
 ""The only response the minister gave was that the government entities at the centre of these scandals filed reports with the police. This, therefore, means that the Police Commissioner did not take any action.
 ""And by the minister’s own argument, it also means that another department under his responsibility – the police – has also failed,"" they added.
 Carabott and Buttigieg told a press conference that according to Camilleri, Identity Malta suspended a staff member in connection with the Identity Card scandal, meaning he kept this information hidden for all these months.
 ""The minister failed to mention what Identity Malta said, namely that an internal investigation was conducted. This raises further doubts over whether this investigation took place, especially since the government failed to accept PN’s challenge to publish it.""
 The shadow ministers slammed the government for being ""reactive"" and without a plan, only responding to scandals when they were exposed.
 ""The PN is disappointed that the minister has come up with no solutions to people’s concerns.
 ""On the contrary, he continues to justify withholding certain information from the public. It is also disappointing that the government is failing to adopt the PN’s proposal to create a system where property owners can verify how many people are registered on their property.""
 These are Camilleri's latest ""major failings"" according to PN:
 Reacting to Carabott and Buttigieg's press conference, the PL said the two were the type of politicians that could not be trusted with the country's leadership.

Watch: ‘I realised it was serious when I began burning bread’,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/i-realised-serious-i-began-burning-bread-hhc-addiction.1098890,10-09-2024,"006947.png,006948.png,006949.png","When baker Sayan Cassar began to forget bread in the oven and burn it to a crisp he realised that a drug he was taking – which looked inconspicuously like cannabis – could have been seriously messing with his brain.
 The 37-year-old has been in the bread business for 20 years and knows exactly how long a loaf takes to bake to perfection. But, after he smoked a weed-like drug that included a substance known as HHC, he started to notice that not only was he losing track of time but his brain had started to erase memories completely.
  “It was horrific. I would put the loaves in the oven and, within 15 minutes, I would completely forget I ever put anything in there, until I start getting whiffs of the smell of burning bread, panic, rush to the oven and realise, to my surprise, that there were loaves of bread there which were all burnt to a crisp,” he told Times of Malta.
 “On other occasions I would go to the supermarket, buy groceries, get back home and forget I ever went. Within an hour or two of returning from the shop, I would remember I needed groceries and make plans to head to the supermarket again.”
 Cassar had just started smoking HHC (Hexahydrocannabinol) – a synthetic cannabinoid that’s similar in structure and effects to THC (commonly known as weed) but which, unlike regular cannabis, was not regulated by law and, despite its often-harmful effects, was available to buy from websites, via courier delivery or over the counter from several shops till last month.
 
 Effects like those suffered by Cassar raised concern among NGOs, Malta’s cannabis authority and the government and, two weeks ago, Reforms Parliamentary Secretary Rebecca Buttigieg announced the semi-synthetic substances have finally been banned from Malta to safeguard the public’s health and reduce children’s accessibility to the usually colourful but harmful products.
 Cassar, who also hosts an online podcast, recalled first smoking the substance last January. It looked like normal weed, which he would sometimes smoke recreationally, and admits he was fooled into thinking it could not have been more harmful. It was also cheaper and much more accessible online, making it even more alluring.
 “Sometimes, I would type messages on WhatsApp and close the application without pressing ‘send’. People would later text again to see why I haven’t replied and that’s when I would usually realise what happened.”
 When he tried to stay away from it, he developed intense anxiety and other severe withdrawal symptoms, and his ADHD and his initial reluctance to seek help made it worse, he admitted.
 But when he did finally go to Sedqa, he managed to overcome it and control it with the help of professionals and has been clean since.
  Unlike THC, which occurs naturally in cannabis plants, HHC is created through a chemical process. HHC can produce similar effects to THC, including feelings of euphoria, relaxation and altered perception, but more research is needed to understand its long-term effects on human health.
 In recent months, products containing HHC – colourful gummy bears, cookies and lollipops – were sold in stores across the country and on food delivery platforms.
 Earlier this year, Health Minister JoEtienne Abela had already expressed concern about it and Church organisations had called on the government to ban the semi-synthetic drug, while the Authority for Responsible Use of Cannabis (ARUC) previously expressed “great concern” that the product was sold openly in shops.
  Speaking to Times of Malta, ARUC executive chair Joey Reno Vella said the substance has been known to exist for more than eight decades in scientific circles but no documented human pharmacological or toxicological studies have been conducted yet.
 “The surge in the commercial scale importation of semi-synthetic and synthetic cannabinoids is a matter of grave concern, particularly when considering that these products are most of the time manufactured, packaged and labelled under dubious conditions,” he said.
 “The availability and marketing of semi-synthetic cannabinoid products, especially in the form of food items, poses risks to public health and exposes young persons and tourists visiting Malta to unnecessary and potentially unknown health risks.”
 ARUC also set up a consultative committee with the superintendence for public health and representatives from the police, the customs office, the health department and the toxicology department to discuss addressing the issue, which has now culminated in a legal ban.
  OASI Foundation, along with Caritas Malta and researchers at the University of Malta, had also been working on the issue since this time last year, when they began shopping for the sweet-like products and testing them to establish what substances they contained.
 OASI chief executive Noel Xerri said in some cases the product packaging had warnings reading “not for consumption” and “this product can be harmful to health if consumed” but, on the same packet, a few lines down, the product was described as “delicious” and “tasty” gummies that “offer a balanced dose of HHC in every bite”.
 Xerri said THC and HHC have very similar effects on the brain, except that one had been controlled and the other was not yet until now.
  “Twenty other European countries had already banned it and we felt we should push to outlaw it in Malta as well,” he said.
 “The ban is a step in the right direction because it clearly sends out the message that the substance is harmful.”
 Cassar, meanwhile, has made it his mission to use his experience as an eye opener to other people.
 “HHC negatively impacts people around you and it’s not fair on them,” he said.
 “All you need is love and the people around you. You don’t need anything else in life.”

"PL risks losing election without ‘real change’, finance minister warns",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/pl-risks-losing-election-real-change-finance-minister-warns.1094677,07-01-2024,006969.png,"People want to see “real” change in the way the country is run and Labour risks losing the next general election if that does not happen, Clyde Caruana believes.
 “People have made their voice very clear,” the finance minister said of the MEP election result. “There has to be real change.” 
 Labour won the June 8 election but was left reeling after it lost over 33,000 votes since the 2019 elections. In a Times of Malta interview, Caruana said he thinks the party is still in time to change course and win back voters.
 
 However, he also sees historical parallels which will cause party insiders sleepless nights. In both 1981 and 1996, governments led by Dom Mintoff and Eddie Fenech Adami, which brought about systemic economic overhauls, ended up losing the popular vote, he notes.  “People always vote for something better,” he mused. And that something better is “not just money”.
  In a wide-ranging interview, Caruana spoke about his worry that infrastructural pressures have yet to be adequately addressed, the challenge of shifting economic gears to higher-value outputs and his matter-of-fact assessment of Malta’s economy being dominated by cartels.
 He is convinced that locals are fast losing patience with living in an overcrowded country, and notes that his warning about Malta’s skyrocketing population still stands.
 “I said that we will be 800,000 people by 2040. If the current trends continue we will already be at 600,000 by the end of this legislature,” he says.  For all the talk of improving quality of life, the money still needs to flow, however: Caruana is clear that Malta’s GDP must continue to grow at the annual 4% rate it has registered in the past years if the country is to avoid fiscal problems.
 What needs to change is how that 4% growth is created, he says, citing the example of the Netherlands – a country where people work fewer hours per week than in Malta but earn significantly more.
 “We need to do more with less,” he acknowledges. “And I think we need to triple the effort to move in that direction.”
 Whether his colleagues in government share his sense of urgency remains moot, however.
 Caruana has spent years calling out the construction sector’s excessively tight grip on politics, and he thinks voters see it that way, too.  But little appears to have changed.
 “I say what I have to say. Then it’s up to the rest to accept what I say or otherwise,” he says.
 Caruana is less concerned about an EU decision to begin excessive deficit procedures against Malta. There will be no tax increases or austerity measures, he says, provided the country continues to cut 0.5% off its deficit every year.
 He briskly cuts off questions about the possibility of Malta missing that target. “It’s my job to make sure that moment does not happen,” he says – and is equally firm about insisting he has no interest in serving as Labour deputy leader or EU Commissioner.
 That assertiveness is conspicuous by its absence when Caruana is asked if he harbours the ambition to serve as prime minister one day.
 “The prime minister is Robert Abela,” he says. But, as he adds when pressed, “a week is a long time in politics”.

Abela's appeal to voters: 'The establishment wants to capitalise on apathy',timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/abela-appeal-voters-the-establishment-wants-capitalise-apathy.1093050,26-05-2024,"007002.png,007003.png","Robert Abela on Sunday urged Labour Party supporters to turn up at the polling booths in June, claiming the “establishment” wants to take advantage of voter apathy and take power away from the people. 
 In two weeks' time, Malta will vote for its representatives in the European Parliament and local councillors. But the elections mean more than that, Abela insisted.
 “June 8 is not a normal day. The full force of the establishment wants June 8 to be the beginning of the end of all we hold dear. They want to divide team Malta and to end project Malta Flimkien."" That was the PL campaign slogan in the general election.
 “Will you let them ride on apathy and take power from your hands?” Abela asked a roaring crowd. 
 The prime minister also called on the crowd to convince their friends and family to vote for the PL. 
  “Will you let your friends, your children, stay at home and, as a result, help the establishment?""
 The Labour Party has focused its campaign on getting out the vote. At least three of the PL's television spots directly ask citizens to vote. One ad says: “If you don’t vote you will let these people vote for you”, accompanied by the voice of PN MEP David Casa.
 A series of billboards that popped up across Malta's busiest streets also focused on convincing people to vote. 
 Thousands attended the PL’s mass rally in Qormi on Sunday. Supporters filled a marquee set up for the occasion with many standing outside the tent.
 Some climbed onto the communal terrace of a large apartment block to get a better view.    
 After greeting the crowd, Abela recalled his achievements since taking over as prime minister in 2020. 
 Abela said he had brought back political calm after a tense end to 2019, and then steered the ship through the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 And when war came to Europe, the government carried the economic burden instead of passing it on to the people, he said.
  The government also implemented reforms that took Malta out of the FATF greylist in record time. 
 “And in a time of challenges, where countries around us have adopted a policy of austerity, I told you to trust me, and we are the best economy in Europe.""
 “If you want to continue down this road, not to stop halfway, I need your vote on June 8, This is how to continue our path of success. What we’ve achieved so far is only the beginning,” Abela said, as the crowd chanted, “Robert, Robert”. 
 “If you trust me again, I give you my word to achieve so much more”. 
 Energy minister Miriam Dalli, who spoke before Abela, said the PN was incapable of presenting itself as an alternative government. 
 ""Their only tool is to encourage people to give up,"" she said, adding that the Labour Party instead encourages hope.

"Helena Dalli receives threatening message, drugs; son slams police inaction",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/helena-dalli-confirms-receiving-threating-message-home.1097792,09-09-2024,"007017.png,007018.png","Updated 6.42am Monday with Luke Dalli's Facebook post, photo of threatening message.  
 European Commissioner Helena Dalli has confirmed that somebody entered the drive of her house in Malta and left a threatening message on her doorstep.
 The case was reported on Il-Mument on Sunday, which said it was the latest episode of an increasingly divided Labour Party as Dalli was sidelined by the prime minister.
 Dalli in a Facebook post did not give the context of the threatening message but said it happened on July 31 when a man placed a note on the doorstep warning "" darb' oħra inkun ippreparat b'xi ħaga għat-tfal"". (Next time I will be prepared with something for the children."")
 She said she reported the case to the police and handed over CCTV footage showing the man walking up her drive, and his car outside.
 Last week she enquired about what had happened to the investigation and was told ""We have not come up with anything.""
  Dalli's son Luke said in a Facebook post late on Sunday also revealed that the threatening note came accompanied by a bag of drugs.
 He said that he had found the threatening note on the doorstep, along with the bag of drugs when he took his son to his grandmother's. 
 He slammed the police for not having done anything about it, despite having 'crystal-clear footage,' and he wondered why the case was not taken seriously.
 He also published a picture of the note and asked who would be held to account if what was in the note materialised.
  Opposition leader Bernard Grech and former Repubblika president Robert Aquilina expressed solidarity with Dalli over the threats.
 Bernard Grech said he had phoned the European Commissioner to express his solidarity and said it was a disgrace that a month after the incident the police commissioner had not investigated it.
  Grech said he had offered support to Dalli and her family.
 ""If Commissioner Angelo Gafà is unable to investigate threats against a European Commissioner and appears to have done nothing in a month despite being in possession of footage, one can only wonder how ordinary Maltese citizens can feel safe in their homes,"" Grech said in Facebook post.
 Aquilina in another post said Dalli should be offered protection.
 ""There should be no grounds for threats and intimidation in a democracy,"" he said in a Facebook post. ""We have a duty to live our values, independently of who the people are. I disagree on a thousand things with Helena Dalli but that does not mean we should close an eye to threats made to her.""
  Dalli is in the last weeks of her five-year-term as European Commissioner having previously served as minister under Joseph Muscat and Robert Abela.
 Last week her husband claimed that senior officials in the Labour Party had worked to destroy his wife’s credibility and stop her from becoming Malta’s president.
 “Soon you will know the manoeuvres that were made in the appointment of the President of Malta by two high-ranking officials of the Labour Party to harm Helena's credibility,"" Patrick Dalli told social media users.
 “It was a fascist attack on a woman who dedicated her life to the Labour Party and the Maltese people.""
 Patrick Dalli had taken to Facebook with his claim after the newspaper Illum said Helena Dalli was lobbying for a second term as European Commissioner, instead of Glenn Micallef, who is Malta’s nominee for the post.
 Illum said that Dalli was attempting to strong-arm her way into securing a second term as Malta's EU Commissioner and she was going about this by criticising Micallef's lack of political experience. 
 Helena Dalli had ""categorically denied"" the  Illum report, adding in a Facebook post that she had more than enough experience to know where reports of dubious purpose originated. 
 ""As I have always done, I choose to continue working in the country's best interest and I will never stoop to these levels of low quality,"" she said.
 ""That being said, there is a limit to everything and you cannot always allow deception to go by unchecked."" 
 The Dallis’ son, Luke also announced last week that he was quitting the PL’s broadcasting stations.

Bill to introduce electronic tagging moved in parliament,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/bill-introduce-electronic-tagging-moved-parliament.1102224,12-10-2024,007034.png,"A bill to introduce electronic tagging for people convicted of certain crimes started being discussed in parliament on Monday.
 Home Affairs Minister Byron Camilleri said the courts would be authorised to order electronic tagging for people liable to a prison term of not more than one year as well as in cases where a restraining order is imposed or when a court issues a temporary protection order. 
 Electronic tagging will not be available for those who commit crimes carrying a penalty of two or more years.
 Electronic monitoring also cannot be ordered in cases of domestic violence, gender-based violence, family maintenance obligations, access to children and cases related to child abuse. 
 However electronic tagging can be ordered in domestic violence cases where a temporary protection order is issued. In such cases, the victim could also be given a device to carry which would set off an alarm when the aggressor approaches.   
 This, the minister said, would be an additional layer of protection for society, particularly victims who feared being approached by aggressors. He cautioned, however, that this was not a perfect system. 
 It was important to point out, Camilleri said, that this law did not cover persons out on bail, although this could come about in the future. This mechanism could be developed in phases.
 The minister said that apart from the courts, electronic monitoring could be ordered by the prison authorities for those on prison leave and the Parole Board for those on parole.
 LESA would be responsible for the operational aspects of the system.
 Opposition Home Affairs spokesman Darren Carabott said he supported the law but it was unfortunate that this bill had been moved now when it was announced five years ago. Had the government acted earlier, victims would have been afforded that additional layer of protection sooner.  
 The interests of victims needed to be given paramount importance, Carabott said. Every measure to improve their protection deserved support. 
 However, this law could also help in the rehabilitation of people who committed minor crimes and would otherwise end up in prison. It was well known that the prisons system was not that successful in Malta and the country had a high rate of recidivism. 
 Carabott also observed that according to international reports, electronic monitoring represented value for money, substituting more expensive incarceration.
 But it was crucial that there was strict monitoring and that those found in breach were promptly punished. 
 Would the monitoring be in real-time?
 Would the authorities be able to know promptly if the electronic tag was removed or tampered with? And how fast would the response time be?
 Would the tags also be able to monitor health aspects of the wearer, such as to ensure there was no excessive alcohol drinking? 
 Did the government intend to eventually extend electronic tagging if its introduction proved successful? 
 Concluding, Carabott urged the government to ensure that enough resources were allocated for the electronic tagging system to work efficiently.

PAC chair calls for mechanism to force action after investigations,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/pac-chair-carbott-follow-up-investigations-mechanism.1097221,31-08-2024,007036.png,"Government entities should come up with an action plan to overcome the shortcomings highlighted by the Public Accounts Committee, the committee’s chair Darren Carabott has said.
 “What happens now is that witnesses are called to the PAC to face public scrutiny. After all witnesses have testified, the committee simply declares that the investigation has ended,” the PN MP said.
 He said that after a PAC investigation, the National Audit Office should list a set of recommendations.
 The public entity at the centre of PAC scrutiny would then have to produce an action plan based on those recommendations.
 “This is not re-inventing the wheel,” Carabott said.
 The Public Accounts Committee is responsible for scrutinising government spending.
 Across the world, several such committees have systems for follow-up of investigations, the MP said, citing the UK and Canadian parliaments as examples.
 In both systems, the PAC may present recommendations to the government for improvements in the administrative and financial practices of public bodies.
 Last May, the House of Commons presented a report to parliament on the UK government’s Rwanda scheme, a policy to relocate to Rwanda those people identified as being in the UK illegally or seeking asylum after arriving via an illegal route.
 Carabott believes it should be the auditor general’s office to draw up a report on the PAC investigation. But Malta’s PAC does not have the resources to do that kind of work, he said.
 It is also rife with political division, which can hinder recommendations, he added.
 The NAO sometimes lists recommendations in its initial report, but it can build on that following the PAC investigation, he said.
 The committee examines reports from the auditor general and investigates matters related to public spending, including how government departments and agencies manage their finances. It does this by calling witnesses who testify by answering the committee’s questions.
 The government holds a majority in the seven-seat committee, but unlike other parliamentary committees, it is chaired by the opposition.
 It is considered one of the more-heated committees in parliament and receives considerable attention from the public, often because of the stature of those testifying.

Turkish family runs into EU visa dead-end: 'Why can't our family visit us?',timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/turkish-family-runs-eu-visa-deadend-why-cant-family-visit-us.1097801,15-09-2024,007040.png,"A Turkish couple have spoken of their frustration after two of their relatives’ visa applications for a family visit were rejected.
 Elif Ören Acar said her mother-in-law and brother-in-law had been planning to fly to Malta this week for a three-month visit to celebrate her and her husband’s recent wedding.
 But their plans were halted when they were told their visa applications had been refused by the Maltese embassy in Istanbul.
 The rejections come at a time when Turkish citizens are seeing a spike in visa refusals to visit the EU, which had tripled over the last decade and were expected to surge this year, according to a July report in news outlet Türkiye Today.
 The Turkish Embassy, meanwhile, said it was “aware of some visa issues especially with Turkish students, workers and citizens,” adding it was working with the Maltese government to find a solution.
 Acar said she and her husband have lived in Malta for around 10 years, calling the country their “home” and saying they “love Malta”.
 The couple got married in Malta in December and had planned to visit Turkey last month to hold a second wedding in front of their families but decided to cancel their plans after a family bereavement and becoming aware of increased work commitments.
  So, they decided to invite their family to visit them in Malta instead.
 “We sent an invitation letter [an EU visa requirement] with both of our incomes listed,” said Acar, stressing she and her husband were financially secure, with both in the country under the Key Employee Initiative (KEI) which fast-tracks residence permits for skilled non-EU workers.
 She said her in-laws paid more than €600 for their short stay visa applications, including application fees and notary fees in Turkey, and were “shocked” when they received the refusal letter.
 Their applications were refused on grounds that the “justification for the purpose and conditions of the intended stay was not reliable,” according to a copy of the refusal letter shown to Times of Malta.
 Slamming the decision, Acar said she was “perplexed and annoyed” by the situation and questioned what else she and her husband could do.
 “We’re financially well-educated, pay our taxes and engage with our community. I am so sad; we are self-made, good people. We have built a harmonious life in Malta. Why can’t our family visit us?”
 Responding to questions, a foreign ministry spokesperson said the Acars “should avail of their right to appeal”, adding visa applications were “reviewed according to their own merits and in adherence to the local legislation and the Schengen and visa codes”.
 In May, visa and immigration-oriented media outlet SchengenNews reported that last year, Schengen countries rejected 16% of Turkish visa applications, accounting for 169,500 denied visas.
 The same year, Schengen countries were estimated to have raked in €130 million in rejected visa application fees, an increase of €25 million on the year before, according to news outlet EU Observer.
 Meanwhile, despite describing Türkiye as a “key partner” and acknowledging it as a candidate country for EU membership, a European Commission report last year said the country had not made progress on visa issues.
 “No outstanding benchmarks under the visa liberalisation roadmap were fulfilled. Türkiye still needs to further align its legislation with the EU acquis on visa policy,” the report said.
 Highlighting differences in foreign policy, which “constitutes an important element in the context of the EU-Türkiye relationship,” the report said the country’s “unilateral foreign policy” was at odds with that of the EU.
 “Türkiye maintained a very low alignment rate of 10% with the EU stance on foreign and security policy (as of August 2023), compared to 8% in 2022,” the report said.

Malta’s OSCE ambassador: ‘We will play a bigger role in international relations’,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/malta-osce-ambassador-we-play-bigger-role-international-relations.1102178,14-12-2024,,"Malta will play a bigger role in international relations following a successful year chairing the OSCE, the world’s largest regional security organisation, the Maltese ambassador to the group has said.
 Natasha Meli Daudey, Permanent Representative to the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, said the country “should and will play a bigger role in international relations”.
 “We showed what a small country could do, and I say this with a lot of pride, because the comments I’ve heard are that we have put Malta on the map,” said Meli Daudey, who also serves as ambassador to Austria.
 “Malta was extremely successful at the OSCE and definitely exceeded all expectations; we were asked to just keep the organisation alive by doing the minimum, and we went beyond that,” she said.
 “Now we have sown these seeds... I don’t think that it will be forgotten easily.”
  Meli Daudey was speaking to Times of Malta following this year’s OSCE Ministerial Council, which took place at the end of last week at Ta’ Qali.
 The largest international conference of ministers Malta has hosted to date, the gathering grabbed headlines around the world, not least because of the controversial appearance of Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.
 Looking back at the conference, Meli Daudey described preparation for the event as having been a “massive task” and paid tribute to the Maltese staff working on it.
 Countries are usually notified years in advance of ascending to the chair of the organisation, having plenty of time to prepare for ministerial councils, while Malta took up the role in January with only three weeks’ notice.
 “It was a lot of work and extremely complicated to manage, and then there were the politics of it all,” she said.
 Calling Malta a “bridge builder”, Meli Daudey said the country had partly been chosen because of its history of neutrality: “We have only one main interest: peace and security. So, we were able to talk to everyone.”
 While stressing Malta had remained “very principled” on the Ukraine war – a divisive issue that has seen Russia marginalised on the world stage – its delegation “told the Russians what they had to be told” while keeping channels of communication open.
 “On the side we were still able to speak and to do diplomacy, and that was the trick – and it was accepted by them as well,” Meli Daudey explained.
 “As long as we managed to do the diplomacy behind the scenes, they accepted the fact that we told them exactly what they deserve to be told in public.”
 Torpedoed talks
 Despite announcing four top leadership appointments last week, the OSCE failed to reach agreement on its budget for this year, a long-standing issue for the organisation.
 While it has been able to function by instead being allotted a monthly budget based on funds allocated to the previous budget, Meli Daudey explained, the arrangement was proving expensive, with the group unable to make long-term commitments.
 While it came close to agreement, “a country in the South Caucasus” – an area bordering Eastern Europe and West Asia – had torpedoed the talks at the last moment, she explained.
 “There was a lot of effort, even personal effort by the chairing office [Foreign Minister Ian Borg] himself. He negotiated numbers personally, went to the two countries and tried to convince them... we were very close, but then one of the countries decided not to join consensus.
 “You need the 57 [countries in the OSCE] to agree. And the problem is that when the consensus principle is used as a veto, you cannot move.”
 Detainees and small states
 In July, Russia sentenced OSCE monitoring mission official Vadym Golda to 14 years in prison for alleged “espionage” in the occupied Donbas region of Ukraine, the third official from the organisation to face such action.
 The trio’s detention has provoked a strong reaction, with Malta, UK and Canada among those having called for their immediate release.
 Borg has called their treatment “unjust, inhumane and unacceptable”.
 Asked about the issue, Meli Daudey said the Maltese delegation discusses it at “each and every meeting we have with the Russians, but it remains difficult. We definitely haven’t convinced them”.
 Looking to the future, although Malta’s chairing of the organisation ends this month, Meli Daudey believes the country’s record could lead to more small countries taking the lead at the OSCE.
 “Malta set a very good example, and people saw how it can work without compromising on principles. I truly think there will be bigger roles for countries like ours.”

PN slams MEP Daniel Attard for his comment about traffic in Malta,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/pn-slams-mep-daniel-attard-traffic-increased-malta.1098159,16-09-2024,007110.png,"Updated 4.10pm with Attard comments
 The Nationalist Party has accused Labour MEP Daniel Attard of being disconnected from Maltese society after a comment he made about traffic in Malta. 
 Speaking on Labour media outlet ONE on Sunday, Attard argued that people tended to forget how bad traffic was in some areas a few years ago. He said he wanted to see empirical data before concluding that traffic is now at its worst.  
 ""They say traffic has increased. I'd like to see a study saying that,"" Attard said. He noted improvements in traffic flow in Qormi, Luqa, Mrieħel and Attard in recent years. 
 PN MP and shadow minister for transport Mark Anthony Sammut said Attard's comment showed he was already disconnected from the daily reality faced by the Maltese just a few months after his election to Brussels.
  Last year, a study published by the Faculty for Social Wellbeing at the University of Malta showed that 97% of Maltese people believe traffic has increased considerably in the last two or three years, Sammut recalled.
 ""It seems that Labour MEP Daniel Attard and the Labour government are among the 3% who think this is not the case. And if they cannot even acknowledge a problem, how will they solve it?""
 In comments to Times of Malta, Attard said his words were being taken out of context to score ""infantile"" political points. 
 ""I never said or meant that we don’t have a traffic issue. Everyone can see and feel it. It’s a challenge that has been building up for years,"" he said. 
 ""Let’s move beyond this infantile reporting of mentioning a few words out of context, just to spark controversy. Let's have a serious discussion, not just gimmicks for social media."" 
 In his comments, on Sunday, Attard also acknowledged that Malta's growing economy had brought with it new challenges and that families now had several cars.
 Citizens, he said, would need to play a leading and vocal role if transport infrastructure is to change.

Grech: Nothing but one scandal after another under Labour,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/grech-nothing-one-scandal-another-labour.1097779,09-08-2024,007116.png,"The Labour government has not done ""one right thing” and has faced “one scandal after another” in recent months, PN leader Bernard Grech said on Sunday. 
 “We have a government that doesn't do one right thing, and they will quote me as being out of context or wrong, but name me one thing they did right in these past few months,” Grech said. 
 “It has been one scandal after another. Especially in Byron Camilleri’s ministry, where week after week, a new scandal emerges.”
 Speaking on NET TV, the Opposition leader referred to allegations about Identity theft and the decision by Identita' - the state ID agency -  to require applications for residence permits by third-country nationals to be accompanied by an attested property agreement.
 The Notarial Council and Chamber of Advocates have complained of lack of consultation and directed members not to put their signatures on these new forms.  
 Grech said the decision to not consult the professionals was another sign of how the government was trying to ignore the scandal and continue as if nothing was wrong.    
  ""We have a minister who remains silent and a prime minister who continues to defend him,” Grech said.
 “This is a clear reflection of a government that allows its internal conflict to impact our society.”
 
 Grech also called out Camilleri for protecting Police Commissioner Angelo Gafà, who failed to carry out any form of investigation in the Vitals Case. He was also protected after he 'lied' about domestic violence victim Nicolette Ghirxi.
 After Ghirxi's murder, Gafà said she did not want to sit for a risk assessment, but the family lawyer provided documents showing she had agreed to take a risk assessment but told a friend and her lawyer that she was ""talked out of it"" by professionals when she attended her evaluation.
 During the interview, Grech said the party was working hard in preparation for the next general election. 
 ""My biggest responsibility as a leader is not just to be prepared for the general election, but to be prepared to govern this country,"" he said.
 ""As a government, we will not only be prepared to address the problems the Labour government would have left but also to ensure that our country is given a better quality of life.""
 He said the party would continue to reach out to people and businesses to listen ""to their story"" and to work together. 
 In preparation for Independence Day, the party would hold several activities, that would lead to the mass meeting on 20 September, he said.

Prime Minister accuses PN of 'persecuting' residents of Siġġiewi social housing,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/prime-minister-blames-pn-persecuting-residents-social-housing.1092731,20-05-2024,007164.png,"Updated 5.35pm with PN reaction
 Robert Abela accused the Nationalist Party of “persecuting” residents of a Siġġiewi social housing on Monday, despite the fact that a court concluded they were manipulated into switching their address to the government housing block.
 Last week, a court ruled that voters were “shamefully manipulated” to change their address to government apartments they were granted in  Siġġiewi even though they were not yet habitable. 
 Magistrate Donatella Frendo Dimech said the residents were induced into making a false declaration by government bodies who were thus potential accomplices in the criminal wrongdoing. 
 She was ruling in some of the first cases instituted by the Nationalist Party against 99 people in what it had described as a case of “gerrymandering”. 
  Yet, speaking to journalists, Abela brushed off the courts' concerns and instead pointed the blame to the Nationalist Party, adding how the party has been against the development from the beginning. 
 ""I am more concerned about the Nationalist Party persecuting the 84 families,"" Abela said.
 “It is an opposition party which is indifferent to the needs of the group of people who require the most help.
 “We are different from that. Because of those 84 families, we provided dignity, dignity through affordable housing. For me, that is the most fundamental point.”
 
 Abela brushed off how the court noted fraudulent activities in the case, and instead accused the Nationalist Party of fraud, since it refused to publish its accounts. 
 Abela also brushed off the timing of the allocation of the social housing, coinciding with the upcoming June 8 elections. 
 “The court has made its decision. One can agree or disagree with it, but we must respect the decision,” he added. 
 “What I can say is that those 84 families will remember what the PN put them through.”
 Abela said the timing of the publication of the conclusion of the Vitals Inquiry, weeks before the June 8 elections, concerned him as it could influence the public. 
 He also said most of the inquiry happened behind the backs of people who are now being charged, and the same people found a “death sentence” behind their doors without knowing they were being investigated. 
 Over the past weeks, Abela has repetitively slammed the timing of the publication of the Vitals hospital inquiry, stating it was not coincidental. 
  “An inquiry that started over five years ago, another four years in front of this magistrate, closed the day we announced the candidates for the European Parliament and local council elections,” Abela said. 
 The Nationalist Party hit back at Abela, accusing him of deceiving people after also deceiving voters to try to ""steal"" the Siġġiewi council, ahead of council elections. 
 ""The PL deceived and manipulated people, some of whom are vulnerable. The court has already confirmed electoral fraud, to the extent that it has called for a police investigation to identify the manipulation,"" the PN said in a statement. 
 Despite this, and without shame, Abela tried to attack the PN which realised what was going on, said a statement signed by PN general secretary Michael Piccinino and spokesperson Ivan Bartolo. 
 ""The only person responsible for this persecution is Robert Abela who got voters into trouble.""

Robert Abela slams ‘dangerous attack' on Yorgen Fenech trial,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/robert-abela-slams-dangerous-attack-yorgen-fenech-trial.1097486,09-01-2024,007263.png,"Robert Abela has slammed a “dangerous attack” by lawyer Jason Azzopardi on the upcoming trial of murder suspect Yorgen Fenech.
 Speaking on ONE Radio, the prime minister indirectly referred to a court decision this week, which ordered Lovin Malta to edit an interview it carried out with Azzopardi.
 In the interview, Azzopardi said all the evidence pointed to Fenech being the sole mastermind behind the October 2017 assassination of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia.
 The former MP is one of two lawyers representing the Caruana Galizia family.
 Fenech's lawyers hit out at the ""untrue"" statements in a court application this week.
 In response, Judge Edwina Grima, who will be presiding over the trial, reportedly ordered Lovin Malta to remove the section of Azzopardi’s interview referencing Fenech, as it could influence jurors and interfere with the administration of justice.
 Without referring to Azzopardi by name, the prime minister slammed those who “act like they are the paladins of the rule of law, then make declarations that contaminate court procedures”.
 Abela said the reasons behind such declarations worried him.
 He lauded the court for taking the necessary steps to stem the “abuse” and protect the judicial process.
 Fenech, who denies wrongdoing, was arrested in November 2019 over his alleged role in commissioning the assassination.
 The Tumas businessman has claimed former OPM chief of staff Keith Schembri is the real mastermind behind the murder.
 Upon his arrest, Fenech initially pinned the murder on ex-minister Chris Cardona, later claiming that it was Schembri who instructed him to blame Cardona.
 During his interview on Sunday, Abela also hit out at the “frontal attack” on health minister Jo Etienna Abela and home affairs minister Byron Camilleri.
 The health minister has been under pressure over the death of 55-year-old Stephen Mangion at Mater Dei while Camilleri has faced  claims he knew of an alleged racket LESA.
 Abela said “unfounded attacks” were unacceptable, vowing that the government will fight back against them.
 The prime minister said it was his government that pushed reforms which improved the judicial process, including the introduction of magistrates dedicated to working on inquiries.
 In the past, he said everyone was comfortable with a system whereby magisterial inquiries either got shelved or took years to be concluded.

 Monday's parliamentary sitting was interrupted on Monday because of a power cut.
 The outage happened during question time as PN MP Mark Anthony Sammut was asking questions to Lands Minister Stefan Zrinzo Azzopardi.
 
 The sitting was resumed after a few minutes as a generator kicked in. 
 It was not immediately clear if the power cut was internal or affected the whole of Valletta but a parliamentary source said the power cut was from the outside mains supply.  A reader reported a power cut lasting a few seconds in Hamrun at the same time.
 A spokesperson for Enemalta said later that there were no power outages in Valletta. However a cable fault occurred in Msida which is fed from Valletta distribution centre. A voltage disturbance may have affected the parliament's electricity network for a couple of seconds until it was stabilised to normal.
 Malta suffered a nation-wide hour-long power outage earlier this month, which was blamed on maintenance work on the Maghtab switchgear of the Malta-Sicily interconnector. According to Enemalta, during testing of the switchgear, a number of distribution feeders tripped.
 Readers also reported power cuts in parts of Zebbuġ, Siġġiewi on Monday evening.
 A Zebbuġ resident said power was lost and returned three times before going out again at about 8.15pm. It returned shortly after.

Migration policy to target firms with high turnover of foreigners,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/migration-policy-target-firms-high-turnover-foreigners.1101168,18-11-2024,007389.png,"The government’s planned Labour Migration Policy will introduce sanctions for employers with a high turnover of foreign workers, Prime Minister Robert Abela has announced.
 In the second part of the interview with Times of Malta, which is being published today, Abela revealed that the policy aims to ensure fair treatment of workers and curtail exploitative employment practices. The policy was discussed during a cabinet meeting last Friday.
 “Employers with a high turnover rate [of foreign workers], whose habit is to hire and fire large numbers only to replace them within a day or two, will face sanctions.  This is about aligning our policies with the dignity and respect workers deserve,” Abela said.
  He added that such measures will be open to public consultation and form part of broader efforts to regulate the labour market.
 The policy, which according to the prime minister is the first of its kind to be discussed in a dedicated cabinet session, will assess Malta’s labour needs and propose strategies to balance economic growth with worker welfare.
 Abela pointed to recent legislation addressing temping agencies, Y-plates and food couriers as an example of the government’s efforts to clamp down on unregulated practices.
 He underscored the social responsibility tied to labour migration, highlighting the need for a shift in focus from the quantity of workers to their quality.
 “Whether Maltese or foreign, employers must understand that their greatest resource is their workforce, and they need to invest in them,” he emphasised.
  The prime minister also acknowledged Malta’s challenges with irregular migration and human trafficking, claiming that the nation remains a leader in addressing these issues in the Mediterranean.
 “Our policy is clear: we focus on prevention at source, not just managing arrivals. This is part of our significant contribution at the EU level, ensuring that migration is consistently discussed at the highest levels,” he said.
 Questioned about Italy’s agreement to transfer the entire asylum process to Albania, Abela expressed his support.
 “Italy’s approach aligns with the return-hub mechanism concept we developed. While our approach is slightly different, the principle is the same, and I believe this initiative needs to be addressed through EU legislative frameworks.”
  However, Abela noted that Malta has yet to secure any similar agreements.
 “We’ve achieved significant success with our return policies, ensuring that those who do not qualify for asylum are returned to their countries of origin.”
 He called for an update to European laws governing migration, referencing judicial decisions that often complicate enforcement.

Nobody discouraged me from running for Labour president – Alex Sciberras,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/nobody-discouraged-running-labour-president-alex-sciberras.1098017,14-09-2024,007418.png,"Nobody in Labour discouraged Alex Sciberras from running for party president, he told Times of Malta.
 In an interview a few days before Labour delegates go to the polls, the lawyer and former Msida mayor dismissed rumours that the party leadership tried to dissuade him from contesting one of the party’s top roles.
 He acknowledged some people within the party feared a contest might naturally cause divisions, “because everyone wants to win”, but insisted that if a contest is done right, it is only beneficial to the party.
 “This is a race between friends – we’re not attacking each other but debating ideas. Norma [Saliba] and myself are genuinely friends and this is truly a race between two friends,” he said.
  “We have different characters, styles, and ideas but both of us want the PL to move forward.”
 Labour is holding internal elections this weekend to shake up its topmost officials in an effort to renew itself and remain appealing to a voter base which showed disgruntlement in June’s MEP election.
 Several sources close to the PL said that, despite many people showing interest in throwing their names in the hat for the different roles, only one person ended up running in almost every role.
 They say some people were discouraged from contesting to avoid causing internal frictions and unnecessary divisions at a time when the party needed to appear united as one front.
 The role of party president is one of just two roles where there is a contest – between Sciberras and Saliba, the former TVM head of news who is now the CEO of the Maltese Language Centre.
 The two hope to succeed former president Ramona Attard, who announced last month she would not be seeking re-election for this or any other role.
 Sciberras also dismissed rumours he was Joseph Muscat’s candidate and Saliba was Robert Abela’s pick.
 “I’m nobody’s candidate. I was raised in the party and I’ve been active in it since 2003. I worked under Alfred Sant, Joseph Muscat and I work under Robert Abela. I only wave one flag – the PL flag,” he said, adding he works really well with Abela.
 He defended Saliba’s PBS employment, saying there was nothing wrong with someone holding a role like that while also being a party official, as long as they do both jobs well.
 “Is there anything wrong for a person with a public role to also have political views? Shouldn’t they also enjoy the right to party membership,” he asked.
 Saliba is still a PBS employee, albeit seconded to the Centre for the Maltese Language. However, her formal affiliation with the Labour Party’s administration would seemingly preclude her from holding a role at the public broadcaster, with PBS ethics guidelines saying that “all PBS (news) staff should refrain from publicly associating themselves with a political party”.
 
 The guidelines also instruct employees to refrain from endorsing political parties, participating in any campaign, express support for a political party or cause, or act in any way “that damages PBS’s reputation for strict neutrality in reporting on politics and government”.
 Sciberras insisted, however, his opponent has a fundamental right to her political views. Pushed on the fact that being party president goes far beyond simply having a political view, he would not budge.
 “This applies even to judges and magistrates, as long as they perform their duties well and impartially,” he said. “It’s time we recognise that people of integrity are also able to rise to the standards that are expected of them in their public role.”
 Sciberras, who is the son of the late Judge Philip Sciberras, first became active in the Labour Party 20 years ago, in its youth wing and eventually served as Msida’s first Labour mayor. He also sat on the district council and held various positions within government in recent years.
 He said voters still believe Labour is the best party to move the country forward but there are issues that must be addressed. People still trust the party but they expect a better version of it.
 “They feel their quality of life has been impacted. The economy is growing and there is more work, yes, but that also means they must work more hours, get stuck in traffic, contend with construction and feel like they cannot open a window in their own home or go to a recreational public place that is not overcrowded,” he said.
 “If we don’t accept that construction is annoying people, we would be fooling ourselves. The solution shouldn’t be to stop development, rather, to find balance between economic growth and quality of life and one must not come at the expense of the other.”
 Another solution is to reignite vivid debates and conversations with delegates within the party, he believes. Policy and decision-making should be spurred by their involvement.
 “Every governing party inevitably focuses most of its resources on running the country – it happened to the PN as well – which means it sometimes forgets to pay enough attention to the party and its structures,” he said.
 “That’s why we must reignite discussions, because we need to be clear with ourselves where we want to go in the next five years.”
 The party should not be closed off either, he added. It needs to better reach out to people and the media instead of closing itself behind the walls of a siege mentality.
 “We shouldn’t be ashamed of ourselves. We made mistakes but we did many great things as well.”

EU says forced return of Syrians 'not possible' for now,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/eu-says-forced-return-syrians-not-possible-now.1102381,13-12-2024,,"The EU's migration chief said that forcibly returning Syrians to their home country was ""not possible"" for the time being, after member state Austria said it was planning to do so.
 Vienna signalled this week it intended to deport refugees back to war-ravaged Syria, after an Islamist-led rebel offensive ended the Assad clan's decades-long grip on the country.
 
 But the European Union's migration commissioner Magnus Brunner - who is himself Austrian - made clear following talks with interior ministers in Brussels that such a move would be premature.
 Syrian rebel forces led by the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) have appointed an interim prime minister to lead Syria until March, and vowed to institute the ""rule of law"".
 But with HTS rooted in Syria's branch of Al-Qaeda, the joy of Assad's overthrow has been accompanied by uncertainty about the future of the multi-ethnic, multi-confessional country. 
 ""For now, I would say forced return is not possible,"" Brunner told a press conference - while noting that returning home voluntarily ""may be attractive for many Syrians"" celebrating the end of Bashar al-Assad's brutal rule.
 ""As the situation is still volatile, we have to focus on these voluntary returns,"" Brunner said, arguing for EU support - including financial - for returnees.
 ""When it comes to the question of money, yes,"" Brunner said. ""I think we have to do something.""
 The war in Syria - unleashed by Assad's bloody crackdown on protests in 2011 - helped spark a migrant crisis that saw more than one million people arrive in Europe in 2015.
 Multiple EU nations including Malta, Germany and Italy have frozen new asylum requests by Syrian citizens in the wake of Assad's ouster, with more than 100,000 cases pending across the bloc at the end of October according to official data.

PN mocks Robert Abela's 'establishment' rhetoric,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/pn-mocks-robert-abela-establishment-rhetoric.1091931,05-03-2024,007472.png,"Updated 6.40pm with Labour reaction
 Robert Abela claims that a shadowy “establishment” is out to destroy independent media while leading a country that ranks terribly on media freedom, the Nationalist Party noted with irony on Friday.
 “Robert Abela has conjured up a ghoul that he’s trying to distract people with,” the PN said. “And when the independent media ask him about this ‘establishment’, he can only manage ambiguous statements that nobody can understand.
 “He says that this ‘establishment’ is trying to destroy the media. It’s ironic that Robert Abela is saying this when our country ranks among Europe’s worst when it comes to media freedom,” the PN said in a statement.
 It was referring to the outcome of the 2024 Press Freedom Index, which saw Malta rank second-from-bottom across the EU, despite rising 11 places on the index.
 Referring to the murder of Daphne Caruana Galizia, the PN said that “a government that was found guilty of assassinating a  journalist can never be taken seriously when it tries to speak about press freedom”.
 An inquiry into Caruana Galizia’s 2017 murder concluded that the state had to bear responsibility for that crime, as it allowed a culture of impunity to fester.
 Abela has in recent days cranked up rhetoric about an “establishment” that he claims is intent on harming the Labour Party and Labour interests.
 But while he has singled out Magistrate Gabriella Vella for criticism, he has stopped short of identifying others he believes are part of this “establishment”.
 Instead, he has sought to fire up Labour supporters by saying they can hit back at the judiciary by voting on June 8. Labour insiders have confided that the party is concerned that lacklustre turnout among its core supporters will lead to the party losing its fourth MEP seat.
 When asked again on Friday by a Malta Today journalist who forms part of the ""establishment"", Abela did not name names but said it is out to ""destroy  Malta Today."" 
 Magistrate Vella completed an inquiry into the Vitals hospital privatisation deal last week. That probe, which remains secret, is expected to lead to criminal charges against many current and former Labour politicians, including Abela’s predecessor Joseph Muscat.
 Muscat has said that he is being targeted as part of a “political vendetta” while Abela has said the inquiry was intentionally timed to damage Labour’s electoral prospects.
 In a reaction, the Labour Party said that PN leader Bernard Grech cannot stand up to the ""establishment"" because it installed him in his post. 
 ""He knows that he will remain there only for as long as he bows to the will of a group of people that took over a party and want to take over a country,"" the party said.

 Said Pullicino told Times of Malta that he had relayed a message of solidarity and support to Magistrate Gabriella Vella during the ""extremely trying and difficult times she has been and still is unjustly passing through"".
 ""I underlined that it is the destiny and duty of judges and magistrates to bear in silence and serenely the grave injustices they are subjected to at the hands of those who should know much better. I stressed that she should find comfort in the conviction that she has performed her arduous task without fear or favour, with commendable courage to the best of her ability.  She has been an example to many while continuing to underscore and strengthen the Courts as the ultimate and strongest bastion of democracy in the country,"" he wrote.
 ""It is the Courts that, through their decisions and judgements, guarantee the rule of law and secure justice for all, ensuring that everyone without exception is held accountable for his/her actions. Not through the verdict of any people's tribunal,  even if expressed in a popular vote, however wide the margin,"" the former chief justice said. 
 
 Said Pullicino had sat on the public inquiry into the murder of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia and later recounted how he found the experience 'traumatic'.
 He wrote later: “I realised that most, if not all, allegations of abuse of power, maladministration and corruption would not have happened had there not been the active or passive connivance if not complicity of public administrators including some heading government ministries and departments as well as public authorities and entities.”  
 In a 437-page report, Said Pullicino, retired judge Michael Mallia and Madam Justice Abigail Lofaro concluded that a culture of impunity was created from the highest echelons of power within Castille under former prime minister Joseph Muscat.

 The complaint came from PN general secretary Michael Piccinino, who argued that when he announced his intention to resign from his position in August, TVM failed to give him adequate coverage. 
 Conversely, when former Labour president Ramona Attard stepped down, the station went into extensive coverage of her departure. 
 Meanwhile, Piccinino said that when it came to coverage of him, TVM opted to simply report what had been reported in a Times of Malta story about him, and did not carry his comment, as it did with Attard. 
 In a decision handed down on Friday, the BA board noted that while both reports were of similar content, they were broadcast in a different way despite their similarities. 
 It felt that while TVM had carried Attard's comments about her resignation, it had not treated Piccinino similarly and only carried comments from Bernard Grech about his departure from the role. 
 For these reasons, the board accepted the complaint and ordered PBS to broadcast the outcome of the decision within two days.

Nigel Vella's deleted post after PL CEO snub: 'This time it won't go unnoticed',timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/nigel-vella-deleted-post-pl-ceo-snub-this-time-wont-go-unnoticed.1096557,08-09-2024,"007524.png,007525.png","The government's former deputy head of communications Nigel Vella deleted a cryptic social media post on Friday, after being snubbed for the Labour Party's CEO post. 
 ""A phone call that changes everything. It was not even in person because that was difficult. One punch, two punches, this time it will not go unnoticed,"" Vella wrote on Facebook on Friday morning.
 Vella had been touted to take over as Labour CEO, however, in a decision described as surprising by party insiders, it was announced Leonid McKay will take on the role. 
 Vella was on Joseph Muscat's communications team until the former prime minister resigned at the end of 2019. Before resigning, Vella remained in Castille for a year under Robert Abela's tenure. He currently works within the Home Affairs Ministry. 
  Several Labour insiders said Vella had been promised the CEO position once Randolph De Battista stepped aside.
 ""I think many were surprised to hear it wasn't Nigel. It was an open secret that he had been picked for the role,"" one PL official told Times of Malta.
 Unlike other elected roles in the party's administration, the PL's CEO is directly appointed by the party's leader. 
 Vella did not reply to a request for comment but later said on Facebook he would remain loyal to the Labour Party.
 ""Let me remove any doubt for anyone who is rubbing their hands. I was born a Labourite, and I will die a Labourite. I have been and will remain a member of the party. I am made of steel and nothing, and no one will break me. As I have always done for the last 20 years, I will be where my heart beats,"" he said.
 Vella served as the Labour Party's communications chief between 2013 and 2017, subsequently moving to the OPM. His roots in the party date back to his student years, when Vella was part of the PL's youth wing before the 2013 election.
 He is a well-known face among PL supporters, often appearing and presenting current affairs television and radio programmes on the Labour Party's stations.
  Randolph De Battista, who had been party CEO since 2022, announced his resignation on Thursday evening. He did not provide any reasons behind his decision. 
 Within hours, Robert Abela announced McKay, currently Jobsplus CEO, in his place.

Grech claims Clint Camilleri wields disproportionate power over Abela,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/grech-claims-clint-camilleri-wields-disproportionate-power-abela.1102167,12-08-2024,007528.png,"Updated 6.35pm
 Opposition leader Bernard Grech on Sunday questioned who truly held power within the Labour Party, as he renewed his call for Prime Minister Robert Abela to fire Gozo Minister Clint Camilleri. 
 Speaking during an interview on NET TV on Sunday morning, Grech suggested that Camilleri wields disproportionate influence over Abela, casting doubt on the Prime Minister’s leadership.
 Grech warned Abela: “as long as Camilleri remains stronger than you and you don’t get rid of him, he will continue to have the upper hand and do what he wants with you”.
 Grech also alluded to “a new scandal” involving Camilleri, referencing a report published this Sunday in  Il-Mument. The article alleged bribery in the allocation of mooring spaces at Mġarr Harbour, claiming irregularities and implicated the Gozo Minister in the process.
 Grech, who said more details are yet to emerge, claimed that the report was indicative of broader issues within the Labour administration.
 After referencing the report by Il- Mument, he praised the journalists who looked into the story and thanked journalists in general for their work.
 However, Grech avoided addressing an incident earlier this week in which a ONE News journalist was bodychecked while questioning PN MP Toni Bezzina at a PN-led protest.
 The Institute of Maltese Journalists condemned the altercation, describing it as the second such case involving the PN and media workers in recent weeks. 
 During the interview, Grech also criticised the administration’s decision to redirect EU funds intended for electrifying Malta’s public transport system to subsidise private electric vehicles instead. 
 He described the original plan to electrify the fleet as “a step in the right direction” and argued that the change reflected poor leadership and planning.
 “Do them both if you think this is the best for the country and the environment. Do them both if you have the money. Do them both if you can plan.”
 The PN leader also spoke later in the afternoon, during a party fundraising event televised on party-owned NET News. 
 “Buying a first home is never a walk in the park. Even when I left university, it was difficult. But now the problem is bigger. Not only have prices risen, but properties have shrunk, too,” he said. 
 “The PL has clearly not done enough to tackle this problem. A PN government will prioritise housing affordability, through involvement of the private sector,” he said.

Why are women still reluctant to stand for election?,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/why-women-still-reluctant-stand-election.1093145,30-05-2024,007557.png,"Of the 39 candidates angling for a seat at the European Parliament in next month’s election, fewer than a quarter will be women, just as has been the case in every EP election held in Malta to date.
 Only nine women will be standing for election, despite initiatives to bolster women’s political participation, including the gender quota mechanism put in place for 2022’s general elections.
 June’s MEP elections will see a record 13 independent candidates putting their name forward, all of them men.
 
 Meanwhile the Labour Party, which currently holds four of Malta’s six EP seats, is only fielding two women among its nine candidates. Back in 2019, the party had five women on the ballot, with two of them, Miriam Dalli and Josianne Cutajar, eventually being elected.
 The PN, which had only fielded two women in 2019, fares better this year, with half of its eight candidates being women, including incumbent Roberta Metsola.
 ADPD’s candidate list is equally balanced, with two women (party leader Sandra Gauci and Rachelle Deguara) on the four-strong list. Another of the party’s candidates, Mina Jack Tolu, identifies as a non-binary trans person.
 The only other woman on the ballot sheet will be ABBA’s Antonia Gauci, one of the party’s two candidates.
 Things are scarcely better in the local council elections, with only some 160 women among the over 700 candidates.
 Experts who spoke to Times of Malta say that while the issue is too complex to point to a single factor, the low number of female candidates suggests that Malta is still struggling to shake off gender stereotypes and expectations that have been ingrained for generations.
 Many argue that the problem is twofold – women are reluctant to dip their toes into the political sphere in the first place and, when they do, they find it exceedingly difficult to get their campaigns off the ground.
 Nikita Zammit Alamango, who heads Nisa Laburisti, PL’s women’s movement, argues that women face “subconscious biases and overt discrimination in all political environments, from assumptions about their capabilities to unequal access to resources and opportunities”.
 Marie Claire Zammit, chair of the PN’s women’s section MNPN, broadly agrees, saying that caregiving and family responsibilities make it difficult for women to plunge into civic and political life.
 This is especially true of poorly paid local council posts, she says, where the sums simply don’t add up. Being a local councillor requires a “high level of commitment and a high level of expectation from residents”, far beyond a councillor’s meagre honoraria.
 Things are a little better when it comes to MEP elections, Zammit says, probably because the role “involves better pay, a whole package to employ assistants and better conditions for working mothers”.
 
 But, she wonders, would anybody, either male or female, want to enter Malta’s current political environment, “obscured by constant scandals and corruption”?
 Zammit Alamango believes that even when women do decide to step into the political sphere, they face an uphill struggle.
 “Women often encounter barriers in accessing the resources necessary to launch successful political campaigns, including financial support.”
 Visibility in the media is also often harder to come by for women compared to men,
 Zammit Alamango says, making it harder for women to engage with voters.
 Ultimately, Equality Commission chair Renee Laiviera says, Malta has a “predominantly male political environment”, with male incumbency just one of the many factors driving women’s underrepresentation.
 Lawyer and former MEP Therese Comodini Cachia agrees, suggesting that Malta’s politics is still steeped in a macho ethos. If elected, she says, women face the additional challenge of steering clear of “the same male style of politics as their male counterparts”.
 
 The low number of female candidates “says a lot about the state of gender equality in Malta”, Comodini Cachia says drily.
 Sociologist and former MEP candidate Michael Briguglio is less categorical.
 Gender equality has broadly improved in Malta in recent years, he argues, pointing to the rise of women in the workplace, but “sometimes, there can be a culture where men are more encouraged and make more noise, like in unions and political parties”.
 But we shouldn’t reduce everything to gender, he warns, even though this is “a very important variable”. There are other issues that are also at play when choosing to stand for public office, he argues, from social class to lifestyle choices and better professional opportunities outside of politics.
 Not according to Zammit Alamango, who believes that it is too soon to judge. The gender quota has “played a pivotal role in reshaping the landscape for female candidates”, she says, but its true impact will only be seen “in the long term”.
 Laiviera agrees, describing any assessment of the mechanism’s impact as “premature”. Even the simple fact of having more women MPs marks an important step forward on a symbolic level, she says.
 “No longer do we see all male parliamentary sittings; these now send a clear message that our country takes on board the perspectives of both women and men in the legislative and policy-making processes.”
 While admitting that “not everyone agrees with the mechanism used and if they should have been introduced”, Zammit believes that having more women MPs than ever is “a definite catalyst to attract potential women candidates”.
 Still, she says, efforts towards greater gender balance need to be deliberate. “An effort was made to ensure that the electorate has an adequate choice of both female and male candidates on the PN’s list,” she says.

 Scicluna served as finance minister when the deal was signed. 
 ""Now that you have been charged in connection with this fraud, I have no doubt you understand that your continued tenure at the helm of the Central Bank despite the charges will irreparably damage the reputation of our country as a financial centre.

 ""The presumption of innocence is a legal principle afforded to all citizens.

Karl Stagno Navarra's 'Pjazza' axed from ONE TV autumn schedule,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/stagno-navarra-pjazza-axed-one-tv-autumn-schedule.1098806,30-09-2024,007568.png,"Pjazza, the controversial current affairs discussion programme led by Karl Stagno Navarra, has been axed from One TV’s upcoming schedule, but the presenter says he will return to the station in the new year with a more “factual” approach.
 Pjazza had been a mainstay on One TV for the past seven years, with Stagno Navarra’s idiosyncratic approach to the issues of the day infuriating and delighting viewers across the political spectrum in equal measure.
 But the programme is conspicuously absent from One TV’s new autumn schedule, with its 6pm evening slot now taken up by Bil-Fatti, a new programme led by Dorian Cassar and Claudia Cuschieri.
 Stagno Navarro told Times of Malta that while Pjazza had served its purpose, appealing to the party’s hardcore and “keeping PN in check”, the programme’s format needed an overhaul.
 Discussions over the programme’s future had been underway since before June’s European elections, Stagno Navarra said, with the decision to remove the programme from the new schedule taken ""by mutual agreement” several weeks ago.
 Stagno Navarra pledged to return to ONE TV viewers’ screens in the new year with a new programme that will turn over a new leaf.
 “Pjazza was known for its hardcore approach, but that time is over. We now need a more factual, measured tone,” he said.
 When asked about Pjazza’s removal, Labour Party CEO Leonid McKay told Times of Malta that ONE TV’s new schedule “caters for innovative content”, replacing the past years' current affairs programming which included Pjazza, among others.
 “Each new schedule features several changes and new programmes, and the schedule presented today is no different,” he said.
 The decision to axe Pjazza from the schedule is believed to have been driven by a desire to move the party station in a new direction amidst dipping viewership figures.
 Labour's new deputy leader for party affairs, Alex Agius Saliba, used his maiden speech as deputy leader just two weeks ago to emphasise the need for ONE to become more ""balanced"". 
 “The politics of simply saying ‘good job’ and ‘thank you’ needs to end,” Agius Saliba said.  
 Stagno Navarra’s confrontational tactics frequently landed him in hot water.
 In 2021, Robert Abela condemned his description of Lovin Malta journalist Tim Diacono as part of an “establishment working against the government”. Stagno Navarra later apologised for his comments.
 He had previously come under fire for targeting several private citizens, using Pjazza to deride comments they made on social media. Abela was once again forced to step in, phoning at least one of the citizens to apologise and distance himself from Stagno Navarra’s comments.
 That same year, the PN had declared that it would be turning down invitations to appear on Pjazza because of the show’s “partisan and aggressive manner”.
 It later accused Stagno Navarra, once a familiar face on NET TV, of orchestrating a character assassination campaign against PN MP  Karol Aquilina, after the latter was cleared of dangerous driving charges by a court. The probe had been triggered by a  request filed by Stagno Navarra, following footage aired on the show.
 But although Pjazza was reviled by some political acolytes, it quickly became a household name among the party faithful and the first port of call for Labour politicians on the campaign trail.
 Stagno Navarra has recently hit headlines after a man was charged with threatening the TV host over an unsettled debt. 
 Jean Pierre Schembri, a 47-year-old maintenance worker from Żebbuġ, is accused of violently insulting and threatening the broadcaster.

Film commission rejects FOI request for Johann Grech film,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/film-commission-rejects-foi-request-johann-grech-film.1096793,16-08-2024,"007586.png,007587.png","The Malta Film Commission has rejected a freedom of information request to publish a controversial 10-minute film featuring Johann Grech.
 In an email denying Times of Malta’s request, the Film Commission said: “The document requested is publicly available or will be published within three months.”
  The 10-minute film, which features the film commissioner and stars David Walliams, is conservatively estimated to cost taxpayers at least €500,000.
 It has never been made public and was only screened to guests at the Mediterrane Film Festival in June.
 The film, called Once Upon a Time in Malta, starred Walliams and Grech, among others, in a plot that sees the British actor travel back in time to the Knights of Malta period.
 Sources said around 130 crew members were employed to work on the film, which was led by a British director, James Nunn.
 Tourism Minister Clayton Bartolo later said the film was made to attract business to the country but also admitted that, in his view, Grech should not have featured in it. 
 Prime Minister Robert Abela implied he had reservations about the amount spent on the film, saying it must bring “very strong” returns on investment to be considered a smart use of taxpayer money.
  Times of Malta filed the freedom of information request in July in the wake of the controversy. 
 The full cost of the film has also not been disclosed with Grech saying all investment in the Mediterrane Film Festival will be made known in an economic report at a later date.
 At the time, Grech said the film would be sent to international film-makers and production companies to generate interest in telling the story of the Knights of St John. 
 He had said: “This story can be as impactful as Game of Thrones or  The Crown, and it [the film] will also be used in various screen tourism and promotional events in the coming months.”
 Walliams was paid €120,000 to host the Malta Film Awards in 2022 but the sum was only revealed after a judge ordered the Malta Film Commission to declare how much it had paid the comedian.
 In reaction to the FOI being rejected, Shadow Culture Minister Julie Zahra said that the government should be transparent about how it spends taxpayer money. 
 Additionally, she said it must turn its focus on helping Malta’s indigenous film industry rather than “spending frivolously on its inner circle”. 
 “It is worrying that the full spend on this film has not been revealed and there is an urgent need for the government to be transparent about how it uses taxpayer money. It is evident that this expense cannot be justified, especially when there is a dearth of funds available to support local artists,” Zahra said in a statement.
 “The PN believes that the government should use financial resources responsibly and transparently. Investment in the local arts scene should be a priority to reach concrete and realistic results for the Maltese cultural sector and not with enormous spending with no accountability, as was the case with this film.”

 The World Justice Project index gave Malta an overall score of 0.67 out of 1, as the country retained its rank as 30th out of the 142 countries surveyed. 
 Malta also retained its rank of 22nd out of 30 among its peers from the European Union, European Free Trade Association and North America.
 The nine countries that scored worse than Malta on a regional level were Cyprus, Italy, Poland, the Slovak Republic, Croatia, Romania, Greece, Bulgaria and Hungary. 
 Rule of law was found to have been on the decrease in 57% of the countries surveyed, including Malta. 
 The region’s top performer is Denmark, which also ranked 1st  globally, followed by Norway and Finland.
 In the last year, 20 out of the 31 countries grouped in this region experienced a decline in the rule of law and of those,13 had already seen a decline in the year prior. 
 The index calculates scores based on how respondents judge the country on eight criteria: constraints on government powers, the absence of corruption, open government, fundamental rights, order and security, regulatory enforcement, civil justice and criminal justice. 
 Malta's score decreased in four of these eight categories, most notably in the absence of corruption, where the score decreased by -0.03. 
 When it comes to constraints on government powers, regulatory enforcement, and criminal justice, Malta's score dropped by -0.01. 
 The country's scores did not change in other categories. 
 Malta's global score of 0.67 was slightly lower than the 0.68 it ranked in the previous version of the index. However, none of the changes in Malta's score were deemed statistically significant by report writers. 
 As with its global ranking, Malta ranked well on a global level, with high scores in seven of the eight categories. The only outlier is civil justice, where Malta ranked 48th out of 142 countries. 
 But on a regional level, Malta's scores placed it towards the back of the pack for most categories. The one exception was order and security, where it ranked 7th out of 31. 
 Some 63% of countries, including Malta saw a decrease in fundamental rights and some 59%, also including Malta, saw constraints on government power slipping in the past year.

 Falzon told a press conference a number of pensioners born before 1962 were receiving higher pensions - an increase of up to €9.45 a week - after the government increased the maximum pensionable income for their age bracket.
 
 Before the govenment's intervention, those born before 1962 had their pensions capped at €20,424, meaning the maximum yearly pension they could have earned was € 13,616.  
 That pension cap has now increased and the maximum pensionable income cap will keep increasing until it reaches the same level as that of those born after January 1, 1962, which currently stands at around €27,00.
 The pension revision is a PL electoral promise and measures were announced by the government last year.
 Asked why the government was holding a press conference about the pension revision now, Falzon said the government was expecting far fewer pensioners to benefit from the scheme.
 
 It only recently 'realised' that 25,000 people would be benefiting.
 Falzon added: “If you’re suggesting this is because of the upcoming elections, should we not announce anything for the two months leading to an election?”
 Malta will be choosing its representatives at the European Parliament and its local councils on June 8.
 Prime Minister Robert Abela has rejected claims that his government is using its power of incumbency to win votes for the upcoming elections, saying the government has been implementing measures at a fast pace throughout the legislature.

Alfred Mifsud questions Scicluna’s decision to ‘cling on’,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/alfred-mifsud-questions-scicluna-decision-cling-on.1095990,31-07-2024,007619.png,"Alfred Mifsud has questioned whether Edward Scicluna’s decision to “cling on” as central bank governor serves the organisation’s best interests.
 Mifsud was tipped to be made governor in 2016, only to withdraw from the race after facing allegations of corruption by assassinated journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia.
 He resigned his role as deputy governor in 2017, three years ahead of the expiry of his term, back when Scicluna was still finance minister. Unlike Scicluna, Mifsud was never charged, and he won a libel case last year after a court found the corruption allegations, based on testimony by his ex-partner, Anna Zelbst, were defamatory.
 Contacted by Times of Malta, Mifsud, who heads the financial arbiter’s office, did not mince his words about Scicluna’s situation: “The question is not what the rules say. The question is what serves best the interest of the organisation:  clinging on, or let go and fight it out without harming the organisation,” Mifsud said.
 Scicluna is facing mounting pressure to resign as governor, after a court ruled last week that he is to face trial on fraud charges linked to the hospitals scandal.
 Ex-health minister Chris Fearne, who faces similar charges, resigned as deputy prime minister in May.
 Scicluna was unceremoniously removed by the government from the Malta Financial Services Authority’s board of governors on Friday.
 Times of Malta reported earlier on Sunday that the government is planning to axe Scicluna from his top role at the Central Bank this week, should he continue to refuse to resign.
 Prime Minister Robert Abela said on Thursday that Scicluna’s future will be discussed in cabinet on Tuesday.
 A central bank governor can be relieved of his duties if found guilty of misconduct or if he no longer fulfils the conditions required for the performance of his duties.
 One senior source in the banking industry pointed out that the role of governor calls for the highest standards of integrity at all times, beyond the slightest shadow of doubt or suspicion. The source said if cabinet were to advise that Scicluna is no longer fit to fulfil his duties, it would probably be hard for him, or the ECB, to contest it.
 Scicluna told Times of Malta last week that his position remained unchanged following the court decision: “I will abide by the EU treaties. We [the Central Bank] are an independent institution. We have our own rules,” he said.
 Appointed on January 1, 2021, Scicluna's five-year term as governor of the central bank also includes membership in the governing council of the European Central Bank (ECB).
 A spokesperson for the ECB told Times of Malta that the bank does not comment on “pending legal proceedings”.
 The Opposition has called on the government to urgently recall parliament to debate the matter.
 Scicluna is among a slew of government officials who have been charged over the 2016 hospitals privatisation deal. The deal was annulled last year on fraud grounds, and ex-prime minister Joseph Muscat and two of his associates have been charged with corruption and money laundering.   Alfred Mifsud withdrew from the race to be central bank governor after facing corruption claims in 2016, which were since found to be defamatory. 
 Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the corruption allegations were based on testimony by Alfred Mifsud's ex-wife. The allegations were in fact, made by his ex-partner.

Michael Piccinino to step down from PN general secretary and run for election,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/michael-piccinino-step-pn-general-secretary-run-election.1097464,09-01-2024,007622.png,"Updated 9am with FB post
 Michael Piccinino will be stepping down as PN general secretary to contest the next general election.
 The 29-year-old lawyer agreed with the party to step down to give his successor enough time to settle in the role before the next general election.
 When contacted for comment, Piccinino said: “I believe it is time to focus on the next step. In the coming weeks, I will ensure there is a process to appoint a new general secretary, and I will step down from this role”.
 “This was not an easy decision, but I believe now is the right moment to ensure that whoever succeeds me as general secretary has enough time to find their footing before the next general election. We need to ensure that the PN becomes the alternative government our country needs.”
 Elected to the role in 2021, Piccinino said serving the PN has been “the honour of a lifetime”.
 The PN plans to roll out its first general election candidates this month, during Independence Day celebrations, and Piccinino is expected to be one of them.
 In mid-September, the PL will be holding internal elections to appoint two new deputy leaders and a party president, among other administrative roles.
 The general election is still two-and-a-half years away, but the prime minister can decide to go to the polls earlier. Following June’s surprising MEP election, both parties have already started sharpening their swords.
 Sources said that being from Paola, Piccinino is expected to contest on the predominantly Labour-leaning fourth district.
  Piccinino was first elected general secretary in 2021, aged just 26. He took over from Francis Zammit Dimech, who is now the country’s acting president.
 The PN was still reeling from massive electoral defeats and grappling with internal divisions, demotivation and dismal poll numbers throughout most of Piccinino’s tenure.
  Less than a year into his appointment, the party lost yet another general election by a landslide.
 But that dramatically changed this year, when Labour saw its seemingly unassailable vote lead shrink from 40,000 votes in the general election to 8,000 votes in the MEP election just two years later, sparking hope for a PN revival.
 Party insiders largely agree Piccinino was one of the major drivers of the upswing.
 Piccinino said his party secured “the highest number of votes” in the MEP election since they began in 2004, narrowed the gap between the two parties to the slimmest in 16 years, won eight new mayoral positions and majorities in the local council elections, and made NET television the most-watched private station, surpassing ONE for the first time since statistics began to be published.
 “We accomplished all of this when many thought it was impossible,” he said.
 Piccinino also thanked party leader Bernard Grech for trusting him and said nothing could have been achieved without the help of many party officials, MPs, councillors, candidates, employees, volunteers and activists.
 The role of general secretary is one of the highest, most powerful and influential roles in the PN. The general secretary is essentially the party CEO and is responsible for finances and the day-to-day running of the organisation and is often also involved in political strategy and policy drafting.
 The general secretary is elected through an election within the PN executive committee.
 It is unclear when the election will be held. No names have yet been mentioned as Piccinino’s possible successor.

 They say that bird trappers are far more useful to “catch and release” research projects than others who catch finches for research.
 In just one season (2016-2017) trappers caught far more finches than [environmental NGO] BirdLife managed to catch in over 44 years, the Federazzjoni Kaċċaturi Nassaba Konservazzjonisti  (FKNK) said. 
 “The blatant effectiveness of the trapper method of live finch capture compared to the bird ringing method could not be more obvious,” they said. 
 BirdLife uses mist nets to live-capture birds as part of an international programme known as Euring. 
 Once captured, data about the bird, including its weight and probable sex, is registered. A small ring is then wrapped around its talon and the bird is released.
 By contrast, trappers traditionally use caged birds to lure finches to their nets.
 The trapping project deemed illegal by the ECJ did not require trappers to ring captured birds. Trappers only had to record data of trapped birds that already had a ring.
 The FKNK now wants its trappers to be taught how to ring birds, so that they can also participate in the ringing programme while using the more effective, “tried and tested” method to trap them.
 To do that, the government should employ professional ringers to assist hunters in the procedure, it said.  
 In 2018, the European Union’s top court ruled that trapping in Malta was illegal as it did not satisfy the EU’s derogation that allows the trapping of the species in “small numbers”.
 Two years later, Malta started to allow finch trapping again. This time, it applied a derogation to EU law that allows trapping for “research purposes” if there is no other way to conduct research. 
 Earlier this month, the ECJ dismissed those arguments and ruled that Malta was in breach of EU law. Gozo Minister Clint Camilleri, who is himself a trapper and whose ministerial portfolio includes hunting and trapping, argued that the court  only found ""minor breaches"" in the way Malta set up its research project.
 Birdlife said that was an insult to people's intelligence, and urged the prime minister to no longer trust Camilleri with the brief. 
 Under the now-forbidden rules, the finches that were caught had to be released, an obligation that according to BirdLife Malta activists is usually ignored by trappers. 
 “According to our estimates 51,000 finches have been captured in Malta and never released,” BirdLife’s head of conservation Nicholas Barbara said. 
 “The intention has always been to trap birds and not release them. The government has tried to fool the Commission this was not the case, but it failed miserably,” Barbara said. 
 FKNK President Lucas Micallef said trappers who did not release birds are breaking the law.
 “We cannot endorse those actions,” he said.
 BirdLife believes the FKNK proposal to teach all trappers how to ring birds is a non-starter, for two reasons.
 First, there are just too many trappers: the 3,500 registered trappers are too numerous to realistically conduct sampling on the finch population that passes through Malta, Barbara said. 
 Secondly, Barbara said, using caged finches to attract the wild birds is cruel and has led to the mass importation of caged finches from Sicily and goes against the point of conservation.

Malta Food Agency to open disciplinary procedures against Joseph Baldacchino,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/malta-food-agency-open-disciplinary-procedures-joseph-baldacchino.1101381,22-11-2024,007684.png,"Joseph Baldacchino will face a disciplinary board as his job at the Malta Food Agency hangs by a thread, but he has been sacked from his post as the Malta Bowling Association’s public relations officer.
 Times of Malta reported yesterday how Baldacchino, a former CEO of the Agency for the Welfare of Asylum Seekers (AWAS), was convicted of embezzlement after an investigation found that he systematically used resources intended for use by the agency, including materials and workers, for his own gain.
 When contacted by Times of Malta, a spokesperson for the Malta Food Agency said that Baldacchino would be facing disciplinary action in line with the rules set for civil servants.
 “He will definitely face disciplinary action, he won’t be receiving any preferential treatment,” the spokesperson said.
 “We will follow the disciplinary procedures set out in the public sector’s manuals.”
 Public sector rules say that the punishment for serious disciplinary breaches, such as criminal conviction, can range from a ten-day suspension without pay to outright dismissal, depending on the severity of the case.
 Baldacchino only recently joined the agency as a senior manager, taking up the job just weeks before a court found him guilty of embezzling public funds.
 Meanwhile, the Malta Bowling Association set the ball rolling, saying that it had removed Baldacchino from his post as the association’s public relations officer.
 In a statement, the Malta Bowling Association said that the decision was “necessitated” by the court judgement finding him guilty.
 “For reasons that are internal to the association but critical to maintaining the integrity of our mission, we have taken immediate action to remove Mr Baldacchino from his current post.”
 They said that Baldacchino had only joined the committee in recent months and that the fact that he was facing criminal proceedings was never brought to its attention.
 The association said that the decision was not taken lightly but guided by its commitment to upholding its principles.
 “We wish to reaffirm our commitment to transparency, accountability, and the values that govern our work. While this transition poses challenges, it also presents an opportunity for growth and renewed focus on the goals that unite us,” they said.
 The association nonetheless expressed gratitude to Baldacchino for his service.

PL fears local councils defeat,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/pl-fears-local-councils-defeat.1093786,06-11-2024,007693.png,"Labour activists are approaching this week’s local council election results with apprehension as several party insiders say they are bracing themselves for what could be the party’s first defeat in 20 years.
 Sources close to the party and the electoral process told Times of Malta that Labour’s poor performance in the MEP election could be an indication that it will fare even worse – and possibly even lose – the local councils elections to PN.
 “According to my estimations, we’re going in for a defeat. Sunday’s gap was too narrow to offer us any comfort for the local councils result,” one senior Labour source said.
 “And that first defeat would dramatically rock the party.”
 On Sunday, the party saw its seemingly unassailable lead cut down to size, winning the MEP elections by under 8,500 votes, in a shock result that stunned PN and Labour officials alike.
 
 Labour insiders who spoke to Times of Malta say that things could be even more bleak come the weekend, with the very real prospect of the party losing the local council elections for the first time in decades.
 One insider said the party was fearing it could lose the majority of localities like Pembroke, Siggiewi, San Ġwann, Mellieħa, St Paul’s Bay and Gżira.
 “If the PN wins the council elections, Abela must re-establish his position as the legitimate leader through a vote of confidence at least – if not through a leadership race,” a senior source said.
 “We portrayed this election as a vote of confidence in the leader and the MEP vote did not pass the 50% mark. The last time Lawrence Gonzi, Alfred Sant and Bernard Grech were in similar situations they were forced to call an election or a vote of confidence, and Abela would need to do the same.”
 Malta chose its new mayors and local councillors at the polls last Saturday but those boxes are yet to be opened and the result revealed.
 Sorting and counting will start tomorrow and an official result is expected by Friday.
 A Labour defeat is not set in stone, however. The PL could still pull through successfully and do better in the 69 localities its candidates have contested. But party acolytes are not too hopeful.
 One factor could be the independent candidates’ votes. Insiders said it seems like the majority of people who gave their first preference to independent candidates like Arnold Cassola in the MEP election were PN voters who swung to him for that election but will probably swing back to PN when it comes to their local council.
 Cassola got the highest amount of number 1 votes among independent candidates – a total of 12,706 – and winning back some of his voters would give PN a much-needed edge.
 Another factor is that the less an election is perceived as important, the more likely it is for disgruntled people to opt for a protest vote, one insider explained.
 Several sources believe Labour would not have fared as badly if this were a general election, as Labourites would be less likely to protest with a vote that they know might change the government. That is why, one source added, Labour portrayed the MEP election as if it were a general election – to bolster its importance.
 “Clearly that didn’t work well enough, because too many people understood it wasn’t as detrimental as a general election and felt comfortable to cast a protest vote,” the source said.
 “Now, the local council elections are perceived as even less important or detrimental, so we fear voters’ readiness to swing to PN in protest is even more plausible.”
 A defeat at the polls would come as a further blow to the party, given its almost unblemished record in local council elections over the years.
 Labour has won 14 of the last 18 local council elections dating back to 1999, although this figure also includes elections that took place for just a handful of councils, before the system was changed to carry out local council elections for all localities in one go.
 Labour’s last significant defeat dates back over two decades to March 2003. At the time, the two parties were locked in a heated battle over whether Malta was to join the European Union.
 PN won that particular battle and, in a more low-key turn of events, pipped Labour to the post to claim top spot in the local council elections.
 The votes will be counted over three days, split into three groups of localities.
 Tomorrow, 23 localities will come under the microscope, including Malta’s largest local council of St Paul’s Bay, Valletta, and important swing towns such as Żebbuġ.
 Thursday will see the votes of another 21 towns and villages counted, including Birkirkara, Sliema and Marsascala. And the process will finally end on Friday, when the votes of the final 21 localities, including Mosta, Siġġiewi and Ħamrun are tallied.
 In the run-up to the election, both Labour and PN sources moved to dispel rumours that they were struggling to find suitable candidates, insisting that they have a “healthy” number of candidates on the cards.
 In total, some 707 candidates will be vying for a seat, 381 from Labour and 292 from PN, both figures slightly fewer than they fielded in 2019.
 Another 34 independent candidates or candidates hailing from smaller parties, including several resident-driven groups, will also be hoping to win a seat.

Watch: The controversial short film used to lure Hollywood to Malta,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/watch-the-controversial-short-film-used-lure-hollywood-malta.1098801,30-09-2024,007728.png,"The controversial short film featuring film commissioner Johann Grech alongside British actor David Walliams was broadcast publicly for the first time on Friday.
 The 10-minute film, which opened the lavish Mediterrane Film Festival's final awards gala night in June, became controversial after industry sources estimated it cost at least half a million euros in taxpayer money.
 After Times of Malta requested a copy of the clip, the film commission promised to make it public within three months. The entire awards show - including the film - was broadcast on TVM last Friday night.
 Here is the short film, which opened the show.
  The film begins in Walliams' dressing room, five minutes before he must take the stage to host the Golden Bee awards show. He is still in his silk dressing gown, rehearsing opening lines, when Film Commissioner Johann Grech walks in, all suited up in a tuxedo, reminding him he must get ready as the show starts soon.
 But first, he must show him ""the legendary golden bee"" award, which he takes out of a wooden box and hands to him.
 ""It's precious,"" Grech tells Walliams, only for the British actor to drop and break it a few seconds later.
 The broken artefact magically opens up a portal into the time of the Knights and Walliams finds himself - still in his silk gown - transported to a room full of hostile knights, among them the grand master.
 What follows is a short tale in which Walliams is imprisoned pending execution, escapes and then reclaims the golden bee statuette, killing the grandmaster in the process. 
 The film features some familiar faces from Malta's acting scene, such as Ray Calleja, Narcy Calamatta and Manuel Cauchi, Maltese scenery and scenes focused on the symbolism of the Maltese eight-pointed cross. 
 The 10-minute production employed around 130 crew members and was led by a foreign director, according to sources.
 The film is shot in several locations associated with the knights - including in several bastions and palaces - and a few seconds of it are shot in a staged storm on a ship.
 Several actors - all in era costumes - as well as horses also feature throughout the film.
 Grech only makes an appearance for a few seconds at the beginning and at the end of the film, but after the film was shown at the awards show, Tourism Minister Clayton Bartolo told reporters Grech should not have featured in it.
 Grech, meanwhile, would not say how much it cost but defended the spend, saying the film was primarily aimed at generating interest among filmmakers about the story of the Knights.
 Last week, just days before the film aired on the national broadcaster, big-time actor and director Mel Gibson revealed he is working on a limited television series about the Great Siege of Malta. 
 The ""Passion of the Christ"" director, who  was in Malta earlier this month discussing a potential film project, told the publication  Movieweb.com that he was working on a project about the ""incredible story"" of the 1565 Ottoman siege of Malta. 
 The actor and director revealed the project after he was asked about his trip to Malta, where he met Prime Minister Robert Abela.
 Times of Malta sent questions to the film commission asking for the total cost of the short film and clarification on whether the government is paying Gibson to produce the Great Siege series.

PL MEP candidate admits Malta 'rushed' economic growth,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/pl-mep-candidate-admits-malta-rushed-economic-growth.1092070,21-06-2024,"007743.png,007744.png,007745.png","Labour MEP candidate Thomas Bajada told an election debate on Tuesday that Malta ""rushed"" its economic growth and advocated for a balance with protecting the country's heritage.
 The 29-year-old Gozitan MEP candidate was replying to a question related to migration that turned into a discussion on how the economy has become dependent on foreign workers. 
 “The discussion is not just about migration, but the element of sustainable development, not just on infrastructure, but an element of economic progress that needs to marry with the social and economic realities of Maltese and Gozitans and our culture and social heritage,” he told an MCAST debate.
 When moderator and MaltaToday journalist Matthew Vella replied that not much has been done for heritage in the past few years, Bajada said: “We rushed, I admit we rushed.""
 He added: “We are now at a point where we need to make priorities that are important for our country, important for every person. Some people wake up in the morning and feel they are no longer themselves  because their situation has changed, and that is what we need to address.”
 He said Malta needs to continue moving the economy forward in a balanced manner. 
 
 Bajada was one of four candidates who participated in the debate, along with the PN's Louise Anne Pulis, ADPD's Sandra Gauci and independent Conrad Borg Manché.
 Borg Manché said Malta could have hired the best foreign workers, yet the government failed to look at the potential employee's skills, and just “brought people to fill up the country”.
 ADPD leader Gauci added that such foreign workers must be shown respect. 
  “There have been members of parliament who said these people smell. What we have done wrong is that we began to bring these people in without any planning, and the population has increased drastically.”
 Echoing Gauci’s words, Pulis said both foreigners and Maltese have been left feeling frustrated over the island’s overpopulation. 
 “There are many Maltese who feel frustrated because of how overpopulated the island is, and there are many foreigners who are frustrated because they are facing modern-day slavery in the workplace,” she said, highlighting the need for inclusion.
 Discussing the new conference Prime Minister Robert Abela held on Monday after criminal charges were filed against former prime minister  Joseph Muscat, all but one candidate slammed his comments. 
 “Attacking the judiciary is not only wrong but also an anti-democratic move,” Pulis said. Gauci described Abela’s comments as irresponsible and said he spoke out of panic. 
 Bajada, however, said he was upset at how such sensitive topics have become politicised, reiterirating his party leader's criticism of the timing of the inquiry's conclusions.  
 ""This election should have been a time to discuss the realities of youth and how we can move forward as a country,"" he said. ""Now we are in a situation of political tribalism that will shock the system for political gain. That is the reality.""
  On the hot topic of abortion, Gauci said ADPD had long campaigned for abortion to be decriminalised while Bajada called for a serious discussion on the topic. 
 Pulis said while she is against abortion, sex education must improve, highlighting how Malta has the highest rate of syphilis in the EU. Borg Manché said he was completely opposed.

Why did Malta attend Vladimir Putin's inauguration ceremony?,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/why-malta-attend-vladimir-putin-inauguration-ceremony.1092114,21-06-2024,"007767.png,007768.png","Malta’s decision to attend Vladimir Putin’s inauguration ceremony on Tuesday was driven by it being at the helm of OSCE, a Foreign Ministry spokesperson told Times of Malta.
 The spokesperson said that “a conscious decision” had been taken to attend the ceremony, “based on the principles which the Chair in Office of this organisation should promote for the survival of such an organisation”
 Nonetheless, they added, this “does not, in any way, alter or soften Malta’s strong condemnation of the Russian Government’s actions in Ukraine”.
 Malta was one of just six European countries to attend Vladimir Putin’s inauguration on Tuesday, with most other European countries choosing to sit out the ceremony.
 Aside from Malta, representatives from France, Cyprus, Greece, Hungary and Slovakia also attended the inauguration. Malta was represented by its Ambassador to Russia, Carmel Inguanez.
 The spokesperson said that Malta also remains steadfast in its condemnation of elections in the occupied Ukrainian regions of Crimea, Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk and Luhansk.
 “Malta will never recognise Russian elections in occupied territories of Ukraine, or their respective results. In this regard, Malta together with the EU stands by the people in Russia who support democracy, peace and respect for human rights,” the spokesperson said.
 The spokesperson described Malta’s “unequivocal condemnation” of Russia’s war in Ukraine as “clear and well-known to all” and “proven through Malta’s actions in several international fora during these past two years”.
 Malta currently chairs the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe - a post it assumed at the turn of the year as members of the regional security body scrambled to find a chair that would be acceptable to both Russia and western countries. 
 Earlier this week, an open letter by the EPP group to Josep Borrell, the European Commission’s foreign affairs chief, urged diplomatic representatives from EU member states to boycott the inauguration, arguing that Putin should not be given “any occasion to institute his ‘legitimacy’”.
 Borrell, who hails from the EP’s socialist grouping, agreed, on Tuesday saying that he had advised member states not to attend the inauguration.
 Borrell said it would be “contradictory” for member states to attend the inauguration in light of Putin’s indictment by the International Criminal Court, as well as the EU’s position that the Russian elections were “neither free nor fair”.
 “My advice to the Member States was not to attend, and I hope that many of them, most of them, will follow this indication. But each Member State is fully sovereign to decide to go or not to go,” he said.
  Replying to questions over Borrell’s advice, the foreign ministry spokesperson said that “Malta subscribed to the EU common position regarding the Russian presidential elections, as outlined by the Josep Borrell on 18th March”.
 Putin, who rose to power in 1999, won a fifth term as Russia’s leader in a landslide victory, securing over 88% of the vote in the March presidential election.
 The European Parliament described the election as “stage-managed”, saying that “changes to Russia's electoral laws make it virtually impossible to conduct any meaningful monitoring”.
 Election observers from OSCE, which regularly monitors elections around Europe for their transparency, were not invited to observe the elections.
 The election came just weeks after Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny died in mysterious circumstances in the Arctic prison where he was serving a 19-year jail term.

 The European People’s Party assembly will be held at PN headquarters on Thursday and Friday next week, November 21 and 22.
 Party leader Bernard Grech will be among the European leaders opening the assembly, alongside EPP President Manfred Weber.
 The EPP is the largest political party in Europe and PN MEPs form part of it within the European Parliament.
 Its annual assembly will help set the party’s political direction, with discussions focussed on people’s quality of life and the situation in the Mediterranean, the PN said in a statement on Saturday.
 PN General Secretary Michael Piccinino said the fact that the EPP had chosen Malta and the PN as hosts was proof that the EPP saw the party as the only real force of change in Malta.
 “Before the June election, we promised that the Partit Nazzjonalista would ensure that the issues facing the Maltese and Gozitan people would be raised at a European level, so Europe addresses what is affecting Malta and Gozo.
 This is exactly what we will be doing next week,” Piccinino said.
 Piccinino was joined for the announcement by PN International Secretary Beppe Galea. Both have said they intend to run for a seat in parliament in the next general election.
 Apart from party leaders and EPP leader Manfred Weber, next week’s EPP assembly will host European Parliament President (and EPP MEP) Roberta Metsola, EPP Vice Presidents, several European Commission Vice Presidents, and European Commissioners, along with other leaders.
 The Labour Party reacted to the announcement of the EPP event by saying it was “insensitive” for the PN to have announced details of the event without  also discussing an EPP decision to vote down a push for a debate at the European Parliament on the situation in Gaza.
 The PN has said that its MEPs voted against the motion because the proposal was presented by the European Parliament’s extreme left without prior consultation, as is customary when setting the parliament’s agenda.

 ""It’s not about titles; it’s about having a decisive voice at the table to drive meaningful change and deliver tangible results for Malta,"" Attard said following the appointment.
 In a statement, Attard said he has consistently championed the notion that shared challenges in tourism demand collective solutions, underpinned by robust EU action. He hopes to tackle critical issues such as sustainability, labour shortages, and enhanced support for local communities.
 ""This is more than policy - it is a forward-looking vision for a tourism sector that strengthens Europe’s competitiveness while safeguarding our cultural heritage for generations to come,"" he added.
 Meanwhile, the PL said in a statement its MEP Alex Agius Saliba secured widespread support to co-chair the European Parliament Intergroup on Mental Health.
 ""This historic initiative will prioritise mental health policies and enhance the voices of people living with mental health challenges,"" the party said. 
 This was the first time that the European Parliament established an intergroup on mental health.
 The intergroup aims to serve as a platform for cross-party dialogue and collaboration, fostering the development of EU-wide policies that ensure the promotion, prevention, and recovery of mental health.
 “This initiative represents a crucial step forward in addressing the urgent and growing mental health needs of our citizens. It reflects our collective commitment to prioritising mental health alongside physical health and ensuring that all voices, especially those of the most vulnerable, are heard,” Agius Saliba said.
 The intergroup will also focus on combating stigma, promoting mental health literacy, and addressing structural gaps in healthcare systems.
 It aims to advocate for long-term measures, such as updating the Occupational Safety and Health Directive to ensure mental health-friendly work environments and allocating sufficient EU budget resources for high-quality mental health care.
 “I invite MEPs from across the political spectrum to join this important cause,” urged Agius Saliba. “Mental health challenges touch every corner of our societies, and our united efforts will make a valuable difference.”

National Bank shareholders want €1.4 billion in compensation,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/national-bank-shareholders-want-14-billion-compensation.1091964,05-05-2024,007566.png,"A group of shareholders in the former National Bank of Malta are claiming they are owed €1.4 billion in compensation.
 A court this year awarded the shareholders €111 million in damages, however both the shareholders and the government appealed the decision.
 The bank was taken over by the government and its assets and debts transferred to Bank of Valletta in 1974.
 In their appeal, a sizeable group of shareholders argued that the €111 million in compensation does not go far enough.
 They argued that the compensation should include the dividends paid out by Bank of Valletta from 1974 to date, as well as legal interest, taking the compensation up to €1.4 billion.
 Another group of shareholders have argued that the court’s decision to apportion the €111 million equally among all shareholders would create a new injustice, as  each shareholder would end up receiving an equal sum irrespective of the extent of their shareholding in the National Bank.
 In its own appeal filed last month, the government said its intervention to save the National Bank by setting up another bank to handle it was needed to avert an economic disaster, the loss of depositors’ funds and jobs. 
 The government said that while the courts had recognised this need, the court’s sentences still adopted a “negative vision” and imposed a penalty on current public finances for having averted an economic disaster in 1973, as if what had been done was wrong.
 The appeals are the latest development in a court battle that has been going on since 1992.
 The cases filed in 1992 by a total of 82 original applicants, revolved around the saga that kicked off in December 1973 when then Prime Minister Dom Mintoff updated parliament about the situation at the National Bank.
 He also spoke about plans to take over the bank, explaining that way forward had been suggested by a representative of the same bank. 
 A week later, on December 12, 1973, the administration of the National Bank and the Tagliaferro Bank was “temporarily” taken over by an administrative council.
 In March 1974, the assets and debts of the National Bank were transferred to Bank of Valletta Limited.
 All 82 applicants were among shareholders who opted not to sign an agreement to transfer their shares to the government without payment.

Abela to back Roberta Metsola for second term as EP president,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/abela-back-roberta-metsola-second-term-ep-president.1094236,20-06-2024,007614.png,"Updated with PN statement 8.30 pm 
 Prime Minister Robert Abela has pledged to back Roberta Metsola's bid for a second term as European Parliament president, saying it would be “inconsistent” of him if he failed to do so.
 Metsola was unanimously confirmed as the EPP Group’s candidate in a closed meeting held on Wednesday.
 Later in the same day, Opposition leader Bernard Grech challenged Abela to back Metsola’s nomination, calling on him to “set partisanship aside” and move away from the “campaign of fear in which he continuously attacked Metsola as a warmonger”.
 Asked by Times of Malta whether he will be backing Metsola, Abela said that he “always supports Maltese people who go abroad to occupy a role”, adding that he will “once again let the national interest guide direct (his) decision”.
 “I would be inconsistent – and I would be adopting the Opposition leader’s position – if I took a partisan stance and sidelined the national interest.”
  Abela poured scorn on Grech’s challenge to back Metsola, describing it as “ironic”.
 “In recent years and months, the PN has attacked every Maltese person who has gone to work in a European institution at every opportunity, maybe because they hold a different political opinion.”
 Abela had backed Metsola’s initial bid in 2021, at the time saying that “if I did not support her nomination, I would be doing exactly what she did to our country”.
 Metsola was a frequent target of Labour’s criticism throughout the recent electoral campaign, with Abela and several MEP candidates accusing her of fomenting conflict by calling for an increase in EU defence and military spending. 
 Metsola is the frontrunner to be named EP president once again after clinching the nomination of the EPP, the largest political family within the European Parliament.
 She would be only the second MEP to serve in this role for two terms, after Germany’s Martin Schulz.
 In reaction to Abela’s statement Opposition Leader Bernard Grech said that it was now evident that Abela had to admit that his campaign of negativity against Metsola and the PN was simply fearmongering and was simply a tactic employed for political convenience. 
 “After the people voted he had to make another u-turn and eat his words and accept that Roberta Metsola is the best candidate to be president of the European Parliament,” he said.

Why is Malta’s south red and the north blue?,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/why-malta-south-red-north-blue.1094081,18-06-2024,007632.png,"While the local council elections sprung some surprises, the outcome has actually reinforced the long-standing tradition of a predominantly Nationalist north and Labour’s stronghold in the south of Malta.
 Labour managed to eat into traditional PN strongholds in the past decade or so but the European and council elections of June 8 appeared to return the political situation to ‘normal’.
 The regional voting patterns in Malta are the result of a complex interplay of history, economic conditions, social structures and cultural identities.
 Malta’s geopolitical divide is as old as Maltese democracy itself. But what led to it?
 Sociologist Godfrey Baldacchino said much of the Maltese industry began and is still based in the south, and as a result, that is where blue-collar, Labour-leaning workers lived.  
 “Few people had a car at the time, so people needed to be within walking distance of their jobs,” he said.  
 The Cospicua dockyard is the base of the industrial south.
 Many of the dockyard’s workers supported socialist ideals, Baldacchino said.
 Malta’s 1921 census shows that 35 per cent of Malta’s working population at that time worked in industry.  
 Most of those workers were employed at the dockyard.  
 In the 1960s, new factories were also built in the south, as was the freeport, Baldacchino said.
  The Marsa and Bulebel industrial estates were built in the early 1960s and the Ħal-Far industrial estate a few decades later; all brought more working-class workers and more Labour voters to the south, Baldacchino said.   
 Out of a process of elimination, those in the more suburban and rural north swayed PN.  
 People with tertiary education are also more likely to live in the north and are also more likely to vote PN, he said.  
 Just like Cospicua has a particular significance for the PL, so does Sliema have for the PN, University of Malta sociologist Michael Briguglio said  
 Sliema was first an area for summer houses before developing into its own locality with mostly middle-class inhabitants, Briguglio said.  
 It has been a PN stronghold since then, he said, with the PN often winning more than two-thirds of the vote.   
 Briguglio said that many English-speaking Maltese tend to vote for the PN and many of those reside in Sliema.  
 While some of those have moved onto other areas, most people in Malta normally like to live close to where they grew up, he said.  
 Others are, however, being elbowed out of their towns because of economic factors like high property prices, Briguglio said.  
 Vittoriosa and Sliema are two such examples.  
 Baldacchino said that the increased use of the car (and population movement during and after the war)  might be changing Malta’s political demographics, since people no longer have to live next to where they work.  
 If people do move, they normally take their political allegiances with them. 
 In fact, localities like Mosta, St Paul’s Bay, Birkirkara and much of Gozo now have no particularly strong allegiance to either party, Briguglio said.  
 Either way, political polarisation is not as strong as it used to be, and political parties need to attract people beyond their core vote if they want to get elected, Briguglio said. 
 And why is Siġġiewi blue in a sea of red in the south? That, a political observer said, could go back to the  1940s and 1950s, when George Borg Olivier, the PN leader, was a popular notary there.
 Going back even further, and given political allegiances which go back generations, Gozo's traditional Nationalist support in the past could be rooted in Nerik Mizzi, who was a successful candidate for Gozo in the early decades of the 20th century.

 This election season certainly does not disappoint.
 With almost clockwork precision, the launch of the election campaign at the beginning of May fired the starting gun on dozens of government announcements over the past few weeks, from regeneration projects across the island to new investments reaching Malta’s shores.
 Everybody loves a newly-restored public space, not least the residents of Kalkara who, as of last week, can enjoy a new town square boasting 16,500 square metres of open space.
 Residents of Tarxien, Qormi and Mtarfa shouldn’t be jealous, after we learnt this month that their village squares are next in line for a facelift, the latter to the tune of €2m.
 Burmarrad will have to settle for something a little more low-key, a new €160,000 playground that opened last week, while Xewkija has a new €255,000 “playing field” opened to the public this month.
  And anyone living in San Ġwann might want to check out the town’s newest open space for themselves, after last week’s launch was widely ridiculed on social media.
 There’s more to it than just squares and open spaces though.
 Brand new plans for the regeneration of the Gozo hospital were unveiled last week. While details about the project’s scale were plentiful – a new anatomy centre, a new helipad, double the existing bed capacity – it is still in search of a commencement date or timeline.
 Naxxar will soon have a new football pitch and gym with underground parking, at the eye-watering cost of €14.3m, with the government announcing earlier this month that works were 50 per cent completed.
 And motorsport enthusiasts must have been relieved to discover that their long-awaited Ħal Far racetrack is still in the pipeline, after they were told last week that almost 25,000 tonnes of construction waste have been removed from the site.
  There’s something for music lovers too, with a €16m, 52,000-square metre concert area at the Ta’ Qali National Park opened to the public in early May.
 There appears to be no end in sight to the election advent calendar, with voters waking up each day to find that they have a newly restored belvedere (Żebbuġ and Marsalforn, unveiled on Thursday), a new cultural space (the long abandoned Marsa tram station, announced just a few hours later), or perhaps the completion of a long-awaited project (the oft-delayed Għadira road, finally completed on Friday).
 But sometimes it’s not just about what you give, it’s also what you remove.
 Residents of Mqabba and surrounding towns had long been dreading the prospect of a new asphalt plant on their doorstep, until last week, when Prime Minister Robert Abela announced that the project had been scrapped while on the campaign trail.
  The customary pre-election cheques have once again found their way to voters’ doorsteps, this time described as “recognition” of workers’ contributions to building Malta’s economy. This despite OSCE warning that they will once again be scrutinising this practice, having already said in 2022 that it does “not conform to international standards and good practice”.
 Some voters will also soon receive a second round of cheques, with some €17m set to be distributed among almost 200,000 people in the form of additional COLA payments for vulnerable households. The payments were due to be issued over the past days.
 This could be the third payout that some 13,500 service pensioners and widowers would have received over the past month, after the promised increases to their pensions were processed and issued in early May.
  Meanwhile, parents of students in post-secondary education will be receiving a €500 allowance in the coming days, Abela announced on Thursday.
 Election time also coincided with the light at the end of the tunnel for Maltese victims of the Thalidomide scandal, who have been campaigning for compensation over the past several years. Almost €1m in compensation payments started being issued to 25 of the victims earlier this week, the government announced on Wednesday.
  And let’s not forget the monthly savings thanks to the government’s subsidies on energy prices. Luckily, ARMS is on hand to calculate precisely how much each household has saved, even adding a nifty information box listing each household’s savings on its electricity bills as of this month.
 Thousands of teachers also received the news they have been waiting for years when last Friday the government and the Malta Union of Teachers said they had reached agreement on the long-awaited collective agreement.
  This is not to mention the flurry of new investments announced in recent weeks –  €7.5m from a Turkish firm to manufacture wind turbine components, €12.5m to produce and export table sauces, 700 new jobs in an iGaming company expansion – and several government services being extended or offered for the first time.
  The cleansing department announced this week that it will be cleaning up after feasts for free as of Monday. Earlier in the month, health authorities said that free diabetes monitoring services will be extended to reach new groups of people, while  IVF waiting lists are to be slashed through a €6m scheme.
 Elderly people living in Rabat and surrounding areas now have free transport taking them to their local health centre, bank or post office, after the government’s Silver T service was extended last week.
 Meanwhile, a new residential parking scheme will be introduced in Gudja on June 1, much to the relief of residents who say that their parking spaces are constantly occupied by people travelling abroad from the nearby airport.
  On Thursday, Abela brushed aside suggestions the government is using its power of incumbency to win votes, saying “the way we have worked in the last week is the same way we have consistently worked in the last years”.
 But announcements of new projects, schemes and initiatives, as well as notices of completed works, appear to have doubled in the first few weeks of this May, compared to the same period last year.

Government told to avoid inflating spending,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/government-told-avoid-inflating-spending.1096892,24-08-2024,007721.png,"A fiscal watchdog has told the government to avoid inflating its spending so as to ensure adherence with its deficit targets.
 In a report published in August, the Malta Fiscal Advisory Council (MFAC) said that whilst efforts at restraining government spending should be explored, “productive” capital expenditure that promotes growth should not be curtailed.
 “Rather, the council encourages the government to preserve nationally financed public investment and improve its efficiency and effectiveness,” the report says.
 The effective absorption of EU funds, particularly those that foster green and digital transitions, should also be ensured.
 In the report, the council reiterated its recommendation for the government to prepare an adequate exit strategy for its policy of subsidising energy and fuel bills, adopting a more targeted approaching and enhancing incentives for energy savings.
 Prime Minister Robert Abela has so far resisted by the European Commission to phase out the subsidies.
 Abela said last year that the subsidies were costing the government €1 million per day.
 The fiscal council said spending on the ongoing energy price measures continued to exert upward pressure on the deficit. In July, the EU launched excessive deficit procedures against Malta and six other countries.
 The procedures aim to ensure EU countries maintain discipline in their government budgets so that government debts remain low or high debts are reduced to sustainable levels.
 The deficit, at 4.9% in 2023, remained close to the EU’s benchmark of 3%.
 Malta debts in 2023 hit €9.7 billion, an increase of €768 million when compared to 2022.
 However, the council said strong growth in Malta’s gross domestic product (GDP) saw the debt-to-GDP ratio decrease from 51.6% in 2022 to 50.4% last year.
 Although the debt levels were lower than the EU’s benchmark of 60% of GDP, the fiscal council said the government must remain vigilant.

PN slams government for diverting EU bus funds to electric private cars,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/pn-slams-government-diverting-eu-bus-funds-electric-private-cars.1102208,12-09-2024,007725.png,"The PN on Monday slammed the government for diverting EU funds that were meant to be used to electrify Malta’s public transport to fund subsidies for electric private cars.
 By encouraging the use of private cars, the government would make the traffic situation on the island even worse, three party spokespeople told a press conference at the Marsa park-and-ride on Monday.
 Last week, the PN revealed that the government had ""secretly"" withdrawn plans to receive over €40 million in EU funding to spend on updating Malta’s bus fleet.
 As a result, the private company that runs the public transport system said its plans to electrify Malta’s bus fleet “cannot go ahead”.
 In reply to questions by  Times of Malta, Prime Minister Robert Abela confirmed the funds that were going to be used for the project will instead go to people to electrify their private cars.
 But for the PN, switching diesel-powered buses to electric ones would have been a crucial initiative to reduce emissions and combat climate change.
 ""Since these buses operate throughout the day on our roads, they should be the first priority in the electrification of Malta's vehicle fleet.
 ""Instead, Robert Abela made the meaningless decision to withdraw the allocation of these funds, leaving diesel buses on the roads while redirecting funds to more private cars, worsening traffic. This comes after the government reduced the grant for private electric cars in the recent budget from €11,000 to €8,000.""
 Spokespeople Mark Anthony Sammut, Ryan Callus, and Eve Borg Bonello told the media on Monday that the decision to withdraw from the €34 million agreement with the European Commission would also result in the loss of €7 million in EU funds for charging stations and another €50 million in private investment for cleaner air.
 ""This reckless decision by Abela confirms his lack of direction and how quality is discarded with every decision he makes.
 ""If he really needed to cut funds, Abela should have reduced wasteful spending on core government insiders and the corruption that has engulfed his administration,"" they said, adding that quality of life depended on clean air.
 They added that due to PL's incompetence, people's health will continue to suffer from the exhaust fumes of diesel-powered buses passing past pedestrians.
 ""The PN is the only solution for the Maltese people. We promise electrified mass transport that will not only reduce emissions on our roads but also provide an efficient and adequate service.
 ""Above all, we promise accountability and seriousness in public spending and in the use of European funds in the interest of the common good, not just for the privileged few.""
 PL reacts
 Reacting to the PN's press conference, the PL said in a statement the Opposition's true colours were revealed on Monday morning.
 ""Under a Nationalist government, the thousands of grants given for a person to switch from traditional fuel to electrification of a vehicle will no longer be given,"" the PL claimed.
 The party said that a Labour government will, on the other hand, continue providing incentives to those who opt for an electric vehicle. The incentives will not just apply to the purchase of a car but also when it comes to the registration and circulation tax relief from the road licence.
 ""Strong initiatives for those who make the choice to go for a private vehicle, with the least possible environmental damage.""
 That is the difference between austerity measures and incentivising people.

ADPD calls for sustainable tourism that prioritises residents,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/adpd-calls-sustainable-tourism-prioritises-residents.1097783,09-08-2024,007767.png,"ADPD on Sunday called for sustainable tourism that prioritises residents, saying Malta has witnessed another summer of overtourism.  
 Party Chairperson Sandra Gauci told a press conference in Birzebbuġa that thinking in terms of unlimited growth of arrivals was counterproductive and unsustainable.
 She observed that The Malta’s Economic Vision 2021 – 2030 – ‘A Future-Proof Malta’ acknowledged that environmental degradation was no longer an acceptable byproduct of economic success.
 She said the current eco-tax, set in 2016, was too low and needed to be revised. It currently stands at only €1 per bed-night, capped at a paltry €5. Proceeds, she said, should go to regional councils and local councils. 
 ""It makes no sense for these funds to go to MTA which in turn uses them to encourage more and more mass tourism. Local councils and regional councils need these funds to mitigate the effects of mass tourism, to boost their cleaning services, to fund enforcement, and other essential local services.""
 ADPD Deputy Chairperson, Melissa Bagley, said overtourism favoured the few and led to great burdens on all the rest.
 She observed that the 2022 Deloitte Report on the carrying capacity study for tourism in Malta showed that by 2019, the volume of tourism levels was already impacting the satisfaction levels of residents and visitors’ alike.  This was at a time when the number of tourists visiting Malta was around 2.8 million, a number which has since been surpassed.

Cabinet's 'partisan' press release slips through standards commissioner loophole,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/cabinet-partisan-press-release-slips-standards-commissioner-loophole.1097939,09-11-2024,007783.png,"A partisan press release issued through the Department of Information cannot be sanctioned because it was issued by cabinet rather than an individual minister, parliament’s standards commissioner has said.
 Commissioner Joseph Azzopardi concluded that while the press release used a partisan tone and should not have been sent out on official channels, he could do nothing about it.
 The case stems from a complaint made to Azzopardi’s office by surgeon and political columnist Kevin Cassar on July 2, about a DOI-issued press release published that same day.
 The press release came in reaction to a  Times of Malta exclusive which revealed that Steward Health Care had  bankrolled a smear campaign that targeted, among other people, former deputy prime minister Chris Fearne.
 In it, the government claimed that the Opposition had been out to “destroy” Fearne from the moment he was named as Malta’s nominee to the European Commission and that it was “never interested in Malta’s position but rather in short-term political gain.”
 The press release was issued by the government and cabinet, rather than any individual ministry.
 Cassar flagged the press release as partisan, noting that Azzopardi’s office had previously chastised minister Silvio Schembri for issuing partisan statements and warned that the commissioner would “take a more serious view of similar future cases”.
 When asked about the press release, Prime Minister Robert Abela argued that the press release concerned cabinet discussions, which were privileged and not subject to the parliamentary commissioner’s scrutiny.
 Commissioner Azzopardi, a former chief justice, dismissed that line of argument.
 However, he concluded that another section in the law – article 13 (4) of the Standards in Public Life Act – meant the complaint could not be investigated.
 Article 13 (4) notes that the commissioner “shall not prejudice the powers and prerogatives of the Prime Minister in respect of the Cabinet”.
 Commissioner Azzopardi cited a 2021 report by his predecessor to justify that decision. That report, by Azzopardi’s predecessor George Hyzler, included a letter Hyzler had written to Gozo Minister Clint Camilleri in which Hyzler said he “agreed” that the commissioner’s role was to investigate individual MPs and ministers’ actions, not cabinet decisions.
 “Therefore article 13(4) of the Act prevents this complaint from being investigated,” Commissioner Azzopardi concluded, emphasising that in his view the government was abusing Article 13 (4) and acting against the spirit of the Act.
 “It is worrying that in this case, no action can be taken against acts which would be deemed unethical if done by an individual minister,” the commissioner noted.
 In a similar case concluded last month, the standards commissioner reprimanded Energy Minister Miriam Dalli for having issued a partisan statement through her ministry. Dalli apologised for the statement’s “tone”.

Two additional 24/7 health centres planned,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/gov-planning-two-additional-247-health-centres-jo-etienne-abela.1095956,27-07-2024,007799.png,"The government is planning to increase the number of round-the-clock health centres in Malta from three to five, the Health Minister said on Saturday.
 Jo Etienne Abela told interviewer Andrew Azzopardi on RTK103 that the government was waiting for building and equipment standards certification confirming that the new Southern Regional Hub in Paola could start welcoming patients. 
 The Paola health centre - together with the Mosta and Floriana centres - provides 24/7 outpatient care.
 Abela said the government wanted to operate an additional two such centres but did not mention the proposed locations. 
 Meanwhile, the Health Minister urged against scaremongering over the government's call to the private sector to outsource emergency care.
 Mater Dei Hospital is currently struggling to keep up with the demands of Malta’s increasing population, with Abela previously telling  Times of Malta he wanted the main hospital to be freed of all outpatient services and instead focus on emergency and longer-term inpatient care.
 Among others, he plans on doubling the size of the emergency department. Mater Dei currently has 35 service cubicles within its emergency department and the plan is to increase it to 70 to 90 cubicles by extending the department into existing areas at the hospital and by physically enlarging its footprint.
 Earlier this month, the government also issued a call to private hospitals to outsource care, in the hope that the initiative, which will operate on a 24/7 basis, will ensure the provision of publicly funded emergency services.
 The announcement was slammed, among others, by former PD leader and doctor at a private hospital Anthony Buttigieg, who said the government was putting people's lives at risk by asking them to decide whether to seek urgent medical care at a private hospital or Mater Dei. 
 The PN also said the call was the result of a lack of planning by Robert Abela's government. 
 But on Saturday, Abela said outsourcing care was not crisis management.
 The idea had been in the pipeline since he took over the heath portfolio: ""We've been wanting to involve the private sector in the provision of accident and emergency services for a while now. This is not management crisis.
 ""On January 15, I met representatives from the private sector at my office and I told them we wanted to involve them more.""
 Abela added the authorities were also looking into tweaking the procedure employed to review cases at A&E, such as having a specialist consultant see the patient immediately, rather than waiting until a nurse and a junior doctor have examined the patient. 
 Abela also addressed concerns about COVID-19 cases at St Vincent De Paul long-term care facility.
 ""COVID cases have increased everywhere, but the virus is not more dangerous than before.
 ""There is no need for alarm. We would be alarmed if cases start ending up in ITU,"" the minister said, adding that the local authorities were monitoring the situation in Malta and abroad.
 He said that when social media users recently expressed concern about COVID cases at SVPR, which hosts 1,500 residents, there were a total of seven patients with COVID in isolation.
 Four of them were being released from isolation the following day. 
 Abela was also asked for a reaction to comments to  Times of Malta by clinical toxicologists about a new trend in admissions of patients with persistent severe vomiting due to long-term use of cannabis.
 He noted that people should be better informed about the use of any kind of substance. 
 ""All substances - including water - can be toxic if abused. If cannabis is abused, it is undoubtedly toxic,"" he said, noting that care provided to people who abused substances could improve if mental health care was physically brought closer to physical health care facilities.
 Abela announced he was scrapping plans for a new mental health hospital in March, saying that inpatient mental health care will instead be provided from within Mater Dei.

Malta to unveil tourism policy aimed at quality visitors and connectivity: Abela,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/malta-unveil-tourism-policy-aimed-quality-visitors-connectivity-abela.1102489,15-12-2024,007801.png,"The Government will present a new tourism policy in the coming weeks, that will look to bring quality tourists and improve Malta’s connectivity, Prime Minister Robert Abela said on Sunday.
 Abela said the policy will focus on how to maintain tourism volume but also focus on what sort of visitors are attracted to Malta. He dismissed the idea that decreasing the number of tourists arriving in Malta is the right measure.
 The tourism policy will also look at short-term rentals, he said. 
 Last month, MTA CEO Carlo Micallef revealed proposals that would mean apartment owners would need to get the go-ahead from the majority in their block before being granted short-term letting licenses. 
 According to an exercise carried out by Times of Malta, the new rules would affect  three-quarters of Malta's licenced homes.
 “We cannot abandon those whose only investment an an apartment they bought to rent short-term, but we must balance their interests with neighbours who live in the same block as those short-term lets”, Abela said.  
 Abela was short on providing further detail on what the policy would include.
 Speaking at the start of a Labour Party fundraising telethon, Abela said that the government’s “sound decisions” have led to economic growth and made the private sector confident enough to embark on investments that require huge capital investments.  
  Those investments will entice the quality tourists the country wants, Abela said.  
 The prime minister specifically singled out Malta’s tallest building, Mercury Towers, in Paceville, developer Joseph Portelli's most ambitious project. 
 “Until a few years ago there wasn't a Maltese who could have taken on a project like this, which cost a third of a billion. This is now possible because this government opened new economic opportunities,” he said. 
 Abela was speaking at PL headquarters in Ħamrun, two days after Malta celebrated its 50th anniversary as a republic.  
 Abela said that the changes made 50 years ago meant that the guardian of the constitution was no longer a foreigner, but a Maltese president.  
 The constitutional amendment that brought about a republic, and several others including in 1987 were fundamental in making Malta what it is today, he said.  
 
 “For 30 years any changes to the constitution were cosmetic,” he said.  
 But the prime minister said that the government embarked on a “constitutional revolution” in the last years.  
 That includes appointing the chief justice via a two-thirds majority vote in parliament and giving full autonomy to how the judiciary operates.  
 How the police commissioner is appointed has also changed he said.  
 Those changes meant that Malta’s good governance credentials have improved, Abela said.

 The architects' proposal would see the busy junction transformed into a tree-filled park. 
 The Kamra tal-Periti said on Sunday it wanted to ditch the planned flyover and instead transform Msida into a 20,000-square metre park with more than 2,000 trees, claiming it would even improve the traffic flow in the area.
 
 However, work on the Msida Creek project is due to start late next month after the feast of St Joseph.

 They added they always had their reservations about the flyover project, especially since there was no guarantee that the proposal was going to reduce traffic in the area. 
 They said they had always expressed a clear view in favour of proposed open spaces. 
 They urged the government not to discard KTP's proposal, meet all Msida councillors and the architects' chamber to discuss their recommendations and see whether parts of the proposal could be implemented.

 Grech dedicated the entirety of his TV appearance, typically reserved to discuss political issues, to Gouder's memory, extolling his virtues and crediting him as an integral reason why the PN made gains at the polls during last June's MEP and local council elections. 
 Gouder, 45, was found dead on Tuesday just two days after he announced his intention to run for PN general secretary.

 This is why the party had decided to continue as planned with activities related to the 60th anniversary of Independence Day, not only because Gouder would have undoubtedly wanted them to do so, but also because his family have also expressed the desire that these activities go ahead, Grech said. 
 ""Yes it is difficult, but we are going to honour our obligation to the people,"" Grech said.

 ""We chose the theme to look to the future and communicate how we can see our country regaining its good reputation and how we plan to move us in a good position again."" 
 ""But with this loss, the theme of moving forward has taken on a deeper meaning,"" he said. 
 Grech said that Gouder was passionate about celebrating Independence Day and working to strengthen the party, adding that his family expressed the desire that all that he worked for go ahead as planned. 
 He praised Gouder for qualities that went beyond his work: his ability to listen, be compassionate, help others and solve problems.
 He remembered Gouder as a person who always put others first and strived to be of service.
 ""Karl’s loss is not just a loss for his family or for the PN, but it is a loss for the entire country,"" he said.
 ""Just as he did in his life and at work, even in his passing, Karl managed to unite the whole country, as was evident during the celebration of his life.""
 He thanked all those who'd sent their condolences for Gouder's passing, including President Myriam Spiteri Debono, Prime Minister Robert Abela and European Parliament President Roberta Metsola. 
 He said that the party would work hard to keep the unity that Gouder inspired and strive to work on common goals. 
 Grech also said that the PN will continue to seek the truth behind Gouder's death, not out of a desire for revenge, but because all those who loved him deserve to know. 
 Independence Day celebrations will be held between September 18 and 20 at Triton Square, with more details to be announced on Monday.

Abela acknowledges message to shift 'from economic growth to quality of life',timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/abela-acknowledges-message-shift-from-economic-growth-quality-life.1094238,20-06-2024,"007916.png,007917.png","People want the government to move “at a quicker pace” towards an economic model that improves their quality of life and away from one focused just on economic growth, Prime Minister Robert Abela admitted on Thursday.
 Abela was speaking at the closing of the presentation of the fourth annual State of the Nation survey, an annual study that takes stock of the public’s beliefs on various topics, from the economy to religion, politics and culture.
 While praising Malta’s “unprecedented” economic growth (“we don’t even remember what it means to have economic growth under 3%, like that of other EU countries,” he said), Abela acknowledged that Malta’s economic growth had introduced new challenges, particularly in terms of pressure on Malta’s infrastructure and demographics, that need to be prioritised.
 But he hit back at claims that Malta’s economic model depends on constant population growth, describing this analysis as “mistaken”.
 “In reality, it’s the economy that has brought people over, not the other way around.”
 He also argued that migrant workers don’t only bring about challenges but also “skills and cultures from which we can benefit”.
 “But we need to analyse how these workers are meeting our needs as a nation, all the while analysing the skills of Maltese workers.”
 Abela pledged to look towards strengthening economic areas that “least impact our country’s infrastructure”, going on to list several possible niches, from robotics to artificial intelligence, digital economy, financial services and gaming.
 But, he warned, this doesn’t mean that the government will ignore the core industries that brought about Malta’s economic growth in the first place, including tourism, construction and maritime industries.
 “Our biggest mistake would be to ignore the feedback of credit rating agencies who praise our economy’s diversification,” he said.
 The conference was also addressed by PN MP Claudette Buttigieg, speaking on behalf of Opposition leader Bernard Grech.
 Buttigieg said that last week’s election result sent “a strong message” about several issues, including the fact that “we need to look at Malta’s economic model through a different lens”.
 “This is an issue that PN has long been saying, one that needs attention,” she said.
  Buttigieg also pointed to the news that Malta, along several other member states, will be facing the European Commission’s excessive deficit procedures.
 “High spending during the pandemic was justified, as that was a time when the country needed expenditure to be brought back on its feet,” she said.
 “But we have to condemn the many millions thrown away, even through corruption, that could have been spent on valuable social projects.”
 Buttigieg said this blow comes just a few short years after Malta’s FATF greylisting.
 “Now instead of talking about our way forward in terms of the environment or social measures, we will instead be talking about the roadmap to get out of excessive deficit procedures.”
 Closing the conference, President Myriam Spiteri Debono expressed her concern at the survey’s findings that interest in politics appears to be on the decline, particularly among youths.
 “We have reduced the voting age, but why have we still not managed to reach youths?” she asked.
 “Is there enough synergy between politics and citizens? Are we truly prepared to give everyone a voice, even if it requires changes to the highest law of the land?”
 Spiteri Debono also expressed her dismay at the survey’s findings about multiculturalism and foreign workers.
 “Maybe we should ask the Maltese who don’t want foreign workers point-blank whether they are ready to carry out the work they do,” she said.
 “They feel that some work is below them but they expect these jobs to still be done,” she insisted.

Chris Fearne files police complaint about '€6 million frame-up',timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/a-6-million-frame-try-block-me-fearne-file-new-police-complaint.1094757,07-02-2024,007937.png,"Updated 1.28pm with PL statement below.
 Former Health Minister Chris Fearne has asked the police to investigate and prosecute those behind a ""€6 million frame-up"" against him. 
 In his first public reaction to revelations in  Times of Malta,  The Boston Globe and Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), the former deputy prime minister said the new evidence was irrefutable proof that as Malta’s health minister, he always stood his ministerial ground in the national interest.
 Leaked corporate records obtained by the OCCRP and published on Monday showed that former hospital concessionaires Steward Health Care funded a campaign to smear Fearne with fake corruption claims.
 The campaign was part of a wider €6.5 million secret operation authorised by Steward to target their perceived opponents in Malta and abroad. 
 Practices included using bank records, accessing sensitive phone data, and planting “fake” media stories about corruption among Maltese officials. The operations were coordinated by senior Steward officials who corresponded regularly with private spies at two London-based intelligence firms called Audere International and CT Group, according to emails, encrypted messages, and financial records. 
 Fearne said in a Facebook post on Tuesday that this showed how much filthy money was paid to politically eliminate him and get him out of the way.  
 ""This malicious plan was done in two steps. First, they tried to find dirt, any dirt, to throw at me. When they failed because there wasn’t any, they just fabricated it. Quite simply, this was a pitch dark 6 million Euro frame up to try to block me from continuing to do my duty towards our patients, my ministry and my country.""
  Claims about Fearne and his top ministry official Carmen Ciantar first surfaced in foreign media in the summer of 2023. They alleged that the two received kickbacks on the sale of a passport to a wealthy foreign investor.
 Both denied the story and reported the claims to the police. On Tuesday, Fearne recalled that the police at the time had quickly concluded that the story was fake.
 However, police had been unable to determine where the claims originated from, he said. 
 Writing on Tuesday, he noted that media reports had now ""clearly shown who the source of this deceit"" was.  
 He asked the police commissioner to investigate the reports and file criminal proceedings against those responsible.
 ""Meanwhile I continue to defend and confirm my integrity in the Courts of Law,"" he wrote.
 Fearne is also facing criminal charges in connection with the Vitals-Steward deal to privatise three state hospitals, which was annulled by a court last year. 
 He is pleading not guilty and is seeking to have those charges dismissed at the prima facie stage. 
 Meanwhile, the Labour Party on Tuesday expressed solidarity with Chris Fearne - its deputy leader - and said it was condemning the malicious attacks made against him while he worked in the national interest and on the side of the truth.  
 The PL said it had also noted the hypocrisy of the Opposition leader and of the Nationalist Party, saying they were now underlining Fearne's integrity while having been the same people who had instituted a court case against Fearne in his personal capacity.  
 The PL said it was committed to seeing that the truth was known and justice was served, and the government had already declared it would seek to recover any Steward funds used for any fake news stories.

"Ombudsman finds discrimination against UPE members, authorities refuse to act",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/ombudsman-finds-discrimination-upe-members-authorities-refuse-act.1101270,20-11-2024,008007.png,"The Ombudsman has reported to parliament that a recommendation for the education authorities not to discriminate against members of the UPE trade union has not been implemented. 
 The Union of Professional Educators (UPE) had alleged that its members faced discriminatory treatment after it issued industrial action directives.
 Some heads of school requested written proof of UPE membership before allowing members to follow the directives. This occurred notably in primary schools in San Ġwann, Ħad-Dingli, Ħal Għaxaq, and Żejtun A.
 No such requirement was imposed on members of the Malta Union of Teachers (MUT) or any other union.
 Additionally, there was harassment of UPE members during a staff meeting at one school, which the union argued was discriminatory and in breach of the right to freedom of trade union association.
 The Office of the Ombudsman said an investigation confirmed that UPE members were being asked to produce a written ""personalised union directive"" when following UPE-issued directives. This practice was not applied to members of other unions, creating an unjust and discriminatory requirement for UPE members.
 There had also been an incident involving heated exchanges between a head of school and a UPE member, but this did not meet the threshold of harassment or maladministration under the Ombudsman Act.  
 The investigation reviewed the legal framework regarding union directives and membership. It was established that the Employment and Industrial Relations Act did not include the term ""collective directives,"" which the Education Authorities cited as justification for their stance.
 The Ombudsman said requiring proof of UPE membership infringed on privacy rights and was possibly inconsistent with GDPR requirements. The practice was unreasonable, unjust, and undermined, through the “chilling effect”, the right to free and unhindered union membership as protected by Article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights. 
 The Ombudsman upheld the union's complaint to the extent that requiring a ""personalised union directive"" for UPE members to follow their union’s directives was discriminatory and contrary to the law.
 The education authorities were called to immediately cease requiring a “personalised union directive” from UPE members.
 Through its permanent secretary, the ministry indicated that it did not intend to abide by the recommendation, the Ombudsman's office said.
 The report was sent to the prime minister but no action was taken. The Ombudsman and the Commissioner for Education therefore forwarded the Final Opinion, together with the correspondence to the Speaker for further consideration by the House of Representatives.

Edward Zammit Lewis to be nominated as EU court judge: sources,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/edward-zammit-lewis-nominated-eu-court-judge-sources.1094173,26-06-2024,008008.png,"Updated 5.15pm with PN reaction
 Labour MP and former minister Edward Zammit Lewis is to be nominated to the General Court of the EU.
 Government sources confirmed reports that Prime Minister Robert Abela intends to nominate Zammit Lewis to the post.
 He will replace Judge Ramona Frendo, who has moved to the EU’s higher court, the European Court of Justice, following the retirement of Judge Peter Xuereb.
 Zammit Lewis is a lawyer and served as Malta’s justice minister for two years, between 2020 and 2022.
 Abela subsequently chose to leave him out of cabinet. He now serves as a backbench MP and chairs parliament’s Foreign and European Affairs Committee.
 Nominees to the EU’s General Court must be approved by a panel of experts before they can serve on the court. Judges serve six-year terms.
 Zammit Lewis will be keen to highlight his work in steering through governance reforms advised by the Council of Europe’s Venice Commission.
 He will be less eager to discuss his friendship with business magnate Yorgen Fenech, who stands accused of complicity in the murder of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia.
 Leaked text messages which predated public knowledge of Fenech’s alleged involvement in the murder revealed that the two were on close terms, with Zammit Lewis telling Fenech that the average Labour voter was a “Ġaħan” (village idiot).
 First elected in 2013, Zammit Lewis was immediately promoted to cabinet by then-prime minister Joseph Muscat, serving as parliamentary secretary for competitiveness.
 One year later, he was promoted to Tourism Minister and served until the end of that legislature in 2017.
 He struggled to get reelected in that general election however, and only returned to parliament following a casual election.
 That cost him his place in cabinet and Zammit Lewis only returned to the executive’s top table in 2019 when Helena Dalli’s nomination as EU Commissioner opened up a vacancy for Equality Minister.
 Zammit Lewis’ parliamentary exit will open up a district 8 seat. However, with seven out of Labour’s 11 candidates in that district already in parliament, Abela might be able to replace Zammit Lewis through co-option.
 That would allow Abela to hand-pick an individual to serve in parliament without being limited to the candidates who ran for a district 8 seat in the last general election.
 Many of Abela’s current MPs were brought into parliament through co-option: from Miriam Dalli to Clyde Caruanam Randolph Debattista and Jonathan Attard, among others.  
 Reacting to news about the nomination of Zammit Lewis, the PN said in a statement the proposal was ""an insult to all those who believe in justice"".
 ""The choice of Zammit Lewis confirms Robert Abela does not care about the shouldering of political responsibility, and is choosing to reward those who abuse their political position,"" spokesperson for justice Karol Aquilina said in a statement.
 The government should withdraw the nomination and launch a public process for the nomination of a person who would make Malta proud. 
 ""The choice should be based on merit and not partisan political convenience.""

 “You represent the best of Europe.” 
 In her acceptance speech, Metsola said that this award is a reminder of her and the European Parliament’s responsibility to stand up for freedom democracy, equality, peace and solidarity. 
 Europe is in a pivotal moment in history, and the challenges that it is facing “demand leadership, clarity of action, and unity of purpose,” she said. 
 “Europe’s place in the world must be clear. When people look to us, they must find direction.”
 The prize has previously been awarded to prominent international figures such as Angela Merkel, Jean-Claude Juncker, and Jose Manuel Barroso.

Leniency should not be the order of the day: Malta Chamber calls for stronger ethical standards  - The Malta Independent ,independent,https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2024-11-09/local-news/Leniency-should-not-be-the-order-of-the-day-Malta-Chamber-Calls-for-stronger-ethical-standards-6736265574,09-11-2024,000001.png,"
                
        

         The Malta Chamber of Commerce, Enterprise and Industry expressed deep concern over recent revelations regarding Government appointments that disregard both merit and the ethical principles expected of public office. There is a disturbing trend of leniency and disregard for standards, which compromises the principles of meritocracy and transparency that are essential for good governance, the chamber said in a statement.
 In December 2021, a report of the Standards Commissioner led to a Minister's resignation over a breach of ethical standards, whereby a €15,000 public contract was awarded to an unqualified personal acquaintance, the chamber said. It was referring to the resignation of Justyne Caruana who was found to have gifted a €15,000 contract to her partner Daniel Bogdanovic. This incident illustrated the necessity for strict adherence to ethical codes, particularly concerning ministerial conduct and the responsible use of public funds.  In the same period, another appointment, recently brought to light, saw the then-girlfriend, now wife, of a different minister secure an eight-month, €68,000 p.a. role within the Ministry for Gozo-a position for which she was neither qualified nor deemed competent. This engagement was justified by the Minister as complying with the Manual of Resourcing Policies and Procedures, yet such comfort in technical adherence reveals a troubling gap in our ethical framework, the chamber said.
 In this case, Clayton Bartolo and Clint Camilleri were found by the Standards Commissioner to have abused their power when Bartolo's then-girlfriend Amanda Muscat was given a job she had no qualifications for, and did not do. The tourism and Gozo ministers respectively were found to have failed to administer public funds diligently, Standards Commissioner Joseph Azzopardi said in a report which was published by the parliamentary ethics committee.
 Azzopardi found that Amanda Muscat, now Bartolo's wife, was first promoted from being Bartolo's personal assistance to his consultant with an increased salary of almost €62,000 and, later, this was upped to €68,000 when she moved to Camilleri's ministry in 2021. The 40-page report showed that Muscat did not have the necessary qualifications for the job and did not do consultancy work. By and large she continued to work as Bartolo's private secretary, with a consultant's salary, even when she was employed with Camilleri.
 The chamber said that the verbatim interpretation of the Ministerial Code of Ethics by the current Standards Commissioner did not consider personal relationships outside of marriage within its scope, thereby overlooking the spirit in which these guidelines were created. The spirit of ethical governance mandates transparency and prioritizes qualifications over personal affiliations, something The Malta Chamber strongly advocates for across all sectors.
 The Prime Minister's acceptance of an apology as sufficient response to this matter only deepens the chamber's concerns, the statement said. Being lenient on such breaches of trust is incompatible with the ethical standards expected for good governance and weakens public faith in our institutions. When standards are inconsistently enforced or diluted, public confidence in Government diminishes, and the values of meritocracy and fairness are undermined. In the private sector, high ranking officers in serious companies are held to high standards of accountability-an apology alone is not sufficient in cases of ethical misconduct. The same, if not higher, standards should apply to those entrusted with public office.
 The Malta Chamber has long spoken about these principles. In 2022, a comprehensive document titled, ""A Strong Transparency, Accountability and Ethical Governance Framework for Members of Parliament"" (incl. Link) was issued.  This document advocates for stricter guidelines to address issues of nepotism, favouritism, and abuse of power in Government appointments. It is our firm belief that laws and regulations should serve as ethical guidelines rather than to provide loopholes to justify improper behaviour. Governance frameworks must be robust enough to hold public officials fully accountable and to deter abuse of power.
 In every Ministry and public entity, it is crucial to ensure that appointments and public contracts are awarded based on merit, qualifications, and a genuine commitment to public service, not personal connections. This approach preserves the credibility and integrity of public institutions and ensures diligent use of taxpayer funds.
 The Chamber called upon the government to take immediate, meaningful action to reinforce the ethical standards governing ministerial conduct. We urge the Prime Minister and all public officials to treat such breaches with the seriousness they deserve, to Government truly values transparency, meritocracy, and ethical governance.

"Court rules that TVM can air government’s budget adverts, as PL blasts PN’s hypocrisy - The Malta Independent ",independent,https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2024-11-11/local-news/Court-rules-that-TVM-can-air-government-s-budget-adverts-as-PL-blasts-PN-s-hypocrisy-6736265657,11-11-2024,000002.png,"
                
        

         A court has ruled that state broadcaster TVM can air the government’s budget adverts, turning down a case filed by the Nationalist Party.
 In a press conference after the decision was handed down by Madam Justice Miriam Hayman, the Labour Party said that the PN’s court case went against people’s “national interest” to know about the budget and to know the direction in which the country is heading.  The PN had argued that the spots breached rules on political impartiality, but the judge said that “in such a small politically polarised country it is difficult for the Budget not to have a political element, but it all depends on the degree.”
 Madam Justice Hayman ruled that some “supposedly educational spots” could be done in a more “politically sensible manner” and that while every budget spot was political, “the dose must be controlled and balance must be respected.”
 “An educational explanatory spot need not irritate the opponent in order to fulfil its purpose towards the public,” the judge said, noting that one sport including Prime Minister Robert Abela explaining a point “surely reaches undesirable levels.”
 However, the court noted that the PN had more effective remedies it had taken up to counter the lack of balance it was aggrieved at, including action through the Broadcasting Authority which had resulted in an order for PBS to allocate 15 minutes of spots to the PN for it to share its own views with the party logo visible.
 The court considered that the party had not managed to prove that it would suffer from a disproportionate prejudice if its court action was not accepted.
 In a press conference after the decision was issued, Labour Party President Alex Sciberras said that the PN had attempted to gag the government from speaking about the budget. He said that the courts noted the importance of the people knowing about the budget since it shows the country’s direction and how wrong it was to take it out of context. 
 Sciberras said that in a democratic country, the budget should be explained and the PN’s court action wasn’t only damaging but more worryingly, “went against national interest”. He said that the “nation’s collective right” was attempted to be usurped despite the PN insisting on the importance of dialogue, good governance and the rule of law.
 Sciberras said that the PN wanted to “shut the public’s ears” to the government and if the PN’s request was upheld, it would not only damage the Labour Party and the government but also the “people’s national interest”. He said that the time has come for the people to recognize the PN’s policy of “if I don’t win, I will ruin the game”. He added that not only are the people are fed up of this, but now the courts too have spoken. 
 On his part PL MP and Culture Minister Owen Bonnici said that if it were up to the PN, the people wouldn’t have seen informational slots on TV to raise awareness on the budgetary measures. He said that furthermore, they wanted people doing their jobs to have the threat of imprisonment “hanging over their heads.” 
 Bonnici said that the people have the right to follow such information which is “so important to the country’s administration”. He said that the PN has been caught in a “great hypocrisy” since the moment the same message was offered to be broadcast against payment on NET TV, it suddenly “became acceptable.”
 Bonnici appealed to the PN to cease their prejudice against the workers of the PBS and he said that the government will keep on defending them. He said that the court’s decision is in favour of the citizen to receive information and “reaffirms the state’s obligation to explain the budget”. “The Opposition has ended up on the wrong side of history,” he concluded.

 Contrary to how it treated Labour Party officials, it censored the Partit Nazzjonalista's General Secretary Michael Piccinino, and failed to report what Piccinino had to say about his future.
 Robert Abela, because he is weak and cornered, is using what is supposed to be the Public Broadcaster to try to stifle the voice of anyone who disagrees with him and his Government, the PN said.

Grech calls on ‘compromised’ PM to sack ministers and return ‘every euro’ paid to Bartolo’s wife - The Malta Independent ,independent,https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2024-11-18/local-news/PN-holding-protest-outside-Parliament-amidst-latest-government-ethics-scandal-as-PL-claps-back-6736265849,18-11-2024,000026.png,"
                
        

         Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech called on Prime Minister Robert Abela to sack two ministers embroiled in an ethics scandal, and for the money paid to the wife of one of the ministers for a job she was not qualified to have to be returned.
 Addressing a protest outside Parliament on Monday night, Grech implied that Abela was ""compromised"" in the wrongdoing because he had not made the two ministers involved - Clayton Bartolo and Clint Camilleri - resign their posts.  ""If you know Bartolo and Camilleri did something wrong tell them to resign their role, and make it public. Otherwise, you are as complicit as they are,"" the PN leader said.
 Grech addressed a protest outside Parliament on Monday under the slogan ""They keep on pigging out. Don't let them."" The Labour Party however erected its own banner overlooking Parliament square posing a question: ""Can they be paid for nothing?"" and including pictures of PN MPs Toni Bezzina, Justin Schembri, Robert Cutajar, David Agius, and Ivan Castillo.
 The crowd present were encouraged to make noise so that those in Parliament could hear them, and PN flags were frequently waved, together with placards, and some figures of pigs stuck to wooden sticks.
 PL MPs exiting Parliament were met with boos and cries of ""mafia"" while exiting PN MPs were met with applause from the crowd.
 The protest was called after a Standards Commissioner report found that two ministers, Clayton Bartolo and Clint Camilleri, abused their power when Bartolo's then-girlfriend Amanda Muscat was given a job with the Gozo Ministry that she had no qualifications for, and did not do.
 Muscat, who was initially working as Bartolo's personal assistant, was employed with Camilleri's Gozo Ministry as a consultant, netting a pay packet of €68,000.
 A Standards Commission investigation however found that Muscat was not qualified for the post, and never actually did any work as a consultant - instead she seemed to continue working for Bartolo as his personal assistant.
 
 Bartolo has since apologised for any shortcomings he may have committed, and the Prime Minister has said that his apology is ""sufficient"" - even as there are calls for the Tourism Minister's resignation.
 Addressing the crowd, Grech said that Bartolo had given his partner the job because he wanted to keep her happy.  Muscat's only qualification, he said, was that she happened to be romantically involved with the Minister.
 He addressed Bartolo's apology, saying that ""They were only sorry because they were caught red-handed"" because ""you need a conscience first to be sorry.""
 He lambasted the Prime Minister for his support for the two ministers, saying that he ""doesn't know the difference between right and wrong"" and has ""no moral authority"" over the country or those in his government.
 ""What do they [the ministers] know about you to make you stoop to such low levels?,"" Grech asked the Prime Minister, as he said that Abela is just as complicit as the two ministers are should he allow them to keep their places.
 ""Robert Abela has forgotten that the mission of a Prime Minister is to share wealth with the people,"" Grech said, as he noted that people in other sectors had to work for years to save up the €70,000 or so which Amanda Muscat was being paid per year.
 
 This wasn't this government's first such theft, Grech said, as he referred to how Melvin Theuma - the pardoned middleman in the Daphne Caruana Galizia murder - was also handed a phantom job, and how Abela had allowed Central Bank Governor to sit at home under a suspension and still get paid.
 Grech said Abela had been compromised because ""once more he chose fraudsters over the people"".
 ""This is why our country is at a crossroads. These people are arrogant and believe they can do what they want. They are convinced they can continue to pig out,"" he said.
 
 Grech said that the government's attacks on PN MPs Toni Bezzina and Karol Aquilina shows how truly government has ""its back is against the wall"" and will ""resort to lies.""
 ""They are so divided that they will not even share the same lift,"" Grech noted as the plenary session inside Parliament concluded. Bartolo, who was the last to address Parliament inside the Chambers, exited the building from its back entrance as the protest came to an end. 
 Grech concluded by saying that the PN is insisting that the two ministers are sacked, and the €68,000 paid to Muscat be returned ""down to the last euro"", adding that only together with a PN government can the people rise from ""the abyss the Prime Minister has put us in.""

 Grech said that the party made this decision “because that’s what Karl [Gouder] would have wanted” on top of also being requested to do so by his family.
 During an interview on NET FM on Sunday morning, PN leader Bernard Grech said that being just a few nights away from the country’s milestone independence date, an internal decision was made by the party to go ahead with all their scheduled appointments and political work over the coming days for two principal reasons: to keep remembering Karl Gouder as well as to work in his honour.  The theme for these independence celebrations is ‘Il-Quddiem’ (“Moving Forward”); this theme was selected to reflect the party’s vision. These activities will be held between the 18th and 20th of September at Triton Square, Floriana. All details will be announced on Monday, 16 September.
 “It’s difficult but we must keep working,” Grech said, “Karl wanted us to keep moving forward.”
 The Opposition leader described how Gouder, who was pinned to be the party’s next General Secretary just days before his tragic death, wished for the Nationalist Party to not only improve its overall position, but to change the country for the better. Grech remarked how Gouder wanted the Nationalist Party to strengthen its position for the good of the Maltese islands.
 Speaking more about his deceased and beloved colleague, Grech described Gouder for his positive attitude and influence onto everyone he interacted with. Grech spoke about Gouder’s “great energy” and his outlook to seek solutions for any sort of problem, stating that “his qualities will continue to live on through us” and that party officials will aspire to keeping working hard in his memory.
 “We need to find the strength to keep working past this,” Grech said.
 When asked about Gouder’s legacy, Grech said that he was a politician who had “great enthusiasm” and “extraordinary qualities” such as a caring nature through which the man would always see to an individual’s true concerns.
 Additionally, the PN leader noted how Gouder showed those around him that it is possible to disagree with someone without commencing any arguing – something he admitted was not easy to do in politics, considering how commonplace it is for politicians to go back and forth at one another.
 “Karl was a legend, and legends live on through us. He will continue to be in our thoughts. We will keep working for Karl,” Grech added.
 Concluding this interview, Bernard Grech announced that the party is planning to organise a tribute in honour of the party stalwart. The tribute will be open to the general public and Grech invited people to join party officials when it takes place. The details for this tribute are still being finalised.
 The PN Leader thanked everyone who expressed their condolences for Karl’s passing, including the President of Malta Myriam Spiteri Debono, Prime Minister Robert Abela, European Parliament President Roberta Metsola, and many others who attended the funeral or sent their messages of condolence. He also called for his party to keep alive the unity that his passing has managed to create, as evident during the celebration of his life.

Notarial Council tells notaries not to sign new Identità forms for lease registration - The Malta Independent ,independent,https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2024-09-05/local-news/Notarial-Council-tells-notaries-not-to-sign-new-Identita-forms-for-lease-registration-6736263945,05-09-2024,000031.png,"
                
        

         The Notarial Council of Malta has, with immediate effect, directed the Notarial College that the new form for the registration of leases issued by Identita should neither be signed nor filled out by the notary, until further notice.
 The Council took to Facebook to announce the directive, which was issued yesterday, emphasizing that the legal certainty, for which the Notary is the guarantor, must always be ensured.  This comes after Identita Malta issued the new Lease Agreement Attestation Form, which started being effective from 1 September.
 Any property lease agreement presented as part of a residence permit application must be officially attested by a Notary, Lawyer, or Legal Procurator. This additional layer of verification was introduced to further ensure the accuracy and reliability of the information provided to the Agency.
  
 The new form followed news reports that Maltese people and property owners started receiving mail addressed to foreign persons who are not residing in their properties, which led to allegations of a widespread racket regarding allegations of ID cards being issued based on forged documents.
Identità described the new form as “part of a broader effort to further enhance the Residence Permit application process, where through collaboration with other relevant entities, Identità has spearheaded initiatives aimed at streamlining the Residence Permit application processes and curbing misuse of the system.”
 The agency continued that by requiring lease agreements to be attested by a qualified legal professional, Identità aims to promote greater accountability from both property owners and tenants and ensure that all parties involved adhere to legal standards, whilst enhancing safeguards against false declarations.
 NGO Repubblika’s Honorary President Robert Aquilina, who is a notary by profession, took to Facebook to express his agreement with the Notarial Council’s directives.
 “Well done to the Notarial Council for the directive it issued in the past hours, so that with immediate effect, us notaries will not fill out nor sign the new form for the registration of leases as issued by Identita,” Aquilina said.
 He said that the Council has every reason to insist and demand that legal certainty, for which the Notary is the guarantor, must always be ensured.

Opinion: Helena’s credibility,theshiftnews,https://theshiftnews.com/2024/09/11/opinion-helenas-credibility/,11-09-2024,000032.png,"Patrick Dalli, husband of Malta’s EU Commissioner Helena, is on the warpath. Brandishing looney conspiracy theories, Patrick is roping in his whole family to turn on Labour and its officials.
 As the whole mortifying comedy is played out in public, the entire nation cringes.
 “Soon you will know about the manoeuvres in the appointment of the President by two high-ranking Labour officials to harm Helena’s credibility… It was a fascist attack on a woman who dedicated her life to the Labour Party and the Maltese people,” he said.
 What? A fascist attack?
 There was no stopping Patrick.  He was on the rampage.  He accused journalists of “lying again” following reports that Helena Dalli was lobbying to remain EU commissioner for a second term.
 Helena used her husband’s tactics. Resorting to Facebook, she categorically denied reports. “I will never stoop to such base levels.  That being said, there is a limit to everything, and you cannot always allow deception to go unchallenged,” she wrote.
 Helena Dalli is an EU Commissioner.  She embarrasses the whole nation with her sheer pettiness. Her husband’s hysterical comments only make things worse for her.
 He accused two high-ranking Labour officials of harming “Helena’s credibility”. She hardly needed any help destroying her credibility; if she needed any, her husband provided it in abundance.
 The two of them issued cryptic messages. If you’re going to make accusations, just come out with it.  Who are the two senior Labour officials discrediting Helena? Who is behind the deception (qerq) Helena is talking about?
 “I have the necessary experience of a life in politics to know where such baseless reports originate and what their objective is,” she said on social media.
 If she knows who’s behind the fake reports, why isn’t she telling us?  Dalli claims she knows somebody is lying about her, somebody is trying to deceive the nation, but she’s coy about revealing who.
 She claims she always worked in the country’s interest.  The country’s interest is knowing the truth. Instead, she chooses to protect Labour by withholding that truth.
 Now she’s upset because the police haven’t found out who left a threatening message at her home. She’s livid because it’s been over a week, and the police haven’t contacted her. Welcome to Police Commissioner Angelo Gafa’s force.
 Helena’s son, Luke, joined the family drama.  He announced that he was quitting after 14 years of hosting shows on Labour’s media outlets.
 He left no doubt who was pushing him to make his move. “I reached my decision after consultation with the people I love most in my life,” he said.
 “The decision was difficult, but it had to be made, and it had to be made now,” Luke added. He made that decision after “several events that happened in the past years, months and weeks”.
 Like his parents, Luke kept us guessing what those “events” could be.  Then he changed his tune – he just needed “more time with the family”.
 Patrick Dalli rushed back to social media to post: “The love and respect for family comes before all else.  Well done, Luke”.
 What an unedifying spectacle. What an embarrassment for the entire country.  If there were any doubt about Helena Dalli’s unfitness for office her petulant posts and her husband’s and son’s tantrums definitely dispelled them.
 Their antics don’t just make them a laughing stock – they shame the whole country. And not for the first time, either.
 Patrick Dalli yelled “mafia” at the Chief Justice in a packed court when a decision didn’t go his way. “You should be ashamed of yourself, mafia, mafia, corruption, free masonry, Opus Dei,” he shouted.
 Anybody else would have been held in contempt of court, jailed, or fined.  But Patrick is the EU Commissioner’s husband.  He was just let off without even a reprimand.
 When his wife Helena was still minister in Joseph Muscat’s Cabinet, the State purchased a painting of a blond nude that was the work of Helena’s husband.  The state paid him €15,000 for it.
 When then-PN MP Therese Commodini Cachia asked in parliament how the minister’s husband had been chosen and who valued Patrick’s work, he went on the attack.  “The price of my art is established by myself, and nobody has the right to value my work.”
 The Dallis’ shenanigans prove one thing – Robert Abela was right not to nominate her for President.  He couldn’t possibly risk it with a husband like Patrick.
 If she were made President, Patrick might get his wife to replace the Gobelins tapestries or Perez d’Aleccio’s frescoes at the Grandmaster’s Palace with his mediocre nudes. You’d never know whether he’d make a scene at some state dinner yelling “fascist”, “mafia”, “Opus Dei” at some head of state.

 Sal-lum, il-Kummissjoni, li mhix magħrufa li tħaddem xi approċċ proattiv fejn tidħol is-superviżjoni, għadha ma ħarġitx multa lill-PN għal dan il-ksur.

 Sena qabel biss, fl-2021, il-Labour kien għalaq is-sena b’surplus ta’ kważi €1 miljun.
 L-akbar nefqa rrapportata mill-PL fis-sena finanzjarja 2022 kienet il-kampanja elettorali, li skontu swiet xi €3.2 miljun, id-doppju ta’ kemm kien irrapporta li swietu l-kampanja tal-elezzjoni ġenerali tal-2017.

 Filwaqt li l-Kummissjoni Elettorali hi mistennija tivverifika l-integrità ta’ dan ir-rappurtar finanzjarju mill-partiti politiċi, fil-verità dan ma jsirx.

Church given €1 million in new stocks in ongoing property negotiations,theshiftnews,https://theshiftnews.com/2024/08/14/church-given-e1-million-in-new-stocks-in-ongoing-property-negotiations/,14-08-2024,"000038.png,000039.png","Aqra 
 The government has issued over €1 million in new stocks to the Church as part of ongoing negotiations on the revision of a 30-year-old agreement on the transfer of Church property to the State.
 Through a legal notice issued without any publicity a few days ago, the Finance Ministry approved the issue of €1.1 million in government stocks in the name of the ecclesiastical authorities, with a privileged dividend of 7% per annum – a much higher rate than current market offerings.
 At the same time, the government declared that the new stocks shall be redeemed at a premium of 10% over the nominal value in ten years. This means that for every €100 paid to the Curia through these stocks, the ecclesiastical authorities will be paid €110 in 2034, apart from the annual 7% interest.
 A spokesman for the Finance Ministry told The Shift that this legal notice was issued as part of crucial and ongoing negotiations with the Church over the revision of the 1991 property agreement.
 “The legal notice is in line with the provisions of the Ecclesiastical Entities (Properties) Act, whereby any difference that might result between the total nominal value of the bonds issued to the Church at the time of the agreement dated 28 November 1991 between Government and the Holy See and the value of the property actually transferred to the State (at several points since the agreement was signed and pari passu as the properties get valued and their value is compared to their original estimate) shall be made good by the Government through the issue of bonds of the same tenor (7% minimum), together with the interest due from the date of the agreement.”
 So far, both the Curia, headed by Archbishop Charles Scicluna and the government have remained tight-lipped over the secret negotiations held since February 2023.
 No details have been given on whether a final settlement has been reached and what the revision will mean to taxpayers. The lack of transparency in these negotiations is a cause for concern. It is not even clear whether the negotiations are still ongoing.
 Questions sent to both the government and the Curia remained unanswered.
 In 1991, under the Fenech Adami administration, an agreement was reached between the Maltese ecclesiastical authorities and the government to transfer all the Church’s property to the State, with a few exceptions.
 The Church was the beneficiary of massive, accumulated property wealth, mainly through donations by followers, primarily through their wills.
 In return, the Maltese government agreed to start covering all the costs related to the running of the Church schools (€108 million in 2023), a significant compensation in government stock to 99 ecclesiastical entities and a mechanism whereby the State passes part of the proceedings from the eventual sale of property back to the Church.
 The latter mechanism, including the amount of compensation, ended in 2023 – after 30 years – and is now the subject of the ongoing negotiations for its revision.
 The Curia has always refused to state its expectations for this revision.
 A champion of social issues upon his appointment in 2015, Archbishop Charles Scicluna has lately been criticised for his silence on major issues, including corruption, exploitation of foreign workers and increasing poverty.
 Many believe the Archbishop’s sudden change of attitude has to do with the millions of government funds awarded to the Church during the past years and the ongoing negotiations on revising the 1991 property deal.

Abela rallies supporters for MEP election: ‘Europe is at cross-roads’,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/national/128918/abela_rallies_supporters_for_meps_election_europe_is_at_crossroads,29-04-2024,000047.png,"Prime Minister Robert Abela urged people to “go out and vote” for their future in the June European Parliament and local council elections.
 “We will choose the Europe we want on the 8 June. Do we want a Europe which invest in social measures or a Europe set on buying tanks and getting into war?” Abela said.
 The PM was interviewed on party television station ONE TV a day after the PL launched its European election campaign.
 In a clear message to the large number of undecided and non-voters in election polls, Abela rallied supporters to vote come 8 June.
  “The road back to power for the PN could start on the 8 June. It will be a choice between those who believe in politics of incentives to those who believe in the politics of austerity,” he said.
 In a dig at the European Parliament President Roberta Metsola without mentioning her by name, Abela said the line-up of Labour candidates all have the country at heart, unlike “those among us who want to use Europe as a way to further their personal career.”
 “Europe is at cross-roads across the continent and even in Malta. We can either chose to go for a Europe which fosters peace or a Europe which has its eyes set on other goals,” he said.
 He said staying home and not voting “should not be an option.” “What we do on the 8 Juned determines our future. To stay home means that other people will be deciding your future for you.”
 Abela also spoke about how the PL has a line-up of experience and youth in its candidates for the local councils, stating they recognise the different needs and realities of their respective localities.
 He also spoke about a number of government incentives and measures which have helped tackle the issues of rising prices in food, energy and fuel.  ",Karl Azzopardi ,Politics

The pair are Scicluna's co-accused in the Vitals case and unlike Scicluna, they both resigned from their public posts upon their indictment.
  Grech highlighted the injustice of Scicluna remaining in his position, despite being supposedly suspended, and continuing to earn €11,500 per month.
 Grech stated that Abela had proposed to the cabinet the removal of Scicluna, but the Abela's lack of authority resulted in only a few ministers supporting him.

Joseph Portelli’s architect blames ‘media spin’ for her resignation as BCA chairperson - The Malta Independent ,independent,https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2023-08-18/local-news/Joseph-Portelli-s-architect-blames-media-spin-for-her-resignation-as-BCA-chairperson-6736254170,18-08-2023,000093.png,"

 Architect Maria Schembri Grima blamed “media spin” for her resignation as the chairperson of the Building & Construction Authority (BCA) last February – a resignation which came after construction debris were filmed flying onto a street from a project which she was the architect for.
 Schembri Grima had long faced questions on a possible conflict of interest between her role as BCA chairperson and as the architect of choice for Joseph Portelli – one of Malta’s foremost developers –and she went into the courtroom to face the public inquiry into Jean Paul Sofia's death on Friday ready to answer questions on this topic.
 “Did you see any conflict…”, board chair Joseph Zammit McKeon began as his first line of questioning.  “No,” she replied immediately.   “It’s as if you knew I was going to ask you this question,” Zammit McKeon said with a chuckle.
 The architect blamed the media for how she was portrayed and how the “perception” that there was a conflict of interest in her being BCA chairperson and still working in her private practice.
 “I always did my work diligently and I believe that’s why I was approached for this post,” she says.
 She spoke about the state of the construction industry prior to the BCA: “It was unregulated.  Whoever wanted, could do as they wanted.   I never did what I wanted: things which are applied by the BCA today are things which I did on site before that, and I think that’s why I was chosen.”
 She said that she had made it clear that she didn’t want to get into the processes or day-to-day running of the BCA.
 Schembri Grima resigned from the BCA last February after a stop notice was issued on a project of which she was the architect, after debris was filmed flying onto Psaila Street, Birkirkara during demolition works. The planning permit for the project in question was issued to Excel Investments Ltd. of which Gozitan mega-developer Joseph Portelli is a shareholder.
 Schembri Grima told the board that there were already two stop notices in place on the site, so the BCA did their job.
 “It was clear that I did my job and [the contractor] didn’t follow the method statement, but forget that.  I could not interfere with the work of the BCA, so I wanted the truth to come out – but there was never a conflict,” she says.
 Zammit McKeon noted that the matter seems to be a sore point for her, and asks why she felt she had to resign if she is so convinced that she did nothing wrong.
 “There was so much media spin that the BCA was going to suffer because of it.  I didn’t want there to be the perception of a conflict of interest – even if there wasn’t one,” she replied.
 Therese Comodini Cachia, who was representing the Sofia family, later read out a media article and asked Schembri Grima to point out exactly which part of it was “spin.”
 The architect did not identify any of that article as being spin, but insisted that some had identified her as being involved in the demolition.
 You are reading the facts as happened on site, but there wasn’t just one newspaper or article on this. I am speaking about the media spin that made it seem like I was involved in the demolition,” she said.
 “On the day of the case, I was, like always on a Saturday, with my children. As soon as I got to know what was happening, I went on site and the road had already been cleared and cleaned of all debris,” she added. 
 Board member Mario Cassar asked the architect how many times she had been to that project, noting that the contractor had blamed her.  “Many times,” she replied.
 Cassar queried what communication there was between her and the contractor.  “Yes there was – there was what was said would be done, and what was done.   On that day there shouldn’t even have been any demolition.   I resigned from the project then – it was either him or me,” she replied.
  “And the contractor got off with a €5,000 fine… the bare minimum,” Cassar points out.   “I don’t get into that,” she replied.
 Schembri Grima’s testimony also laid bare the fact that there was no authority entrusted with enforcing the building standards of a building like that which collapsed and killed Jean Paul Sofia.
 “You need to see what remit the BCA had in this case.  The BCA is there first and foremost to safeguard third parties – so that neighbours are safe,” the architect said
 She says that a building on a site like that where Sofia collapsed the responsibility is with the duty holders – and that is the same for following the procedures and documents submitted as part of the commencement notice.
 “When there are no third parties, there is no method statement,” Schembri Grima clarified to the board as they tried to understand the matter.
 “But you have the right to step in,” Zammit McKeon suggested.
 “The BCA doesn’t get involved in sites where there are no third parties,” Schembri Grima replied.
 “So when there are no third parties, BCA out,” Zammit McKeon stated.  “Yes,” came the reply.
 Asked by the board whether she thinks that the BCA should have power to intervene in projects which do not neighbour people, Schembri Grima said that it shouldn’t necessarily be the BCA, but agreed that someone has to enforce it.  
 “Does a person have to stay knocking doors everywhere to find out who to speak to?  The rule of law means knowing where you need to go,” Zammit McKeon pointed out.
 “I am not sure that it should be under the BCA, but I agree that there has to be something,” she said.
 Comodini Cachia later asked who one should go to if she is concerned about a building which has no third parties.
 “If it’s a structural issue, then one goes to the Chamber of Architects,” Schembri Grima began.  But her answer was not as easy to come for if the problem is with the construction of the building.
 “If it’s a problem of construction…” a pause … she stutters to repeat the words.  Zammit McKeon even felt the need to asks whether she was ok.   Schembri Grima replied in the affirmative and said that she was thinking.
 Ultimately there was no answer: the architect referred to the board’s suggestion that there should be an entity to enforce standards in such buildings – seemingly admitting in not so many words that, at present, there is nobody to enforce those standards beyond those who are constructing the project.
 Schembri Grima was also asked about the dismissal of the BCA’s first CEO Karl Azzopardi – who also testified on Friday – and about the BCA’s enforcement capabilities, which were detailed later in the day by the BCA’s current CEO Jesmond Muscat.
 The choice of Muscat – who was the final witness to testify on Friday – as Azzopardi’s successor was also a topic of questions to Schembri Grima, with Comodini Cachia suggesting that there had been disagreement on the board over his appointment.
 Schembri Grima said that the discussions took “some time” – although she avoided the use of the word disagreement.  There were two separate meetings on Muscat’s appointment in fact before the board ultimately decided to back Muscat.
 Comodini Cachia asked whether she was right to say that one person didn’t attend the meeting when Muscat’s appointment was confirmed and whether others abstained. Schembri Grima said that she doesn’t remember, but doesn’t think that anybody abstained.
 Also testifying on Friday was Schembri Grima’s successor: Saviour Camilleri, who came out retirement in order to become the BCA chairman after the embattled architect had resigned.
 He too admitted that the building where Sofia died did not fall under the BCA’s remit.
 “And this doesn’t bother you?” Zammit McKeon asked.
 “Yes it does, of course it does,” Camilleri replied.
 Much of his testimony focused on the recently announced plans to license contractors by the start of 2025.  
 Camilleri detailed the reform, saying that contractors must all be licensed by the end of 2024, that the BCA would have the power to revoke a contractor’s license to work on any site, and that – put simply – those who do not have the necessary standards to work in the industry, will not be allowed to.
 Zammit McKeon however asked what was going to happen until the end of 2024, to which Camilleri replied that the current laws still apply.
 That means, he admitted, that contractors will remain unlicensed.
 “So how are we going to control the industry so people don’t die,” Zammit McKeon asked.
 Camilleri said that the number of inspections which the BCA is doing has increased – although he could not give exact figures of by how much they had increased to the board, much to Zammit McKeon’s annoyance.

 Investigations by The Shift show that after years of supplying third-country national workers to various companies in Malta, JK Security Limited, owned by Kevin Borg, a 45-year-old businessman from Attard, failed to meet the newly established criteria for continuing to provide such services.
 A due diligence exercise by the Department for Industrial and Employment Relations (DIER) established that Borg’s companies, JK Security Ltd and JK Services Ltd, did not qualify for the licence to operate a recruitment and outsourcing agency, and his application was withdrawn.
 The criteria include tax compliance, a bank guarantee and a competent person, among the main requirements.
 While he continued to supply workers without a licence, Borg registered a new company, Worldwide Outsourcing Ltd, based at the same address as his botched companies.
 He was issued a new licence after reapplying for a licence to act as a recruitment agency through the newly registered company.
 DIER did not explain. The Director General, Daine Vella Muscat, only said: “The process for granting or declining a licence for an employment agency to operate is governed by a due diligence procedure and a working committee that reviews and recommends whether the licence should be issued.  Regarding specific cases, I am not at liberty to disclose information pertaining to ongoing investigations. ”
 She said the information was incorrect but did not bother to explain it.
 Kevin Borg made his employees pay €300 to transfer them to the new company.
 Some of Borg’s employees who contacted The Shift complained that they were being forced to pay for their boss’ failures so that they could keep their jobs.
 “We are just keeping our jobs and it is not our fault that our boss did not have his papers in order,” an employee said.
 Efforts to contact Kevin Borg proved futile.
 Sources in the hospitality industry described this episode as an example of the mismanagement of the whole licensing scheme, describing what is going on at the DIER as “one big joke”.
 They claimed that DIER enforcement is poor. The agency does not even have the required inspectors to enforce the rules.
 The DIER falls under the remit of the Office of the Prime Minister and Parliamentary Secretary Andy Ellul. Questions sent to him were referred to DIER.
 Kevin Borg and his companies had already made news before. The Times of Malta reported that nine months after JK Security recruited a group of third-country nationals to work at a Christmas Village in Ta’ Xbiex, they were still expecting to be paid. Some were owed around €1,500 for a month’s work but did not receive a cent.
 The employees claimed that Borg had even refused to give some workers part of their dues, even though they risked becoming homeless as they did not have enough money to pay their landlords.
 Borg admitted to not paying his workers, as he said the operator of the Christmas village had not paid him for his services.
 Later, he said that he withheld payments as he was investigating some workers who reportedly stole from the Christmas activity.
 New legislation to control the influx of foreign workers in Malta was introduced in June after years of a government-fuelled ‘free-for-all’, with claims of worker exploitation becoming the order of the day.
 As of June, all recruitment and outsourcing agencies are required to hold an operating licence. Yet many continue to operate irregularly.

In defence of Amanda: Gozo ministry boss tells investigation he doesn’t email,theshiftnews,https://theshiftnews.com/2024/11/17/in-defence-of-amanda-gozo-ministry-boss-tells-investigation-he-doesnt-email/,17-11-2024,"000100.png,000101.png,000102.png","Michael Buhagiar, Gozo Minister Clint Camilleri’s right-hand man and his Ministry’s Chief of Staff, told the Standards Commissioner under oath in the investigation on Ministers Clint Camilleri and Clayton Bartolo that he doesn’t really use emails for his work.
 When interviewed by the Commissioner during the investigation on the €70,000 job given to Minister Bartolo’s wife, Amanda Muscat, Buhagiar, known as ‘It-Tewmi‘, could not explain how he had not received emails from her when she occupied the role of policy adviser at the Gozo Ministry.
 “I rarely use emails in my work,” Buhagiar told the Commissioner.
 Buhagiar admitted that Muscat had no office at the Gozo Ministry, and she rarely attended. When questioned about how he maintained contact with her to monitor her performance on the projects she claimed to be working on, Buhagiar did not explain. He said he judged people “on results”.
 Buhagiar declared, that he engaged Muscat as a person of trust with Minister Camilleri. He said Minister Bartolo’s Chief of Staff, John Grima, recommended her to him, but he did not question whether she had the qualifications for the job.
 “I knew that she had experience in tourism, as she used to work within the Tourism Ministry. I did not give too much importance to her academic qualifications,” Buhagiar said to justify his decision.
 According to her CV, Muscat’s education includes 2 ‘A’ levels in Sociology and Maltese, with grades ‘D’ and ‘B’, respectively. She then earned a diploma. These are insufficient qualifications for the role of policy adviser, which requires top academic qualifications and experience.
 Before being promoted to policy adviser, she was Tourism Minister Clayton Bartolo’s personal secretary, taking care of his diary and daily needs.
 Buhagiar also could not explain how, after being given a job for which she was not qualified, he decided to award her an extra €20,000 expertise allowance, which is restricted to exceptional expertise. The Gozo Ministry’s Head of Secretariat said he could not remember.
 However, he said that he had obtained all necessary approvals, including from Robert Abela’s office.
 A Ministry’s Chief of staff is the second in command and is usually in regular daily contact with all his departments and agencies through email and other means.
 In an attempt to shield his Minister from any responsibility, Buhagiar claimed that he had terminated Muscat’s contract some four months before it expired “as she had completed her tasks.”
 He was asked to give examples of these tasks but found it difficult to remember, again.

 Buhagiar did not reveal at any time that Muscat’s contract termination was an order by the Prime Minister, as Robert Abela recently declared.
 Buhagiar, 60, from Qala, has worked for Minister Clint Camilleri, known as Tal-Bedeq, since the Minister’s early days in politics. He started as a secretariat member of former Gozo Minister Anton Refalo in 2013.
 The Qala resident switched allegiance when Camilleri was elected to parliament in 2017 and became Parliamentary Secretary for Agriculture.
 Buhagiar has no academic qualifications and used to work in a hotel until he opened a restaurant in Victoria known as Maji Wine and Dine.
 The restaurant, now closed, had little success. Buhagiar’s company, X & B Co Ltd, which he owns with his wife Mary Rose, has accumulated debts of over €240,000, according to its last published accounts. The Chief of Staff is also known to deal in property in Gozo.
 His company’s auditor is Joe Cordina – Gozo Channel’s Chairman.

New scheme by Lands Authority for revising conditions in government property contracts,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/national/130958/new_scheme_by_lands_authority_for_revising_conditions_in_government_property_contracts,30-08-2024,000122.png,"The Lands Authority has launched a new scheme aimed at updating the criteria for accepting changes or removals of conditions set when property is transferred from the Government, the Land Authority, or ecclesiastical entities.
 This scheme was detailed in Legal Notice 196, recently published in the Government Gazette.
 Previously, changes or removals of conditions in original contracts were limited only to alterations in the number of residences or garages.
  The updated Legal Notice grants the authority the power to determine whether the proposed changes are of minor, medium, or major importance, and based on this decision, appropriate fees or administrative penalties will be established.
 In making this decision, the authority will consider the impact of the change or removal of a condition on the free and open market value of the transferred property. The Legal Notice includes a comprehensive schedule of payments required for each category.
 Changes or removal of conditions will not be permitted when the property was acquired through a parliamentary resolution, tender, tender process, or auction.
 During a press conference, Lands Minister Stefan Zrinzo Azzopardi said this new scheme will provide citizens, families, and the general public with greater clarity regarding the processes of the Land Authority.
 Cases excluded from this scheme include changes in title, revisions of ground rent review dates, changes in ground rent payments, or changes in the ground rent expiration term.
 Lands Authority CEO Robert Vella said this scheme will allow the authority to process requests to resolve longstanding issues related to outdated ground rent contract conditions that are no longer relevant.
 Present at the press conference were also the Chairperson of the Land Authority, John Vassallo, and the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Lands and Implementation of the Electoral Manifesto, Carlos Tabone.  ",Nicole Meilak ,Government

 The former parliamentary secretary, who was removed from office when Robert Abela became the leader of the Labour Party, not only works as a full-time health worker at Mater Dei but was also recently appointed chairman of the Grand Harbour Regeneration Corporation (GHRC), a government entity responsible for infrastructural upgrades in Valletta and Kottonera.
 The appointment was made by Social Justice Minister Michael Falzon, who is currently embroiled in a scandal involving millions in disability benefits fraudulently distributed for political gain.
 The racket saw hundreds of people, mostly from Labour Party stronghold towns, fraudulently receiving millions of euro in disability benefits through a racket suspected to involve officials close to the Labour Party.
 Meanwhile, Agius Decelis, who was unseated in the last general elections, is also eyeing the mayorship of Mosta, another paid position, challenging the unpopular incumbent, Labour’s Christopher Grech.
 Minister Falzon has also re-appointed Trischia Falzon, the Deputy Head of One News, to the government agency board despite her lack of expertise in the sector.
 Trischia Falzon is also on other paid government boards, including the Residency Malta Agency appeals board and a service contract with the Active Ageing Ministry to work on social media. However, it is unknown whether this contract has been renewed.
 Over the past years, the FSWS has seen several partisan appointments, with Labour Party activists moving to top managerial positions.
 Apart from CEO Alfred Grixti, a veteran Labour activist, the top management directors include two MEP candidates, Claudette Abela Baldacchino and Jesmond Bonello, the partner of Minister Owen Bonnici, Remenda Grech and  Monsignor Joe Vella Gauci, Malta’s ambassador to UNESCO.

ADPD calls for accountability over fake identity card scandal,newsbook,https://newsbook.com.mt/en/adpd-calls-for-accountability-over-fake-identity-card-scandal/,14-09-2024,000178.png,"Tista' taqra bil-
 ADPD, the Green Party, has expressed significant concerns about the alleged issuing of 18,000 false identity cards in Malta, a scandal that transcends national borders due to the access these cards provide to the Schengen Area. During a press conference on Saturday, party officials demanded political accountability, emphasising the gravity of the issue and seeking the resignation of the minister responsible. Dr. Ralph Cassar, Secretary General of the ADPD, emphasised the frightening ease with which fraudulent identity cards were purportedly disseminated, including examples of identity theft. Cassar emphasised that such a pervasive problem could not have occurred without deliberate planning, significant financial backing, and possible complicity between officials and criminal networks. “It’s unlikely that this scale of fraud could occur without a coordinated effort involving many individuals,” Cassar told the crowd. He also argued that the absence of prompt political action, particularly by the minister in charge, Byron Camilleri, demonstrates a failure of leadership. Cassar accused Camilleri of failing to recognise the gravity of the crisis, which he feels is deeply ingrained in Malta’s culture of impunity, particularly following the killing of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia. Sandra Gauci, ADPD Chairperson, shared Cassar’s thoughts, calling for severe penalties for those engaged in what she described as a serious violation of trust that jeopardises Malta’s Schengen membership. Gauci emphasised that the repercussions of this scandal extend beyond immigration, harming the national health system. She stated that the trustworthiness of identity cards has become so undermined that healthcare staff are increasingly being obliged to obtain additional documentation to validate patients’ identities, putting an unneeded load on an already overcrowded system. “The situation has worsened to the point where no one feels safe. “Our health services are now at risk, with sensitive data vulnerable to misuse,” Gauci stated. The state-run agency responsible for issuing identity cards and residence permits reacted to ADPD’s press conference denying the claim that 18,000 people were given identity cards with false information. Identità said it had already denied the claim adding that the investigation “has to do with residency permits and not identity cards as APD had said earlier today.” The agency defended itself saying its compliance team has an internal verification system in place which it applies and continues to strengthen and complement its processes with a number of measures. Identità said it reported a case relating to residency permits – and not identity cards – to the police following an internal investigation. There is currently a magisterial inquiry underway in connection with alleged fraud at Identità initiated by former PN minister and lawyer Jason Azzopardi. In his application he indicated car dealer Bernard Attard and former Identità employee Maria Spiteri as suspects.",Dylan Attard,Politics

 Sources told The Shift that both Magro and Abela did not want Saliba to remain at the authority, even in a different role, despite being a full-time employee.
 Saliba has instead been given a new role advising Public Works and Planning Minister Stefan Zrinzo Azzopardi.
 According to government sources, neither the minister nor Saliba are asked for their advice on many matters, as Magro speaks directly to the Office of the Prime Minister (OPM) whenever needed.
 “It is a pity how we keep wasting the limited and stretched resources this country already has”, senior Planning Authority officials told The Shift.
 “Although also controversial, as this comes with the job, Saliba surely had much more to contribute at the PA than inside a minister’s secretariat,” they added.
 With a reputation as a fair man, Saliba was appointed as the authority’s executive chairperson in 2019 after the departure of Johann Buttigieg.
 The latter was embroiled in various scandals and is now employed by Michael Stivala’s ST Group, together with disgraced former prime minister Joseph Muscat. Stivala is also the president of the Malta Developers Association.
 Saliba’s position at the authority came into question when Robert Abela became prime minister.
 Sources said that Saliba was not in tune with Abela’s policies, favouring prominent businessmen, and was “not obeying enough the OPM’s direction”.
 Abela employed Magro as a person of trust at the Office of the Prime Minister as soon as he came to power in 2020.
 He had previously been an employee of the Planning Authority and was tasked to act as a liaison between the OPM and the authority, with a reputation as the man to go to for permits.
 The two had also worked together when Abela was on a €17,000-a-month direct order contract to act as the authority’s legal counsel.
 In December 2022, a day after Saliba’s three-year contract was not renewed, Magro returned to the authority as executive chairperson with a €100,000-plus financial package.
 His contract ends in December 2025 but can be renewed on the prime minister’s orders.
 Meanwhile, Salbia now finds himself out of the authority altogether.

Standards Commissioner calls for ‘prudence’ in use of ministerial cars,theshiftnews,https://theshiftnews.com/2023/08/17/standards-commissioner-calls-for-prudence-in-use-of-ministerial-cars/,17-08-2023,000184.png,"Commissioner for Standards in Public Life Joseph Azzopardi has called for more explicit guidelines on the use of ministerial vehicles in a decision on a complaint by independent politician Arnold Cassola based on a report by The Shift.
 Cassola had filed the complaint after this newsroom revealed that Parliamentary Secretary Chris Bonnet had used his ministry-financed car for a family holiday to Sicily last November.
 The Commissioner concluded that while there was no breach of ethics, “this does not mean it was good practice”, saying that there should be “prudence” in the use of the vehicle, despite it being “a known fact that there are other high ranking officials who have used their ministry vehicles to go abroad”.
 Last November, The Shift reported that Bonnet had used his government-leased BMW 520D for a private holiday, not official government business.
 The Commissioner said that “Bonnet and others who have similar benefits can use caution and prudence with respect to the public perception given that [the Commissioner’s] office is obliged to look past regulations as ethical behaviour demands”.
 Azzopardi said there should be “guidelines in this regard that apply to Ministers, Parliamentary Secretaries, and all government and parastatal officials”, adding that “these guidelines should be available publicly”.
 Nevertheless, the Commissioner’s document concluded with a decision not to investigate further.
 In a letter to the Commissioner on 12 April, Bonnet refused Cassola’s complaint of unethical behaviour, claiming his ministerial vehicle’s contract did not limit where it could be used. He also claimed that he paid any additional expenses incurred on the November trip.
 Bonnet pointed to the car’s contract which specified charges for “European break-down service coverage, additional insurance, and a surcharge of Lm25 daily for the duration that car is in use outside Malta”. Despite being signed in March 2020 by the Foreign Affairs Ministry, the contract still specifies charges in Maltese lira, a currency that has been obsolete since 2008.
 An invoice annexed to the decision from Vision Car Leasing to Bonnet for the charges is dated 31 December, showing it was only issued following The Shift’s reports in November on Bonnet’s car usage.
 Chief Justice Emeritus Joseph Azzopardi was appointed Standards Commissioner last March through a controversial ‘anti-parliamentary deadlock’ legislation passed covertly two days after last Christmas.
 The new legislation allowed the commissioner to be appointed through a simple majority vote, given that the previously required two-thirds consensus was not reached.
 This meant that the government freely chose a Commissioner without the need for consensus with the Opposition.

Abela blasts PN for trying to belittle police ‘at every opportunity’ - The Malta Independent ,independent,https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2024-10-21/local-news/Abela-blasts-PN-for-trying-to-belittle-police-at-every-opportunity-6736265097,21-10-2024,000200.png,"
                
        

         Prime Minister Robert Abela has condemned the Nationalist Party for its treatment of the local police and the disciplined forces, saying that the party has tried to belittle the police ""at every opportunity.""
 Abela called for the PN to retract its sustained attitude towards these law enforcement officers, which he said it has continued to put on display through its comments.
 The Prime Minister said that the Nationalist Party was wrong to issue the ""false statement"" that Police Commissioner Angelo Gafà had recently increased his own salary.  On Wednesday, 16 October, PN expressed its criticism that Gafà was not only given another term as police commissioner, in spite of all his ""shortcomings at the helm of the Malta Police Force,"" but also saw his salary ""practically double."" According to reports, Gafà is now on an annual salary of €107,438.
 During Monday's plenary session in Parliament, the Prime Minister called for the Opposition to cut out this attitude against Police Commissioner Gafà, arguing that every such comment ""sheds a really bad light against the entirety of the police corps"" and is disrespectful to all its members. Abela also said that he can sustain his comments through his experience as lawyer to police.
 PN's Shadow Minister for Home Affairs, Darren Carabott, formally interrupted Abela's intervention to describe the erupted outrage over Gafà's new six-figure salary. Speaker of the House Anġlu Farrugia rejected the PN MP's call that a point of order had been conducted by the Prime Minister.
 At this instance, PM Abela stated that through Carabott's comment, everyone is able to see that he in fact needs to defend the police against PN's verbal attacks. Abela argued that all attacks against Gafà are attacks against all police since he is the figurehead of the whole police force.
 Similarly, the Prime Minister said that the active government has been very supportive to the disciplined forces through several offered initiatives and more opportunities, ""unlike the Opposition, who at every opportunity has attempted to belittle them.""
 Later in the plenary session, PN's Joe Giglio stated that he, on behalf of the Nationalist Party, has never attacked Police Commissioner Angelo Gafà as a person amidst all its criticisms against the Police Force's operations.
 ""God forbid we don't let our voices be heard when we believe they should be,"" he said.
 He also remarked that the Bill currently in discussion - which refers to amendments in the Criminal Code that should invoke greater deterrents against persons who opt to resort to violence - will be fruitless to avoid physical altercations with police if the government does not invest in the disciplined forces training, resources, and overall work.
 PN's Ivan Castillo later said it is ""shameful"" that the Prime Minister would ""continue lying"" after Carabott's point of order.
 ""It is shameful that the government would insist that the Opposition is somehow showing disrespect to the police,"" Castillo said.
 PL backbencher Michael Farrugia supported the Prime Minister's comments and agreed on the sense of disrespect referred to earlier through the Opposition's criticisms. He also noted that ""what was said was far from the truth.""
 Farrugia spoke of scaremongering inside Parliament before remarking that the police must be working well, and be empowered to do so, if crime rates continue to decrease year after year.
 He then concluded that respect to the police by the parties can be seen in how each respective party's administration prioritised the Force's working conditions, speaking negatively on PN's time in power. Farrugia said that under the Nationalist Party's administration, working conditions were far worse than they are now. He described that there was great injustice years ago when the PN government refused to pay for all the extra hours' worth of overtime worked by police officers.
 ""It had to be the Labour Party for all the injustices that were taken against workers, including against the police, were compensated for,"" Farrugia said, ""That is respect.""

 We need a reality check on what we want for the future of our country, Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech said on Sunday.
 In an interview on party media, Grech said that he is concerned with the amount of young people saying that they do not want to live in Malta anymore.
 He said that in total 70% of the nation’s youth are considering leaving the island, adding that this situation is the result of the Labour Party’s economic plan based on cheap labour.  Grech said that apart from robbing youths of their opportunities, Prime Minister Robert Abela’s government has also adopted the politics of theft in other departments, such as the nation’s quality of life and sense of security and peace of mind.
 On these points, the leader said during the most recent power cuts, Energy Minister Miriam Dalli said that they were being caused by the overheating tarmac however “at the same time was also telling us to not use our air-conditions.”
 Delving into the topic of the politics adopted by the PL, Grech said that even Finance Minister Clyde Caruana “who was one of the few decent people [in the PL] who were trying to say the right thing” was caught lying.
 The PN leader was referring to recent news that apart from his €21,500 monthly salary Air Malta’s Executive Chairman receives a director's fee of €10,000 each year.
 Going back to the cheap labour based economic plan, Grech said that “I have nothing against foreigners” but that the government has “in the last years increased the population, without investing in the country’s infrastructure,” which in turn has increased traffic.
 Moreover “our country is in a bad state, wherever you see there is dirt.” Hence, he said that the nation is doing its job to separate the waste, but that the government is not enforcing its collection.
 “We need an authentic government, that is mature and serious…a safe pair of hands”, he said, “and a Prime Minister which has the heart of the nation as his priority.”
 Here he said that the PN always had a plan. Grech reminded how it was a Nationalist government which brought new economic niches such as iGaming and the pharmaceutical industry.
 Moreover, the PN had also asked institutions to develop a programme of studies which would cater for when LufthansaTechnik was going to start operating. 
 Bearing witness to the PN’s past planning, Grech spoke of how despite not having the skilled human resources, the previous PN administration did not see resorting to foreign workers as their first priority as the Maltese youth started to get skilled through educational courses.
 “Like this, the Maltese youth were guaranteed a job as soon as they left their educational institution,” he said.
 “It is clear that Robert Abela, has given up on governing and does not want to look at the people,” he said, adding that these were also the same words that late Jean Paul Sofia’s parents had told him in parliament after the government initially voted against a public inquiry into the tragic construction death.
 Moreover, he said that currently the PL is having “some big internal problems” of which even the biggest labourites are well aware of as they write about it on their social media.

 As the Hungarian Prime Minister ended his speech inside the chamber, a number in attendance began clapping and singing the famous ""Bella Ciao"" chant, temporarily stalling the proceedings in the process.
 After around 20 seconds of this chanting, Metsola exerted her role as European Parliament President, stating that ""This is not the Eurovision,"" in order to stop the disruption. Visibly stifling a laugh, Metsola demanded present officials to ""respect the dignity of this House"" as European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen was next to take the floor and speak.  Orbàn had just presented Hungary's priorities for its Presidency over the Council of the European Union when this scene erupted in Strasbourg. Hungary holds this EU Presidency till the end of 2024.
 ""Bella Ciao"" is an Italian song that originated from Italian resistance fighters in their fight against Nazi Germany's occupying troops during the Second World War.
 Hungary's Orbàn is the leader of the right-wing Fidesz party in Hungarian government - the Hungarian Prime Minister has faced many criticisms throughout the years over his political beliefs.

 In a press conference on Saturday, ADPD Chairperson Sandra Gauci criticised the government's delayed response to safety concerns in the construction sector, particularly in light of another fatality just one week ago. Gauci condemned the  resignation of Jesmond Muscat, CEO of the Building and Construction Authority, as a reactive measure rather than a proactive solution to systemic issues.
  Gauci emphasised the need for accountability at the ministerial level, calling for the resignation of Ministers Stefan Zrinzo Azzopardi, Silvio Schembri, and Miriam Dalli. She criticised the lack of political maturity and urged government officials to take responsibility for their actions.
 Janet Zahra Walker, ADPD candidate for the Pietà local council, emphasised the importance of addressing safety risks posed by derelict buildings, advocating for immediate repairs to prevent harm to residents and passers-by.
 Walker also called attention to critical public projects in Pietà, such as the passageway from St Luke’s Hospital to the local primary school, stressing the need for safety measures to prevent accidents. Additionally, she urged the timely completion of the roundabout project opposite St Luke’s Hospital, including the installation of public conveniences.
 Zahra Walker highlighted the importance of better accessibility and maintenance of pavements and open spaces, emphasising the need for improved street lighting and cleaner streets. She underscored the urgency of electing a new council in Pietà, where she is contesting. 
 Mina Jack Tolu, ADPD candidate for the European Parliament, stressed the importance of public inquiries and local council involvement in ensuring building safety.

PL MP Alex Muscat denies allegations made by whistleblower - The Malta Independent ,independent,https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2023-08-24/local-news/PL-MP-Alex-Muscat-denies-allegations-made-by-Whistleblower-6736254320,24-08-2023,000235.png,"

 PL MP Alex Muscat has denied allegations that were made by a man who alleged that ID cards belonging to deceased foreign-born Maltese citizens were given to other foreign residents for them to vote for the Labour Party in the last election.
 A former Labour Party activist has claimed knowledge of kickbacks in an illegal identity and citizenship scheme, and has come forward to tell a Maltese court of law all he knows about an allegedly criminal ruse.
 In the court application, the former activist claims ID cards belonging to deceased foreign-born Maltese citizens were given to other foreign residents, for them to vote for the Labour Party.
 Adel Ali Hassan claims his residence permit was revoked in October 2021 after having refused to assist the then-minister responsible for identity and citizenship, Alex Muscat, in his electoral campaign for 2022. Hassan, a one-time Labour activist, ostensibly refused to give assistance to Muscat because his complaints about corruption inside the Transport Malta testing and licensing section, where he had been employed, had fallen on deaf ears.
 In a Facebook post, Alex Muscat has said that the allegations made by Hassan are baseless, and said that people known to be from the PN establishment are helping him.

Sacked Transport Malta CEO to be made Ambassador to the Netherlands,theshiftnews,https://theshiftnews.com/2023/07/24/sacked-transport-malta-ceo-to-be-made-ambassador-to-the-netherlands/,24-07-2023,000242.png,"Jeffrey Curmi, the former Armed Forces of Malta Commander who was sacked last March from his post as Transport Malta CEO, will be moving abroad on a new political appointment as Malta’s new Ambassador to the Netherlands.
 The appointment, which is to still be formally endorsed by Parliament, is a compromise the Office of the Prime Minister found to appease the former Brigadier.
 While he has no diplomatic experience, except for sporadic interaction with his EU counterparts in his former capacity as AFM Commander, Curmi and his family will be moving to the Netherlands later this year.
 His ambassadorial benefits will include his residence in a posh residential area in The Hague, transport and private schooling for his children, among several other perks.
 The post of Malta’s Ambassador to The Hague is considered a very comfortable posting in diplomatic circles as the island’s mission there is not considered busy or of any significant importance except for the handling of day-to-day relations with the small EU member state.
 Curmi’s new overseas posting comes weeks after an acrimonious fall-out with Transport Minister Aaron Farrugia.
 Appointed in June 2022 on Prime Minister Robert Abela’s instruction, the outgoing AFM commander was placed on a €115,000 a year contract for three years at Transport Malta with a mission to “clear the mess” left behind at the regulator by the former minister responsible for transport, Ian Borg.
 His relations with Minister Farrugia soured when the latter began blaming Curmi for increasing traffic chaos.
 During his short stint at Transport Malta, Curmi was also faced with new scandals including driving licences corruption allegations, which also date back to the time when Borg was responsible.
 The Shift has reported that following information leaked by the government that Curmi was asked to tender his resignation last March, he refused, and sought the Prime Minister’s intervention.
 Transport Malta sources had told The Shift that Curmi was insisting he had no intention of moving out if the government did not pay him for the remaining two years of his contract or be given a new government post.
 Abela’s solution was to name Curmi as Ambassador to the Netherlands but to make this possible, Foreign Minister Ian Borg transferred the current ambassador in The Hague, career diplomat Mark Pace, to Canada.
 Curmi made headlines as soon as Labour was returned to power in 2013 when he received four consecutive accelerated promotions within just six months to become Brigadier.
 On the eve of the 2017 elections, along with now Identity Malta CEO Mark Mallia, Curmi was responsible for 885 Army promotions, some of which were handed out on ballot day.

Glenn Micallef to face MEP grilling on 4 November - The Malta Independent ,independent,https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2024-10-10/local-news/Glenn-Micallef-to-face-MEP-grilling-on-4-November-6736264784,10-10-2024,000255.png,"
                
        

         Glenn Micallef will be among the first nominees to the European executive to be grilled by a parliamentary committee of MEPs on 4 November, ahead of a general vote in the plenary.
 His sitting is scheduled on the same day and time as that of Slovakia's Marus Sefkovic.
 Micallef has been assigned as commissioner-designate for intergenerational solidarity, youth, culture, and sport, and will be taking questions in a three-hour session from MEPs from the lead committee Culture and Education, but other MEPs from the committees covering employment and social affairs, civil liberties, justice and home affairs, and legal affairs will also be present.  Micallef, a former head of secretariat at the Office of the Prime Minister, has never occupied a ministerial post or been an MP, a situation that led to Prime Minister Robery Abela being harshly criticised for his choice. Micallef was Abela's second option, as the nomination of former deputy prime minister Chris Fearne had already been made public until the latter was charged in court in connection with the hospitals' magisterial inquiry.
 Malta was listed as being among the losers in the list of portfolios assigned by Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. The government lobbied to obtain the post of Commissioner for the Mediterranean, which went to Croatia.
 The hearings will take place between 4 and 12 November, and a formal acceptance or otherwise of the nominees will be announced at the end of the hearings.

"PN slams ‘disgusting, dangerous, irresponsible’ PM for ‘exploiting’ Karl Gouder’s death - The Malta Independent ",independent,https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2024-12-01/local-news/PN-slams-disgusting-dangerous-and-irresponsible-PM-for-exploiting-Karl-Gouder-s-death-6736266197,01-12-2024,000258.png,"
                
        

         The Nationalist Party has slammed Prime Minister Robert Abela for “exploiting” the death of Karl Gouder in a political speech on Sunday, saying that the PL leader’s behaviour is “disgusting, dangerous, and irresponsible”
 In his Sunday speech, Abela said that the PN had set a “trap” for the PL when the party invited him and senior party officials for a coffee.   From there, Abela said, that PN had reported him as being implicated in the death of an individual, and he had been summoned to testify in recent days.  Abela did not name the individual concerned, but the PN said in a statement that he was referring to Karl Gouder – a former PN MP and the head of the party’s media wing, who passed away tragically earlier this year.
 In a statement issued soon after Abela’s speech, the PN said that it “strongly and categorically condemns Robert Abela's speech during a Labour Party political event, where he exploited the tragic death of the beloved Karl Gouder to save himself and divert attention from the scandals perpetrated by his Government.”
 “Robert Abela’s behaviour is disgusting, dangerous, and irresponsible, aimed solely at deflecting attention from the corruption he and his Ministers are drowning in,” the PN said.
 The party said that Abela “is willing to discard anyone and exploit everything and everyone, including the tragic death of the beloved Karl Gouder, to cling to the seat of power. Robert Abela shows no respect for anyone, not even for the deceased and their families.”
 The PN reiterated its full solidarity with the family of the late Karl Gouder and once again urged those of goodwill who have relevant information to pass it directly to the Magistrate leading the inquiry.
 “The PN will not allow Robert Abela to use a tragic death to divert attention from his Government's scandals,” it added.
 
In a statement issued in response, the PL said that what is truly scandalous is that where maturity should have prevailed, Grech had resorted to “dangerous and vindictive tactics to try and take political advantage.”
 The Prime Minister, the PL said, had mentioned what is a fact: that after being invited for a coffee at the PN’s HQ, Bernard Grech reported the Prime Minister to the inquiring magistrate and tried to implicate him in the death of a person.
 The party noted that Abela had been careful not to mention any names in his speech out of respect of the family, but it was the PN itself which had identified which inquiry Abela was referring to – “thereby confirming what the Prime Minister said.”
 “Our country should never stoop to this level,” the party concluded.

Cassola wants Fisheries Minister’s event investigated for breach of ethics,theshiftnews,https://theshiftnews.com/2023/07/06/cassola-wants-fisheries-ministers-event-investigated-for-breach-of-ethics/,06-07-2023,"000261.png,000262.png","Independent politician Arnold Cassola has called on the Commissioner for Standards on Public Life Joseph Azzopardi to investigate Parliamentary Secretary for Fisheries Alicia Bugeja Said for a breach of ethics in an upcoming event she is hosting in her personal capacity for Ministry employees, in a letter sent on Wednesday.
 Bugeja Said’s event, “Swimming with Tuna” is slated for Friday 7 July and will see ministry employees taking part during office hours given the event starts at 2:30pm.
 In his letter, Cassola argued that such an event constitutes a clear breach of ethics and a conflict of interest given that such an event could only be hosted in collaboration with the fish-farming industry, of which Bugeja Said is the regulator.
 An invitation to the event sent to ministry employees on Monday by the ministry itself is emblazoned with Bugeja Said’s personal logo, which she uses for campaigning, with no mention of the ministry itself.
 The invitation states that the event is in aid of abandoned animals and suggests a donation of €10.
 Cassola said that while the event’s scope is ostensibly positive, “the end goal is political exposure”. He also noted that the breach of ethics is compounded by the fact that Bugeja Said used ministry data – the employees’ email addresses – for self-promotion.
 The event is not the first case of conflicting interests for Bugeja Said, given that one of the Fisheries Junior Minister’s donors was Azzopardi Fisheries.
 Chief Justice Emeritus Joseph Azzopardi was appointed Standards Commissioner last March through a controversial ‘anti-parliamentary deadlock’ legislation passed covertly two days after last Christmas.
 The new legislation allowed the commissioner to be appointed through a simple majority vote, given that the previously required two-thirds consensus was not reached.
 This meant that the government freely chose a commissioner without the need for consensus with the Opposition.
 Azzopardi’s first decision as Commissioner last March, in response to another letter by Cassola calling on him to investigate Tourism Minister Clayton Bartolo for obscuring public documents, was to forego the investigation, calling it unmerited.

European elections: From 1979 to 2024,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/ewropej/128944/european_elections_from_1979_to_2024,04-05-2024,"000275.png,000276.png,000277.png,000278.png,000279.png","The first pan-European elections to elect the European Parliament were held in June 1979, making the institution the first supranational international assembly directly elected by the people.
 European elections are held every five years and the upcoming election is the 10th to be held over a span of 45 years.
 Maltese voters and EU nationals living in Malta who registered to vote here, will cast their ballot on Saturday 8 June. However, elections across the 27 member states will be held between the 6 and 9 June.
 MaltaToday takes a look at the elections held since 1979 to elect the European Parliament, which has expanded gradually over time to take into account the inclusion of new member states.
  1979
 The European Parliament becomes the world’s first directly elected international assembly. More than 185 million voters in nine countries that formed the European Community were called on to vote. The election was held on 10 June, marking a historic moment for European democracy. The turnout was 62%.
 The first session of the new European Parliament was held at the Palais de l’Europe in Strasbourg, France. MEPs chose Simone Veil as President of the European Parliament.
 The parliament consisted of 410 seats and women made up 16% of MEPs. After Greece joined the EEC in 1981, the parliamentary seats increased to 434, allowing Greek MEPs to take up their seats.
 1984
 The second election saw 434 MEPs being elected across 10 countries. The turnout was 59%. Women made up 18% of elected officials. The Socialist Group emerged as the largest grouping with 130 seats, followed by the European People’s Party with 110 seats. By the end of the five-year term the parliament had grown to 518 seats to cater for the accession of Portugal and Spain in January 1986.
 1989
 The election was held in 12 countries and the turnout was 58%. Representation of women increased marginally to 19%. The parliament consisted of 518 seats and its size remained so throughout the five-year term. The Socialist Group emerged as the largest with 198 seats, followed by the EPP with 162 seats.
  1994
 The election was held in 12 countries and 567 seats were up for grabs after parliament was expanded to take into account Germany’s unification that happened in 1990 after the fall of the Berlin Wall. By the time the five-year term came to an end, the EP consisted of 626 seats to take into account the accession of Sweden, Austria and Finland in 1995. Just over a quarter (26%) of MEPs were women. Turnout for the election was 57%.
 1999
 Now a bloc made up of 15 countries, the EP election was held in June and 626 seats were up for grabs. The turnout continued to decrease and reached 50%. Female representation increased to 30%. The EPP emerged as the largest party with 232 seats, followed by the Party of European Socialists with 180 seats. The Treaty of Nice that came into force in February 2003 to prepare for the bloc’s largest expansion in 2004 when eight eastern European countries and two Mediterranean islands – Malta and Cyprus – joined the union.
 2004
 Elections were held across 25 countries, including Malta. Turnout across the bloc was 45%. Female representation remained relatively unchanged at 31%. Europeans elected 732 MEPs, with the EPP emerging as the largest grouping with 268 seats, followed by the Socialist Group with 200 seats. Parliament expanded to 785 seats after Bulgaria and Romania joined the bloc and held European elections in 2007.
  Malta was allotted five seats, with the Labour Party electing three MEPs and the Nationalist Party electing two.
 2009
 Elections were held in 27 countries and the turnout continued to decrease to reach 43%. Europeans elected 736 MEPs with the EPP maintaining its supremacy with 265 seats, followed by the Socialists and Democrats with 184 seats. Female representation increased to 35%. The election was held under the old rules, which meant Malta had five seats to its name. The PL won three seats against the PN’s two. However, when the Lisbon Treaty came into force Malta was allotted an extra seat, which was won by the PL. Croatia joined the EU in 2013 with its MEPs joining the parliament soon after.
 2014
 Elections were held in 28 countries and the turnout remained at a dismal 43%. Europeans elected 751 MEPs and female representation notched up to 37%. The EPP retained its primacy with 221 seats, followed by the S&D with 191 seats. This was the first election in Malta for six seats. The PL and PN won three seats each.
 2019
 This election, held across 28 countries, saw the turnout increase to 51%. Europeans elected 751 MEPs and female representation increased to 41%. The EPP emerged as the largest grouping with 182 seats, followed by the S&D with 154 seats, and the liberal Renew coming in third with 108 seats. When the UK exited the EU in January 2020, the 73 UK MEPs vacated their seats. 27 of these vacated seats were reassigned to 14 other member states, while the remaining 46 were set aside for future allocations should new member states join the EU. In Malta, the PL won four seats and the PN won two.
 In January 2022, Maltese MEP Roberta Metsola was elected to serve as EP president following the death of incumbent David Sassoli. She became the youngest ever president, the first Maltese to hold the office and the first female president since 2002.
  2024
 The election is to be held between 6 and 9 June in 27 member states. In Malta, the European election will be held on Saturday 8 June with an option for early voting a week before. Voters in each of the 27 member states will be electing a total of 720 MEPs. Malta is allotted six MEPs.

In it, we see the party candidates gathered around the television speaking to some young people on a Zoom call, and gearing up for some outdoor activities (and a cynical Jesmond Marshall who would rather do otherwise). They’re doing obstacle courses! Horseback riding! And they don’t have a bed for everyone. Now it’s really starting to give Love Island vibes, but hopefully without the 7 Days Croissants and Camel-brand dip.
  Muscat rallies the crowds: Joseph Muscat is  gearing up for his arraignment next week. Last night he was the guest speaker at an activity organised by Clint Azzopardi Flores, and tonight he will be addressing the crowd at an event by Alex Agius Saliba. On Friday, Muscat will also attend Daniel Attard’s rally in Bormla. And on Saturday, Muscat will be at Marija Sara Vella Gafa’s morning activity. He also recorded a small video message praising the MEP hopeful. So, is Joseph Muscat now taking bookings? Does he do weddings and funerals? I’m curious to see his rates.
  Cassola’s banners: Independent candidate Arnold Cassola does not fear the banner bandits. On Tuesday, several banners were set up across Malta to promote his campaign under the new tagline “Issa ċ-Ċans” (Now’s the chance). In a small statement to the press, Cassola thanked his young volunteers who have been contributing to his campaign and said Maltese people are looking forward to breaking the PNPL duopoly. “Such aims are truly achievable. The excitement is palpable!” he said.  
  Local council-watch: This will absolutely not be a recurring feature of the Playbook, but since we had two local council-related news stories on Tuesday, we’re taking the opportunity. The first story concerns  Santa Venera mayor Stephen Sultana, who is recontesting the election this year, and who was also acquitted of drunk and dangerous driving charges after the court found insufficient evidence against him. The court also doubted the credibility of the LESA officers who accused Sultana, noting his prior complaints about their dereliction of duty. In a second story,  Floriana PN councillor James Aaron Ellul called for proper maintenance and appreciation of his locality’s neglected Jubilee Grove, expressing concerns about mysterious red markings on the trees that could indicate severe pruning or removal.
 What’s happening today?: The Labour Party will be in Balzan at 5:15pm, in Attard at 5:45pm, and in Ħamrun at 6:30pm. The Nationalist Party will in be in Santa Venera at the same time.  ",Nicole Meilak ,Politics
[WATCH] Abela doubles down on ‘political terrorism’ remarks: Magistrate purposely chose start of election campaign to conclude inquiry,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/national/128919/watch_abela_doubles_down_on_political_terrorism_remarks_magistrate_purposely_chose_start_of_election_campaign_to_conclude_inquiry,29-04-2024,000292.png,"Updated at 9pm with PN reaction 
 Prime Minister Robert Abela has doubled down on his comments where he had warned the judiciary not to commit “political terrorism.” 
 On Sunday, without mentioning Joseph Muscat, Abela explicitly noted, “Justice does not mean political terrorism,” amid growing speculation within legal circles that the magistrate responsible for the hospitals inquiry has passed on her findings to the Attorney General. 
 On Monday, MaltaToday asked Abela what he was referring to in his comments, as he noted that he was speaking in a general manner about the judiciary system. He reminded that a few months ago, he had warned against a “particular investigation” being used to disrupt next June’s elections.
 Abela further stated that if it is true that the inquiring magistrate concluded her inquiry into the hospitals concession on the day that candidates could declare their interest to contest next June’s elections, then he was “obliged” to speak in the manner that he did.
 When asked directly if he would consider recommendations to charge Muscat as “poiltical terrorism,” Abela replied that he would not speak about hypothetical cases.
 “No one is a fool,” Abela noted, as he spoke about his suspicions regarding the conclusion of the inquiry.
 Abela was then asked if he thought his comments on Sunday were meant to instigate supporters, to which he responded that he disagreed.
  The Prime Minister then said that on Wednesday morning, the Attorney General is going to testify whether or not the conclusions had been recieved. “Tomorrow morning we’ll know the day that proces verbal, then everyone will come to their own conclusions.”
 Abela said that he is convinced that the Maltese people are intelligent enough to “come to their own conclusions.”
 The inquiry was initiated in 2019 on Repubblika’s initiative. The inquiry originally targeted former ministers Chris Cardona, Konrad Mizzi and Edward Scicluna but later widened to include Muscat.
 Muscat had tried to remove the magistrate from the inquiry, insisting she had a conflict because her relatives were publicly critical of him. He also complained of constant leaks from the inquiry and decried the magistrate’s refusal to let him testify before her.
 In January 2022, as part of the inquiry, police officers searched Muscat’s Burmarrad home and ceased several electronic devices.
 Nationalist Party reaction
 Reacting to Abela's comments, the Nationalist Party (PN) stated that Robert Abela's latest attack on the judiciary marks a concerning trend.
 They said Abela persists in undermining the judiciary's independence and its efforts to investigate police shortcomings over the years.
 It criticised Abela's remarks on the Inquiring Magistrate as irresponsible and dangerous, emphasizing that his actions contradict his oath of office as Prime Minister.
 They condemned Abela's attempts to interfere with the constitutional duties of Prosecutors and Magistrates, labelling it as a betrayal of the Maltese and Gozitan people's trust in upholding truth and justice.
 The PN called for an end to Abela's attacks on the judiciary and urged him to respect the institutions' autonomy in fulfilling their mandates without interference.  ",Matthew Farrugia ,Politics
Opinion: Abela’s biggest threat,theshiftnews,https://theshiftnews.com/2024/04/11/abelas-biggest-threat/,11-04-2024,000297.png,"Robert Abela can’t hide his authoritarian instincts. He was asked about President Spiteri Debono’s expressed view that the media should be enshrined in the constitution as the fourth pillar of democracy. That was enough to trigger him.
 “It’s not just a matter of putting journalism as the fourth pillar of our democracy in the constitution; to get to that point, there must be the safeguards, those obligations that the other pillars have,” he announced.
 “All three pillars of democracy have a regulatory framework that regulates them – what duties, what responsibilities they have, their accountability, the transparency they need to show,” he added.
 “The three pillars exert checks and balances on each other.  Each one of those pillars checks and scrutinises the others.  Any new pillar added will have regulatory obligations and scrutiny and a regulatory framework,” he threatened.
 That is what Abela really aspires to – a media landscape that looks like Russia’s, where only government-friendly media organisations survive.  The rest are driven out, pushed into bankruptcy, or intimidated into submissive compliance.
 Abela has made no secret of his intention to stifle the independent media. He’s using a carrot-and-stick approach to achieve his objective – permitting only media outlets to sing his praises, laud his greatness, and applaud his wisdom.
 There is no place for proper investigative journalism and critical opinions in Abela’s world.
 He bragged that he drafted an anti-SLAPP law that is stronger than the EU directive to protect journalists.  He announced he wants the EU directive to be implemented as soon as possible. Yet he’s the one who’s directed his ministries and entities to launch 40 different SLAPPs on one small online media house – The Shift.
 Abela put Malta at the top of the table of EU countries with the most SLAPPs per capita.
 Having rejected 40 different FOI requests, Abela challenged the Information and Data Protection Officer’s decision that the requested information should be made public.  When even the Tribunal upheld those decisions, Abela directed his ministries and entities to fight the Tribunal’s decisions in court.  He’s lost all the cases that have been decided. He knows he’ll lose the rest.
 Those cases cost the country tens of thousands of euros in legal fees and court expenses.  Instead of humbly withdrawing those court cases, Abela persists.  His intention is clear.  He wants to cripple The Shift to stop it continuing to expose his government’s slew of scandals. If he could, he’d shut The Shift down.
 That is the real Robert Abela, a man with a fundamentally autocratic psyche.
 The irony is that all 40 cases are meant to conceal how many millions the government paid Saviour Balzan out of our taxes. That’s the other tactic Abela uses.  He’s buying out some media houses while financially ruining others.
 Government advertising allocation remains opaque, with funds distributed based on media houses’ compliance with government wishes. Cash-strapped media organisations know they must tread carefully to avoid losing their financial lifeline from Abela’s government.
 Abela is obsessed with control, scrutiny, responsibilities, obligations, accountability, and transparency for media organisations. That’s why he wants them shackled with a ‘regulatory framework’ and “checks and balances” for the media. It’s not because he wants responsible, honest, critical journalism. It’s because he can’t tolerate it.
 If he wanted responsible journalism, he could have transformed his own party’s media organisation – ONE. Instead of wielding it as a weapon of intimidation, harassment, and persecution of government critics, he would insist they endorse a proper code of ethics and maintain standards of honesty and integrity, at least in their news bulletins.
 If he valued professional journalism, he would insist on balanced reporting, a modicum of fairness and adherence to the facts. He’s had plenty of time to sort ONE out.  He hasn’t.
 Instead, he’s captured the state broadcaster and steadily and swiftly transformed it into another ONE, placing party loyalists at its helm and ensuring that it is as biased and partisan as his own party station.
 As for regulation, we know exactly what he means.  The broadcast media is regulated by the phoney Broadcasting Authority (BA). But all the authority does is breach human rights and the constitution through its utter failure to impose impartiality on PBS.
 The constitutional court found that the BA breached Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights dealing with freedom of expression and Article 45 of the Constitution. The BA is meant to protect the public from biased and partisan reporting.  Instead, it’s breaching our human rights.
 Its decisions are perverse and illogical. They fined RTK €6,410 because Andrew Azzopardi said he would not allow Norman Lowell on his programme.  That BA decision was labelled “a threat to free speech” by Aditus and the Daphne Caruana Galizia Foundation.
 That’s no surprise.  Sitting on the Committee reaching those oppressive decisions are Frans Ghirxi, former editor of L-Orizzont, who was fined 20,000 euros for falsely linking two former ministers, Louis Galea and Ninu Zammit, to drug running, and Alessandro Lia, son of Joseph Muscat’s personal lawyer Pawlu Lia, and who is  undergoing criminal proceedings, details of which cannot be reported because of a court-imposed ban.
 The five-man BA panel is chaired by Frank Farrugia, whose background is in business and who is obliged to Labour for his multiple appointments. In addition to being BA chair, he sits on Malta Enterprise and Jobs Plus Boards. He also sat on the board that approved the Corradino project, where Jean Paul Sofia lost his life.
 Robert Abela wants to subject the media to that sort of regulatory body. Instead of maximising press freedom, he wants to scrutinise, regulate, control, and stifle the press.
 America’s founding fathers wrote the freedom of the press into the Bill of Rights because they rightly recognised that without a free press, the people cannot make the right political decisions. Robert Abela wants to destroy the free press because, without it, Labour knows it will remain in government for good.

 ""On behalf of the PN and on his own behalf, PN Leader Bernard Grech this morning conveyed his condolences directly to the family of Karl Gouder. He paid tribute to Karl as a personal friend and a dedicated individual who held various important roles both within the structures of Partit Nazzjonalista and in its media,"" a PN statement read.  ""Karl will always be remembered by the PN as a person of principle who constantly sought how he could do good for others. His leadership in every role he occupied was always based on what was right and how improvements could be made. From his youth, Karl held various roles as his activism was always a means to make a difference.""
  ""Karl held various positions in student organisations, within the country, and within Nationalist Party, but he never sought these positions; rather, it was those who saw in him a person capable of providing guidance and direction who encouraged him to take on such roles. This also prepared him when he decided to run for the position of PN Secretary General. The experience he gained over the years, all his knowledge, and his energy were being channelled into this new role.""
 Among the roles that Karl Gouder carried out with competence were Mayor of St. Julian's, Partit Nazzjonalista MP, Chief Operations Officer of NET Media, and, more recently, Campaign Manager for the European Parliament and Local Council elections held last June.
 ""At this moment, our thoughts are with Karl's family,"" the PN statement read. 
 NET Television will honour his memory with a special programme, which will be broadcast this evening at 5:30pm.

 Speaking at a press conference on Saturday morning, PN leader Bernard Grech said that he was determined to build a new national PN majority, continuing the trend which he said ,clearly emerges from the results of last week’s European Parliamentary and Local Council elections.
  “The PN has gained 6 new local councils and lost one, and now has 24 local councils in its hands,” Grech said. Adding Birkirkara and Mellieha, where the PN won the majority of votes, but not of seats, would increase the number of PN councils to 8, he said, “a majority in 26 councils.”
 Labour lost 9 of the local councils it previously controlled and had gained one, Grech said.
 PN reduced the gap between the parties by 26,861 votes, added the PN leader. The difference between the two major parties now stands at 20,155, he said, adding that Labour’s lead had been slashed in half : from 18.1% to 7.8%  - a decrease of 10.3%, and its total number of votes had been reduced by 52%.
 20 local council seats had been gained by the PN, reducing the gap to 27 seats. Grech said that this figure was yet to be broadcast on the national TV station, “because they are still trying to hide it.”
 He reeled off a list of localities where the PN now held a majority of local council seats:  St Paul's Bay, Fontana, San Gwann, Siggiewi, Mosta, Zebbug in Gozo and for the first time in 21 years -Msida, amongst them. The party now also holds a relative majority - meaning it received the most votes but still less than 50%, in Birkirkara and Mellieha, added Grech. This was due to the election of independent candidates in those localities.
 An increase in PN seats had also been recorded, he said, in the Birzebbugia, Hamrun, Lija, Qrendi, Munxar, Xewkija, Zurrieq, St. Paul’s Bay, Xaghara and San Gwann councils.
 “Even with respect to these, PBS, which is run on your taxes, isn’t giving you this information.” he said.
 The PN had lost a total of 5 seats in three localities, he said. Bormla, Ghasri and Kirkop, but now has a majority representation in 24 local councils, when compared to the 19 it controlled in 2010. 
 Labour had lost its majority in 8 councils in the same period of time and had lost seats in many other councils, Grech said.“It is clear that the PN is succeeding in bringing back votes it had lost to Labour. The people are recognising that the PN can be an alternative government to get Malta out of the problems the Labour government had put it in.” When asked by a reporter whether he felt that the PN was now ready to govern Malta, Grech  replied in the affirmative.
 He stressed the importance of unity and respect both amongst the Nationalist party and amongst the wider electorate. It was important to recognise each other’s humanity, Grech said. 
 “Even those of you who do not see the PN as an alternative government, I want to work with you too to find a way forward. You can disagree with us, but you can still work with us,” he said, borrowing former Labour Prime Minister’s Joseph Muscat’s catchphrase.
 Many of those who had not voted had taken heart after seeing Labour’s lead in the polls so drastically reduced, he said.
 Grech ended the press conference with an Obama-esque soundbite set to rousing music. “Everyone has value. You have a value. You made choices for the country and gave a new hope to the people. You can also give new hope in the general elections. Let us work together. The country is waiting for you.”

"Ian Borg’s man at Transport Malta steps down, remains at agency on full pay",theshiftnews,https://theshiftnews.com/2023/05/23/ian-borgs-man-at-transport-malta-steps-down-remains-at-agency-on-full-pay/,23-05-2023,000324.png,"Minister Ian Borg’s lasting hold on Transport Malta has been loosened with ousting of one of his key officials from a top position at the beleaguered regulator and agency, The Shift can report.
 The Shift is informed that it was on the direct instructions of the Prime Minister that Transport Malta’s new CEO Jonathan Borg ordered deputy CEO and COO Kevin Farrugia to step down with immediate effect.
 Farrugia, who was appointed to one of the top jobs at the agency in 2018 by then-transport minister Ian Borg directly, is known to have been one of the key people at the agency that curried favour with Borg’s constituents.
 The Shift has already reported Farrugia was one of a group of individuals involved in the driving licences corruption scandal, through which recommended individuals were given licences without sitting for exams or by being given considerable assistance from examiners.
 The scam was allegedly run by Transport Malta official Clint Mansueto, who is facing criminal charges, with the help of a closely knit group of Borg’s friends including his former consultant Jesmond Zammit.
 Farrugia, former CEO Joseph Bugeja and his personal assistant  Rachel Debono, who is now working within the office of Robert Abela)  are known to have been aware of what was going on.
 Sources at Transport Malta told The Shift that Farrugia’s head has been on the block for a long time, particularly since Transport Malta was removed from Borg’s ministerial portfolio after the last election.
 The Shift is informed that instead of terminating his contract, as normally happens in such circumstances, Farrugia will be retained on Transport Malta’s payroll with a far less significant job description and with little to do.
 Sources at the authority said that Farrugia is to be transferred to administer the Foundation for Transport – a talking shop financed by the government in which the Malta Chamber of SMEs, the Malta Employers Association, MCAST and Malta Enterprise are also members.
 According to his three-year definite contract signed in 2019, Borg’s political canvasser had been placed on a salary of over €100,000 a year.
 That included a basic salary of €78,000, a performance bonus, allowances for a car and fuel, mobile and residential phones and international health insurance for himself and family members.
 His contract, which was meant to have expired in 2022, stipulates that Farrugia – an accountant and auditor by profession – is to not engage in any other work, not even part-time, apart from that at Transport Malta.

Glenn Micallef to face MEPs in committee grilling on November 4,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/ewropej/131673/glenn_micallef_to_face_meps_in_committee_grilling_on_november_4,10-10-2024,000343.png,"The Maltese commissioner-designate Glenn Micallef will be the first nominee to the European executive to be grilled by a parliamentary committee of MEPs that will assess his suitability for the role, on 4 November, ahead of a general vote in the plenary.

 As commissioner-designate for intergenerational solidarity, youth, culture, and sport, Micallef will be fielding questions from MEPs from the lead committee Culture and Education, but other MEPs from the committees covering employment and social affairs, civil liberties, justice and home affiars, and legal affairs will be present for the committee hearing.

                     The 35-year-old former head of secretariat at the Office of the Prime Minister lacks executive experience despite his knowledge of European affairs.

 Micallef will be expected to head a portfolio that focuses on the role of art and culture in improving the resilience and well-being of people and society, and supporting fairness and social inclusion, which includes both physical and mental health. Yet none of the areas have EU competence but rather mostly member state competence, which means barely any legislative acts can come out of the portfolio. Most of the funding under these sectors will still be managed by another commissioner.

 Nationalist MEP Peter Agius said the timing of Micallef’s committee hearing could bode well for the young nominee,.

 “This puts Micallef in a slightly more advantageous position as he will have a hearing in a more neutral setting, before ‘the knives are out’ – if we come to that at all – in other hearings.

 “Naturally all will depend on Mr Micallef’s competence on the portfolio at the hearing. We want competent commissioners to implement the will of the people as expressed on 8 June. We will certainly not give discounts on competence,” Agius told MaltaToday.

 Labour MEP Daniel Attard said Micallef’s portfolio on intergenerational fairness would provide a crucial long-term perspective on these and many other challenges.

 “When you consider that some of the most pressing European debates revolve around climate change, high debt ratios in numerous economies, and the risks of conflict on the continent, creating a portfolio focused on intergenerational fairness within the European Commission is truly a forward-thinking initiative.”

 Attard added that it was paradoxical to require extensive political experience for a role that is inherently meant to represent the interests of the younger generation.

 “Glenn is an excellent candidate for this position because, while he possesses valuable experience navigating the political corridors of Brussels and knows the political process inside-out, he is also a representative of the younger generation – bringing fresh ideas and the representation of a generation of people who will live with the long-term consequences of today’s politics.”

 Calendar for the hearings of Commissioners-designate.

 The hearings will take place from 4 to 12 November.

 The European Parliament President and political group leaders adopted a detailed schedule of which Commissioner-designate will be heard by which committees and at which time slot.

 European Parliament leaders also adopted the written questions prepared by the different committees that Commissioners-designate should reply to by 22 October 2024.

 Each hearing will be followed by a meeting in which the Chairs of the Committees and group representatives (coordinators) concerned will evaluate the performance of the Commissioner-designate they just heard.

 After the completion of the evaluation process, the Conference of Committee Chairs will assess the outcome of all hearings and forward its recommendation to the Conference of Presidents. The latter will exchange views and decide whether to close the hearings in its meeting on 21 November; it will also decide to place the vote on the College as a whole on the plenary agenda.

 The full Commission needs to be elected by a simple majority of the votes cast in plenary, by roll call. The vote is currently scheduled to take place during the (25-28) November session in Strasbourg.     ",Matthew Vella ,Politics
Prime minister transfers yacht to friends’ marina at centre of controversy,theshiftnews,https://theshiftnews.com/2024/10/27/prime-minister-transfers-yacht-to-friends-marina-at-centre-of-controversy/,27-10-2024,"000344.png,000345.png","Prime Minister Robert Abela started using a new berth for his luxury yacht at the Gardens Marina in Ta’ Xbiex, owned by his close friends Paul and Mark Gauci, known as Tal-Gedida, from Birkirkara.
 The prime minister’s Azimut yacht was transferred from its original berth at Birgu to the Ta’ Xbiex marina a few weeks ago.
 The marina, which the Gaucis obtained through a 25-year concession from the government, is currently undergoing refurbishment through the construction of a Capitainerie, which will be turned into a restaurant and handed over to the prime minister’s friends.
 The government is proceeding with the project despite public opposition to the deal and a pending appeal.
 So far, Abela has failed to prove that he is paying for his yacht’s berth, estimated to cost some €15,000 a year.
 The prime minister did not reply to questions from The Shift about why he had moved his yacht to Ta’ Xbiex and whether he was actually paying for it or ‘allowed’ to use it by his friends.
 Abela refused to publish proof of payment in the form of invoices and bank transactions for his yacht’s berth.
 Sources close to the marina operators told The Shift that Abela’s yacht had been moored at the Gauci marina since the summer and has changed two berths so far, making it difficult to identify from shore.
 Abela’s 16-metre yacht, a 50-foot flybridge model, was manufactured by Italian boat manufacturer Azimut in 2008. It was first provisionally registered under the Maltese Shipping Register in 2020, soon after Abela became prime minister. Its registration was completed in 2021.
 Eyebrows were raised among yachting enthusiasts on the sudden presence of the prime minister’s yacht at the Ta’ Xbiex marina at the same time as B&B contractors, known as Tal-Bona, started construction work on a new Capitainerie on behalf of Transport Malta.
 It seems that public funds are being used to build the one-storey building, which will be dominated by a large water’s edge restaurant, which will be passed on to the marina’s operators upon completion
 Transport Malta CEO Kurt Farrugia has failed to reply to questions on whether the government Authority is paying for a building that the marina operators will use for commercial interests.
 Farrugia did not reply to questions on how much Transport Malta will be forking out for this project and whether a tender has been issued for the engagement of Tal-Bona contractors. No such call for tenders appears on the Authority’s website.
 The Shift reported that while the Planning Authority permit issued in 2022 for the Capitainerie was still under appeal, Transport Malta gave instructions for construction to start, contrary to Abela’s promise to stop the possibility of developing projects while they were being contested.
 In May 2023, Abela announced that the government would soon legislate on the appeal process to stop abuses. Nothing has been done while the abuse continues.

Opinion: Course correction,theshiftnews,https://theshiftnews.com/2023/08/19/opinion-course-correction/,19-08-2023,000350.png,"“If you have a proposal that’s not in line with planning policies, don’t bother submitting it. Why do developers submit applications with no chance of approval?” Robert Abela asked with a straight face
 He should ask Ian Borg, his friend and Foreign Affairs Minister. Borg applied to build a swimming pool in a rural settlement – something completely against policies.  But the Planning Authority issued the permit.
 In March 2023 Chief Justice Mark Chetcuti ruled that Borg’s permit was illegal and that the permit was issued on an entirely incorrect interpretation of planning rules. The court declared Borg’s permit “null and without effect”.
 But Borg’s swimming pool was completed by then. He’s probably frolicking in it this very minute, unbothered by the court’s decree.
 It’s been five months since Borg’s permit was declared null.  No enforcement notice has been issued. No heavy machinery entered Borg’s property to demolish his pool and return the rural settlement to its previous idyllic state.
 Robert Abela knows the answer to his hypocritical hypothetical question.  Developers submit applications with no chance of approval because they know they’ll still be approved.  They’re so certain of it that they start excavating before the permit’s even issued.
 Charles Polidano, ic-Caqnu, proceeded to illegally uproot trees, destroy rubble walls and demolish part of a 300-year-old palazzo in Balzan believed to have been used by Grand Master de Rohan. That was before a permit was even issued to develop 43 dwelling units with underground parking facilities instead of historic Balzan houses.
 That palazzo was on the national list of scheduled buildings. The rules are categorical. The PA must refuse a development application if illegalities exist on site. But what did the PA do?  It gave ic-Caqnu the permit, completely ignoring the illegalities.
 Joseph Portelli, meanwhile, admitted carrying out illegal excavation work on a protected area in Qala. He stated he’d done so because he expected to get a permit to build a swimming pool there “in the near future”. He admitted he was “wrong” but said he would “gladly pay a fine”.
 When the Zammit Tabonas hijacked prime seafront land for the Fortina hotel, developed a lido and started operating it illegally, Abela’s party went to parliament to transfer the land to the people who’d committed the illegalities.
 Instead of demolishing the illegal development, Labour proposed granting the Fortina the land for the paltry sum of €70,000. Silvio Schembri vociferously defended Fortina’s illegalities.
 Abela knows exactly why the Zammit Tabonas, Polidano and Portelli willfully commit illegalities.  He knows exactly why they apply for permits that are “non-starters”. Because they always get what they want.
 Abela dined with Joseph Portelli on the eve of the general election.  One week later Portelli was granted a permit for his  Sannat monstrosity that turned untouched land into 125 apartments.  Portelli and his partners had split the project into three different applications to avoid an Environment Impact Assessment. The PA’s original refusal was miraculously overturned after Abela’s dinner.
 Zammit Tabona regaled Labour with a massive donation  and subsequently benefited from government protection in the face of gross illegalities.
 Abela had the cheek to inaugurate ic-Caqnu’s Montekristo offices despite his catalogue of illegalities.  When  ic-Caqnu dropped a massive concrete block, obstructing the entrance to a garage complex belonging to somebody he had a dispute with, the police didn’t intervene. No action was ever taken against him.
 When he amassed a multimillion-euro tax bill, Labour conveniently negotiated favourable terms for the development mogul.
 Abela knows exactly how the PA works.  He was its chief legal advisor for years, besides being a main recipient of its funds.  The PA is nothing but a tool in Labour’s hands, ever willing to break the law to advantage some.  It suspiciously sanctioned multiple illegalities on a Zejtun property just days before Abela acquired it for peanuts. It issued a permit for development on land Abela ceded to Chris Borg for €45,000.
 When the PA allowed the Sea Malta building to be demolished, the court ruled the PA had “disregarded the law”.  The PA even ignored the Environment Commissioner at the Ombudsman’s office. It allowed the demolition without bothering to send an architect to inspect the site.  The PA argued there was no point pursuing the case since the building had already been demolished.
 The court was incensed. It decreed “it could not close the door to justice just because the PA’s illegal decision had already been implemented”.  The court recommended “those responsible should shoulder political and administrative responsibility and face disciplinary and criminal proceedings”.
 Did Abela care?  Did the police or the AG comply with the court’s order? Certainly not.
 Abela knows which side his bread is buttered on.  He’s on the developers’ side.  He’s one of them.  He’s earned hundreds of thousands of euros off his Iklin property development business partner Gilbert Bonnici, a Bonnici Brothers director.
 Abela shamelessly inaugurated Bonnici’s new Ta’ Zuta quarry, which was partly financed with undisclosed taxpayers’ funds.  Malta Enterprise refused to divulge how much Bonnici Brothers received. What we surely know is that the company was awarded €7.7 million in contracts and direct orders in Abela’s first two years alone.
 After Miriam Pace was killed beneath the rubble of her home, Abela concealed the Quintano report for months.  When forced to publish it, he set up the Building and Construction Agency but then appointed Joseph Portelli’s own architect to head it. She was forced to resign after another tragedy was narrowly averted during  reckless demolition work for which she was responsible.
 Abela failed to provide the BCA with adequate resources.  Inevitably, more tragedies followed.
 When Jean Paul Sofia suffered the same fate as Miriam Pace, Abela continued protecting the developers, resisting a public inquiry for months.  He relented only after public anger boiled over.
 Abela literally supped with the developers. He’s shielded them from the nation’s wrath, as they propped up his party’s finances, and innocent citizens died.
 Abela’s suddenly realised the tide is turning. Now he’s calling them “cowboys”. He’s correcting his course. And feigning surprise at development applications being submitted “with no chance of approval”.
 Nobody’s taken in.

Prime minister under pressure to sack two ministers over girlfriend scandal,theshiftnews,https://theshiftnews.com/2024/11/07/prime-minister-under-pressure-to-sack-two-ministers-over-girlfriend-scandal/,07-11-2024,"000352.png,000353.png,000354.png","Prime Minister Robert Abela is facing internal pressure to sack two of his most loyal cabinet ministers, caught in a massive scandal connected to the girlfriend, now wife, of Tourism Minister Clayton Bartolo.
 Apart from Bartolo, the prime minister’s advisers are also suggesting the sacking of Gozo Minister Clint Camilleri, who allegedly helped Minister Bartolo keep his girlfriend on the public payroll through a fake job for which she wasn’t qualified.
 The scandal, exposed by this newsroom in 2022 and confirmed following an investigation by the Standards Commissioner, is expected to rock the government’s credibility further, putting Abela’s diminishing hold on his ministers into question.
 While the investigative report by Standards Commissioner Joseph Azzopardi has not been published yet, Labour sources described it as “very damaging to the prime minister, the two ministers involved and the whole Labour government”.
 The Shift is informed that Justice Minister Jonathan Attard passed the report on to the prime minister several days ago, and its conclusions are “damning”.
 “Abela has a clear and difficult choice to make. Either sack his two ministers or defend them and continue to dent his government’s standing,” a PL senior official told The Shift.
 While the government has been postponing the publication of this report for days to avoid overshadowing its budget marketing campaign, it is now expected to be discussed this afternoon by parliament’s Standards in Public Life Committee.
 The same committee, headed by Speaker Anglu Farrugia, will decide whether to publish the report.
 On 1 February 2022, The Shift broke the news with an article titled ‘Tourism Minister’s Secretary and Girlfriend Shifted to Gozo Ministry Payroll to Hide Ethics Breach’.
 The Shift had been investigating the story for weeks after government sources indicated that what happened to former Education Minister Justyne Caruana was not the only case in Robert Abela’s cabinet.
 In December 2021, an investigation found Caruana in breach of ethics after she gave her boyfriend, footballer Daniel Bogdanovic, a job within her secretariat. Caruana was forced to step down after pressure from Robert Abela.
 The Shift reported that the Commissioner’s conclusions on Caruana and her resignation immediately raised red flags for ministers Clayton Bartolo and Clint Camilleri, who made a similar arrangement to circumvent ethics rules and avoid following Caruana’s path.
 The Shift revealed that while Minister Bartolo and his private secretary, Amanda Muscat, were outed to be in an extramarital relationship following a well-known embarrassing incident inside the minister’s office, Bartolo agreed with his Gozo colleague to shift, on paper, his girlfriend to Camilleri’s payroll in an attempt to avoid the same scandalous situation Caruana faced.
 At the time of the transfer, an investigation on Caruana was already in full swing, and the two ministers and the prime minister were well aware of it.
 The Shift revealed that despite the transfer on to Minister Camilleri’s books, the minister’s girlfriend continued to work with her boyfriend, whom she recently married, and never really did any work for the Gozo ministry.
 Questions sent to Minister Bartolo by The Shift in January 2022 received a terse reply insisting that “Amanda Muscat was not employed at the tourism ministry, the Gozo ministry, or any other government entity, ministry or department.”
 
 However, The Shift already had information from government servers showing that Amanda Muscat was a person of trust at the Gozo ministry while she was still acting as Minister Bartolo’s private secretary.
 Other media outlets followed The Shift’s story, while independent candidate Arnold Cassola asked the Standards Commissioner at the time, George Hyzler, to investigate.
 Although the prime minister insisted on replacing former standards commissioner George Hyzler with former chief justice and Labour candidate Joe Azzopardi, the investigation continued.
 According to the current procedure, once a report is sent to the parliament, it indicates that the individuals involved in the investigation have been found guilty of an ethics breach.
 In similar situations, such as the cases of Justyne Caruana and former Labour MP Rosianne Cutajar, Abela was faced with no option but to call for the resignation of those who breached the ethics code.
 Both ministers involved in the latest ethics breach are known to be among a handful supporting Abela in his cabinet.

 After only three months in Brussels, Labour MEP Daniel Attard appears to have already completely disconnected from the daily reality faced by the Maltese who spend long hours in traffic, the statement, signed by spokesman Mark Anthony Sammut, said.  Just last year, a study published by the Faculty for Social Wellbeing at the University of Malta showed that 97% of Maltese people believe traffic has increased considerably in the last two or three years. It seems that Labour MEP Daniel Attard and the Labour Government are among the 3% who think this is not the case, the PN said.

 In a statement on Saturday, the Chamber said politicians must lead by example and thus demonstrate a commitment to ethical standards and accountability.

  The Chamber noted that in his resignation letter Fearne highlighted the importance of political integrity, respect for democratic institutions and towards the solemn oath of office.
 “We have become accustomed to seeing private persons resign from office following inquiries that implicate public authorities, while politicians carry on business-as-usual. Fearne's resignation sets a high standard for political conduct,” the Chamber said.
 It also stressed the importance of expediting court processes now that a good number of individuals face criminal procedures.
 “Justice delayed is justice denied – it punishes the innocent and favours the guilty, and also creates unnecessary uneasiness in people’s well-being and peace of mind as well as unnecessary instability in the economic climate,” the Chamber said.
 It noted that upholding the rule of law and ensuring transparent institutions are vital for Malta's reputation, especially as an EU member state.  ",Kurt Sansone ,Politics

 The Commissioner for Standards in Public Life has dismissed allegations against Prime Minister Robert Abela and minister Jonathan Attard regarding their public statements about the magisterial inquiry into Jean Paul Sofia’s tragic death. The investigation, triggered by a complaint from Opposition MP Karol Aquilina on 19 July 2023, centred on claims that government officials had inappropriately disclosed confidential information during a press conference about an ongoing judicial inquiry. But the commissioner found no evidence of misconduct, decisively rejecting accusations of breaching statutory and ethical duties. The commissioner specifically highlighted a critical point: “It is incorrect to say (as the Prime Minister gave the impression during the press conference) that the Magistrate requested an extension of the time allowed by law to complete the report. The Magistrate does not need to make this request, but must inform the Attorney General that she will need the extension and indicate the reasons for this.” The controversy originated from a press conference on 17 July 2023, where Abela and Attard revealed that the magistrate had taken another 30-day extension for the inquiry into Sofia’s death following a fatal building collapse in Kordin on 3 December 2022. The report meticulously examined the legal framework governing judicial inquiries, specifically highlighting that magistrates are only required to inform the Attorney General about inquiry extensions. Moreover, the Attorney General holds discretionary authority over inquiry document disclosure and the report concluded that statements by Abela and Attard were consistent with standard procedural updates. Significantly, the commissioner referenced a Court of Appeal ruling emphasising that while the Attorney General has document disclosure discretion, such decisions must be based on reasonable legal considerations. The report recommended enhanced protocols for handling sensitive inquiry information, suggesting a review of legal provisions to clarify procedural boundaries for all stakeholders. In reaction, the Nationalist Party demanded an apology from Abela, with Aquilina stating that the Prime Minister had been “attacking the Magistrate leading the inquiry”. “The Partit Nazzjonalista insists that Robert Abela must immediately issue a public apology to the Magistrate who conducted the inquiry into the death of Jean Paul Sofia and commit to refraining from attacking the Judges and Magistrates of our country,” Aquilina said. Conversely, the Labour Party characterised the complaint as “partisan politics”, declaring that the Standards Commissioner had “completely dismissed unfounded accusations”. “Indeed vengeful Opposition and fake news behaviour that only intends to try and score political points (sic),” the party in power said, adding “But the Opposition is blind to partisan politics and only intends to spread unfounded accusations.” Chief Justice Emeritus Joseph Azzopardi, cited in the Labour Party’s response, stressed that the prime minister and justice minister had not improperly accessed information, and a “mere mathematical calculation” would have revealed the inquiry’s potential delay.",Jurgen Balzan,Politics
Top civil servant claims MUT seeking benefits without concessions in widening rift,newsbook,https://newsbook.com.mt/en/top-civil-servant-claims-mut-seeking-benefits-without-concessions-in-widening-rift/,06-12-2024,000379.png,"Tista' taqra bil-
 Adds MUT and UPE reactions As the rift between government and the Malta Union of Teachers widens, a top government official lashed out at the union’s intransigence in the ongoing MCAST dispute, accusing it of solely seeking additional benefits without offering any concessions. Speaking alongside senior education officials in a press briefing this morning alongside ministry permanent secretary Matthew Vella and new MCAST Principal Stephen Vella, Joyce Cassar made explosive allegations that laid bare the escalating tensions between the government and the teachers’ union. The permanent secretary of the people and standards division within the Office of the Prime Minister claimed the MUT was proposing outlandish conditions that would fundamentally undermine educational standards. Cassar said that MCAST had made efforts to accommodate certain proposals but alleged that the MUT had suggested educators be paid €400 for each student who fails to attend an exam. “I believe many lecturers are unaware of this proposal, as their integrity would not allow them to accept it,” Cassar remarked, further alleging that many lecturers are not fully informed about the union’s proposals. Another rejected proposal concerned the amount of leave granted to MCAST educators, which, according to Cassar, exceeded legal stipulations. She argued that the government could not approve an additional 10 days of leave for MCAST educators. Cassar accused the MUT of seeking only additional benefits through the negotiations, adding, “Instead of giving more, they are offering less work.” She also criticised a suggestion for students to start school at 6am, rhetorically asking, “What would they do if they did?” “I am tired of seeing parents being destroyed because they are watching their children suffer and they do not know if they will graduate,” Cassar said, emphasising the human cost of the ongoing industrial dispute. The government’s stance remains unequivocal: negotiations cannot progress until the MUT withdraws its current directives at MCAST. Cassar stressed that while the government typically does not negotiate with unions implementing industrial action, they made an exception due to the widespread impact on workers and students. The union has consistently argued that the education ministry’s negotiation inconsistencies have prolonged the dispute, which has now lasted nearly three years. However, Cassar dismissed these claims, asserting that the government cannot accept different conditions for certain educators while leaving others on less favourable terms. The industrial action, which began on 4 October 2024, has severely disrupted MCAST operations. Lecturers have been forbidden from communicating with administration, participating in meetings, and providing student marks – leaving thousands of students in academic uncertainty. In reaction, the teachers’ union strongly rejected allegations by government that its proposals in the ongoing MCAST dispute would undermine educational quality. In a statement issued following the press briefing by Cassar and other officials, the union accused government of being responsible for the “degradation of educational quality” at the college, citing drastic reductions in teaching hours and staff shortages as key issues. “How can the government expect a syllabus written for six lessons per week to be delivered in three?” the union asked, highlighting that reduced hours have curtailed experimentation, practical work, and experiential learning, which are integral to vocational education at MCAST. The MUT also dismissed Cassar’s claims as “nonsense,” stating that proposals for flexi-time had been distorted and were unrelated to lecturing grades or students. It also denied requesting additional leave or remuneration for failing students, calling the allegations “false” and “inconceivable.” “The MUT rejects all the statements by the Permanent Secretary at OPM Dr Joyce Cassar. MUT never requested students to be at MCAST at 6am. This is nonsense. The Government turned a flexi-time proposal which was not for lecturing grades and for students and twisted it. It did the same with the claim that MUT is requesting more leave than working hours for its grades. These are false. Similarly the MUT never requested remuneration for failing students. This is inconceivable.” Despite escalating tensions, the MUT reaffirmed its commitment to negotiations, stating: “The MUT and its members will not be intimidated by these tactics. The Union reiterates that it is still open to negotiations towards a satisfactory agreement if the Government wants to negotiate instead of attacking the MUT and abandoning social dialogue.” The latest tit-for-tat comes as government and the union remain locked in a standoff over prolonged industrial action at MCAST, disrupting thousands of students. Yesterday, the ministry accused the union of depriving students of quality education, claiming it has already accepted key MUT proposals, including reduced semester lengths, lighter lecturer workloads, and more flexible hours. However, it insisted some MUT demands are “unacceptable” as they risk compromising student outcomes. However, the MUT rejected this, blaming the ministry’s inconsistent negotiation teams and delays over three years for the deadlock. It also criticised the government for refusing previously agreed proposals and highlighted its own goodwill, having twice suspended directives without achieving progress. In recent weeks, students have staged protests over academic disruptions, with the Opposition criticising Prime Minister Robert Abela for failing to resolve the impasse. The union says it remains open to talks but insists the ministry must show genuine commitment to resolving the dispute. But Cassar systematically dismantled the MUT’s negotiating position, rejecting proposals for additional leave and arguing that accepting such demands would create a scenario where more educators would be on leave than in the workplace. While acknowledging that government negotiating teams had changed, Cassar said she had personally begun attending meetings in the past eight weeks to understand the negotiations’ dynamics. However, she maintained that the government’s financial package remains valid and comprehensive. While legal action against the MUT remains a potential avenue, Cassar indicated the government would currently refrain from such measures. Instead, she made a direct appeal to MUT members, urging them to critically evaluate their union’s propositions and potentially disregard directives deemed harmful to students’ education. The MUT’s rival union, the Union of Professional Educators weighed in on the matter, claiming that the ongoing delay in finalising the collective agreement for MCAST lecturers has left many questioning the reasons behind this protracted process. “As a union committed to protecting the integrity and fairness of professional negotiations, we find it puzzling that nearly three years have passed without a positive resolution for MCAST lecturers. The suggestion that these delays are solely due to ongoing negotiations does not seem to reflect the full picture,” UPE said. UPE added that recent statements from government officials indicate that several demands from the MUT have been deemed non-negotiable.  “This raises pertinent questions: Are earlier negotiating positions now fettering the government’s approach, creating a challenging environment for balanced negotiations? It seems there are signs that prior commitments might be influencing the government’s ability to negotiate effectively, creating potential barriers to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement. The UPE asks whether MCAST educators and students are being held at ransom due to expected compromises and concessions?” Pointing out that the lack of transparency in these negotiations is concerning, especially given the significant impact on hard working educators who are caught in the middle of this stalemate, UPE said transparency seems to be lacking from both government and the MUT. “Coupled to these the UPE now also queries whether negotiations are being carried in good faith and whether third parties are also being put into an already troubled equation.”",Jurgen Balzan,Politics
"‘Abela can’t keep doing what he wants,’ Bernard Grech says",maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/national/132323/abela_cant_keep_doing_what_he_wants_bernard_grech_says,17-11-2024,000385.png,"Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech said Monday's protest outside parliament will show the Prime Minister that he “can’t keep doing what he wants.”

 ""The Prime Minister has lost all sense of decency and is too weak to take necessary action,"" Grech said during an interview on NET TV.

                     The protest organised by the PN comes in the wake of revelations that a minister's wife was paid €70,000 annually for a position she was unqualified for.

 ""Robert Abela continues to ignore the anger of the people, just as he did after the death of Jean Paul Sofia,” Grech said.

 The protest is scheduled to happen at the same time as Tourism Minister Clayton Bartolo's parliamentary address on the budget estimates. It follows a week of controversy surrounding the appointment of Bartolo's wife to a consultancy role, despite lacking relevant qualifications.

 Grech emphasised the importance of meritocracy. “The Nationalist Party will ensure that the sacrifices made by students will translate into opportunities where they can succeed, based on their efforts. Under a Nationalist government, no one will take anyone's job if they are not competent.""

 The PN leader also criticised the government's handling of traffic issues, particularly during the recent SiGMA convention. 

 He argued that lack of planning in this sector has led to the loss of foreign investment, as the conference will be held in Milan next year.

 Reflecting on the PN's recent General Council themed Malta Żagħżugħa, Grech outlined the party's vision for an energetic and ambitious Malta.

 He praised the participation of young speakers and non-party members who have approached the Nationalist Party, seeing it as evidence of the party's renewal and its appeal to those who believe in its political will to effect positive change.     ",Juliana Zammit ,Politics
PN temporarily closes Hamrun club after leader refused entry - The Malta Independent ,independent,https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2023-08-18/local-news/PN-temporarily-closes-Hamrun-club-after-leader-refused-entry-6736254173,18-08-2023,000387.png,"

 The Nationalist Party has temporarily closed its club in Hamrun after last Sunday leader Bernard Grech was refused entry.
 In a short statement, the part said its administrative committee met to discuss last Sunday's incident and decided that the club should remain closed for the time being.
 The party did not give an indication as to when it will be opened.
 Neither did it mention any reference to how its party leader Bernard Grech was not allowed to enter the club as the locality was celebrating the feast of St Cajetan.
 Grech attempted to enter the club with a group of followers but, as a barman refused him entry, an altercation broke out between people who were already in the club and others who were accompanying Grech.
 One of Grech’s supports, Noel Mifsud Bonnici, was allegedly beaten to the ground, his wife later said on Facebook. The man needed to be taken to hospital for treatment.
 Police officers on site intervened to break up the altercation.
 In a post on Facebook (below), the injured man’s wife Fatima said her husband was attacked as he was accompanying Grech inside the PN club in Hamrun. The person responsible for the club, she wrote, did not want him inside and “when my husband, without any violence”, insisted that the party leader had every right to enter the club, he was attacked by a number of men who were inside the club. She said that her husband suffered torn knee ligaments and needed surgery.
 Speculation has been rife as to the reason behind the refusal. News reports said that Grech had not visited the club for two years; while other reports said that Grech's decision not to have Mario de Marco as part of the shadow cabinet - a decision that was later reversed - led to bad blood, given that De Marco is popular in the district.

Neighbour files case against ‘abusive’ development at the Abelas’ Gozo hotel,theshiftnews,https://theshiftnews.com/2024/11/24/neighbour-files-case-against-abusive-development-at-the-abelas-gozo-hotel/,24-11-2024,"000397.png,000398.png,000399.png,000400.png","A man from Xewkija, Gozo, who lives in a farmhouse next door to a property that the prime minister and his wife are turning into a boutique hotel, asked the court to intervene and stop ongoing works, accusing Robert and Lydia Abela of trying to build on his property.
 Joseph Portelli, 74, filed an urgent court case at the Gozo Court to stop the prime minister and his wife from trying to take property that is not theirs. According to Portelli, Lydia Abela insists that a common wall dividing the two properties is hers and wants to dismantle it and build further, onto his property.
 Records on the court’s public database show that Magistrate Brigitte Sultana has already ordered the works to stop temporarily until the Gozo court takes a final decision expected on 4 December.
 Sources close to Abela’s contractors, Vella Brothers Ready Mix Ltd, better known as  Tal-Malla, from Xewkija, told The Shift that Portelli first tried to settle the issue amicably without the need to resort to legal action. However, they said that Lydia Abela, who is frequently on site, did not give in, insisting the wall was hers.
 Situated in Xewkija’s Triq Mġarr ix-Xini, Robert and Lydia Abela acquired their Gozitan farmhouse in 2012 from a German couple. At the time, they forked out €268,000 for the 500-square-metre property.
 Despite obtaining a development permit in 2012 to build a pool, they never did. After its five-year validity had elapsed, they applied for a permit renewal in 2017.
 After becoming prime minister, Abela applied for and obtained a government grant through the Irrestawra Darek Scheme, reserved for residences. A permit was issued in 2021 to carry out the work with public money.
 Then, the Abelas applied for an extension to turn it into an eight-bedroom ‘residence’. The application was withdrawn soon after The Shift revealed that the Abelas were using a residential application for a commercial development.
 Application expenses related to commercial developments are usually higher.
 In 2022 and 2023, through two separate deeds, the Abelas acquired fields abutting the back of their property, extending their farmhouse footprint by a further 1,500 square metres. They paid a total of €315,000 for the new acquisition.
 At this point, in 2023, Lydia Abela filed a new planning application to turn the farmhouse into a guesthouse with eight double bedrooms, including a reception and lounge area, a breakfast room, a basement with a gym and wine cellar, a large outdoor pool, and surrounding landscaped gardens.
 The permit, approved by the Planning Authority, also involves a significant extension to the building on the first floor.
 The planned boutique hotel will have a capacity of 16 guests.
 Recently, MHRA president Tony Zahra took a dig at the prime minister while commenting on the oversupply of tourist beds in Malta’s saturated market.
 “We need to be careful; we can do better than this craze to build more and more rooms,” he said.
 “Even the prime minister’s wife wants to build more rooms! What will happen is that we have a lot more supply, but not the demand. We must be careful,” Zahra said.

 Bajada was questioned about whether he was worried about the use of “very dangerous” rhetoric used in the Prime Minister’s press conference on Monday, at the Ewropej2024 debate hosted by MaltaToday and Lovin Malta.
 “I’m going to ask another question – what do young people want? Definitely not to go to court, but that when or if they do they get justice. Justice for everyone, without prejudice or any type of doubt,” Bajada said.
  “We saw that the magistrate lengthened an inquiry of 60 days to four and a half years without disputing the fact there were many details that need to be analysed…
 “We’re in a situation in Malta where sensitive things are becoming politicised. Such an important and sensitive inquiry was concluded in the middle of an electoral campaign. Me, as a youth, it hurts me because I felt that I was going out for the elections to talk about important elements that affect youths.”
 Moderator Matthew Vella intercepted to say that the same thing can be said for the timings of the presidential pardons that were given to those who benefitted from the social benefits racket.
 PN candidate Louise-Anne Pulis added: “and the cheques, and social housing”.
 Bajada claimed the Vitals inquiry was being turned into tribalist politics. “Instead of spending the next few weeks speaking about what Malta needs from the EU, we’re going to be confronted with tribalism politics. And that hurts me.”
 Independent candidate Conrad Borg Manche, mayor of Gżira and a former Labour mayor, interjected: “Tribalism is the thing that hurt this country the most… every election I can remember of has been centred around the corruption of the other party. The elections get won because of the corruption of the party before. Malta cannot remain a country with two parties fighting while we have to pick the best out of two evils.”
 ADPD candidate Sandra Gauci strongly censured Abela’s comments calling them “irresponsible, if not criminal”.
 The debate was organised in collaboration with LovinMalta, MaltaToday, Ewropej, and MCAST.  ",,Politics

The agency also denied receiving any directives from the magistrate currently conducting an inquiry.
 On Thursday morning, alarms were triggered on two floors of the Msida premises, including the floor housing the server room. However, according to Identità, preliminary investigations indicate that the alarm was caused by a faulty sensor rather than any unauthorised activity.
  An inspection of the facility, including the secure server room, revealed no irregularities or signs of a security breach, the agency said. Identità emphasised that its systems remain fully operational and secure.
 The agency assured that all CCTV footage has been reviewed and shows no evidence of foul play, with logs and footage preserved as part of their commitment to transparency.
 Identità clarified that no applications or documents are stored in the affected area, as their servers are hosted by MITA, a separate entity.
 Additionally, the agency stated that it has not received any orders from the magistrate leading an inquiry into alleged fraud at Identità. The decision to seal the archives of the Expatriates Unit was made internally by the management.
 The agency said it has stringent security measures, including 24/7 monitoring by security personnel and secure recording of all entry logs and CCTV footage, accessible only by authorised compliance staff.
 Identità’s statement comes after lawyer Jason Azzopardi alleged on Facebook that an inquiring magistrate ordered the sealing of the archives at the agency’s Expatriates Unit.
 He also suggested that the 5am alarm from the IT servers room was due to a security breach, and that someone entered the room to cover up their tracks.  ",Nicole Meilak ,Government
Report published: Two ministers breach ethics as girlfriend given job she was not qualified for - The Malta Independent ,independent,https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2024-11-07/local-news/Two-ministers-breach-ethics-as-girlfriend-given-job-she-was-not-qualified-for-6736265532,07-11-2024,000417.png,"
                
        

         Photo: Clayton Bartolo (left) first recruited Amanda Muscat as a private secretary before she was promoted to being a consultant, a role she retained when she was transferred to Clint Camilleri's (right) Gozo Ministry 
  
 Two ministers, Clayton Bartolo and Clint Camilleri, were found by the Standards Commissioner to have abused their power when Bartolo's then-girlfriend Amanda Muscat was given a job she had no qualifications for, and did not do.  The tourism and Gozo ministers respectively were found to have failed to administer public funds diligently, Standards Commissioner Joseph Azzopardi said in a report which was published today by the parliamentary ethics committee.
 In a statement on 23 October, independent politician Arnold Cassola, who had filed the complaint on the issue to the Standards Commissioner, said that the report by the commissioner had been passed onto the Parliament's Committee for Standards in Public Life. A meeting of the committee today led to the publication of the report.
 Cassola called for the investigation in 2022, when he alleged that Muscat, who was Bartolo's girlfriend and private secretary at the time, was transferred to the Gozo Ministry, as well as that she was not turning up for work.
 Cassola had asked the commissioner to investigate whether Bartolo acted with nepotism or favouritism with his ""girlfriend"", why Camilleri was allowing his employee to not show up for work, and whether both ministers breached ethics.
 Azzopardi found that Amanda Muscat, now Bartolo's wife, was first promoted from being Bartolo's personal assistance to his consultant with an increased salary of almost €62,000 and, later, this was upped to €68,000 when she moved to Camilleri's ministry in 2021.
 The 40-page report showed that Muscat did not have the necessary qualifications for the job and did not do consultancy work. By and large she continued to work as Bartolo's private secretary, with a consultant's salary, even when she was employed with Camilleri.
 ""Muscat was appointed policy consultant with the benefits that come with it arbitrarily, without justification, both because she was not qualified and because she did not fulfil the work that her role entailed,"" Azzopardi concluded.
 Azzopardi's report found that there were inconsistencies in the testimonies given by Muscat, the two ministers and the heads of secretariat and the Office of the Prime Minister was aware that she was still working in Bartolo's office after she had been technically employed by Camilleri.
 
 Muscat and Bartolo developed a relationship when the two started working together and they eventually got married last summer.
 As a consultant at the Tourism Minister, Muscat had a salary of  €39,414, which increased to €61,888 with allowances, including one for her expert opinion which she was not qualified to give. Her ""transfer"" to work with Camilleri had landed her a more lucrative pay-check of €40,183, which increased to €67,657 with allowances.
 Ministers' conde of ethics lays down that they should not appoint spouses or relatives by consanguinity to the first degree to their private secretariats. The commissioner concluded that this did not apply to relationships outside marriage, so there was no breach in this case although they were in a relationship.
 But the commissioner did find fault in Muscat's qualifications, as she had no experience or special expertise in any sector related to tourism to justify her contracts.
 She has A level and intermediate certificates and obtained a diploma in leadershop and management in 2017, and her work experience was that of a secretary or personal assistance. Consultants are expected to advise ministers on policy and strategy, the commissioner said, and they require vast experience or specialised studies. Despite not having this experience, she was given a salary equivalent to scale 3, the commissioner said.
 Expertise allowancxes should only be given in exceptional cases, but Muscat was given a €15,000  expertise allowance when she was at the Tourism Ministry with Bartolo, and this was later increased to  €20,000 when she was transferred to Camilleri. The report said that Camilleri's head of secretariat, Michael Buhagiar, was unable to explain why this rise was given and even denied that there had been an increase.
 The role of policy consultant is a position of trust which depends on the minister, but this should not be given to a person who is unqualified. People chosen for this role should be competent and able to carry out their duties.
 The commissioner also could not find any evidence that she did any consultancy work with either of the two ministers. Muscat herself had testified that her work continued to be that of a private secretary. This breached the rules, and policy consultants should serve as consultants, and not carry out secretarial work. Muscat's emai box did not show that she had carried out any such work as there were no references to policy or strategic reports in her contributions.
 Muscat told the commissioner that she had not been isntructed to prepare reports, do research or give advice. Instead, she requested research from other professionals, saying that she was more of a coordinator. She admitted that she was not part of the decision-making process, with Azzopardi ruling that her role as advisor meant she was supposed to be part of this. The way her employment was arranged effectively gave her a substantial, unjustified salary rise, the report said.
 
 Bartolo, through his lawyer Pawlu Lia, told the commissioner that his relationship with Muscat began after she started working at the Tourism Ministry, and they had agreed that it would be better if she left her role. ""That would have been appropriate and correct if it were true,"" the commissioner noted, but instead Muscat's employment was transferred to the Gozo Ministry while she continued to effectively serve as Bartolo's assistant.
 Conflicting testimonies were given by Muscat and John Grima, who was head of secretariat at the tourism ministry at the time she was transferred to the Gozo ministry. She said Grima approached her and suggested to transfer to the Gozo ministry because of her relationship with Bartolo, but he said that it had been her choice to resign. He said he had been surprised when she handed him her notice.
 Gozo Ministry head of secretariat Michael Buhagiar said that the kind of work Muscat did for the ministry was tourism strategy, diving, a Comino trail project, the film industry and then fireworks festival. Moth Muscat and Minister Camilleri said she also worked on preparations for the 2022 scuttling of a ship that had run aground in Qawra four years before.
 Buhagiar had very few recollections of the project and indicated it had been one under the responsibility of the Tourism Ministry, not the Gozo Ministry.
 The commissioner said Muscat's emails gave a different story, and showed that she was effectively working for Minister Bartolo throughout this period while she was officially Minister Camilleri's consultant.
 ""Her engagement at the Gozo Ministry was only nominal and practically all her emails throughout this period are about work at the Tourism Ministry.""
 In some emails she was even indicated as the Tourism Ministry's contact person, the investigation found. 
 She was also copied in emails sent to Minister Bartolo regarding customer care issues and in correspondence sent to Bartolo from the Office of the Prime Minister.
 The only emails she received that were somewhat related to Gozo appear to have been sent automatically to all employees who for some reason had their email address connected to the Gozo Ministry.
 She did not receive emails from Clint Camilleri or Michael Buhagiar, who were supposed to be her direct superiors, the commissioner observed..
 Muscat told investigators that during the pandemic she would do most of her work from her home in Malta and only go to Gozo when the need arose.
 She said she got permission from the Tourism and Gozo heads of secretariat to use an office at the Tourism Ministry to prepare documents, ""because of logistics and to avoid wasting a lot of time"".
 
In their defence, both ministers pinned the blame on their heads of secretariat, saying Muscat was engaged by them, a fact both heads confirmed. But the commissioner observed that a person of trust generally meant enjoying the trust of the minister, not the head of secretariat, so much so that these persons have their contracts terminated immediately once a minister is removed from the job.
 It is only Cabinet members who recruit persons of trust, the commissioner said.
 Camilleri argued that the complaint did not allege that he had acted with favouritism in Muscat's regard, but that he had permitted her not to turn up for work. But he said he could not be blamed for this as it was not his jonb to oversee employees' attendance.
 But, during a hearing in the minister's presence, his lawyer said the minister worker with Muscat, knew what she was doing and what projects she was working on. 
 On this, the commissioner said that one could argue that a minister should not be held responsible for the actions of his persons of trust if he genuinely was not aware of them. But if the minister defends these actions or makes statements that do not correspond to the facts, there is no doubt that he would be shouldering personal responsibility for what happened.
 Azzopardi suggested changes to the guidelines for the engagement of policy consultants. 
 He said that they need to be updated because, as they stand, there is room for abuse.
 Commenting on the Standards Commissioner report on Clayton Bartolo and Clint Camilleri, Arnold Cassola stated:
 ""Following a thorough analysis of the facts, that lasted more than two years, Commissioner for Standards, Judge Emeritus Joseph Azzopardi has confirmed my report of a breach of ethics on the part of the two ministers.
 ""This breach of ethics on the part of the two ministers has been clearly proven, since they abused of public funds, which were given to a non qualified consultant who, while being richly compensated as a consultant with one minister, never did any consultancy for him but instead acted as a personal secretary to another minister. 
 ""I now expect Prime Minister Robert Abela to lead by example on good governance and take the necessary disciplinary action against the two ministers, whilst introducing safeguards to ensure that such blatant abuses do not re-occur in the future"". 
 Camilleri and Bartolo react
 In a post on Facebook, Minister Camilleri said that he has taken note of the report by the Commissioner for Standards, and one now waits for the outcome of the discussion within the Parliamentary Committee for Public Life.
 ""In the meantime, however, certain points should be clarified: The individual mentioned was engaged for a short period of about eight months, always in strict adherence to the applicable policies outlined in the Manual on Resourcing, Policies, and Procedures. At no point, in any way or manner, was the content of this manual breached. The report does not state that the individual in question did not work; on the contrary, it confirms the opposite. This is one Government, and a Ministry such as the Ministry for Gozo requires joint efforts with all other Ministries, including Tourism, as demonstrated in projects like the Tourism Strategy 2021-2030, the Diving Strategy, the film sector, and the Malta International Fireworks Festival.""
 Minister Bartolo also posted, and aside from a similar writeup as Minister Camilleri, also said that: ""It is worth noting that the mentioned contract was terminated on December 31, 2021, and since then, the individual in question has not worked for the Government nor received any other form of remuneration from it. The report does not state that the individual did not work; it confirms the opposite. In light of all this, while I do not agree with everything written by the Commissioner for Standards in Public Life, I accept the report. If there were any instances where I fell short in some way, I humbly apologize. No one is perfect, and the only people who never make mistakes are those who do nothing. As I have done throughout my years in this position, I will remain focused on my duties to continue working for the tourism industry, which is creating prosperity for the benefit of all the Maltese and Gozitan people.""

Court stops Gaffarena’s ‘cowboy’ attempt to evict farmers from land,theshiftnews,https://theshiftnews.com/2024/05/15/court-stops-gaffarenas-cowboy-attempt-to-evict-farmers-from-land/,15-05-2024,000418.png,"Rogue property speculator Mark Gaffarena, notorious for a series of scandals, particularly in the past decade, was once again stopped by the court from evicting farmers working large tracts of land in Żebbiegħ for generations.
 The Constitutional Court, presided by Judge Toni Abela, rubbished Gaffarena’s plea that his fundamental rights had been breached because he could not enjoy his Żebbiegħ property as the land was leased to farmers.
 Throwing out his latest attempt to evict farmers from the land, the court said Gaffarena knew when he bought the land in 2005 that it was protected agricultural land leased to farmers.
 According to the court, the laws clearly state that the owner of this type of property cannot evict any farmer if the latter keeps working the land. This law is in place to protect farmers and agricultural land from speculation.
 The court seriously doubted Gaffarena’s declaration in court that he wanted the Żebbiegħ farmland to start working it himself. The court said this did not appear to be true, as Gaffarena had abandoned a small portion of the same land he acquired through an agreement with another farmer.
 Court documents show that the Żebbiegħ farmland – the size of four football pitches – was bought by Gaffarena in 2005 from a company for just €60,000. The price was low because the land was already rented out through a protected lease to farmers.
 In court, Gaffarena claimed that the market value of the land was now €1.8 million.
 However, the court observed that while the market value of the land was irrelevant in this case, court experts gave a different value of €450,000.
 This is the second time in a few weeks that Gaffarena lost a case related to the eviction of farmers.
 Last February, the court slammed Mark Gaffarena over a similar case in which he wanted to evict farmers from agricultural land in Burmarrad.
 Criticising the businessman’s “cowboy-like attitude”, the court declared that none of Gaffarena’s fundamental rights had been breached.
 The Burmarrad case involved a farmhouse and some 15,000 square metres of land in the area known as Ta’ Lippin, which Gaffarena bought in 2003.
 The deed of sale specifically stated that the property was subject to a lease and that condition was reflected in its price of just €70,000.
 Gaffarena claimed that the Burmarrad property today had a value of €3.5 million, and he wanted it back. The court turned down his request.

"Conservatorio Vincenzo Bugeja youths relocated, staff fired due to ‘mismanagement’",theshiftnews,https://theshiftnews.com/2023/11/25/conservatorio-vincenzo-bugeja-youths-relocated-staff-fired-due-to-mismanagement/,25-11-2023,000419.png,"The Conservatorio Vincenzo Bugeja, a home for youths opened more than a hundred years ago, will shut down its care programmes, relieve staff of their duties and relocate residents after disagreements between its private management and the government.
 Sources at the Conservatorio told The Shift the situation resulted from mismanagement of the homes, including the Fejda and Jean Antide residences,  in recent years, resulting in increased violence between residents and several escapes.
 When contacted by The Shift, representatives of the board of trustees downplayed the changes at the privately-owned Conservatorio, characterising them as a simple “restructuring.” They refused to provide details on the reasons behind the changes.
 The Social Justice and Children’s Rights Minister Michael Falzon claimed in parliament on Wednesday that the Ministry and the Foundation for Social Welfare Services (FSWS) will find “alternative accommodation” for the youths.
 Falzon said the Public Social Partnership, which this year saw some €800,000 budgeted for the Conservatorio, would not be extended by the trustees, but similarly did not give any further information.
 Questions sent by The Shift to FSWS CEO Alfred Grixti asking for more details on the changes were also left unanswered at the time of publication.
 Police sources who spoke to The Shift noted how they are often called in to maintain order at the Conservatorio.
 They said the two homes saw “constant fighting and violence” between the residents and were “a complete mess,” noting how social workers were subjected to distressing situations.
 Falzon disclosed the information on the changes at the Conservatorio following questions by opposition Shadow Minister for Social Policy David Agius.
 He asked what would happen to the 36 workers at the Conservatorio when it shuts down.
 Sources at the home claimed all care workers at the Conservatorio were being laid off by its management, with their last day of work set for the end of the month.
 They claimed the home management took a turn for the worse in the last three years and expressed disappointment at its closure.
 While Falzon claimed the government was urging the workers to apply for vacant ministry positions, it is understood their previous conditions of work and remuneration will not be kept.
 According to the same sources, the youths at the home will be moved out next week, with Falzon claiming they will be relocated to three other residences administered by the ministry and FSWS.

         The dismembered body found in a luggage off the Sliema Ferries promenade on Monday is that of a man aged between 40 and 60, police sources said.
 An autopsy carried out today revealed that the man's stomach contained drugs, TVM reports.
 TVM also reports that the police are looking for a man who is suspected to having committed the murder and dismembered the body with an axe.
 The axe and the luggage are thought to have been both bought from a Naxxar outlet.  The suitcase was lifted out of the water on Monday afternoon after being noticed floating by passers-by.
 In it, the police found a man who is believed to have been killed recently.
 The body had not yet decomposed, leading the police to believe that the man was killed a few days ago.
 The body is however still to be identified. The identification of the body will be a crucial factor in helping the police in their investigations.

Five years after road fatality: Widow seeks justice after bungled charge sheet leads to acquittal - The Malta Independent ,independent,https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2023-08-27/local-news/Five-years-after-road-fatality-Widow-seeks-justice-after-bungled-charge-sheet-leads-to-acquittal-6736254386,27-08-2023,"000434.png,000435.png","

 The widow of a man who was killed in a road accident said that the several court and police failures she experienced since the death of her husband ultimately led to the acquittal of the accused in the case.
 Moira Vassallo’s husband, Mark, died five days after the motorcycle he was riding in slow moving traffic in Pieta towards Valletta, on 22 August 2018, was hit from behind by a car being driven by a young man.
 Today, 27 August, marks five years since Mark died in hospital, having succumbed to severe internal injuries. He was 53.
 The magisterial inquiry into the case recommended that the young man, who had been driving behind Mark, should be charged with involuntarily causing his death through negligent driving.
 But due to a series of mistakes, the accused “was acquitted as if he killed a fly” in May 2022, Moira said.
 Moira, an actress of Ipokriti and  F’Bahar Wiehed fame, said that the court had not been notified that the family wanted to be part of the proceedings and in turn the family had not been told when sittings were taking place.
 She said that consequently the family did not show up to any of the sittings and was not informed on what was going on, but rather, Moira had been assured that court proceedings take “very long”.
 
 Moreover, the police chargesheet which listed details about the accident were filled in incorrectly, she said. 
 The model of the car was listed as a Volkswagen, when in fact, it was a Peugeot. The number plate was registered wrong and the police wrote that the accident happened at 1.30am in Triq Dun Karm, Msida, when in fact it happened at 7.30am in Triq ix-Xatt, Pietà.
 Moira also said that she was informed by the police that it could not take action on the police officer who made these mistakes, as apparently, she had “left the Force”.
 The results of the magisterial inquiry in the procès-verbal should have also been submitted to court for the case, but the court registrar did not submit a copy of the report. Therefore, the report of the inquiry never reached the magistrate overseeing the case, Moira said.
 Additionally, the statement that the accused gave to police when they arrived on the scene of the accident was deemed null and void by the court, because the police had failed to inform him of his legal rights.
 “These mistakes could not be fixed,” Moira said, as the chargesheet had been filled in incorrectly and the procès-verbal was not presented to court before the deadline. 
 Moira said that although the family can make an appeal, the outcome of the case would turn out the same, due to the series of “major shortcomings” from the authorities. 
 Moira questioned why nobody checked the chargesheet and its data before it was presented to court and said that it seemed as if a door had been opened to allow abuses to happen.
 “Will there be more cases handled like this? If mistakes are made, somebody should take responsibility. That is what I want, that they come to me, tell me that they took action and made sure that these failures won’t happen again,” Moira said.
 She said that she does not want vindication, as it will not bring Mark back, but her wish is for people to not go through the “huge injustice” that her family went through.
 “I never expected that the culprit would go to prison, two wrongs do not make a right. It was an accident, and it can happen. Unfortunately, (people found guilty) are normally given suspended sentences and have their licence revoked. But he was acquitted as if he killed a fly. That is something I do not want anyone to experience,” Moira said.
 She said that nobody gave her an explanation as to how, and why the “banal” mistakes on the botched chargesheet were made, and she often wonders if this was done on purpose, as all the facts were incorrect.
 “The culprit was taken to court, he was acquitted due to the mistakes, the procès-verbal was not submitted and we were not there. I have been told that the magistrate had also commented as to why the family was not present,” Moira said.
 A note of appeal to the court’s acquittal was submitted to the Attorney General’s Office by the police, to consider reopening the case and restart criminal proceedings with a new, error-free chargesheet. 
 Moira said that the AG refused, with no explanation as to why. The case cannot be reopened now, Moira said.
 She said that the criminal proceedings against the accused took three years to be completed. There should not be such a huge delay in court. 
 “There is no humanity. I feel that for the authorities, the court and the police, we are an ID number, not people,” she continued.
 Moira also said that she wished for some type of organisation which provides support to the family of the victims, as well as legal advice and information about procedures, as a grieving person would not be in the right frame of mind to think thoroughly about these things, especially soon after a tragedy occurs.
 “All I wish is that nobody else experiences this and that there is a solid structure which reaches out first, and helps these people,” she said. 
 “The family should automatically be notified on proceedings by the courts directly and not through a lawyer. These things need to change; there needs to be more humanity with the family (of any victim),” Moira continued.
 Moira said that there should also be more road awareness and that the country is not doing enough, even with the recently increased fines.
 “I remember, in the past, when the seat belt law came into force, they bombarded the public with this particular advertisement, which is still mentioned today by people my age,” Moira said, calling for more of this kind of awareness.
 She said that people should not be on their phones while driving nor should they be smoking, drinking, listening to loud music, as these are all distractions.
 Moira said that nobody came to explain to her what had happened, and only one person from the Police had apologised, the inspector who took over after the mess left by the botched chargesheet. 
 “If you’re in the wrong, come to me and explain, and apologise if possible. Assure me that you will do everything so that these things do not happen again,” Moira said.
 “We have become a cold nation, which is a pity,” she continued.
 “I do not want anyone to experience this. Five years later and I miss his contagious laugh, where you could not help but laugh with him, rather than at the joke he was telling and laughing about at the same time,” Moira said.

A PN government will give tax reductions that will benefit everyone - Grech - The Malta Independent ,independent,https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2024-10-06/local-news/A-PN-government-will-give-tax-credits-and-allowance-increases-to-everyone-Grech-says-6736264683,06-10-2024,000438.png,"
                
        

         Opposition Leader Bernard Grech said that a Nationalist Party government would reduce taxes, whilst increasing allowances for parents and those who do not have to pay taxes.
 In an address on Sunday, commemorating four years since he became PN Leader, Grech said that the PN in government would emphasize a new economic social model, which addresses all facets of society.
 Grech said that the PN would remove taxes from the Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA) in order to address the higher cost of living. He accused the Labour government of ""stealing from people's pockets,"" as well as putting excess burden on employers who have to bear the cost of the COLA.  A Nationalist government would also give out tax credits to the self-employed and the private sector so that they do not transfer the burden of higher prices to the consumer, Grech said.
 ""We will also introduce reductions in tax for parents, and increase allowances as they are investing in raising their children, and that is an important and necessary investment for the country today, and in the future,"" Grech said.
 He said a PN government plans for the short, medium and long-term, and it will also provide greater aid to parents with children with disabilities, as they have extraordinary burdens.
 ""We do not want their children to fall behind, they have intrinsic value, and value for our country,"" Grech said.
 Grech said that the PN government will reduce tax for parents whose children are still studying, as well as grant allowances to those who do not have to pay taxes.
 He said the PN would grant the biggest pension to pensioners, as well as reduce taxes and introduce a special allowance for widows.
 ""We will be sensitive not to leave any sector behind,"" Grech said, adding that with a PN government, there would be more money in people's pockets.
 ""This is one of the ways we will help you more forward, so that you generate economic activity, and the whole population moves forward,"" Grech said, adding that the PN government would award hard work, and the needs of all vulnerable persons.
 He also said that a Labour government has no other tactics but to ""attack"" people, as he strongly deplored a statement issued by the Labour Local Council of Żejtun (or by the Mayor herself), which condemned PN councillor Enya Abela simply for keeping the people of Żejtun informed about her work.
 ""We will not let anyone attack our youth. The PN will defend, it will be a party for the small, and those who invest, to guarantee a country which moves forward,"" Grech said.
 Grech said that the party has done and changed a lot in these past four years, saying that he felt proud of his Parliamentary group, made up of people with long experience in politics, and new people who started their first steps in parliamentary work these past two years.
 He said that despite being in the Opposition, the mix of experience, energy, various ideas and innovations brought together by the PN managed to make a difference and push policies.
 ""Our work is based on the unity there is between us. We love each other like family, and the country must move forward as one family,"" Grech said.
 He continued that maturity and respect require apologies in politics, as the PN's aim is to be a government which looks out for the best interests of the Maltese and Gozitan population.
 ""That is the difference in what we say and do. People recognize us by our work. On the other hand, the PL has internal conflicts, and the Prime Minister lost all moral authority, and is being distrusted,"" Grech said, adding that Robert Abela had to concede in letting Central Bank governor Edward Scicluna have his way, still receiving a salary and perks without going to work.
 Grech said that the PN was also at the forefront for calling for a public inquiry into the death of Jean Paul Sofia, as well as at the front of calling for the Vitals deal investigation.
 He also said that the PL government tried passing a law ""from under the table"" with regards to the abortion legislation, and said that at least, one knows where the PN stands on the matter.
 Grech said that while Abela gives money to the corrupt, he has none for the teachers who are protesting for better pay and rights, workers, vulnerable persons, etc. He said that when he became PN leader, he immediately went to Abela to ask for an immigration conference.
 ""Today, everyone agrees with us that the country needs a new economic, social model,"" Grech said.
 He noted the recent survey which showed that the PN is ahead of Labour by 12,000 votes, saying that this shows a trend that the PN is moving forward, and with authenticity and conviction, it can be the government leading the country forward.
 Speakers Martina Cutajar and Matthew Bonello also spoke at the event.

New Lands Authority scheme for contract changes of government-transferred property - The Malta Independent ,independent,https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2024-08-30/local-news/New-Lands-Authority-scheme-for-contract-changes-of-government-transferred-property-6736263846,30-08-2024,000444.png,"
                
        

         A new scheme has been launched by the Lands Authority through which the reasons are being updated for changes or removal of conditions made when property has been transferred from the government, the Lands Authority, or ecclesiastical entities.
 Details of this scheme were issued through Legal Notice No. 196, the Ministry for Lands and the Implementation of the Electoral Programme said.
 Lands Minister Stefan Zrinzo Azzopardi spoke about the reasons why there was a need for a change to be enacted, as the Legal Notice used to dictate that the change or removal of conditions from the original contracts was limited only to changes in the number of residences or garages.  The Minister continued that this new scheme is necessary so that citizens, families, and the general public have more clarity about Lands Authority processes. He said that through this scheme, it is now clear how the process is to be operated when a citizen makes requests of this kind. He added that requests of this kind are being structured in a scheme to make it clear how things should be done.
 The Ministry said that the Legal Notice is now giving the Lands Authority the ability to decide whether the proposed change is considered to be of minor, medium, or major importance, and from this decision, the fees and administrative penalties to be paid will be established. It said that to arrive at this decision, the Lands Authority will take into consideration what impact the change or removal of a condition will have on the free and fair value of the property which has been transferred. It added that the Legal Notice includes a complete schedule of payments to be made in each category.
 Zrinzo Azzopardi said that an example of cases where the Lands Authority will be able to consider applications for the change or removal of conditions in contracts includes changes in the use of a property. Regarding what sort of cases are being excluded from this scheme, he said that exclusions include a change in the title, a change to the date of the census review, a change in the amount of census payments, and a change in the term of when the census expires.
 The Ministry said that changing or removing conditions will not be possible when a property has been obtained by parliamentary resolution, by tender, by tender procedure, or by auction.
 Lands Authority CEO Robert Vella said that this scheme will allow the Lands Authority to be able to process requests for solutions to old problems linked with conditions in contracts that were included in old times and are no longer relevant today.
 Lands Authority Chairperson Dr John Vassallo and Lands Permanent Secretary Carlos Tabone were also present for the news conference.

"PM 'exploits violence against  police' to silence those who disagree with him, PN says
 - The Malta Independent ",independent,https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2024-09-22/local-news/PN-exploits-violence-against-police-to-silence-those-who-disagree-with-him-PN-say-6736264322,22-09-2024,000451.png,"
                
        

         The Nationalist Party strongly condemned the way Robert Abela is exploiting violence against members of the Police Force to incite people against the PN.
 This is happening instead of admitting that the climate of impunity he himself has created is leading to a culture of indifference in the country, the PN said.
 Abela implied on Sunday that the shocking attack against officers in Hamrun was a consequence of the seeds of disrespect shown against the police commissioner.  Abela has become an unscrupulous politician who is even willing to exploit violence and tragedies to turn the people against each other and to silence those who do not agree with him, the PN said. This behaviour by Robert Abela represents the worst form of politics our country has ever seen and highlights his immaturity, irresponsibility, and lack of moral integrity.
 The PN said that, over the last three legislatures, the Labour Government has weakened the Police Force and its leadership by keeping them under political control, and now Robert Abela is trying to justify the aggression against Police Force members with ridiculous excuses.
 In reply, the Labour Party said that the PN's reaction exposes their admission of irresponsibility.
 The PN said that the police and other institutions always work, even when its outcome goes against what the Opposition believes is right.

Opinion: Labour’s great strides,theshiftnews,https://theshiftnews.com/2024/12/10/opinion-labours-great-strides/,10-12-2024,"000457.png,000458.png","Robert Abela made another of his comical claims – “Labour made great strides on press freedom”.  Maybe he has a point, except it’s great strides backwards that Labour made.
 In 2013, after 25 years of PN administration, Malta ranked 45th in the RSF World Press Freedom Index. By 2023, it had plummeted to 84th.
 Labour’s great strides started briskly in 2013 – Malta fell to 51st in just one year. By 2018, it reached a disgraceful 65th place.
 By 2019, it was 77th, 81st in 2020 and 84th in 2023. That was Malta’s worst-ever ranking, with a score of just 59.76.  This year, Malta’s  global score practically stayed the same at 60.96.
 Robert Abela is right.  Labour made great strides – towards extinguishing media freedom. Malta is tied with the Central African Republic, Guyana, and Kosovo, all of which have a global score of 60.
 Does anybody remember Labour’s empty promise that it would make Malta the best in Europe? Instead, it sank Malta’s press freedom to the level of the Central African Republic.  That’s a catastrophic fall Labour engineered.
 Abela believes that if he repeats the same lie often enough, everybody will swallow it.  That might be the case for the ever-dwindling number of purveyors of Labour’s ONE news, but not for most others.
 Abela flew into a rage in parliament because the respected Reporters Without Borders (RSF) ranked Malta so low, rubbishing his silly boasts about great strides.  Abela launched into a vicious tirade against RSF and their World Press Freedom Index.
 “In the end,” Abela claimed,” like any report of its kind, (the Press Freedom Index) represents the point of view and reflects the motivation and perspective of those who wrote it”.  Except, it doesn’t.
 The report is based on the replies to detailed questionnaires sent to media experts, journalists, lawyers and other key stakeholders.  It doesn’t reflect the views or the motivation of the authors. It reports its findings.
 Abela attempted to discredit RSF.  He accused the international organisation of making misleading claims. He called them agenda-driven and fed by “those who think the government does nothing good in this country”.
 At least he didn’t label them part of the establishment or an extreme faction of the opposition.
 Why is Abela so furious that Malta’s ranking plummeted to Guyana’s level?  He knows exactly why.  He’s the one who accused journalists of being part of the establishment during a press conference.
 He accused the editor of the Times of Malta of conspiring with the opposition “at Costa Coffee”. His own party station relentlessly harasses and persecutes journalists for doing their job.
 Government ministries and entities have doggedly refused to provide information even when the Freedom of Information Appeals tribunal ordered the information released.
 Abela’s ministries and public entities took multiple cases before the appeals court, knowing they would lose, purely out of spite and with the explicit intention of financially crippling The Shift, which relentlessly exposes Labour’s abuse.
 It’s been over three years since the Daphne Caruana Galizia inquiry report was published. After first pledging to implement its recommendations, Abela steadfastly refuses to implement any of them.
 Instead, he’s publicly attacked the members of that inquiry board in an attempt to discredit them and their work.
 Just three days after Abela’s vicious attack on RSF and their World Press Freedom Index, his deputy, Ian Borg stood up at an OSCE side event and stated that “the assassination of Daphne Caruana Galizia is a stark reminder of the urgent need to strengthen the fourth pillar of democracy”.
 Borg was part of the government, which the Caruana Galizia inquiry lambasted for creating an atmosphere of impunity leading to the collapse of the rule of law that emboldened those who wanted her dead to execute their plan.  Borg has also been part of Abela’s government.  He’s now deputy prime minister.
 Abela and Borg have the power to implement those recommendations.  They could easily have made the changes to ensure journalists were protected so they could work freely and safely and that information of public interest was readily available.
 Neither Borg nor Abela have lifted a finger to improve the situation.  They both contributed to Malta’s spiralling deterioration in press freedom.
 Ian Borg is the epitome of hypocrisy.  “My country knows all too well the threats to media freedom,” he told the international delegates at the OSCE meeting held in Malta last week.  Of course, he does – because it’s his party leaders, his fellow MPs like Glenn Bedingfield, and his party behind those threats to the media.
 “The space for free and independent media is shrinking, and so is access to public interest information,” Borg declared.
 How can these people show their face in public? Borg turned down a Freedom of Information request to publish details of the hundreds of thousands of public funds funnelled into Gozo Channel.
 His ministry and entities falling under his ministry rejected Freedom of Information requests on payments made to Malta Today’s Saviour Balzan for PR. Even when the court ordered his government to publish the documents, his ministry still refused, openly defying the rule of law.
 Labour runs the government like a secret organisation while its deputy prime minister pretends to mourn the shrinking access to public interest information. Abela hasn’t even tabled his or his ministers’ declaration of assets, which he should have done by March.
 No wonder Reporters without Borders called out Robert Abela: “The prime minister’s remarks in parliament were indicative of his administration’s continued lack of political will to implement meaningful reforms to improve Malta’s press freedom record”.
 The organisation accused Abela of attempting to deflect criticism instead of addressing “very serious issues”. They pointed out that Abela was attempting to “establish a misleading counter-narrative”.
 Reporters Without Borders dealt Abela a deserved humiliating rebuke: “Until the Maltese government begins to take its international obligations seriously… the public’s right to information will continue to be impacted”. They’re right.
 Labour hasn’t even started taking its obligations seriously.  It’s too busy destroying the independent media, concealing the truth and trying to save itself.

         The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Dr Anġlu Farrugia, welcomed Kevin Bonavia, a serving British Labour Party politician and Member of Parliament for Stevenage, at the Parliament of Malta. The meeting underscored the strong ties between Malta and the United Kingdom, built upon a rich history and common values shared between the two nations.
 During the discussions, the Speaker and Bonavia exchanged views on a range of issues of mutual interest, including the importance of fostering bilateral relations in areas such as education, cultural exchange, and the Maltese diaspora in the UK. They also highlighted the significance of continued cooperation in the face of global challenges, such as climate change, security, and the post-Brexit landscape.  Kevin Bonavia, who was born to a Maltese father and a Scottish mother and spent part of his childhood in Rabat, Malta, expressed his strong personal connection to the country. His unique background provides him with a deep appreciation of both Maltese and British cultures, enabling him to serve as a bridge between the two nations.
 Farrugia praised Kevin Bonavia's dedication to public service and his efforts to strengthen ties with Malta. He noted that Bonavia's heritage and connection to the island are invaluable assets in promoting stronger collaboration between Malta and the United Kingdom.
 Both dignitaries acknowledged the importance of deepening cooperation between parliaments and maintaining open channels of dialogue to address shared priorities. The meeting concluded with a commitment to continue working closely on issues of common concern and to explore new opportunities for engagement between Malta and the UK, especially the fostering of relations between the Parliament of Malta and the House of Commons.

Third edition of 'A Gift with Love with a Difference' launched - The Malta Independent ,independent,https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2024-12-14/local-news/Third-edition-of-A-Gift-with-Love-with-a-Difference-launched-6736266523,14-12-2024,,"
                
        

         The Prime Minister's wife, Lydia Abela, has launched the third edition of 'A Gift with Love with a Difference,' during a visit to Mater Dei Hospital.
 This follows the launch of the fifth edition of 'A Gift with Love' at Castille last week. The campaign collects gifts for underprivileged children who might not receive presents during the Christmas season.
 Through this initiative, the entire country can contribute to ensuring that no child in Malta is left without a gift during the festive period, a government statement said.  'A Gift with Love with a Difference' works hand in hand with A Gift with Love, with a focus on supporting animals in sanctuaries across Malta.
 The initiative was inspired by the beloved Jake Vella, who passed away earlier this year. His wish was to collect pet food and related products at the entrance of Mater Dei Hospital.
 Abela paid tribute to Jake's memory, recalling his extraordinary courage in battling his rare illness with altruism and positivity until the very end.
 ""I remember how two years ago, we fulfilled Jake's dream and launched A Gift with Love with a Difference for the first time. During this season, when everyone is buying gifts, we also thought of abandoned animals, encouraging people to buy food and pet products to be collected here at the main hospital hall,"" Abela said.
 She also noted the great success of the past two editions of this initiative.
 Abela invited everyone who can to contribute to abandoned animals by leaving their donations at the main hall of Mater Dei Hospital during the festive season, ensuring that Jake's dream becomes a reality once again.
 ""I have no doubt that the Maltese and Gozitans' altruistic spirit and beautiful values will ensure that A Gift with Love with a Difference will be as successful as previous editions,"" Abela said.
 ""We gave Jake our word that every December, we would come here and breathe life back into this hall with this initiative. Let us keep the promise we made to Jake and continue making his dream a reality,"" Abela said.
 Health Minister Jo Etienne Abela, who was present during the visit, described the gesture as one that honours the memory of Vella, a young man who inspired many.
 He recalled that, despite facing numerous challenges, Jake always looked for ways to help others, especially animals.
 The Minister also highlighted the return of the Paw Walk on Sunday, 15 December, a fundraising activity for abandoned animals in support of the AAA Sanctuary, an event originally created by Jake Vella.
 As in previous years, the walk will start from Mater Dei Hospital at 10:00am, and everyone is invited to attend with their pets.
 ""I am certain that, once again, the Maltese and Gozitans will show their support and ensure that A Gift with Love with a Difference is a success like the past editions. I am confident this is what Jake envisioned for this year: helping as many sanctuaries and animals as possible,"" Abela said.
