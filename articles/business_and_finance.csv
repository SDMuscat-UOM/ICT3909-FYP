Finance Minister: Making COLA tax-free would create 'two classes of workers',timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/finance-minister-defends-decision-keep-tax-cola.1100319,30-10-2024,001767.png,"Removing tax from the Cost of Living Adjustment would lead to having ""two classes of workers"", Finance Minister Clyde Caruana said on Wednesday. 
 Caruana argued that the anomaly would arise because thousands of workers covered by collective bargaining deals do not receive COLA. 
 Instead, those workers tend to have an annual increase included as part of their agreements.
 “If we implement the PN’s proposal, we’ll end up with two classes of workers: those who are taxed on their annual increase, because they don’t get COLA, and those who aren’t,” Caruana said.
 The minister was speaking at the tax and customs offices in Qormi two days after he unveiled the Budget for 2025. 
 The Opposition, which has long called for the government to make COLA tax-exempt, noted after the budget that the proposal was ignored.  
 Caruana said the budget's headline measure - a widening of tax bands that will effectively reduce workers' tax burden - was only possible thanks to improved tax collection by the tax department.
 He said the tax cuts announced on Monday ""would have been impossible without the tax department's effective work.”
 In the first six months of this year alone, the government collected €300 million more than in the previous year, Caruana said.
 The tax changes Caruana announced during the Budget 2025 speech on Monday are projected to cost the government €140 million in all. 
 They will see income tax bands broadened, allowing single workers to avoid tax on their first €12,000 in 2025.
  Married people, who make up around 14% of all taxpayers, will see a similar increase in tax-free income from €12,700 to €15,000, while parents will not be taxed on the first €13,000 of their income.
 Caruana was also asked why the government decided to reduce taxes instead of collecting more revenue to spend on capital projects - a concern raised by the Malta Employers Association in its pre-budget document.
 Caruana argued that capital spending is strong despite the tax cuts, saying that this year capital expenditure will top €1 billion. Over the past two years, the government has increased its capital expenditure budget by €250 million, he said.
 The government has enough money to invest in energy infrastructure, Caruana insisted.
 Tax cuts made sense because ""it was time to give something to the middle class, which has contributed so much to the country’s economic growth,” he said.

"‘If we want to become a blockchain island, we don’t have to ask permission’",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/if-want-blockchain-island-don-t-ask-permission.1093687,27-06-2024,001529.png,"Four years ago, a tech start-up co-founded by Maltese entrepreneur Max Thake had just attracted €750,000 in investment and was looking to reach €5 million.
 At the time, Thake spoke with passion about the start-up’s blockchain-based technology called ‘peaq’ and said he and his colleagues were “looking to the future”.
 The future is now, and judging by recent developments the platform has continued to grow.
 Recently, peaq secured $35 million in two rounds of private and public funding and is now valued at a third of a billion dollars.
 Commenting on the technology’s meteoric rise, Thake, who lives as a digital nomad, said it was “crazy to see it grow so much,” but said it was “still only a fraction of what we envisage”.
 Peaq is a technology for building networks that connects users to crowd-sourced information and services by linking and monetising internet-connected devices.
 Thake and his colleagues think peaq won’t just be a successful venture; they believe it has the potential to change the world by ushering in a new era of democratised, user-owned industries.
 And judging by the latest round of funding, they’re not the only ones. So, what is the secret to their continued success?
 “Resilience; we had to go to hell and back to make this a success,” Thake said, adding he hoped peaq’s success could serve as an inspiration for young technology enthusiasts in Malta.
 Stressing the importance of “vision, passion and adaptability”, the young entrepreneur said he and his colleagues had learned how to “take the hits and make the changes that are necessary”. 
 But with blockchain technology – a decentralised sequential list of encrypted records called ‘blocks’ that can be used to store information such as financial transactions – being complex and arguably still viewed with scepticism, what has been the reaction of family and friends to his venture?
 “Sometimes I almost got that look of, ‘oh, that’s sweet’ – especially in my early 20s,” he said, but noted that as the technology became more widely known and the start-up grew, attitudes had changed.
 Asked if he had always gravitated towards technology, Thake said his co-founder Leonard Dorlöchter was “the tech guy”, with his own role “more on the creative side and setting the long-term vision for the company...”
 Describing the technology underpinning the platform as the “next evolutionary step of the internet,” Thake explained how peaq connects users and devices on vast networks that offer crowd-sourced alternatives to company-driven solutions.
 Such alternatives could offer services like ride hailing, communal 3D printing and goods deliveries, provide information on traffic and pollution and even establish crowd-sourced infrastructure such as WiFi and 5G networks, he said.
 Networks powered by peaq offer information and services to users while putting power – and money – back into the hands of those who provide the service.
 The more a user contributes to the network, the more they are rewarded in peaq tokens, which afford the user more of a say in how the network develops and which can also be exchanged for regular currency, he explained. 
 Think cooperatives, but high-tech.
 “In the past, the internet put power into the hands of a few, and there’s enormous inequality in the world today... but peaq doesn’t rely on Google or other big companies,” Thake said.
  Using ride hailing as an example, the entrepreneur said a network offering a service like Uber would be able to do so more competitively while avoiding the fees leveraged by such platforms.
 “The network will be able to undercut companies like Uber at a rate they can’t compete with, essentially using their own business model against them,” he said, stressing that unlike existing platforms, drivers would earn money while owning a part of the network.
 “The long-term vision is to power the ‘Economy of Things’,” said Thake, referencing an economic model where internet-connected devices – the so-called ‘internet of things’ including health trackers and charging stations, for example – generate cryptocurrency as they provide data to others.
 Emphasising that peaq is focused on providing “real-life solutions”, Thake pointed to an app called Silencio, which monitors background noise and combines that with readings from other users to help people make informed decisions about where they live or go on holiday.
 As the app collects data, the user is rewarded with tokens which can then be traded or sold in a similar way to shares in a traditional company.
 So, what makes peaq different to a traditional company?
 “This technology is about giving up power, giving it back to the people,” said Thake, contrasting this with established models where, as a business grows, a controlling minority continues to exert most of the influence.
 Despite the promises of blockchain technologies and in particular cryptocurrencies, a branch of the blockchain, in recent years the tech world has been rocked by a series of high-profile scandals involving the technology.
 In March, disgraced former cryptocurrency whizzkid Sam Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison and ordered to pay $11 billion in damages after being found guilty of defrauding investors.
 Do they worry Thake?
 “It’s annoying; every time this kind of thing happens, we think, ‘here we go again’, he said, but stressed he was confident that despite the short-term damage, such scandals “won’t sink the industry,” while cautioning against blindly investing in new technologies.
 And while Malta’s forays into the blockchain world haven’t always gone smoothly – its infamous ‘blockchain island’ marketing drive derided as a flop after failing to attract tech start-ups – Thake doesn’t think a government-led approach is the right one and instead argues for a crowd-driven embrace of crowd-sourced technology.
 If we want to become a blockchain island, we don’t have to ask permission.”

Malta Enterprise signs deal with semiconductor research leaders Imec,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/malta-enterprise-signs-deal-semiconductor-research-leaders-imec.1091946,05-04-2024,001545.png,"Malta Enterprise has signed a deal with international microelectronics research centre Imec (Interuniversity Microelectronics Centre).
 The memorandum of understanding will enable University and MCAST students to get better access to Imec facilities during their postgraduate studies, facilitate Malta-based firms in the sector in obtaining Imec start-up support and provide them with opportunities to expand their business.
 Imec is a world-leading R&D and innovation hub in nanoelectronics and digital technologies that is headquartered in Belgium.
 The EU has made a concerted effort to ramp up EU-led research and production of microchips, as fears about the reliance on foreign manufacturing in places like Taiwan and the US grow.
 In 2023 it introduced the European Chips Act, intended to make it easier to tap funding related to semiconductor-related industries. The act is expected to lead to more than €15 billion in additional public and private investment in the EU’s semiconductor sector.
 As part of that EU-led initiative, Malta obtained approval to inject €20 million in state aid into Malta-based semiconductor manufacuter STMicroelectronics. The company will use that money to upgrade its production lines.
 The local semiconductor industry contributes around 15 per cent of Malta’s exported goods and generates around 8 per cent of all employment in the manufacturing sector, the government said in a statement announcing the Imec deal.
 Economy Minister  Silvio Schembri, who presided over the signing ceremony between Malta Enterprise and Imec, said the government wants to encourage start-ups n the sector and make it easier for them to access European infrastructure.
 “I am optimistic that with the right strategy, we can achieve this,” he said.
 Malta Enterprise CEO Kurt Farrugia said the MOU with Imec was “a first initiative and an important step in our strategy. It will be further enhanced with a dedicated semiconductor strategy, which we will be working on in the months to come.”
  Jo de Boeck, Executive Vice President and Corporate Strategy Officer at Imec, said Malta was doing well to make use of the EU Chips Act.
 “I believe Malta can bring a lot to the table. The investment being made by the country in the IPCEI and the setting up of a competence centre will certainly bring a new wave of innovation.,” he said.

"Church deficit narrows from €7m to €325,000 - financial report for 2023 shows",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/church-deficit-narrows-7m-325000-financial-report-2023-shows.1096380,08-06-2024,"001560.png,001561.png,001562.png","The Church in Malta “did better than expected” in the 2023 financial year and narrowed its deficit to just over €325,000 from €7 million in the previous year.
 Church officials said on Tuesday that the improved financial situation was due to several factors that included more income, controlled expenditure and a record €7.22 million in APS bank dividends.
 Speaking at a press conference to present the financial report of the Archdiocese of Malta for 2023, administrative secretary Michael Pace Ross said that during 2023 the archdiocese  -  which encompasses around 120 entities and employs 1,369 people -  operated on an income of €59.9 million while the expenditure stood at €60.4 million.
 Despite the shortfall of some €325,000, the Church increased subsidies to its entities by 33%, with the bulk of funds directed towards children’s homes - where subsidies increased by €180,000 to reach €406,000 last year.
 In 2023 the homes were at full capacity hosting 41 children. Investments were made in the homes to ensure that the children felt they lived in a home and not an institute, he said.
 “The children are our future and, if we don’t look after them, no one will,"" Pace Ross said.
 Another cost, he said, was the staff, with more professionals needing to be engaged as nuns retired.
 Revenue increased to €59.9m in 2023 compared to €52.6m in 2022. Income from collections received by parishes went up by 20% to reach €3m. However, revenue from donations decreased from €6.4m to €5.8m.
  There was a doubling in inheritances, mostly through Dar tal-Providenza, that spiralled from €452,821 to €909,699. Income from property rental and sale of property rose by €2.05m to reach €1.8m for rental and €3.2m for sale. Investment income increased to €10.23m and included €7.22m in APS gross dividends 
 The Mdina Cathedral Museum and Mosta Basilica registered a 55% and 21% increase respectively in visitors with generated income increasing by €730,000.
 Expenditure by the archdiocese increased by €6.04m compared to the previous year. Salary costs accounted for 61% amounting to €36.8m up from €33.6m in 2022.
 This went to pay the salaries of 1,067 full-timers and 302 part-timers at the Curia, priests, children's homes, the homes for the elderly and persons with disability; the Archbishop’s Seminary and Sacred Heart College; monasteries and sextons.
 Operational and maintenance costs, including the conservation and restoration of ecclesiastical heritage, increased by €2.52m reaching €18.8m while tax amounted to €2.5m.
 Asked why the archdiocese did not intervene to fund needed restoration works at Paola parish church, Pace Ross explained that the curia usually helped parishes with funding, loans and subsidies.
 In this case the €400,000 fee was too large to fork out at one go so the proposed café was to create a steady income stream. Once the government stepped in, it was a win-win situation.
  He added that church continued to subsidise entities with the highest increase going to children’s homes. The Church, he said, has been making every effort to help families and individuals seeking assistance, and various initiatives were underway aimed at furthering the Church’s mission.
 “Through the LOOP Parish Diaconia initiative, 870 people received food and 380 were the beneficiaries of clothing. Last year, the Church also opened Il-Kċina ta’ Marta at the Archbishop’s Seminary in Tal-Virtù - supported by a team of dedicated volunteers and the Alfred Mizzi Foundation. It provides more than 1,200 meals a week to those in need,” he said.
 In addition to this, Maltese parishes received over 1,300 requests to provide individuals and families with food hampers, medicines and other necessities. Some of these requests were one-time needs, while others are ongoing.
 The Archdiocese of Malta also assisted survivors of earthquakes in Turkey and Syria, hosted foreign priests at Casa Fratelli Tutti, and facilitated the participation of 565 youths at the World Youth Day in Lisbon.
 Last month, the archdiocese also donated Dar Saura in Rabat - a former residence for the elderly valued at €25m - to The Malta Trust Foundation, which will transform the property into a music and arts centre for children with disabilities.

Corinthia unveils a €150m crown jewel in the heart of Brussels,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/corinthia-unveils-150m-brussels-hotel-astoria.1102200,12-09-2024,"001563.png,001564.png,001565.png","Corinthia now has a presence in the heart of Brussels following a €150 million rebuild and restoration of the historic Grand Hotel Astoria.
 Situated on Rue Royale in the Notre Dame aux Neiges district, the Corinthia Brussels opens on Monday and is the latest jewel in the Malta-based hotel group’s crown. 
 Formerly the Grand Hotel Astoria, the iconic Belle Époque landmark has undergone a complete transformation, now featuring 126 rooms and suites, and a subterranean spa.
 It is the second new hotel that Corinthia has launched in as many months, following the opening of The Surrey, A Corinthia Hotel in New York’s Upper East Side of Manhattan.
  The Malta-founded and publicly traded Corinthia Group owns and operates high-end hotels across the globe, in major cities including London, Budapest, St Petersburg and Lisbon. Other properties in Bucharest, Doha, Riyadh and Rome are in the pipeline.  
 Last week, the company said it was exploring further investment opportunities in tandem with the Kuwait-based Action Real Estate Company. 
 Commissioned by royal decree and designed by Henri Van Dievoet, the Grand Hotel Astoria was originally conceived as a palace to host distinguished guests of the King of Belgium.
 It first opened in 1910 and was considered one of the finest hotels in the world. With its era-defining architecture and opulent interiors, it became synonymous with elegance, hosting illustrious guests like Winston Churchill and Andy Warhol. 
  The hotel shut down in 2007. In 2016, the Corinthia Group purchased the property and began preparations to bring it back to life. Works began four years ago and have now been completed. 
 The original façade and first floor of the hotel were preserved, with works undertaken in collaboration with Urban Brussels and the Royal Commission. 
 The hotel features two Michelin-starred Belgian chefs in Davide Martin and Christophe Hardiquest and a bar led by mixologist Hannah von Ongevalle. An excavated floor beneath the hotel hosts a 1,200 square metre spa with seven private treatment rooms, a steam room, sauna, experience showers, tea room and fitness centre with personal training by former British Army physical training instructor Paul Tucker. 
 QP, a Corinthia Group company, handled the design and project management of the restoration project, while the Group’s hotel operating arm, Corinthia Hotels, will operate it. 
 Corinthia Group CEO Simon Naudi said the Corinthia Brussels “has brought out the best in our Group and highlights our quite unique involvement as investors, developers and operators.” 
 Simon Casson, CEO of Corinthia Hotels, said the hotel will redefine “what luxury hospitality can be.” 
 Reuben Xuereb, CEO of QP, said the project to restore the hotel was a complex one. 
 “Under the watchful eye of the local heritage authorities, we have painstakingly worked with leading contractors, craftsmen and artisans to recreate one of Europe’s finest hotels,” he said.

Scam Facebook page imitates Gozo business,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/scam-facebook-page-imitates-gozo-business.1102510,17-12-2024,"001566.png,001567.png,001568.png","A technology company in Gozo is the latest target of a Facebook page that imitates genuine businesses to scam customers.
 The owner of Infotech Enterprises Ltd said he was “alarmed” after a customer came to his shop asking to collect a phone he claimed to have ordered online. Another called asking about delivery for a games console they had paid a deposit for.
 The shop has not sold consumer electronics for around a decade, now dealing in IT and security systems.
 Speaking to Times of Malta, the owner, who asked not to be named, said he was worried people would pay money for items they would not receive, adding: “I don’t want to be accused of anything.”
  When he investigated the incidents, he discovered a Facebook page operating under the name ‘Infotech Gozo’ sporting almost identical branding to his genuine business.
 It is the same page involved in another scam Times of Malta exposed six months ago, however the details have been changed to imitate Attard’s business.
 In June, the owner of San Ġwann-based audio shop FutureTech Pro contacted the police after receiving scores of complaints from people scammed by a Facebook page with a similar name to his business.
 The ‘Future Tech’ page responsible for the complaints was traced to a defunct technology shop in Gozo by the same name and was used to scam victims out of payments for games consoles, smart watches and other items that never turned up.
 Screenshots of recent messages between customers and the page show its operators providing prices of items and asking for deposits while supplying Revolut account details.
  Highlighting the dangers posed to customers, Infotech’s owner said: “We believe this issue deserves further attention to prevent more people from falling victim to this scam and to protect the reputation of legitimate businesses like ours.”
 The ‘Infotech Gozo’ page was briefly shut down by Meta – the parent company of Facebook – earlier this week but by the next day, the page reappeared sporting the same name and branding.
 Infotech’s owner said his business would continue to fight for the page to be removed from Facebook.
 He initially did not report it to the police, describing it as “useless” because of the previous report. However, he plans to alert the cybercrime unit if it “pops up again”.
 Last year, consumers in Malta lost some €12.5 million to scams and online fraud, an increase of 50 per cent over the €8.5 million lost in 2022, according to police figures. In February, Home Affairs Minister Byron Camilleri tabled figures in parliament showing that the number of online scams reported to the police had more than doubled over the same two years, reaching just over 2,500 reports in 2023.

APS ‘exploring growth’ but won’t comment on HSBC reports,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/aps-exploring-growth-won-t-comment-hsbc-reports.1100358,31-10-2024,001692.png,"APS bank “owes it to its shareholders” to explore opportunities for growth, APS bank CEO Marcel Cassar said on Thursday, stopping shy of commenting on reports of the bank’s negotiations to purchase HSBC Malta.
 Cassar said that the bank is “continuously analysing opportunities that may arise in our natural market.""
 ""We believe that there is a lot of potential in the bank that is yet to be unleashed, so we owe it to our stakeholders to explore possibilities to gain scale”.
 But Cassar would not comment on reports about negotiations, saying that the “as a responsible listed bank, we will inform the market through company announcements whenever there is anything to report”.
 Cassar was speaking as the bank presented its financial results for the first nine months of the year, which saw the pre-tax profits dip to just under €15m from the €23.6m registered at this point last year.
 The overall group’s profits were slightly higher than those of the bank, at €16.5m, although these also lagged behind last year’s €23.3m.
 These numbers are “not a surprise,” Cassar said.
 “We started anticipating that the high interest rate environment, coupled with the buildup of the bank’s rights issue was piling pressure on our margins and squeezing our income.”
 The results also reflect the bank’s policy to pass down the European Central Bank’s interest rate cuts to its customers, Cassar added.
 “The impact on our finances has been significant, but we are seeing improving margins and expect them to improve further in the last quarter of the year.”
 Despite the drop in profits, the bank said several aspects of its operations performed strongly, from the growth in its business and loan books to the increase in assets under its management.
 Notably, APS CFO Ronald Mizzi said that the bank’s home loan portfolio had now grown to over €2b, just short of a quarter of the entire market. In practice, Mizzi said, this means that 45% of every new home loan throughout 2024 is being financed by APS.
 The bank’s overall loan book, including home loans, grew by €226.6m to now stand at €3.1b, with commercial and syndicated loans also showing “cautious growth”.
 Meanwhile, the bank’s customer deposits saw a 10% rise, some €305.3m, since the beginning of the year, now standing at €3.4b.
 Nevertheless, the bank is looking to raise more capital through a new rights issue. While this was initially planned to take place at the end of this year, this will now likely take place in the first half of 2025, Cassar said.

Regulator to probe claim of MIA shares ‘insider trading’,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/regulator-probe-claim-mia-shares-insider-trading.1096318,08-05-2024,001827.png,"A financial regulator will evaluate claims that Malta International Airport shares were “illicitly” traded shortly before the announcement of its financial results and “highest” interim dividend to date.
 Stockbroker Paul Bonello flagged on Facebook how there was a sudden jump in share trades hours before MIA’s board announced its half-yearly financial results and the dividend payments to shareholders.
 Bonello said the timing of the trades just before the dividend announcement was indicative of insider trading, which is prohibited.
 Insider trading occurs when a person uses or attempts to use inside information from a company for his own benefit or for the benefit of others.
 In comments to Times of Malta, an MFSA official said the regulator takes such allegations seriously.
 “As per MFSA internal procedures, the necessary reviews/evaluations will be made for the appropriate action to be taken, both from a supervisory perspective, as well as in terms of enforcement, if need be,” the official said.
 MIA poured cold water on the claim in a company announcement on Thursday.
 It said the company disclosed on July 18 that the board of directors would consider the proposal of an interim dividend at a meeting held on August 1.
 MIA said it has a significant track record of communication with the market, as it regularly issues monthly announcements on passenger numbers, quarterly financial statements and company updates ahead of board meetings scheduled to consider the approval of financial statements and the declaration of dividends.
 A company spokesperson told Times of Malta MIA has formally requested the MFSA to “inquire further into this matter”.
 According to airport financial figures released on Thursday, MIA generated €66.4 million in revenue over the first half of the year, netting €22.1 million in profits.
 MIA CEO Alan Borg said during a press conference that the company’s solid financial performance enabled it to distribute its highest interim dividend to date to shareholders and continue to invest in the development of MIA.

Construction continued to slow down in 2023: Central Bank,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/construction-continued-slow-2023-central-bank.1091691,29-04-2024,001873.png,"The construction sector show­ed signs of continued slowdown last year, employing more workers but dropping in productivity, according to Central Bank of Malta figures.
 The largest drop in productivity across the economy last year was in construction, which declined by almost 13%, the bank said in its annual report for last year.
 It noted that while employment in the sector grew by 5%, its output decreased by 8%, leading to an overall slump in productivity. At the same time, its share of the total value added to the economy fell by almost a fifth.
 Meanwhile, the number of Planning Authority residential and commercial permits drop­p­ed by around 15%, while investment dwindled and confidence in the sector plummeted to its lowest levels since the pandemic, the report showed.
 The bank said residential construction was expected to “decline marginally” this year amid “weak sentiment” in the sector and “increasingly binding” labour shortages.
 However, it noted that despite the slowdown, construction was still expected to deliver “modest growth” this year with employment in the sector also forecast to improve over the next three years.
 Despite confidence in construction dropping by more than 80%, the bank noted it was still “firmly above” the historical average.
 The central bank’s annual report cements similar findings last year pointing to a slowdown within the construction industry.
 In August, auditing giant KPMG said the sector had shrunk by 14% in the first three months of 2023 when compared to the same period in 2022, a trend it said at the time had been ongoing for a year and a half.
 And data from the central bank report shows the sector’s Gross Value Added (GVA) has fallen steadily since 2021, dropping by around €40 million each year. During the same period, employment in construction rose by 20% to reach almost 19,000 last year.
 GVA measures the economic value that each individual sector contributes to a country’s economy. Last year, the construction industry’s share of the total GVA fell to 3.4% from 4% the year before.
 Last April, Finance Minister Clyde Caruana hit out at Developers Association president Michael Stivala after the construction mogul claimed the sector was vital for sustaining “health and education, infrastructure and all the other social schemes”.
 Caruana argued instead that the country’s economic growth was mainly driven by other industries, including financial services, gaming and tourism, rather than hinging on the construction industry.
 And the latest report seems to support Caruana’s assertion, with central bank figures revealing that exports ‒ which includes tourism ‒ contributed almost 90% of the country’s 5.6% Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth last year.
 GDP measures the monetary value of all goods and services produced by a country.
 “Services remained the main driver behind the rise in economic activity, adding 4.9 percentage points to real GDP growth”, the financial institution said, pointing to professional and administrative services and financial and insurance activities, among others, as the main drivers of growth.
 Construction, meanwhile, lower­ed GDP growth by 0.3 percentage points due to the value added by the sector falling “for the second consecutive year”, it said. For the second year in a row, construction was the least contributing sector to GDP growth, with Malta’s agricultural sector the only other to contribute negatively.
 Overall, economic growth and inflation both hit 5.6% last year, while the government deficit reached 3.4% of GDP in the third quarter and employment grew by 5.7%.
 The central bank report also reveals that total private and public sector investment drop­ped dramatically last year, falling by 22% after rising by a whopping 31% the year before.
 “The most significant decrease [in investment] was recorded in expenditure on transport equipment, reflecting a decrease in registrations of aircraft from the very high level recorded a year earlier,” the report said.
 “Investment in other buildings and dwellings also declined. On the other hand, investment in intellectual property increased, while investment in cultivated biological resources remained broadly stable.”
 The central bank predicts Malta’s GDP will continue to grow over the next three years, but at a slower rate than last year.
 Growth is expected to reach 4.4% this year, 3.6% next year and 3.3% in 2026, while government debt as a percentage of GDP is expected to increase to 54.3% by 2026.
 The rate of increase in employment is expected to halve to 3.2% this year while unemployment is set to rise marginally over the next three years.
 And while there is good news for consumers, with inflation expected to almost halve this year to 2.9%, exports are antici­pated to reduce drastically this year through to 2026 amid geopolitical tensions and trade disruptions.

From 'here for the long run' to 'strategic review': HSBC changes mind on Malta,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/from-here-long-run-strategic-review-hsbc-changes-mind-malta.1097910,09-11-2024,"002290.png,002291.png,002292.png,002293.png","For years, HSBC Malta has been reassuring its customers that it is going to stay put in the country, but a new company announcement has cast its future in serious doubt.
 That HSBC has been quietly chipping away at its European operations and pivoting towards growing its presence in Asia is no secret.
 Reports last year revealed that it would be selling or drastically streamlining its presence in 12 European countries, effectively slashing a fifth of its operations.
 Sales across several countries followed, from France to Greece to Russia.
 Malta had long been rumoured to be on the chopping block, a suggestion frequently dismissed by HSBC Malta.
 HSBC is in Malta “for the long run”, HSBC Malta CEO Geoffrey Fichte told  Times of Malta just eight months ago.
 “I could speak until I’m blue in the face but you just need to look at what we’re doing in Malta,” he said, pointing to the company’s new €30m headquarters, when asked whether the bank is looking for an escape route.
  The bank's announcement on the stock exchange that ""it will undertake a strategic review"" indicates a change of mind. 
 But the signs had been piling up for some time.
 In October 2019, the bank shut down several of its branches and ATMs across the island, from Ħamrun to  St Julian’s and Marsascala, ostensibly to “focus on digital banking services”.
 One month later, the bank announced it would shed 180 of its workers in a €16m voluntary redundancy scheme.
 A 2020 Financial Times report suggesting that the bank was looking into whether to sell or shutter its operations across several of its smaller markets, including Malta, was met with silence, with the bank simply saying that its policy was “not to comment on speculative stories”.
 Wednesday’s announcement marks a clear change of tone. Although the bank’s statement stops short of tracing the bank’s plans in Malta, it is the first admission that there could be cracks in the armour, which could widen once the bank’s “strategic review” is completed.
 It remains to be seen whether the strategic review will bring  HSBC Malta’s almost quarter-century presence in Malta to an end.
 The bank’s introduction to Malta on the eve of the millenium was no less controversial. On 2 June 1999, the Maltese government handed over its 67.1% stake in Mid-Med Bank to Midland Bank PLC, a member of the HSBC group.
  The Lm91 million (roughly €191m) deal, brokered by then-Finance minister John Dalli, was widely seen to come short of the bank’s true value, with the government’s move harshly criticised by the opposition and bankers.
 Then-opposition leader Alfred Sant called for Dalli’s resignation, arguing that Mid-Med Bank’s sale should have been opened up to offers from other potential buyers. Meanwhile, Mid-Med Bank’s former chair, Alfred Mifsud, insisted that the bank had been sold for well under its true value.
  The sale also included the only painting of Malta by one of England’s most beloved Romantic painter, J.M.W. Turner, which had been recently purchased by Mid-Med Bank.
 The painting, depicting Malta’s Grand Harbour, was eventually loaned to the Museum of Fine Arts and remains at MUŻA  on a  permanent loan from HSBC.
 But, Dalli rebutted, HSBC’s introduction to Malta would place Malta “more securely on the international financial map” and bring about “a quantum leap in the the banking sector in Malta”.
 Meanwhile, HSBC Malta’s profits soared by 30% each year, rising from €32m in 2000, its first full year in Malta, to almost €120m in the span of just a handful of years.
 The bank reported profits of €134m last year and €39.3m in the first three months of 2024.
 But these profits will mean little to the bank’s thousands of customers and roughly 9,000 investors, who will be awaiting the outcome of the bank’s strategic review with bated breath.

Farsons reports €9.6 million pre-tax profit for first half of the year,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/farsons-reports-96-million-pretax-profit-first-half-year.1098573,26-09-2024,002296.png,"The Farsons Group has reported a profit before tax of €9.6 million for the first half of the year.
 It said the results for the first six months of 2024 showcased its ability to navigate evolving market conditions through the implementation of strategic initiatives.
 ""The Group’s diverse business portfolio and proactive management efforts were instrumental in delivering this performance, despite challenges in certain sectors.""
 Group turnover for the first six months rose by 7%, to €69.8 million, with profit before tax up 18% to €9.6 million.
 Group Chairman Louis A Farrugia attributed the growth to operational efficiencies and strategic investments.
 The Beverage and Food segments saw increases of 6.6% and 8.2% with improved profit margins of 15.8% and 10.8% driven by higher demand and cost control measures.
 Earnings per share (EPS) rose by 17%, from €0.209 to €0.245, reflecting the group’s strong performance and commitment to maximizing shareholder returns.
 Group CEO Norman Aquilina, noted broad growth across all sectors in the first six months driven by changing  demographics, increased tourism, and a growing supplier base.
 ""Despite fierce competition in the importation sector, which impacted profit margins, the group's diverse  business model helped mitigate pressures. Strong performance in the manufacturing sector and franchised restaurants offset the margin mitigation, highlighting the group’s resilience and the success of its strategic initiatives focused on innovation, efficiency and margin optimisation,"" he was quoted as saying in a statement.
 Farrugia emphasised the group’s ongoing commitment to long-term growth and sustainability with focus on reinvesting profits to modernise operations. Farsons is nearing completion of a major renewable energy project to expand its photovoltaic capacity, and is developing a CO2 recovery plant to enhance sustainability and strengthen its production supply chain.  
 A major investment in the food sector is underway with the construction of a state-of-the-art logistics center and office complex in Ħandaq, set for completion by 2026. This will expand warehousing and operational capacity to support the growth of subsidiaries Quintano Foods and Food Chain.
 The group’s strategic review of its Foods business, which is nearing completion, includes evaluating the potential benefits of structuring the expanded operations into a separate listed entity. The board is expected to present detailed proposals to shareholders in the near future.
 Looking ahead to the second half of the financial year, the group said it expects a moderation in performance due to seasonal factors that typically affect demand in the latter part of the year.

Watch: ‘Malta’s economy is in need of CPR’ -  Chamber CEO Marthese Portelli,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/watch-malta-economy-need-cpr-chamber-ceo-marthese-portelli.1097504,09-02-2024,002340.png,"Malta’s economy is overheating and the time for incremental changes has passed, the Malta Chamber’s CEO has warned.
 Marthese Portelli is adamant the country now requires comprehensive and immediate action to address its economic challenges.
 “The country needs CPR. We need a government that connects, plans and reforms,” Portelli insists in an interview with Times of Malta.
 In its pre-budget 2025 document published last week, the Malta Chamber of Commerce urges a shift in the country’s economic strategy towards high-value industries, improved governance, and more prudent management of public resources.
 “We need to speed up the implementation process of all the decisions that need to be taken in the interest of Malta, some of which might not be exactly popular immediately in the short term but will be of benefit to the country in the longer term.”
  “Malta is nearing breaking point, with full employment putting immense pressure on the nation’s infrastructure, particularly in areas such as traffic management and utilities.”
 She says the Malta Chamber has long championed a transition from a labour-intensive economy to one focused on high-value industries.
 While the influx of foreign workers has been necessary in certain sectors, Portelli contends it has done little to enhance the skills and expertise crucial to building a high-value-added economy.
 To tackle these challenges, she advocates a sweeping overhaul of the education system, a stronger emphasis on digitalisation and automation, and a more strategic approach to attracting highly skilled foreign workers.
 These measures are essential for Malta to reduce its reliance on population growth and move towards a more sustainable economic model.
 The Malta Chamber is critical of the government’s handling of third-country nationals (TCNs – foreign workers from outside the EU) in the labour market.
 In its pre-budget document, the Malta Chamber calls for a more selective approach, proposing caps on TCNs in certain industries, particularly those already facing oversupply, such as construction.
 While acknowledging the need for TCNs in essential services and sectors such as tourism, Portelli warns against an unchecked influx that does not significantly contribute to the country’s skill base.
 Portelli also questioned the government’s financial strategy, expressing concern over proposed tax cuts that the prime minister has described as historic.
 “I just hope it will not just be another handout sent by post, first of all, because it is totally environmentally unsustainable, and also because we believe that if we need an impetus in spending power, it needs to be given gradually through salaries paid per year.”
 She cautions against implementing these cuts without a clear plan to fund them, particularly in light of Malta’s current excessive deficit.
 “Such fiscal measures could jeopardise essential public services and infrastructure projects,” she says.
 A key recommendation from the Chamber is for the government to shift its focus from recurrent expenditure to capital investment. Malta’s infrastructure, especially in energy and transportation, is in dire need of modernisation, she says.
 The Malta Chamber is particularly concerned about the current energy distribution network’s inadequacies, which are stifling economic growth and hindering the country’s ability to meet renewable energy targets.
 Portelli supports a gradual reduction in energy subsidies, even though the Malta Chamber’s members stand to lose. She advocates for the savings to be redirected towards supporting companies and individuals investing in renewable energy solutions.
 She also raised concerns about the Planning Authority’s continued approval of permits despite evidence of oversupply, suggesting the construction industry needs to be realigned to meet the country’s needs.
 “Studies show us we have an oversupply of office space and yet the Planning Authority keeps issuing permits for office buildings. The same applies to supermarkets and shopping malls.  Do we really need more?”
 Portelli also called for the revision of the Strategic Plan for Environment and Development (SPED) which is four years late.
 “We have a version dated 2015 which states that the document should have been revisited by 2020.”
 Governance is another area where the Chamber sees significant room for improvement.
 “We have consistently called for greater transparency and accountability in public procurement, suggesting a public procurement outlook that would detail the government’s spending plans for the next six to 12 months.”
 Portelli argues that such measures would reduce reliance on direct orders and ensure a more competitive and efficient use of public funds.
 She reiterates the Malta Chamber’s call for a moratorium on new hotel developments, citing the strain on Malta’s infrastructure and the need to prioritise quality over quantity in tourism.
 “In Valletta there are boutique hotels which cannot operate properly because of the inadequate distribution network. We have had boutique hotels that had to switch off their lift if they have a kitchen operating in full flow. Is this the product we are offering,” she asks.
 Throughout the interview, Portelli emphasised Chamber’s commitment to ethical business practices.
 She advocates for the introduction of a whitelisting system to ensure that govern­ment entities engage with reputable suppliers and a blacklisting system to hold defaulting contractors accountable.
 This, she argued, would protect both businesses and consumers by promoting transparency and ethical standards.
 Last year the Malta Chamber put forward 219 proposals, but only four – or the equivalent of 1.8 per cent – were taken on in full by the government. Likewise, only 20 per cent of the Malta Chamber’s 2020 document on good governance has been implemented so far.
 And yet Portelli does not feel discouraged. Asked whether her organisation feels it has the government’s ear, she says “we feel that government hears us but does not listen to us properly. Implementation is not exactly there.”
 One of the problems recently highlighted by the Malta Chamber is the frequent turnover in CEO positions at major government entities.
 Insisting that CEOs should be appointed on merit and competitively and transparently, just like in the private sector, Portelli argues that “every time the top management of a government agency changes, we have to start from scratch. We cannot afford to continue repeating the same things year in, year out while nothing gets done.
 “The traffic congestion is one such situation,” she says. “Years ago, we presented the government with proposals, but the gridlock keeps getting worse year after year. It gives us the sense that for the government it’s just a matter of plug and play.”

Malta would see 70% rise in hotel rooms if all pipeline projects are completed,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/malta-see-70-rise-hotel-rooms-pipeline-projects-completed.1092855,22-05-2024,002381.png,"Malta could see an additional 483 hotels crop up on the island if all the planned tourism accommodation projects in the pipeline ever come to fruition, new data has shown. 
 The information was shared during the Malta Hotels and Restaurants Association’s hospitality forum during a presentation on hotel occupancy by Deloitte. 
 With a disclaimer stressing that not all projects in the pipeline may materialise, Financial Advisory Director Matthew Xuereb said that, if all of them do come to fruition, this would see a 70% jump in rooms available for tourists in Malta. 
 He also added that due to the nature of these projects, there is no definite timeline on which they may be completed and noted that the data did not take into account any existing property whose use may not remain for tourism purposes in the future. 
 Xuereb said the vast majority of these planned accommodations (41%) are designed to be 3-star offerings, which means such projects might not necessarily align with the national vision to accommodate ""high quality"" tourists. 
 Another 32% of the planned accommodations are labelled as ""other"", while 5-star and 4-star accommodations are set to take up 10% and 18% respectively. 
 Xuereb highlighted his concern about how the majority of the 3-star and ""other"" planned accommodations are set to have less than 100 rooms, throwing into question whether these can actually survive in the long term. 
 Some 1,664 of the planned 3-star accommodation are only planned to have 0-50 rooms, with a further 2,658 planned to have 50 to 100 rooms. 
 Of the accommodations rated as ""other"" 4,165 of these are planned to have 0-50 rooms, with only 116 projects planned for 100-200 rooms. 
 “Looking at planned 5-star and 4-star accommodations, those aren’t small numbers but they could potentially be managed,” Xuereb said. 
 “But when it comes to 3-star and others, where we are looking at an increase of some 10,000 hotel rooms, the majority of which have 50 rooms or less, how can that operate sustainably?” 
 Hoteliers and other stakeholders in the tourism industry have been sounding the alarm on the pace of supply of tourist accommodation since at least 2018, when the MHRA called for a study to determine the maximum amount of tourists Malta could possibly cope with due to its limited size and population density. 
 In 2022, an MHRA-commissioned Deloitte study found that Malta would need to see 4.7 million tourists a year to keep its occupancy rates afloat, although the study stopped short of naming what a sustainable number of tourists the country should aim for. 
 In 2021, an MHRA survey also found that an economic slowdown was on the cards for the Maltese tourism industry irrespective of the COVID-19 pandemic, as a sharp increase of available tourist beds had started to outpace demand for them in 2019. 
 During Xuereb’s presentation on Wednesday, he found that 5-star hotels had managed to stay profitable by upping room rates despite a minor slowdown in occupancy, while hotels that were performing in the median and lower percentile struggled to break even and in some cases were making a loss.

 Many businesses did not wait for Friday to offer their deals, and instead stretched out deals for the whole month of November. 
 
 In a statement, the Malta Chamber of SMEs said that while some businesses experienced very positive sales and some even an increase in sales, others reported a drop compared to the previous year. 
 ""With regards to average spend, some sectors reported lower average spend,"" the chamber reported. 
 It noted how the performance of Black Friday was also influenced by location and weather conditions, impacting customer turnout and sales in some areas. 
 ""In contrast, shopping malls across Malta and Gozo reported strong footfall from early morning and positive sales throughout the day,"" the chamber said.
 ""The extension of promotional offers over the month of November proved beneficial for both customers and businesses.""
 Sectors traditionally associated with Black Friday, such as shops selling electronics, appliances, and homeware achieved the best results, with many offering promotions throughout the month. 
 The results can change, as businesses look forward to the weekend, as most stores will retain their offers.

 In a statement, the bank said that this has enabled it to continue the trend of rewarding shareholders with the highest interim dividend in the past decade. 
 The bank directors have recommended a gross interim dividend of 10 cents per share. 
 HSBC said that profit before tax increased by €19.3m to €78.6m, mainly driven by an increase in revenue due to the higher interest rate environment and higher credit recovery which was partially offset by higher costs as the bank continued to invest. 
 Revenue increased by €21.5m or 20% driven by rising interest rates and a 34% increase in trading income. Progress was also reported in net fee income and income from the insurance subsidiary.
 Costs are €6.6m higher than the same period in 2023. This increase was largely driven by the investment in people, technology as well as the new headquarters in Qormi.
 During the first six months, loans to customers and deposits were slightly lower than those reported up until December 31, 2023.   
 Profit attributable to shareholders of €50.7m for the six months ended June 30 and resulted in earnings per share of 14.1 cents which compared favourably with 10.7 cents in the same period in 2023.
 Return on equity of 18.3% for the past six months compared favourably with 16.2% for the same period in 2023.
 Cost efficiency ratio (‘CER’) improved to 43.9% from 46.6% in the same period last year as the increase in revenue outweighed the increase in costs.
 The bank maintained a strong liquidity and capital position as of June 30, with a   Liquidity Coverage Ratio of 552% and Tier 1 Capital of 21.1%.

Dr Juice begins phasing out single-use cups,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/food-beverages-retailer-dr-juice-begins-phasing-singleuse-cups.1091803,21-06-2024,"002504.png,002505.png","Food and beverages retailer Dr Juice will begin phasing out single-use cups from today, replacing them with reusable plastic cups made in Malta.
 Customers will be able to buy a fresh new cup for €1 or purchase their drink in a pre-used (and pre-washed) cup for an additional 50 cents, while being able to take both home.
 The company has not provided a firm timeline for how long it will take to fully switch over to the new cups but estimates it will take around six months.
 Dr Juice says it is making the switch at no profit while going out of its way to reduce its environmental footprint.
  Speaking to Times of Malta in the run-up to the launch, the company’s founder, John Winfield said its packaging had been troubling him for years, especially when he noticed it littering the streets. 
 “Over the last three to five years, the impact of the amount of packaging that we’re putting out started to weigh on me,” he said, adding the problem had only become worse following the COVID-19 pandemic and the delivery business “exploding”.
 Winfield said that though the company’s cups were biodegradable, they were often not disposed of properly, with many ending up in landfill sites.
 And, while the company had tried introducing stainless steel reusable cups in the past, he said their take-up had been slow, speculating the price tag of around €12 could have been a factor.
 So, for this latest attempt, the company opted for plastic instead, with Winfield explaining the company “needed to create a cup cheap enough for customers to feel it’s not a huge leap to adopt this for every purchase”.
 But he stressed the choice of material wasn’t just about cost; by using plastic and making them in Malta, he says the cups will be able to be recycled while reducing shipping.
 “Imagine shipping 100 of these [cups] in a box – essentially, you’re shipping air... it’s a one-to-20 ratio if we make them in Malta; for every 20 containers we would usually have to import, we only need to bring in one of raw materials,” he said.
 Winfield said the cups were being produced in Malta by local company MCL, which would also have the facility to recycle them. He said the manufacturer was offering to produce them “at cost” with Dr Juice selling them on to customers for the same.
 MCL CEO Luke Satariano said the company had ""created something unique,"" stressing the new cups were the first recyclable offerings on the market designed for multiple use and were easier to recycle due to only being made from one type of plastic.
 Asked about the pre-washed cups available for 50 cents, the Dr Juice boss said the company would wash the cups in water above 65 degrees Celsius, “which kills any bacteria”, before screening them in a ‘UV [ultraviolet] sanitising cube’.
 Describing the re-usable cups as “like a deposit scheme”, Winfield said customers will be reimbursed 50 cents when bringing cups back to outlets to be reused.
 Greenwashing?  
 But with reusable plastic being more energy-intensive to produce than paper alternatives, how does this factor into Dr Juice trying to reduce its environmental footprint?
 “The great thing about this scheme is that because it's done locally, there's a lot less energy used in the process,” he said, pointing to reductions in fuel usage for transportation, something he said was a “huge part” of the energy associated with importing cups to Malta.
 Winfield said the cups would be “used, reused, recycled and remade into something else,” all in Malta, calling the process a “circular economy” and noting it hadn’t been applied to beverage containers in the country before. 
 And while he admitted there was an energy impact associated with the process, he stressed the material requirement of the cups was “the main thing we’re trying to push down”.
 But how would Winfield respond to those who might argue the move could be seen as an example of greenwashing, while Dr Juice continues to burn fuel importing exotic fruits such as pineapples, coconuts and mangoes?
 Winfield said the company used frozen fruit to avoid waste from spoilage but acknowledged that ""operating this business model on an island like Malta, [means] importation of multiple goods is inevitable.”
 However, he said the company aimed to increase their reliance on local suppliers, calling reducing its environmental footprint a “journey”.
 Winfield said Dr Juice also plans to phase out single-use straws in the following months, replacing them with metal alternatives.

IMF again calls on Malta to phase out energy subsidies,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/imf-calls-malta-phase-energy-tariffs.1101178,18-11-2024,002308.png,"The International Monetary Fund, like other international institutions, has projected strong but moderating economic growth for Malta, while repeating previous calls for Malta to phase out its energy subsidies.
 The Fund said in its annual country report that the Maltese economy is projected to grow by 5% in 2024 and 4% in 2025, largely in line with  projections made by the European Commission last week. That will be among the highest in the EU.
 But with the energy subsidies accounting for a fifth of Malta's financial deficit, the IMF says fixed energy price policies should be phased out and the funds allocated for investment (including green) and productivity-enhancing policies.
 ""In line with last year’s staff recommendations, the authorities should gradually but decisively exit the current fixed energy price policy by shifting to more targeted subsidies and strengthening market pricing mechanisms. This will reduce fiscal risks associated with energy price shocks, enhance incentives for energy conservation, and help accelerate the green transition. The resulting fiscal space should be allocated to public investment (including green), services (e.g., education), and innovation support,"" the fund said.
 That recommendation is at variance with declarations by the finance minister last month that the energy subsidies will stay, because they support investment, and their cost as a percentage of GDP and in real terms is well below what it was when they were introduced at the peak of the COVID crisis.
 The Fund also repeated a warning it has been making for years, that Malta should safeguard financial stability by maintaining close monitoring of risks that can arise from banks’ concentrated lending to the real estate sector.
 Malta was also urged to further develop and implement a productivity-driven growth strategy that emphasises innovation, digitalisation, education, training, and environmental sustainability. 
 The fund said developing a long-term fiscal framework is essential for strengthening Malta's policy decision-making and aligning fiscal planning with strategic priorities.  
 ""The authorities should develop a roadmap for corporate income tax (CIT) reform that aligns with the EU’s Minimum Tax Directive (Pillar II) to guide taxpayers and investors. While Malta’s wait-and-see approach—by deferring the implementation of Pillar II—allows for adaptation to international developments, it risks ceding revenue to other jurisdictions that adopt the directive sooner,"" it warned.
 ""The authorities should develop a roadmap that addresses CIT (for both foreign and domestic companies) and personal income tax due to their interaction. The roadmap should be developed and disseminated promptly, pending clarification of rules regarding Qualified Refundable Tax Credits (QRTCs) from the European Commission,"" it said. 
 In other parts of its report, the IMF said Malta's tourism sector ""requires more effective management.""
 With numerous hotel projects underway and a rise in other types of accommodation, tourism may continue to grow significantly, potentially exacerbating labour shortages, infrastructure bottlenecks, and social and environmental concerns. Attention should be given to steadily implementing the Malta Tourism Strategy 2021–2030, which aims to promote sustainable and high-quality tourism,"" it said.

Firm fined for ignoring customer ‘red flags’,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/firm-fined-ignoring-customer-red-flags.1098613,28-09-2024,002501.png,"A corporate services provider has been fined by the Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit (FIAU) for failing to report suspicious activity by a client that handled “millions of euros”.
 The firm, which was not named by the FIAU as it fell under the public reporting threshold, was fined €8,000.
 In a report on its website, the FIAU said the firm knew one of its clients was reportedly convicted for “multiple financial crimes”, including money-laundering tied to fraudulent real estate investments.
 The client had also been “unresponsive” to requests by the firm for client due diligence documents.
 It was only shortly prior to the FIAU’s examination that the firm prepared a memo noting the “red flags” identified, including adverse media coverage and the failure to fulfil persistent requests for due diligence documents.
 Despite the memo recommending the client relationship be terminated and a suspicious transaction report filed with the FIAU, the report was only filed following the completion of the anti-money laundering body’s inspection.
 The customer had also failed to file annual audited financial statements with the business registry for close to a decade.
 It was observed how the last available accounts for the entity serviced by the corporate provider, dating back to 2014, showed “substantive” assets and liabilities reaching into the millions of euros. 
 “The magnitude of these figures indicates that the exposure of this customer to the company, in terms of overall activity is considerable,” the FIAU said.  This illustrates the importance of taking proactive and timely steps when unable to complete due diligence checks, the FIAU continued. It said if there is knowledge or suspicions of money-laundering, this must be reported to the FIAU without undue delay.
 Multiple court decisions over the past years have struck down FIAU fines for being “unconstitutional”.

Is Malta being overrun by supermarkets?,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/is-malta-overrun-supermarkets.1098617,29-09-2024,"002562.png,002563.png,002564.png","September has been particularly busy for supermarkets.
 Early in the month, ARD Discount, a popular Italian discount store, opened its first Maltese outlet in Mellieħa, just 100 metres up the road from the town’s Welbee’s supermarket.
 A day earlier, the Planning Authority had given its go-ahead for a new Lidl outlet in Qormi, on the site of former General Soft Drinks Factory, nestled between its existing Qormi outlet and the soon-to-be-opened Lidl on the former Cortis site in Żebbuġ.
 Meanwhile, Lidl’s plans to expand even further hit a stumbling block when the competition regulator blocked the Italian giant’s plans to buy Scotts supermarket in Żabbar, saying that it would become too dominant in the south.
 In the midst of this, the Malta Chamber questioned whether Malta needs more supermarkets, suggesting that we may have reached saturation point.
 With the country’s population continuing to grow, and spikes in food inflation in recent years, it is no surprise to find that people in Malta spent more on food last year than at any other point in recent history.
 Maltese households spent €1.2 billion on food shopping in 2023, rising to over €1.5b if we include cigarettes and alcohol. This means that each person in Malta spent a little over €2,000 on groceries throughout the year, together with another €600 on tobacco and alcohol. Not to mention the money spent on other products typically sold at supermarkets, from toiletries to household goods, pet food and garden equipment.
 This is set to rise even further this year, if trends during the first half of the year are anything to go by, with expenditure during the first six months of 2024 above that of the same period the previous year.
 
 People spend over a tenth of their income on grocery shopping, with only housing (including electricity bills) and restaurants and hotel stays proving more costly.
 So, in theory, the introduction of more competition across the supermarket sector is welcome, potentially driving grocery prices down and leaving people with more money in their pockets.
 It’s hard to tell for sure.
 A 2020 exercise by Malta’s competition regulator, MCCAA, found there were around 400 grocery shops across Malta and Gozo, from large chain supermarkets to small corner shops.
 This is likely to have increased slightly over the past four years, as new retailers moved into Malta and existing operators looked to expand their business, but it is unclear how much of this has been at the expense of more traditional grocery shops.
 Industry sources told Times of Malta there are roughly 50 supermarkets across Malta and Gozo, although these include a handful of smaller outlets run by the larger supermarket retailers, such as Greens and Scotts, who are dipping their toes into the corner shop market.
 Lidl and Welbee's lead the way, with their 10 supermarkets apiece, with several other household names such as Arkadia, Ta' Dirjanu and Chain Supermarket all having multiple outlets.
 
 Unsurprisingly, many of the supermarkets are located in Malta’s most densely populated urban centres, often just a stone’s throw away from one another. Relatively fewer larger supermarkets have opened in the country’s more sparsely populated western towns.
 Industry sources estimate there are roughly 192 small or medium-sized grocery shops run by chain outlets such as Maypole and Miracle Foods although some of them, such as those run by Dave’s, straddle the line between a large corner shop and a smaller supermarket.
 The difference between the two isn’t always clear. The rule of thumb used by the competition regulator is that a shop under 200 square metres in size is typically considered a grocery shop, not a supermarket, but this is not a hard and fast rule across the industry.
 Almost half of these small or medium-sized shops are run by Convenience Shop, with the brand’s 95 outlets now a ubiquitous sight across Malta’s towns and villages.
  Industry sources say that while Convenience Shop is looking to open more outlets, many of its competitors in the corner shop market have similar plans. Maypole are looking to add to their 29 outlets, as are Dave’s and Spar.
 In addition to these 192 outlets, there are dozens of other independent or family-run corner shops dotted around the island, together with butchers, vegetable hawkers and fishmongers.  
  Data compiled by the Food Systems Dashboard, which brings together indicators that track food and nutrition systems across the world, suggests that Malta had around 13 supermarkets for every 100,000 people in 2021, rising to 52 if we also include smaller grocery retailers.
 These figures place Malta it in the upper echelons of the list, certainly above countries in the developing world where supermarkets are few and far between, but also above some Nordic countries such as Finland and Denmark, not to mention Ireland, the US and France.
 But Malta actually trailed most other EU countries, including Greece (the world capital of supermarkets, with almost 47 for every 100,000 people), Spain, Germany and countless others.
 According to the database, Malta also had far fewer supermarkets per capita than fellow European minnows Luxembourg, Cyprus and Iceland (all at around 22), not to mention Liechtenstein, Monaco and Gibraltar.
 Curiously, the database suggests that although Malta’s supermarket scene may be flourishing, it was still being outpaced by the growing number of people in the country, meaning there were slightly fewer supermarkets and grocery stores per 100,000 people in 2021 than there were five years earlier.

Income gap shrinks across Europe... but not in Malta,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/income-gap-shrinks-across-europe-malta.1096245,08-02-2024,002659.png,"The gap between high and low earners is dropping across Europe, but not in Malta, with only four EU countries now sharing their wealth more unequally than Malta.
 An analysis of the country’s economic prospects published on Friday by audit firm KPMG suggests Malta’s income inequality has now reached 33%, well above the EU rate of 29.6%.
 The only countries in Europe with a bigger gap between high earners and those living from paycheck to paycheck are Bulgaria, Lithuania, Latvia and Portugal.
 More damningly, while income inequality has steadily dropped across Europe over the past decade, Malta has been bucking the trend in recent years, with a sharp increase since 2019.
 
 KPMG says that Malta has its welfare state, which provides additional income to disadvantaged or low-income groups, to thank for the income inequality not being even higher.
 Without it, income inequality would jump to a staggering 44%, “which further highlights how important the welfare system is in creating a more equitable society,” the report’s authors say.
 This despite Malta keeping up its strong economic growth throughout 2023 and into the start of 2024.
 Several economic sectors have continued to grow in early 2024, the report says, with the accommodation and food services industry in particular performing strongly.
 Meanwhile, the construction industry appears to be bouncing back, now showing growth after “a prolonged period of contraction”.
 The country’s workforce also appears to be in good health, with over 306,500 people now employed, 4.6% higher than last year. KPMG predicts that Malta’s unemployment rate will remain steady at 3.1% until 2026.
 The worst of the inflation crisis appears to be behind us, the report suggests, with price inflation expected to drop to 2.4% this year and to 1.9% by 2026, less than half the 5.6% registered last year.
 Although Malta's inflation rate was higher than that of the Eurozone average for most of 2023 and early 2024, this appears to have been reversed in recent months.
 Malta's inflation rate reflects the energy subsidies that remain in place and which, the report's authors drily note, ""are forecasted not to be winding down fast enough"" according to the European Commission.

Private schools insist fee hikes 'are not driven by profit',timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/private-schools-insist-fee-hikes-are-driven-profit.1098133,16-09-2024,002778.png,"Higher fees being charged by independent schools reflect teacher salary increases and are not profit-driven, the association representing the sector has said.
 Under a deal announced last week, the annual rise in private school fees will be capped at 12% for the next five years following a government commitment to inject €27 million into independent schools over the same period.
 Without it, fees were expected to soar by up to 24% and parents would have been forced to pay an additional one-off payment of €1,000, Education Minister Clifton Grima told a press conference last week.
 Asked about the rise, a spokesperson for the Independent Schools Association (ISA) said that to their knowledge, “most schools” would increase their fees by 12%.
 “The increases are not to increase profits, but to meet costs... our hope is to go back to normal rises from next year,” she said.
 Parents of independent school students said they usually saw yearly fee increases of around 5%. Letters sent out by schools shown to Times of Malta show parents could be expected to pay up to €8,300 in private school fees this year.
 “The truth is that school fees go up each year to reflect salary increases. School fees would have probably gone up significantly this year anyway,” the spokesperson said. She pointed to cost-of-living allowance (COLA) increases as one factor pushing up fees.
 She said the larger-than-usual fee increases this year reflect the higher salaries agreed in the recent deal agreed between the government and the teachers’ union.
 While independent school teachers are not government workers and therefore paid differently to those in state schools, private school salaries are “broadly in line” with state salaries, the association spokesperson said.
 She added that if independent schools did not pay as much as the state, they would not be able to retain staff or attract new teachers.
 While the 12% fee increase would cover the new higher salaries – which she stressed had been backdated in the MUT agreement – the spokesperson said the remaining 12% increase and one-off payment originally envisaged would be covered by the government deal to inject state funds into the private sector.
 Defending the figures, she said they were “all tested on each school, looking at teacher and student populations as well as teacher pay grades and experience levels.”
 She emphasised that both the 24% and later the 12% increases had been “cross-checked with auditors and the government and wasn’t just decided by independent schools”. The process was a “very studied approach”.
 The spokesperson added that independent schools had worked hard to keep the figures as low as possible.
 Asked about parents who might already feel squeezed by yearly school fee increases, the spokesperson said “that is why the government and ISA agreed the cap”.
 Stressing that around 90% of a school’s costs were for HR, she said that any impact on those costs has an impact on school fees.
 Asked if schools were considering alternative payment options for parents in light of the higher-than-usual increases, she said private schools had “always been open to financing options”.
 Emphasising the association’s support for the MUT sectoral agreement, the spokesperson said that while the sector had “needed” it, this had inevitably impacted fees.
 “We needed to recognise the work of teachers, or we would have had a national problem – but there is a cost impact to that,” she said.
 Parents of independent school students last saw price hikes above normal levels in 2018, when school fees jumped by up to 20%.
 Like this year, the increases six years ago were to match salaries being offered in state schools following the conclusion of a sectoral agreement between the teachers’ union and the government.
 The ISA represents Chiswick House School, St Martin’s College, San Anton School, San Andrea School, St Catherine’s High School, St Michael School, St Michael Foundation and Newark School.

Should I take it?'",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/ive-offered-free-apartment-strings-attached-should-i-take-it.1096811,17-08-2024,003032.png,"Welcome to The Money Coach, a Times of Malta column where readers can ask questions about life's money issues. Send your questions about personal finances, inheritance, gifting or other personal finance topics to moneycoach@timesofmalta.com
 I am currently facing a problem that might cause significant tension in my future.
 My fiancée and I are looking for a property to buy and live in. We’ve found an ideal place in a village that holds sentimental value for us—perfect in every way and suitable for a growing family. However, the loan repayment would be nearly €2,000 per month – a commitment I would have to honour for the next 37 years.
 Here's where the problem lies: my grandmother has offered to give me one of her apartments for us to live in, as a 'donation.' This incredible opportunity means no loan repayments, ever. However, her condition is that the property remains solely in my name and that my fiancée would have no claim over it. Additionally, my grandmother is giving me this property specifically for me to live in, not to rent out or use as an income source.
 I am not sure if that can change in the future, but if I agree to the offer I intend to honour my grandmother’s wishes completely, even after she passes away.
 I have witnessed firsthand how tensions concerning property can impact a couple's life. Growing up, I remember the arguments at home, with my father frequently reminding my mother that the property was solely in his name. The threat of ""I can kick you out whenever I want"" was a regular occurrence, causing fear and insecurity. Though my father always apologised afterward, the damage was done, and it's a scenario I am desperate to avoid in my own marriage.
 So, Luca, what would you do in my situation? Should I accept my grandmother’s generous offer and avoid the lifelong burden of a property loan, or should I pass up this opportunity to prevent potential future tension in my relationship?
 Best regards,
 Conflicted Fiancé
 My first instinct would, of course, be to tell you to take up your grandmother on her generous offer. I have a home loan myself, and I can’t begin to imagine the extra things I could be doing if that monthly repayment commitment wasn’t there!
 I completely understand your concern about your fiancée not owning the property. This leads me to my first question: Is there a possibility, as remote as it may sound, that your fiancée buys a property under her name only? This could balance matters out – I know many couples who follow such arrangements and live in complete harmony.
 Your grandmother’s intention for you to live in the property and not rent it out complicates things. I understand why it’s such a hard decision to make. You might promise yourself you won’t ever mention what your dad used to say to your fiancée, but this can get hard, especially when tensions rise – it is rare that you control your words in such a scenario.
 So financially speaking, your grandmother’s offer makes complete sense; emotionally speaking, it might not. I had a similar offer in the past, which I chose not to take in order to ensure that my wife and I start our married life as 100% equals. Many might disagree with this stance, but to this day, seven years later, I never regretted it.
 Another consideration is the potential for growth in both your personal and financial lives. While the immediate relief from a home loan is appealing, owning property together can be a unifying project, a shared dream that you both work towards. It fosters a sense of joint accomplishment and deepens the partnership.
 On the other hand, if you decide to accept your grandmother’s gift, you could also explore ways to make your fiancée feel equally invested. Perhaps, if feasible, you could both contribute to renovating or furnishing the property, creating a shared space that reflects both of your tastes and efforts.
 Ultimately, it’s crucial that you both feel comfortable and at peace with whatever decision you make.

"Household savings jump in January, February",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/household-savings-jump-january-february.1091715,29-04-2024,003208.png,"Households appeared to be saving more in the first two months of this year, with bank deposits growing sharply, according to data by the Central Bank of Malta.
 The bank said in its latest issue of the Economic Update that during the 12 months to February, residents’ deposits held with monetary financial institutions increased by 2.5%. This was the third consecutive month with year-on-year increases, following a period of declines in the final months of 2023. The latest increase was mostly driven by balances belonging to households, the Crentral Bank said, adding that deposits belonging to financial intermediaries and non-financial corporations decreased. 
 The bank also reported that time deposits with agreed maturity of up to two years – the second largest deposit category – continued to show very strong growth at the beginning of the year. They rose by 24.2% over the year to February, though less than the 31.7% recorded in the year to January.
 ""This marks the sixth consecutive period with double-digit growth and reflects more attractive terms on fixed deposit accounts by certain credit institutions. The latest increase was driven by higher balances belonging to households, as balances held by non-financial corporations increased to a lower extent,"" the bank said.
 Credit to Maltese residents grew by 5.9% in February, higher than the 5.6% growth recorded in January. Credit to general government fell by 0.2% over the 12 months to February, following a 2.2% decrease a month earlier.
 At the same time, annual growth in credit to residents outside general government increased by 8.1% in the year to February, below the 8.3% recorded a month earlier.
 The annual rate of change in loans to households reached 9.1% in February, up from 8.5% in the previous month. Growth in mortgage lending stood at 8.8%, compared to 8.2% recorded in the year to January. Furthermore, growth in consumer credit and other lending increased by 11.7% year-on-year

 I recently attended a seminar hosted by a local investment firm in which the speaker emphasised the importance of investing and earning compound interest.
 It all made sense: invest regularly, a consistent sum of money monthly, and in return, your money will compound over the years. By year 25 or so, you’ll have a decent sum of money thanks to these regular investments.
 I am sceptical of this strategy. I don’t doubt that investing regularly and earning that 8-10% annual interest (the average rate of the S&P 500) has its benefits and will yield rewards after several decades. But that’s it, you know – decades – 20 to 30 years.
 I don’t want to wait 25 to 30 years to enjoy my hard-earned income.
 I know this goes against the principles of retirement schemes and what many are trying to instil – but for me, it just doesn’t make sense. Are there ways I can grow my money faster without taking unnecessary risks? I am a full-time worker with a family to care for, so I am also cautious about get-rich-quick schemes.
 I might be asking the impossible here, but well... it's worth a try.
 Best regards,
 Impatient Investor
 Dear Impatient Investor,
 I am a huge advocate of dollar-cost averaging – that is, investing a consistent amount per month and letting it compound. However, I understand your frustration, and it is something many of my clients have expressed as well.
 You might be surprised to learn that there are ways to increase your income without gambling it away or investing in risky ventures that could lead to losses.
 One of the most proven sources of extra income is monetising your passions, perhaps even creating a side hustle from them. Ask yourself, what do you enjoy doing? Do you like reading, perhaps? If so, have you ever considered doing book reviews and getting paid for it?
 You might think this is far-fetched but a man from Britain recently wrote a few Amazon reviews on fish tanks, then forgot about them. A few months later, he received a check in the mail for $350! He continued writing reviews and eventually earned around $700 for his small efforts.
 A side hustle is the perfect way to make extra money without giving up the security of your full-time job. It will give you:
 And it can be anything. One of my earliest clients worked as a teacher. She was sceptical about this side hustle idea, saying, ""My only talent is writing novels. Can you tell me how I am expected to earn money from that? Because unless you’re JK Rowling, you have very little chance of earning anything"".
 Being an aspiring writer myself, I know how hard it is to get your novel published and sold successfully. But then I asked her: ""Have you ever considered writing for brands?""
 Her creativity, I was sure, would be optimal for creating brand stories for businesses. She was hesitant at first, but then she created Fiverr and Upwork accounts. A few weeks later, she was consistently earning €400 to €500 a month. Nothing extraordinary, but enough to fund the vacations she enjoyed without touching her full-time income, or perhaps to save more.
 And guess what? It didn’t feel like work because she was doing something she liked.
 We live in the Knowledge Era, where people are making money from anything.
 That is my message to you: focus on what your talents are. Ask: what skills do I currently have that could earn me money?
 Can you afford half an hour every day for the next month to build your idea into a successful side hustle?
 It can be a game-changer.
 Best regards,
 Luca

Competition watchdog will not probe Lidl’s Żebbuġ and Qormi plans,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/competition-watchdog-probe-lidl-zebbug-qormi-plans.1098715,28-09-2024,003094.png,"Malta’s competition regulator is not investigating Lidl’s plans to open new supermarkets in Żebbuġ and Qormi, a spokesperson for the authority has confirmed.
 In recent weeks, the authority blocked the German supermarket giant’s plans to take over a Scotts supermarket in Żabbar, warning that Lidl would become too dominant in Malta’s southern areas.
 But Lidl will not be facing any similar obstacles in the case of its upcoming Żebbuġ and Qormi outlets, since the plans do not involve taking over an existing supermarket.
 The two planned branches lie just two kilometres apart, with an already-existing Lidl branch a further two kilometres up the road in Qormi.
 If the plans come to fruition, there will be four Lidl branches within a seven kilometre stretch of road, from Żebbuġ to Luqa, bringing the total number of Lidl outlets across Malta and Gozo to 12.
 Replying to questions sent by Times of Malta, a spokesperson for the Malta Competition and Consumer Affairs Authority (MCCAA) said that the authority’s approval is only required in cases that “fall within the scope of the Control of Concentration Regulations”.
 In practice, this refers to cases in which a business is either taking over or merging with a competing business that operates in the same market, such as in the case of Lidl’s attempted purchase of Scotts in Żabbar.
 “In the case of Żebbuġ and Qormi properties, the office considers that the assets in question do not constitute a concentration,” the spokesperson said.
 Competition experts say that watchdogs such as the MCCAA have to tread the fine line between incentivising businesses to grow and safeguarding an even playing field for all operators in the market.
 So, while the competition office is not necessarily against a company gaining a dominant position in its respective market, it steps in when it suspects that the business is exploiting its dominance to undercut the market or harm competitors, such as through predatory pricing.
 The MCCAA spokesperson echoed this, saying that the office’s role is “not to prevent a business from growing, but to examine whether certain concentrations will be deemed notifiable by law (such as mergers, acquisitions, and joint ventures) will have harmful effects on competition”.
 “If a concentration is considered not to harm competition, it is approved unconditionally. Conversely, if a concentration is found to harm competition, the notifying party may propose suitable commitments to eliminate the harm.”

'We want three children. How much is it going to cost us?',timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/we-want-three-children-how-much-going-cost-us.1098084,13-09-2024,003244.png,"Welcome to The Money Coach, a Times of Malta column where readers can ask questions about life's money issues. Send your questions about personal finances, inheritance, gifting or other personal finance topics to moneycoach@timesofmalta.com
 I’m a 32-year-old lawyer. My wife is a notary. We both earn decent salaries, and we have good reason to believe our incomes will grow over the next few years. The only loans we have are our home loan, and my wife still has three years of payments left on her car loan.
 We’re expecting our first child in a few months, and I won’t lie - we’re beyond excited! We’ve already started shopping for baby essentials, and we’re making sure our little one has everything he needs (yes, it’s a boy).
 I recently watched your video where you mentioned that it costs €10,000 from the moment you find out you’re pregnant until the child’s first birthday. I have to admit, that number caught me off guard. It’s not that we can’t afford it—thankfully, we’re doing fine financially - but I couldn’t help wondering how much it will continue to cost after that first year. And the thing is, we’ve always wished for a big family: three children have always been our dream.
 So, I’ve got two questions for you:
 Best regards,
 Expectant Father 
 Dear Expectant Father,
 You are right to be a bit concerned. I was also surprised at the costs one needs when children are involved (I have two young children myself).
 The €10,000 estimate might seem high to some, but let me give you a peek at how these expenses typically add up:
 
 These costs can vary from family to family, and while this gives a general overview, it's important to remember that unexpected expenses can arise.
 Of course, there are ways to lower this amount. You could rely solely on the public health service for your child’s doctor visits. You could go without a nursery or some of the other items on this list. If you wish to really push it a step further, buying second-hand items helps as well. Remember, the €10,000 price tag is an average. It can be lower, and higher as well.
 Now, to answer your questions:
 No, it’s not crazy to think of having three children in today’s world, especially if you love a big family! It’s key to forecast these costs and adjust your spending month by month. Remember also that having three children doesn’t mean that you have to go through the process of buying exactly what you bought for your first child, as most of the items can be re-used.
 You can also prepare by looking into childcare options. For example, while the Free Childcare Scheme in Malta covers children up to 3 years old for working parents, private childcare costs range from €300 to €700 per month, and after-school programmes for older children cost between €3 and €6 per hour. Babysitting or nannies could cost anywhere between €8 and €12 per hour.
 In terms of planning, you can start by calculating your current monthly income and allocating a portion to family-related expenses. Breaking down the costs over time can prevent surprises. I also encourage you to explore Malta's child benefits, including the €1,000 per child born, as well as children's allowances paid every three months.
 And while we're on the subject, it’s worth noting that maternity leave policies in Malta could certainly be improved. Compared to other countries, we're still behind in terms of providing sufficient support. Hopefully, this is something the government can address to ensure a more sustainable and family-friendly approach.
 I hope I have answered your concerns and given you the reassurance that, with the right planning, you can comfortably manage the financial aspects of growing your family. But beyond all the financial considerations, I can tell you from experience that being a parent is the most rewarding feeling you can ever experience.
 Wishing you the best of luck on this exciting journey!

 The benefit was introduced in the 2024 budget for low-income families but was  later expanded to include individuals who earn less than the median income or around €18,155 a year. 
 The amount of the grant ranges from €100 to a maximum of €1,500 over two payments, depending on the household wage and the size of the family. It is disbursed in two yearly payments. 
 The Ministry said that these payments are going to people who do not receive any other social benefits and had to apply for these payments. 
 Once an application is received a division within the ministry obtains information about the income of that family from the tax department to determine whether they are entitled to the benefit or not. 
 As a result, a total of 493 beneficiaries were identified as part of the latest exercise and they will receive a payout of €141,000 split between them.

Supplier for second interconnector transformer selected following €20m bid,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/supplier-second-interconnector-transformer-selected-following-20m-bid.1096581,08-10-2024,003510.png,"Key machinery required to run electricity through a second undersea interconnector is to be supplied and installed by a local firm, after its €20.3 million tender bid proved to be the cheapest.
 AG Installations has been recommended as the supplier to install a shunt reactor on each side of the interconnector – in Magħtab and Ragusa, Sicily – as well as a 220kV/132kV transformer in Maghtab.
 Shunt reactors will reduce the reactive power generated by the interconnector cable, improving its energy transmission efficiency. The transformer will step down the interconnector’s 220kV voltage to 132kV.
 AG Installations is part of the AG Group, a local company that provides mechanical, electrical and plumbing services and which is run by founder Andrei Grech.
 Its €20.3 million bid was one of two offers received for the tender. The other bid, made by Shining Star Infrastructure and Construction Ltd, came in at €24 million.
 Tender evaluators were instructed to assess bids on the basis of cost/price effectiveness.
 Interconnect Malta, the state-run entity that is overseeing the second interconnector project, has advised the Department of Contracts to award the contract to AG Installations. That is expected to be a formality, given that the deadline for other bidders to file objections to that recommendation ended on August 5.
 The tender is the first of four related to the interconnector project to be adjudicated. The largest – to manufacture and install the submarine cable itself – has an estimated value of €185 million and is still open for bids. Another tender, valued at €12 million, is for the supply and installation of 220kV Switchgear, Fire Suppression System and Construction of Fire Walls at Ragusa and the Upgrade of Control System.
 Further tenders related to the project will be published later this year, according to ICM’s website.
 In a statement on Saturday announcing the tender award recommendation, ICM said that the Sicilian Regional Administration for the Environment had this week positively reviewed the project’s screening submission. That review will play a part in the Italian environment ministry’s authorisation of the project.
 Plans to develop a second undersea interconnector linking Malta to the European energy grid were first unveiled in June 2021.
 At the time, Energy Minister Miriam Dalli had said the project would cost €170 million and be completed by 2025.
 That deadline now appears exceedingly unlikely to be met, given that tenders have are still being evaluated and Italian regulators have yet to greenlight the project. It is now projected to cost €300m, though €165m of that amount will be covered by EU ERDF Funding.
 Analysis Malta’s energy needs indicates authorities must hurry to complete it, as the country’s energy supply will be stretched to breaking point by 2030 and overwhelmed by demand by 2035.
 Minister Dalli said IC2 – as the project as been dubbed – “is central to the government’s energy vision”.
 “The project will not only strengthen one of the sources in its energy mix but will also enable the country to improve its indigenous renewable energy supply. The project will allow Malta to move towards larger scale offshore RES as the interconnector can provide a buffer to counterbalance the intermittency of renewables,” she aid.
 ICM divisional manager and engineer Joseph Vassallo said the company was pleased that reputable firms had bid for the tender.
 Manufacturing shunt reactors and the transformer came with “long lead times”, he warned.
 “The project is a complex one which involves a lot of planning and coordination between different providers given that at one time, there will be cable laying works ongoing both onshore in Malta and Italy, offshore works with detailed surveys and the laying of the subsea cable, works involving the overall control system and the installation of the transformer and reactors,” Vassallo said.

 ""The higher interest rate environment was the biggest contributor to the increase in profits. Good progress was reported on the non-interest income while lower Expected Credit Losses (ECL) recoveries were registered,"" the bank said. 
 Revenue was up €14.6m or 29% when compared to Q1 2023. This was mainly driven by higher net interest income earned on the placement of excess liquidity due to the higher interest rate environment. The bank additionally registered higher business volumes resulting in an increase in net fee income, foreign exchange and insurance income.
 It said it had recorded an improvement in the credit quality of its loan book, resulting in a release of ECL (expected credit loss) of €1.8m in Q1 2024 compared to a release of €3.7m in Q1 2023. The Q1 2024 release reflected a generic improvement in the credit quality of the book.
 The bank said it had managed to maintain costs at the same level as the same period last year despite the impacts of inflation and the continued investment in its people, technology, and premises.
 Net loans and advances to customers remained broadly in line with Q4 2023 levels.
 Customer deposits decreased marginally mainly driven by a decrease in operational corporate deposits.

 The sponsor was unaware the arrangement would impact Bonello, the statement said.
 ""As mentioned in Beacon Media's initial statement, there were never any ulterior motives in RTK's acquisition of a sponsor for the slot occupied by Mr. Bonello. There was certainly no attempt on Beacon Media's behalf to silence anyone.""
 Bonello's appearance on the RTK programme is not a sponsored advert, the statement said, adding that he is not paid for appearing on the show.
 ""Beacon Media and Mr Bonello are pleased recent misunderstandings have been cleared and look forward to collaborating going forward,"" the statement said.

MTA marks 25 years as it reflects on the 'curse of success',timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/mta-marks-25-years-reflects-curse-success.1097544,09-10-2024,"003697.png,003698.png","As Malta’s tourism numbers soar to unprecedented heights, Leslie Vella, deputy CEO of the Malta Tourism Authority (MTA), warns that the island is nearing its limit and that the sector’s growth needs a strategic reassessment.
 Speaking to Times of Malta on the MTA’s 25th anniversary, Vella said Malta “can no longer keep going in the direction like there is no tomorrow”. He noted that the island is approaching the maximum number of tourists it can comfortably accommodate, cautioning: “We are very close to reaching that limit.”
 Vella, who also serves as the MTA’s chief officer of strategic development, stressed that there are limits to growth, especially in small territories like Malta. “Most things can’t keep growing, whether construction, development, or tourism within a small territory. We very quickly reach limits and exceed them.”
 In 2023, Malta welcomed over three million tourists, an 8% increase over the previous record set in 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic temporarily halted the industry. Vella referred to these figures as “the curse of success” but expressed optimism that there is still time to change.
 He advocates for a shift away from what he describes as the “religion of growth”, which focuses solely on increasing numbers rather than sustainability. Vella likened the situation to needing “a trim rather than a drastic haircut”, suggesting that the solution lies not in halting tourism altogether but in scaling it back to more sustainable levels.
 He hinted that the MTA is exploring several strategies to achieve a more sustainable balance in tourism. These include promoting domestic tourism and targeting long-haul markets, such as the United States and Australia, which, typically, generate higher spending and longer stays than short-haul tourists.
  Vella emphasised the need for a holistic approach to the tourism sector that involves coordination with other industries and policymakers. “Tourism does not work in isolation,” he said, stressing the importance of collaboration among stakeholders to adopt a comprehensive strategy for the future.
 Reflecting on the MTA’s 25-year history, Vella, a key figure in Malta’s tourism sector for over four decades, recounted how the industry has evolved. When he began his career, the National Tourism Organisation of Malta (NTOM) was the primary body overseeing tourism. Established in 1984, the NTOM served as “the marketing arm of the ministry of tourism”.
 Malta’s early identity as a tourist destination was shaped mainly by its appeal as a summer getaway for British tourists. Vella described this initial approach as “heavily influenced by a colonised mindset” aimed at providing “a Mediterranean version of Britain”.
 By the 1980s, the focus had shifted to making Malta a year-round destination, attracting visitors from across Europe by leveraging local culture and heritage as a key asset. “Being entrusted to deliver the message of what your country is and seeing people enjoy it is a great privilege,” Vella said.
 The MTA was established in 1999, expanding beyond marketing to encompass broader aspects of tourism management, including licensing, compliance, enforcement and product development.
 
 Back then, around 1.2 million tourists visited Malta annually – a far cry from the over three million in 2023. “The main difference between then and now is the volume,” Vella explained, attributing the surge to significant changes within the sector.
 The advent of the internet, the spread of the euro, the formation of the Schengen area and the introduction of low-cost airlines in the 2000s were all pivotal in transforming Malta into a mass tourism destination. The arrival of Malta’s first Ryanair flight in 2006 marked a new era, with visitor numbers rising rapidly.
 When the MTA was set up, its vision was to position Malta as a destination of choice rather than just a convenient stop. According to Vella, this goal has been met and exceeded, with Malta now recognised as a sought-after location that consistently outperforms expectations.
 As the MTA celebrates 25 years, Vella expressed hope that the sector would be viewed not as a “monster” but as a powerful tool to appreciate Malta’s unique offerings.

"Man’s food truck dreams battered in €23,000 import nightmare",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/man-food-truck-dreams-battered-23000-import-nightmare.1097193,09-01-2024,"003741.png,003742.png,003743.png,003744.png","An entrepreneur whose electric food truck from China reached a dead end before his business even got started has chronicled a “bureaucratic nightmare” that culminated in the vehicle’s destruction – the only solution to the ordeal.
 Over a year ago, Shane Rowe purchased the truck from a Chinese company, eager to expand Yardie’s, a small family-run coffee distribution business, by selling the Jamaican Blue Mountain brew on Malta’s streets.
 But before he knew it, the plan ground to a halt and he was battling to overcome hurdles to be able to smash his new vehicle – the only way he could plug the draining cost of daily fees to keep it in customs limbo.
 Rowe estimated that he lost just over €23,000. Breaking down the investment that went nowhere, he said the truck and shipping cost almost €20,000, with an extra €800 just to keep the vehicle at the port for an additional three weeks. He paid a further €1,500 to the destruction company just to see his investment crushed.
  It turned out that, despite his checks and assurance, the electric vehicle was non-compliant with EU standards and could not be allowed entry into the country; that the Chinese supplier refused it back on these grounds; and that the only route was to demolish it.
 That option, however, also hit a brick wall when Rowe was informed by Transport Malta that the vehicle could not even be scrapped because it had to be registered first. And this was not possible.
 Meanwhile, the family’s financial burdens were becoming increasingly untenable as the vehicle remained stuck at customs, incurring daily costs.
 When Rowe sought to buy the electric food truck in March 2023, he said the supplier had assured him it would meet necessary EU regulations and that he would not face any issues.
  Based on this, an unsuspecting Rowe proceeded with the purchase.
 He contacted Transport Malta to ask what was needed to import the vehicle and was provided a list that included a Certificate of Conformity (CoC).
 Returning to the supplier’s website, Rowe saw the CoC listed, and noted it claimed to comply with EU regulations.
 By April last year, the purchase agreement and payment were made, “following further discussions and reassurances”.
 While the supplier had initially quoted shipping costs at around €500, a year later, when it was time to ship the truck, these had increased “significantly and unexpectedly” to over €4,000, Rowe noted, adding he had no choice but to proceed at that point.
 To have everything in order, he contacted a customs clearance agent as the food truck made its way to Malta in June. One of the first things he was asked was whether he had spoken to the Malta Competition and Consumer Affairs Authority.
 The agent advised him to seek the authority’s approval of the CoC, and Rowe sent it over, only to be informed it covered certain aspects of the vehicle, including electrical work, but did not comply with EU regulations.
 With the truck already en route to Malta, Rowe repeatedly contacted the supplier to obtain the correct CoC and any other necessary documentation, but he said they were unable to provide it.
 So, when it arrived on June 16, its business journey, which was about to start, stalled abruptly. It was stuck at customs due to “insufficient documentation provided by the supplier”, Rowe said, explaining it was classified as a food cart rather than an electric vehicle.
 According to the customs clearance agent, the typical solution in such cases was to return the shipment to the country of origin. Despite the vehicle’s non-compliance, Rowe said the supplier refused to cooperate and accept the cargo, leaving him with no viable alternative.
  Rowe tried every road, turning to various officials and entities, including the Transport Ministry, to support him. He sought assistance from the Chinese Embassy in Malta and the Maltese Embassy in China but said this did not lead to any resolution, and the supplier continued to “shun responsibility”.
 “Both embassies informed me they had no jurisdiction in the matter. The Maltese embassy attempted to help by directing me to a customs clearance agent, but I already had two working on the case,” he said.
 “The agents advised that it was unprecedented for a company to refuse to take back cargo with incorrect documentation,” Rowe said.
 Facing this impasse, he had no choice but to begin to explore the only way out – scrapping the vehicle before he put it to any use. However, even that proved to be fraught with complications and a Catch-22 situation: the truck could not be demolished because it was not yet registered. And it could not be registered because it was non-compliant.
 The aspiring entrepreneur started to lose steam. But he continued to chug on, as the costs to keep the vehicle at the wharf increased daily.
 He worked with TM and MCCAA to find a solution and, eventually, an exception was made to release the vehicle from customs for destruction.
 But even the process of coordinating this frustrating twist faced delays. Rowe contacted the approved destruction facility and continued to plead for expedited release to minimise the “immense financial burden and emotional strain” on his family.
 Yardie’s was finally smashed to pieces on July 19 thanks to a bureaucratic nightmare with no clear resolution in sight.
  While he recognised the blind spots in some of the actions he took, he pointed to the irony of spending weeks chasing multiple organisations for the possibility to destroy his own truck.
 “As an aspiring entrepreneur, I was simply trying to start a business and contribute to the economy,” he said, adding it has been a “tough lesson”.
 Rowe chose to highlight the vehicle shipment issue to avoid others experiencing similar pitfalls.
 And while it has been a costly journey, he said he did not feel it was a road to nowhere and his hopes and dreams for Yardie’s coffee have not been crushed.

 Inaugurated on Thursday, Economy Minister Silvio Schembri said DiHubMT aims to foster innovation, collaboration, and business growth by offering cutting-edge tools and professional support to start-ups and SMEs.
 The hub hosts among others, ten 3D printers, a podcasting studio, access to a metaverse platform, hot desks and meeting rooms.
 The hub cost €6.6 million and was co-financed by the EU. 
  A high-performance computer - the first of its kind locally - will be installed on-site in May next year, offering computational power that researchers currently seek abroad, the minister said.
 “The potential of the digital (sector) is enormous. For an island without natural resources, we need to continue investing in people,” he said.
 CEO of the Malta Digital Innovation Authority Kenneth Brincat described DiHubMT as “a platform where ideas are born, grown, and become a reality"".
 He also highlighted Malta's growing reputation in the tech industry, referencing a Business Insider article that noted the area has “more AI startups per capita than the United States"".
 The hub's head Bernard Montebello meanwhile focused on the place's role in fostering a sense of community among entrepreneurs through mentorship opportunities, networking, and workshops.
 The hub is partnered with over 220 hubs across Europe.
  The hub already hosts seven start-ups, six of which are locally founded. These Happy Pot - a 3D printing company specialising in sustainable plant pots.
 Times of Malta spoke to Chris Mercieca, 24, co-founder of Happy Pot, who praised the hub’s resources.
 “The space is excellent because we finally have a place to put our heads together and come up with ideas... but the fact we have access to people, workshops, and technology is insane,” he said.

Plans for major San Ġwann ODZ supermarket withdrawn after outcry,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/plans-major-san-gwann-odz-supermarket-withdrawn-outcry.1092737,20-05-2024,003786.png,"Plans for a massive supermarket project outside the development zone in San Ġwann have been withdrawn two days after a public outcry. 
 Objectors received an email from the Planning Authority on Monday stating: ""Please be informed that the application has been withdrawn.""
 On Saturday, Times of Malta revealed the application to build a 7,000 square metre supermarket adjacent to a private secondary school.
 Prime Minister Robert Abela was among those who opposed the project, saying he felt it is a “non-starter” and that the town's Labour-led council would object.
 The proposal was to build a two-storey supermarket with underground parking on a 7,000-square-metre site on Triq tal-Balal and Triq tal-Prepostu, in an area of San Ġwann known as Ta’ Ġnien Tut.
 The site is just over 250 metres from another supermarket, while an application for a supermarket and a DIY store on a site directly across the road is still being processed.
 The PA had already been inundated with objections to the proposed development, particularly because the site in question is agricultural land outside the development zone and located close to a school, St Michael Foundation for Education.
 According to the public application form submitted by architects JG Periti, Jason Pace is the sole owner of the site in question. However, the PA website lists the developer as being Meleney Gauci.
 The total area of the site is around 12,000 square metres.
 The area proposed for the project abuts Wied Għomor and Wied il-Kbir, protected areas of ecological importance and sites of scientific importance.
 Objectors insist that the application runs contrary to the PA’s rural policy and objectives of the Strategic Plan for Environment and Development, which limits land take-up for uses which are not necessary or legitimate in rural areas.
 “San Ġwann already has numerous supermarkets and the take-up of agricultural ODZ land, let alone land that is on the doorstep of a school and a protected ecological area, is certainly not necessary or legitimate,” the objectors wrote in their representation filed with the PA.

APS Bank in advanced negotiations to buy HSBC Malta,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/aps-advanced-negotiations-buy-hsbc-malta.1097941,09-11-2024,003889.png,"Updated 11.15pm with HSBC statement
 APS Bank is in advanced negotiations to take over HSBC’s Malta operations, according to inside sources who spoke to Times of Malta.
 HSBC announced on Wednesday morning that it would be carrying out a “strategic review” of its operations, its clearest hint yet at a possible exit from the country.
 Insiders told Times of Malta that negotiations between APS and HSBC’s global shareholders have been underway for several years, ever since it became apparent that HSBC Malta was looking to wind down its operations.
 In a company announcement issued late on Wednesday, HSBC Malta said it did not know of any such talks.
 HSBC Malta said ""it is not aware of any such negotiations taking place between the majority shareholder and APS Bank p.l.c. or any other third party but has requested clarification of the position from its majority shareholder."" 
 The bank's shares fell 18.2% in trading while APS Bank shares rose 11.5%. 
 HSBC's exit is believed to be driven by the bank's gradual pivot away from Europe and smaller markets towards Asia.
 The negotiations are believed to have been sparked by international parties who, knew of HSBC’s intention to leave Malta and approached both banks to see if there was interest.
 
 The discussions did not directly involve HSBC Malta, whose CEO Geoffrey Fichte earlier this year insisted with Times of Malta that the bank was in Malta “ for the long run”.
 Although negotiations are ongoing, the two parties are believed to agree on several key elements of the deal, including its overall price. 
 Nevertheless, sources say, advisers on both sides of the negotiating table will work to iron out several details before the deal can be concluded.
 The deal would see APS purchase HSBC’s 70% stake in the bank, although it remains to be seen whether HSBC opts to keep a foothold in the market by holding on to a minor share of the pie.
 Although negotiations are progressing smoothly, the transition could take some time. 
 Sources say that regulatory approvals and procedures make it unlikely that the takeover will be completed within the next 18 months.
 The move would see APS up its market share significantly, growing to rival that of market leaders BOV and overshadowing all other banks in Malta. Whether this raises any regulatory concerns over  competition across the market remains to be seen.
 This expansion would effectively mean that HSBC’s customers would eventually be transferred to APS.
 The move is not without its doubters.
 Some figures in government are believed to be pushing for a foreign buyer, but it is unclear whether any reputable foreign banks have expressed concrete interest in HSBC’s Maltese operations.
 HSBC has been quietly chipping away at its European operations and pivoting towards growing its presence in Asia. Reports last year revealed it would be selling or drastically streamlining its presence in 12 European countries, effectively slashing a fifth of its operations.
 Sales across several countries followed, from France to Greece to Russia.

Insurance Association calls for mandatory workplace pensions in the Budget,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/insurance-association-calls-mandatory-workplace-pensions-budget.1098480,24-09-2024,003989.png,"The Insurance Association Malta has urged the government to make workplace pensions mandatory in the forthcoming budget while introducing a transitory framework for employers to contribute towards their employees' pensions.
 ""With people living longer and not always managing to set aside sufficient funds for their future, a mandatory workplace pension will help to smooth the transition to retirement while maintaining a good standard of living,"" it said.
 “Malta should adopt the British model and introduce mandatory workplace pensions with a voluntary opt-out. Experience has shown that for this to succeed, employers should also pool in and contribute to entice employees to take part,” the association said.
 The Association said private pensions were still relatively under-developed. Although the foundations had been laid, workplace pensions and private third pillar pensions still had a long way to go.
 “As the government works on finalising its budget for 2025, we urge it to consider our proposals and present a more ambitious and courageous approach by introducing mandatory workplace pensions that will also encourage employers to contribute. In this way employees will think twice before opting out,” it said.
 With contributions made tax deductible for employers, they could also benefit from a tax credit on the amounts made, the association said. 
 It added that at a recent meeting at the finance ministry, it also called for effective enforcement of drink and drug-driving laws and raised issues related to workplace safety, electric vehicles and the challenges the repair industry faced, as well as fire safety in buildings.

Em@ney barred from taking on new clients by financial regulator,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/emney-barred-taking-new-clients-financial-regulator.1098503,25-09-2024,003786.png,"Updated 12.30pm with Em@ney statement
 A payments services provider has been ordered to stop taking on new clients as its operations come under scrutiny from the financial regulator.
 Em@ney, a Ta’ Xbiex digital payments provider, hit the headlines this month after  Times of Malta reported how its clients were unable to access their funds for “several days” without explanation.
 In directives published last week, the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA) ordered Em@ney to stop taking on new clients until it ensures that the “proper governance and internal controls” are in place to operate its payments services licence in accordance with the law. Em@ney has also been ordered to process client transactions in a “timely and efficient manner” after carrying out the necessary anti-money laundering checks.
 The company is to report weekly to the MFSA on the status of client transactions being processed. The regulator said Em@ney must ensure that any decisions taken are done by individuals authorised by the MFSA to act on its behalf.
 A company spokesperson has blamed the delays in processing client transactions on “technical difficulties” with its IT systems caused by a change in management.
 The former chief executive officer and board of directors have, however, pushed back at the claims.
 In a joint statement last week, the company’s former CEO, Germano Arnò, and former board directors said they “bear no responsibility for the recent decisions made by the new management of Em@ney”.
 Since the handover occurred, “the former board no longer has any influence over the company’s operations”, they continued, before “entirely” attributing the suspension of banking services to the new management.
 “Despite his [Arnò’s] attempts to offer support, the new leadership chose to make sudden changes to the platform and discontinue services built over years of hard work and perseverance,” the statement read.
 Three years ago, the company was fined €360,000 by the Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit (FIAU) for a series of anti-money laundering breaches concerning clients involved in passport sales, cryptocurrency and with potential links to organised crime.
 The fine has been appealed by Em@ney.
 Cannabis associations have been hard hit by Em@ney’s problems, with many of them using the payment provider’s services.
 Association owners also report being given different explanations for the outages; one said they had been attributed to a change in company director, while another said the company had told him they were undergoing a “periodic review” by the FIAU, during which time account services would be unavailable.
 In a statement, Em@ney said it was complying fully with the regulator's order not to take on new clients. 
 The company said it was currently in the process of re-onboarding all its existing clients, in like with Know Your Client and due diligence requirements. 
 The re-onboarding is necessary because the company ""lost access to critical banking IT systems and data"" as a result of an ""uncooperative"" provider, it said. 
 All clients who have been re-onboarded can use its SEPA transfer system, it said. 
  Em@ney insisted it had followed all necessary procedures in terminating its previous CEO, including informing the MFSA and Malta Business Registry. 
 It denied claims that 3,000 Italian clients lost access to their funds, saying the company has around 1,000 clients in total, with 40 per cent of those being Italian. 
 No clients are being left without assistance, it said, with a dedicated team focused on client cases.

 The approval brings a long saga of development applications for the site to an end, with the new supermarket being approved in a PA board meeting on Thursday.
 The development is a joint venture between the German supermarket chain and the Mizzi Organisation following initial plans by subsidiary company Mizzi Estates to transform the site into an apartment complex.
 The change in plans saw almost all but four of the approximately 150 apartments removed – which will be built on Triq Alexandra – and an underground parking area scrapped.
 Instead, the upcoming LIDL store will feature outdoor parking for 122 vehicles, with the supermarket facing onto Mdina Road and Triq il-Vitorja.
  The site has remained unused since the factory owned by General Soft Drinks Ltd was relocated to Marsa in 2008.
 Entrance to the supermarket will be from the main Mdina road, with vehicles exiting onto the adjacent Triq il-Vitorja residential street.
 However, despite concerns about the traffic impact of the development, a traffic impact assessment earlier this year predicted the supermarket would create less traffic than the apartments and showrooms originally planned.
 While the initial development was estimated to have led to 305 trips in peak evening hours, the new LIDL is forecast to create less than half that number (120), according to the assessment.
 The study also suggests the development will relieve pressure on two roundabouts on the nearby Triq Manuel Dimech east of the supermarket by attracting shoppers approaching from the west.
  The supermarket’s developers will be required to contribute €23,000 to the Planning Authority’s Urban Improvements Fund to make up for a shortfall of five parking spaces unable to be accommodated on the site.
 Recommending the project for approval, the case officer said the “low supermarket structure and open car park” would have less of a visual impact on the area than the apartment blocks originally envisaged.

 Responding to the complaints, the Pietà-based company said it had encountered “technical difficulties” while changing IT provider from one owned by the previous management, who it said had also refused to hand over customer data.
 Emoney said the former management being “uncooperative” had contributed to “further delays in releasing funds for some customers”.

 Stressing that the former CEO “no longer has any control over... access to information”, the statement – issued to “protect the professional reputation” of the former management – called on the new management to “prioritise the needs of customers”.
 Arnò founded Emoney in 2011, becoming CEO the following year and serving until last month, according to his LinkedIn profile.

 A report by the auditor general detailed how spending on the 10-day event dedicated to the LGBTIQ+ community “significantly” exceeded its original budget, with a total spend of €4.6 million.
 When questioned about the discrepancy, the Office of the Prime Minister blamed it on “unexpected adverse weather conditions”, as well as the omission and undervaluation of certain expenses like security.
 This explanation, however, did not appear to hold water with the auditor general, who noted that bad weather only impacted the event’s opening ceremony, which had to be shifted to Ta’ Qali’s MFCC, and security accounted for just nine per cent of the total spend.
 “…these reasons cited by management could not have been the sole cause of this variance,” the report notes.
 “Major” shortcomings in procurement procedures were found during the audit.
 “Given that the bid to host the event in Malta was won in 2020, and the EuroPride Parade 2023 agreement was finalised in October 2022, it was presumed that management had sufficient time to plan the event and procure the required goods and services in compliance with standing regulations,” the auditor general said.
 The report says that despite these time frames, none of the goods and services purchased for the event were acquired via a tender.
 Furthermore, no quotes were obtained for a considerable number of other purchases, which were procured directly from the open market, and for which no direct order approvals from the respective permanent secretary or finance ministry were found.
  The report says the piecemeal approach used for the procurement of certain services was likely split to circumvent the need for a tender.
 “Under no circumstances would it have made sense from a logistical perspective to have different service providers setting up a stage and roof structure during the two consecutive weeks of the event,” the auditor general said.
 
 The auditor general noted at least eight instances whereby quotations for lighting, video and stage set-up, were provided not more than two days before the required service was to be delivered.
 From an operational standpoint, as well as considering the nature of these expenses, the auditor general said it is difficult to envisage how service providers were willing to provide these services at such short notice.
 Additionally, no reference was made to the required layout, design, desired appearance and availability of equipment, which would have been discussed at some stage.
 “This suggests that the service provider had been selected directly beforehand (without obtaining direct order approval), also implying that the quotations were very likely obtained merely to conceal the bypassing of procurement regulations,” the report says.
 In response to the findings, the Office of the Prime Minister said certain goods and services procured for the event were acquired under “time-sensitive circumstances”.
 In cases where direct orders were used, the Office of the Prime Minister said it was due to the immediate nature, which precluded the standard timeline for obtaining departmental tenders or multiple quotations.
 Who was responsible?
 Auditors found significant difficulty in identifying the key government personnel responsible for the event’s organisation and management, with the situation complicated by a shift in ministerial portfolios and the event being organised in tandem with an NGO.
 The auditor general said clear ownership and accountability should be established when projects transition from one ministerial portfolio to another.
 All financial transactions, decisions and key project milestones must be consistently recorded to maintain a complete audit trail.
 The report struck a frustrated tone in this regard.
 “Unless roles and responsibilities are clearly recognised and defined, ownership cannot be established,"" the auditor general said.
 ""Consequently, identifying who should be held accountable for any shortcomings in the organisation of the event, particularly those relating to the procurement of goods and services, and the fact that the budget allocation was substantially exceeded, can become an arduous task.""
 When organising similar events, the roles and responsibilities are to be clearly defined, the auditor general insisted.
 The audit was able to identify one key officer in the event’s organisation, namely the head of secretariat of Parliamentary Secretary for Equality Rebecca Buttigieg. This, however, appears to have gone against established procedures, as the head of the secretariat is a position of trust appointment and, therefore, the person should not exercise executive powers.
 Despite this, the auditor general found that the head of secretariat monitored calls for quotations, certified invoices, forwarded purchase orders, corresponded directly with artists who participated in the event and took receipts of EuroPride merchandise.
 All this goes against the guiding principle outlined in a manual on resourcing policies and procedures, which states that people engaged on a position of trust basis should not enjoy executive powers on government matters, the auditor general said.
 The auditor general urged those responsible to delve into the matter to establish how the head of secretariat took on responsibilities beyond those expected of the position held.

"'Budget failed to address low fertility, work-family conflicts': Women's lobby",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/budget-failed-address-low-fertility-workfamily-conflicts-women-lobby.1100271,30-10-2024,004211.png,"The Malta Women's Lobby on Wednesday slammed the absence of ""evidence-based, gender-sensitive policies"" in the drafting of budgetary measures.
 While acknowledging the inclusion of a few positive measures in the budget plans for 2025, the Malta Women's Lobby said ""gender budgeting"" was still not an essential component of future fiscal planning,
 MWL said women were directly impacted by four measures:
 The 2025 budget also promised the distribution of panic buttons to victims of violence.
 ""Yet, the government’s insistence on a gender-neutral approach obscures the reality of the disproportionate impact of violence against women, rendering the measure less effective in addressing gender-specific safety concerns.
 ""Moreover, we earnestly hope this initiative will not encounter the setbacks and delays faced by the previously promised electronic tagging programme,"" the MWL said in a statement. 
 The MWL said Budget 2025 fell short of addressing the country’s low fertility rate and related family-work conflicts.
 It said that in a recent National Commission for the Promotion of Equality (NCPE) study parents voiced a clear demand for adequate and generous work-family policies such as the introduction of special leave for the parents specifically for when their children fall ill, and longer, better-paid family leave that would allow both parents to spend more time with their infants before returning to work.
 ""The budget sidesteps these pressing concerns and only offers an ineffective one-time €1,500 bonus for parents of three (or more) children, missing a critical opportunity to address Malta's declining fertility rate with sustainable, family-focused policies.""
 This budget clearly shows that Malta continues to lack a holistic, gender-sensitive approach to budgeting, despite ongoing discussions about gender mainstreaming since 2000.
 A gender mainstreaming approach would ensure that decisions relating to financial planning align with the needs and realities of each and every member of society.

Send your questions about personal finances, inheritance, gifting or other personal finance topics to moneycoach@timesofmalta.com. 
 I am a 21-year-old undergraduate student who also works a part-time job for around 15 hours a week, making €10 an hour. I have established an emergency fund of about €2,000. 
 I am mainly interested in ways in which I can optimise my money, and I am sending this message to ask about some of the best strategies to do this.
 I had already purchased a couple of ETFs about three years ago, namely €1,500 in each of QQQ and VOO.
 I am currently turning a bit of a profit, but I can understand that my current strategy isn't sustainable.
 What is the best way to invest my current savings, and income, such that I can grow my money rather than just saving it?
 I had read that it would be a good idea to invest portions of my monthly income, even small amounts like €100 or €200 EUR. Could you guide me on this?
 Sincerely,
 A young guy
 First of all, allow me to congratulate you on your achievements so far – not every 21-year-old can boast an emergency fund of €2,000 and €3,000 in investments, while also studying.
 Before continuing my response, allow me to make it clear that I am not licenced to offer investment advice – for that it is best to seek the services of a professional investment advisor.
 That being said, I can provide guidance on optimising your savings to not only ensure growth in the future but also maintain long-term sustainability. This is in fact a concern shared by many of my clients, and it normally becomes an urge when people are in their late 30s or early 40s and realise that they barely have any savings, let alone investments.
 In your case, you are in the best possible position if you can make that small monetary contribution consistently per month and allow it to grow exponentially through the power of compound interest.
 You might think that your current strategy is not sustainable... and I am curious to understand the reasons for this.
 From the choices you have made it tells me that you are well-versed in the world of investing. If one considers the S&P 500 for example, over the past 90 years it gave a return of 8-10% on average per year. Does this mean that it should be a no brainer choice? Not at all. After all it depends on a person’s risk appetite, financial goals and other aspects which an investment advisor can lead you better in. Always consider all angles when making any investment choice.
 I find that the best way to keep disciplined in your savings and investing is by being consistent, which means doing it monthly. This not only leads you to the benefits of dollar-cost-averaging, where you buy into the market at different price levels, ensuring a smoother ride long-term; but it also ingrains a discipline in you that can be quite beneficial long-term. Remember, it is not about the amount you save and invest per month, but about consistency. Start small, even €50 on a consistent basis can do the trick, and then gradually increase the amount as you see fit.
 Don’t pressure yourself: it is better to start small and keep to it, rather than start big, and then start stressing if you don’t save that amount. Remember things happen in life, and at times it is normal to take a pause. I passed through such a period myself when my daughter had sensory issues, and my wife had to stay with her for a whole year. We had to get used to one income rather than two, and that meant that I had to give my saving and investing a pause, and I don’t mind revealing that... this is all normal. The important thing is to restart once you get back on your feet.
 Make a plan, see how much you can consistently save and invest per month, and keep to that amount for a few months and gradually increase it. Furthermore, ask yourself:
 The above should help you think, initiate a plan, and start executing it at your own pace. At 21 years, the sky is literally the limit.
 Warm regards,
 Luca

ARD Discount becomes latest supermarket to open in Malta,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/new-supermarket-ard-discount-open-round-corner-wellbee.1098079,13-09-2024,"004552.png,004553.png","ARD Discount, a popular Italian discount supermarket chain, will be opening its first store next week, just up the road from giant chain Wellbee's in Mellieħa, introducing another budget supermarket to the island.
 The discount supermarket will be located less than 100 metres from its Maltese rival on Triq il-Kbira and according to a Google Listing, the store will open on September 19. 
 ARD Discount is a joint venture between Italian retailers Ergon and Maiora with over 240 stores across southern Italy and Sicily and has a 40,000 square metre distribution centre. 
 Last year it opened its first store in Sardinia, with plans to open a further nine stores on the Italian island.
 According to its website, it offers over 900 items from 40 different brands, such as Buono & Gusto, Fatti a Fette and Frutti di Frutta. It also offers its own range of low-cost products.
  On Wednesday, ARD Discount announced the opening of the Maltese store on social media platforms.
 “Big things are coming to Malta, stay tuned for something awesome,” the post read, providing no further details on where the store will be located. 
  The opening of the new store adds to the ever-growing number of discount supermarkets popping up across the Maltese islands. 
 The announcement of the new supermarket comes after the Planning Authority approved the construction of a new LIDL supermarket on the site of the former General Softs Drinks factory in Qormi.
 The development is a joint venture between the German supermarket chain and the Mizzi Organisation following initial plans by subsidiary company Mizzi Estates to transform the site into an apartment complex. 
 Lidl, which opened its first Malta store in Santa Venera in 2008, now has 10 outlets across Malta and Gozo.
 Earlier this year, Italian supermarket giant Eurospin opened its first store in Mosta, right next door to competitor Lidl. Risparmio Casa, another Italian discount store, also opened a store in the same locality.
 Earlier this year, plans for a massive supermarket project outside the development zone in San Ġwann were withdrawn following two days of public outcry.
 The proposal was to build a two-storey 7,000 square metre supermarket adjacent to a private secondary school.
 Prime Minister Robert Abela was among those who opposed the project, saying he felt it was a “non-starter” and that the town's Labour-led council would object.

Central Bank stand-in governor has not had salary topped up,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/central-bank-standin-governor-salary-topped.1096290,08-05-2024,005033.png,"As Edward Scicluna steps aside to defend his innocence in a high-profile fraud case, Central Bank deputy governor Alexander Demarco has taken the helm without a pay increase, the bank has confirmed.
 Demarco remains on the same salary as he did throughout his tenure as a deputy governor with no additional benefits or perks.
 “No alternative arrangements have been made to date,” a spokesperson said.
 He told Times of Malta Demarco’s remuneration remains unchanged since his reappointment as deputy governor on January 1, 2024. 
 Demarco will stand in for Scicluna who, last Tuesday agreed to step aside in face of fraud and misappropriation charges in relation to the Vitals hospitals case.
 Scicluna is among dozens of former politicians, civil servants and others charged in connection with their alleged involvement in the fraudulent deal to privatise three hospitals.
 He stepped aside from carrying out the functions of governor after facing pressure from Prime Minister Robert Abela. However, Scicluna,  whose term as governor expires in December 2025, will retain half his pay throughout his hiatus.
 Asked to lay out the salary of deputy governors at the bank, the spokesperson declined, saying that “it is not the policy of the Central Bank of Malta to publish the salaries of the governors”. 
 Demarco is a veteran of the bank, now entering his fourth decade with the central bank.
 He was first made deputy governor in January 2014, initially put in charge of running the bank’s financial stability unit.
 Three years later, he was named the bank’s deputy governor for monetary policy, leading its banking and financial markets divisions, among others.
 Before being made deputy governor, Demarco found himself at the centre of a controversy, when then-communications minister Austin Gatt accused him of leaking confidential information to then-opposition leader Joseph Muscat.
 Demarco, Gatt alleged, was acting as a consultant to the opposition, having reviewed a report for the Labour Party.
 A series of internal probes cleared Demarco of any wrongdoing, finding Gatt’s accusations to be unfounded.
 However, he was told off by a disciplinary committee which, in exonerating Demarco of the accusations, noted that he should have exercised more caution in the matter.
 The affair led to a protracted row with then-Central Bank governor Michael Bonello. Demarco filed a judicial protest accusing Bonello of keeping the outcomes of the investigations exonerating him secret.
 Bonello responded in kind, filing a counter-protest to rebut the accusations.

Tourism revenue expected to exceed €3 billion as MTA eyes new markets,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/tourism-revenue-expected-exceed-3-billion-end-year.1100353,31-10-2024,"005211.png,005212.png","Revenue from tourism is expected to exceed an unprecedented €3 billion by the end of the year, the Tourism Ministry said on Thursday. 
 In a press conference, Malta Tourism Authority CEO Carlo Micallef said tourism revenue has already seen a 23% increase, having already reached €2.2 billion by August. In 2023, the country made a total of €2.7 billion in revenue from tourism. 
 Pivoting to the MTA’s efforts to increase connectivity, Micallef said Malta has direct flights to 110 airports both within and outside of the EU and has undertaken marketing efforts in more than 40 countries. 
 Thanks to Aer Lingus starting to operate in Malta, Micallef said this has allowed Malta to be connected to North America, reaching 15 airports in the US and two in Canada. 
 The MTA, Micallef said, is actively courting another two legacy carriers for travel to Asia and Australia, to expand routes to Malta in the region. 
 The authority has undertaken a competitive marketing strategy to continue to grow tourism during the winter period. The effort, Micallef said, is tailored specifically to different niches and based on data to send targeted advertising to consumers more likely to be higher spenders. 
 According to MTA data, tourists from the United States tended to be the highest spenders while in Malta, followed by those from the UAE, Ireland, Norway, Canada and Australia. 
 Malta is actively competing with destinations such as Budapest, Rome, Paris and Dubai in the winter season while in summer advertising pivots to compete with Mediterranean resort-style locations, including the Spanish and Greek islands as well as Cyprus. 
  Micallef said that tourism in the winter period grew from 993,253 passengers in the 2022-2023 season up to 1,272,059 passengers in the 2023-2024 season. The number has more than doubled since the 2012-2013 period when it stood at 514,273. 
 The tourism industry has been able to grow sustainably because it is cultivating growth in the winter months and staying its hand during the summer season, with hotels being able to keep their room rates up throughout. 
 “You’re not going to see any special offers to Malta, everyone is keeping up their price because we are attracting tourists who are interested in the Maltese product,” he said, adding that the country will no longer see the phenomenon of hotels having to close up for the winter. 
 The average room rate hovered at €202 per night in five-star hotels last year, up from €165 in 2019, while in four-star hotels they stayed at €104 per night, up from €90 in 2019. 
 In line with global trends, Micallef said that the average length of stay has also continued to dip, going from 7.3 nights in 2022 to 6.8 nights in 2023. 
 He said this is viewed positively as it has not impacted spending while hosting travellers for fewer nights lessens their impact on the community. 
  Asked how the government is planning to balance out the so-called quality tourism against the pressures created by instances of mass tourism, including public cleansing and crowding, Tourism Minister Clayton Bartolo said the strategy is no longer courting mass tourism and aims to keep summer traffic steady while continuing to grow in winter. 
 Additionally, he said that the government has plans to announce reform for the tourism accommodation sector, although he declined to elaborate further when asked. 
 “In the coming weeks, we will be going public with a consultation that will help us make that next leap in the sector,” he said. 
 “I believe the same way we introduced the skills pass and left good results for the industry, we will be achieving something similar in this next step.” 
 Bartolo said the government has also stepped up investment in problem areas where the pressures of tourism are felt more keenly, such as increasing waste collection times in the Swieqi, St Julian’s and Sliema areas. 
 Bartolo said the core of the ministry’s strategy is moving away from mass tourism as a whole.
 “We want to give tourists a good experience, focus on spending and have more sustainable bed nights all year round,” he said.  
 “We feel that on these three pillars, we can take tourism to a higher level and so the wider community can benefit from it and not just feel it as a burden.”

Teachers told to return overpay as ministry admits payday 'discrepancies',timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/teachers-receive-calls-return-overpaid-salaries-pay-issues-arise.1100407,11-01-2024,"005242.png,005243.png","Updated 2.55pm with ministry response
 Teachers are facing a raft of payment issues, with many being overpaid and asked to pay the money back, teachers' unions confirmed on Friday. 
 Since Thursday, both the Malta Union of Teachers (MUT) and the Union of Professional Teachers (UPE) have received complaints from their members after receiving incorrect payments.
 The issues seem to stem from changes to teacher pay brought in with the new sectoral agreement signed between the government and the Malta Union of Teachers (MUT) in July.
 The agreement included revised starting salaries, a one-off payment and increased allowances backdated and paid in arrears, among other measures.
 But since Thursday, teachers have reported issues receiving payments agreed upon by the deal, with many saying they received incorrect amounts, while others received calls from government officials asking them to pay back the overpaid sums.
 One teacher told Times of Malta she was alerted to discrepancies in her pay after receiving more than €13,000, which “didn't make any sense at all” as a colleague of hers who had been teaching a year longer received only €9,000. 
 In total, she received over €3,300 in arrears, including almost €1,000 for having taught for more than 16 years - and more than €2,300 for teaching for over 17 years.
  “I have tried calling the department but haven't heard anything. I also emailed them. At this point I'm the one chasing them to return their money; it is an absolute embarrassment from their end,” she said.  
 The teacher added that teachers had been “left in the dark” after receiving no guidance on how their payments would be calculated. 
 “As usual, teachers are not treated with the respect their profession deserves,"" she said.
 MUT president Marco Bonnici said that while “the majority” of state schoolteachers received their adjustments according to the agreement, “there are still some individuals and groups who have not received the adjustments.”
 “We are informed – and have been in communication with the education ministry – that there are still some individuals and groups who have not received the adjustments,"" Bonnici said, pointing to “errors” which he said were “being addressed by the ministry.”
 Calling the situation “complicated”, he said the union was pressuring the ministry to respond to teachers' calls for clarification.
 Bonnici said that while “few” teachers had reported errors so far, many had contacted the ministry “to understand what they received.”
 He added the union was confident the issues would be resolved by the end of the year.
 But Union of Professional Teachers (UPE) executive head Graham Sansone suggested the problem was larger than one confined to a few teachers, saying the union had been “inundated” with complaints from its circa 3,500 members.
 “From what we’re noticing, the majority of arrears payments are incorrect,” he said.
 Sansone said the union was helping its members to work out accurate payments due.
 Stressing the government was “already recalling significant amounts of money,” Sansone said teachers had reported receiving calls from government officials asking them to pay back up to €5,000.
 On Friday afternoon, a spokesperson for the education ministry said while the “majority” of educators had received their pay adjustments “smoothly”, the ministry acknowledged “some discrepancies occurred, resulting in incorrect payment amounts for a limited number of individuals.” 
 The spokesperson said the ministry had “proactively reached out to educators impacted by overpayments to ensure clarity and transparency.” 
 He added that a dedicated email address - info.edu.agreement@gov.mt - had been set up to handle enquiries related to teacher payments.
 Shadow Education Secretary Justin Schembri said he had been contacted by affected teachers, but noted it was difficult to calculate payments en mass as “all were personalised” due to provisions of the sectoral agreement.
 The agreement factors in how many years a teacher has been active, with additional allowances included for those who have been teaching more than 20 years.
 Schembri said that in one case, however, two Learning Support Educators (LSEs) who joined the same year had been paid a difference of €5,000.
 He warned that many teachers might not know if their calculations were correct, however, noting some could be happy to receive an additional payment despite it potentially not being equal to the full amount owed.
 “I advise teachers to send questions to the salary department asking for a breakdown; this is the only way to avoid it,” he said.
 A circular issued to educators earlier on Friday after Times of Malta reported the issue, did not acknowledge if there were errors in the system.
 It instead invited educators with ""questions about your individual outcome"" to contact the education ministry by email if they have any questions.
 Teachers Times of Malta spoke to complained of being paid too much or too little, while others expressed their confusion at payslips seeming to contain contradictory or inaccurate figures. Nearly all were unwilling to speak openly about the issue, however.
 
 As of last month, teachers must now get written permission before speaking to the media and have to tell their bosses what they intend to speak about.
 The move has attracted criticism from educators and politicians, with Sansone calling the rules ""unheard of"" and independent candidate and academic Arnold Cassola branding them ""fascist"".

Malta to sign up to international maritime convention ,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/malta-sign-international-maritime-convention.1094006,18-06-2024,005504.png,"Malta is expected to sign an important United Nations convention on Wednesday in a ceremony that will see a special UN book brought to the country for the occasion.
 Verdala Castle will host a United Nations convention inviting foreign dignitaries from Europe and around the world to add their signatures to an international maritime treaty.
 The treaty aims to provide certainty to purchasers of ships sold in ‘judicial sales’ – when vessels are sold by authorities to settle outstanding debts – by ensuring such ships are not rearrested by old creditors. 
 But as well as foreign representatives, the convention will also see the official UN treaty book brought to Malta for the signing, an event considered to be an exceptional event by legal experts. 
 It is hoped that through the convention, international shipping – responsible for transporting around 90% of world trade and of which Malta is a significant player – will become more stable and attractive to investment.
 First signed by 15 countries in Beijing in September, the UN Convention on the International Effects of Judicial Sales of Ships was introduced to combat what maritime experts say was an unstable situation resulting from illegitimate claims of old creditors against legitimate buyers of ships in judicial sales. 
 When ship owners are unable to settle their debts, often the only way forward is the arrest and judicial sale of the ship with the sale price used to pay off the debts.  
 But legal experts say legitimate buyers who purchase such vessels may face serious challenges when hit by claims from old creditors who refuse to consider the matter settled, despite the ship passing to a new owner.
  They argue this puts off potential buyers, who can sometimes struggle to see the registration of the ship’s previous owner, or its mortgagees removed in favour of their own.
 This can lead to so-called ‘double arrests’, with such vessels being arrested for a second time despite having been bought ‘clean’ by new owners, with the convention aiming to put a stop to these tactics. 
 Maritime lawyer and Comité Maritime International president Ann Fenech – the CMI coordinator at the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law – said it would “ensure stability” for the sector and promote interest in judicial sales.
 She said the move would lead to better sale prices, with buyers more confident their new vessel would not be rearrested and provide more certainty to crews keen to be paid and repatriated to their families.
 
 Stressing its importance for Malta, one of the largest flags in the world, Fenech said it was important for buyers and their financiers to be able to invest in such vessels “without fear they will be rearrested in other jurisdictions.""
 The convention has already been signed by China, Burkina Faso, Comoros, El Salvador, Grenada, Honduras, Kiribati, Liberia, São Tomé and Principe, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Singapore, Syria and Switzerland, Ecuador, Tanzania, Belgium and Luxembourg.
 Following the EU signing up in March, European countries including Malta are now free to add their signatures to the convention. It is expected that various EU countries will sign on Wednesday.

MDA pushes for minimum wage rise and a universal 15% corporate tax rate,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/mda-pushes-minimum-wage-rise-universal-15-corporate-tax-rate.1098097,14-09-2024,"005536.png,005537.png","Malta’s minimum wage should rise to at least €1,100 a month while corporate tax rates should be harmonised to remove disparities between foreign and local firms, the Malta Developers Association believes.
 The proposals are among a raft of suggestions that the MDA has presented to the government ahead of its Budget for 2025.
 Those suggestions range from the expected, such as renewing schemes to encourage the restoration of old properties or purchases by first- and second-time buyers, to more left-field ideas, such as tax breaks for people who park their cars in garages or making interest paid on home loans tax-deductible.
 Arguably the MDA’s most radical pre-budget proposal, however, is that of totally overhauling Malta’s corporate tax structure to result in a flat 15% rate for all businesses.
 The MDA would like to see tax rates for foreign businesses gradually raised from their current effective 5% rate, while tax rates for local entrepreneurs are slowly slashed from their 35% rate.
  To help address housing affordability, the MDA is proposing a revamp of tax rates for landlords of rental properties. The MDA believes that long-term rental properties rented out for €1,000 or less should be subject to a 5% tax rate. Currently, all rental properties are subject to a 15% rate, irrespective of value.

MFSA fines tripled last year over 2022,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/hold-mfsa-fines-tripled-last-year-previous-year.1094491,26-06-2024,005729.png,"Malta's financial regulator last year issued fines totalling three times the amount levied in the previous year.
 The Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA) issued €444,800 worth of fines through 77 enforcement actions last year, according to its 2023 annual report tabled in parliament on Wednesday.
 This is more than three times the amount issued in 2022, when €147,445 worth of fines were issued through 44 enforcement actions.
 
 The MFSA issues licenses to banks, insurance companies, investment firms and all other financial institutions operating in Malta.
 It is responsible for overseeing and enforcing financial regulations on more than 2,000 entities and often issues fines to punish infringements and deter financial crime.
 From 474 investigations, the MFSA issued 77 enforcement measures in 2023. These ranged from 60 administrative penalties to five directives, four settlement agreements, three licenses cancelled, two individuals not deemed fit and proper, and one entity that was struck off the register.
 Another entity had a competent person appointed to ensure compliance, and another had its license suspended.
 CEO Kenneth Farrugia told reporters that enforcement actions, especially fines, must be proportionate, but crucially, dissuasive, to ensure a stable and secure sector going forward, and acknowledged that if the courts slash MFSA fines on appeal, enforcement that is fair and works for everyone must be remodelled with authorities and lawmakers.
 ""Nearly half of our inspection also had an anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing element, and we undertook 44 FIAU-delegated supervisory engagements specifically focused on financial crime compliance,"" he said.
 ""These efforts underscore our resolve to combat financial crime and uphold Malta's reputation as a secure, safe and transparent financial hub.""
 The annual report also notes that last year the authority received 352 licence applications across various sectors, with 84 per cent being approved. The remaining 16 per cent were either withdrawn by the applicants or refused by the MFSA.
 The MFSA's supervisory interactions with its licenced entities quadrupled between 2019 and 2023 and increased by 50 per cent last year alone.
 These interactions included inspections, meetings, and even ""mystery shopping"" exercises to assess compliance.
 To support the intensifying workload, the MFSA has grown its workforce significantly, according to the report.
 It added 107 new recruits last year, bringing the total to nearly 500 full-time equivalent employees. This expanded team underwent extensive training, logging more than 27,000 hours last year.
 Meanwhile, the ""stable and resilient"" financial sector continues to thrive, seeing an 11.8 per cent growth last year, generating €1,251 million in gross value added.
 The sector grew by nearly 6,500 people between 2019 and 2023, the authority said.
 MFSA chair Jesmond Gatt said the industry has seen steady growth, reflecting the strength and stability of Malta's financial ecosystem.
 ""Locally, the industry has demonstrated remarkable resilience and growth in 2023, outperforming many of our peers in the Euro area,"" he said.
 Gatt and Farrugia also fielded questions on Central Bank governor Edward Scicluna, who stands charged in court over the hospitals deal and who still sits on the MFSA's board of governors.
 They confirmed his case is being monitored and he is still considered as ""fit and proper"" to hold onto his seat. His case is not being treated any differently from similar cases in the past.
 Any further decisions will be taken in due course, as the court case progresses, they insisted.

Mellieħa mayor caught off-guard by MTA's push for more tables and chairs,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/mellieha-mayor-caught-offguard-mta-push-tables-chairs.1097676,09-07-2024,005779.png,"Mellieħa mayor Gabriel Micallef has expressed surprise at the Malta Tourism Authority’s (MTA) application to increase the area for tables and chairs in the town’s parish square.
 The application, which covers the space in front of the Mellieħa parish church, was submitted without prior consultation with the local council, raising concerns about the process.
 
 An MTA spokesperson clarified that the application is part of the Mellieħa parish square master plan, launched earlier this year.
 “This type of application sets limits for any future proposals for tables and chairs,” the spokesperson said.
 “It ensures that future operators cannot exceed the parameters established in the plan. If approved, the application will also nullify existing permits in the area.”
 The process, which began in February, aims to regulate the use of public spaces in Mellieħa’s square, balancing both commercial and community interests.
 However, Micallef noted that the first meeting between the council and the MTA only occurred in late August – months after the process had begun.
 “I was abroad when this issue surfaced, and I was sent several photos of the permit,” Micallef said.
 “I was caught by surprise as I don’t recall any consultation about this.”
 Micallef’s primary concern is the lack of public consultation.
 
 In a social media post following the August meeting, which included the tourism minister, MTA officials and architects, Micallef stated that while the plan had been explained, the council’s request for formal public consultation was turned down.
 The MTA responded that stakeholders had been kept informed but never directly confirmed that a consultation had taken place.
 “This was one of the final administrative actions required to establish the parameters for parking areas and to limit lines for current and future proposals for tables and chairs,” said the spokesperson.
 “The elements of the plan do not necessarily reflect the MTA’s original ideas, as they had to be adjusted to reflect local realities and practicalities. Furthermore, the application carries out the widest possible consultation exercise, where anyone, not just Mellieħa residents, can submit comments,” continued the spokesperson.
 Mellieħa’s mayor remains concerned about the potential impact on the community.
 Micallef referred to Victoria, where unchecked commercial expansion has negatively affected public spaces despite the city having its own master plan.
 “We need to make sure we proceed in a balanced manner; we don’t want to face the same issues as Gozo,” Micallef said.
 To address the matter, Micallef said the council would undertake its own research to represent residents’ concerns.
 “We can’t move forward without consulting the people,” he said. “At the end of the day, they are the ones who elected us.”
 The issue of tables and chairs has been contentious in the locality. In April, residents and activists staged a protest at Misraħ iż-Żjara tal-Papa, in Mellieħa by occupying restaurant tables and chairs, claiming that an establishment was illegally using public space without a permit.
 They said they wanted to send a strong message against the occupation of public spaces by tables and chairs, which they said were choking streets, pavements and squares, and accused “useless authorities” of facilitating rampant abuse.
 They argued that public spaces belong to the community, insisting it was within their rights to reclaim them.

Hili Ventures to hit €1 billion in revenue In 2024,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/hili-ventures-hit-1-billion-revenue-in-2024.1092873,23-05-2024,005949.png,"Malta-based Hili Ventures is expecting to achieve revenues of over €1 billion in 2024 for the first time since it was incorporated just over a decade ago.
 This was announced as the group published its consolidated financial statements for the year ended 2023, in which it registered revenues just short of the billion-euro mark at €987 million, marking an increase of 26% over 2022.
 Chairman Archie Bethel said, “Last year was a record year for the group, including a major acquisition in Poland, 11 new McDonald’s restaurants across Europe and more than 1,300 people added to the team. The results speak for themselves, and we are even more motivated to deliver on the many ambitious projects in our pipeline this year. We pledge to keep delivering real value to our shareholders, while being a good neighbour in the communities in which we operate.”
 Chief Executive Officer Melo Hili said, “It is important to recognise that this is ultimately the result of 12,000 people working in diverse teams and industries, across 10 countries, with a common set of values. Seeing everybody’s work pay off, especially after the challenges of the past few years, strengthens our resolve to keep driving market leadership in each industry we operate in.”
 Hili Ventures holds a diverse portfolio of businesses and is best known for its major pillar Premier Capital p.l.c., which is the developmental licensee for McDonald’s in Malta, Estonia, Greece, Latvia, Lithuania and Romania, with 185 restaurants across these markets.
 The group’s portfolio also includes 1923 Investments p.l.c., which owns iSpot Poland Sp. Z o.o., Poland’s largest Apple Premium Reseller business which has a network of 47 stores and service points across major Polish cities.
 All of the group’s direct operating subsidiaries, including Hili Properties p.l.c. and Breakwater Investments Limited (previously known as HV Marine), registered growth in varying degrees, with group EBITDA reaching €125 million, compared to €99 million in 2022.
 Setting its sights on 2024, the group is eyeing further growth in each industry and building on previous success by expanding its network and internationalising its service portfolio further.
 It is also awaiting planning permission for its landmark Six Senses Comino Hotel, an eco-luxury destination which will be built on a smaller footprint than the current development. HV Hospitality Ltd, the group’s hospitality arm, has also committed to restoring substantial areas of land around the site by planting more than 55,000 endemic trees, shrubs and plants.

Food inflation slowed after Stabbiltá scheme's introduction: Central Bank,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/food-inflation-slowed-stabbilta-scheme-introduction-central-bank.1096965,20-08-2024,006130.png,"The government’s controversial Stabbiltá scheme, which saw the price of some 450 food items slashed by 15%, has contributed to food inflation dropping by 2%, according to a new economic forecast published by the Central Bank on Tuesday.
 The scheme, introduced in February, was touted as a measure to contain inflation across several essential food products.
 The Central Bank report notes that once the scheme was introduced, inflation across almost all food products slowed, with some (such as margarine, pasta and preserved milk) reversing their price increases altogether.
 By June, the price of food products affected by the scheme was two percentage points lower than it was before the scheme’s introduction in January, the report says.
 However, the report says, it is difficult to gauge the precise impact of the scheme, since these figures also include brands and food items that were not included in the scheme.
 Nevertheless, Malta’s food inflation across some food products, particularly processed food, remains higher than that across the Euro area, the report continues. It ties this to Malta's dependence on importation, making Malta's food inflation more volatile than that of many other European countries.
 More broadly, the report predicts that Malta’s GDP will gradually slow down, dipping from 5.7% in 2023 to 4.4% this year and, eventually, 3.4% by 2026.
 The country’s deficit, which has seen it placed under the EU’s excessive deficit procedures, will drop from 4.9% (or almost €1 billion) in 2023 to 3.1% by 2026 as inflation-mitigation measures are gradually cut.
 The bank predicts that Malta’s debt-to-GDP ratio of 50.3% by last year’s count will rise to just over 54% over the next three years, but will remain below the Maastricht criteria’s 60% threshold.
 There is good news for workers, with the bank predicting that Malta’s average wage is set to grow “at a significantly faster rate” throughout 2024 after lagging behind inflation for several months.
 The report suggests that wages will grow by 5.1% in 2024, as they try to make up for their “lagged response” to the rising cost of living, which has seen people’s wages outpaced by their daily expenses.
 This means that wages will finally start to “catch up” to the rising cost of living, with the real value of people’s wages getting closer to what it was before the cost of living crisis that hit the world in recent years.
 But this rapid growth will be short-lived, with the growth in wages set to dip to 3.8% in 2025 and 3.2% in 2026.

Ex-commissioner slams 'insulting' Mediterrane film festival expenditure,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/excommissioner-slams-insulting-mediterrane-film-festival-expenditure.1094748,07-02-2024,006041.png,"Updated 10.55 with PN statement below.
 Former film commissioner Oliver Mallia said on Monday it was ""insulting"" that only €1 million was invested in local productions over the span of a year, while the Mediterrane Film Festival - a one-time annual event - cost almost  €4 million.
 Mallia raised the issue on social media in a ""public letter"" to President Myriam Spiteri Debono.
 His comments follow an appeal by the president, who, speaking at a Mediterrane Film Festival flagship event on Sunday, urged the Film Commission and Commissioner to respect the principles of accountability and good governance in a bid to foster the public’s trust in their operations.
  Mallia commended Spiteri Debono for her comments, saying her message could not have come at a better time.
 “You delivered your message at an event that was not included in the budget approved by Parliament for 2024 and which was organised by an entity that, for the past five years, has ignored its legal obligations and systematically failed to report its annual expenditure to parliament,” said Mallia.
 In her address on Sunday, the president said the number of local workers employed by the film industry had grown from 300 in 2017 to 1,000.
 However, Mallia refuted the claim that there were currently 1,000 full-time workers in the film industry.
 In his post on Facebook, Mallia maintained that a national film festival was ""necessary"". 
 Mallia knows first-hand about the impact of film festivals: he organised the Valletta Film Festival for several years.
 On Monday he suggested that the €8 million spent on the two editions of the Mediterrane Film Festival could be better spent, including investing in a Centre for Cinema, joining the Council of Europe programme  Eurimages, providing more funding to local productions, and creating better film programmes to help boost local film literacy.
 PN joins criticism of Film Commission's spending
 The Nationalist Party on Tuesday also joined criticism of excessive spending by the Film Commission, saying taxpayer funds were being squandered to benefit the few.
 Referring to the Mediterrane Film Festival and the concluding Golden Bee Awards, shadow minister Julie Zahra said that while the film industry was important, the PN was concerned that the Film Commissioner was dictating everything without consulting anyone.  
 The government, she said, was not being clear about what returns the country was getting for its spending. What use was it to spend excessively to get foreign guests to announce prize winners, when the actual winners did not turn up?  
 Zahra said the PN agreed with President Myriam Spiteri Debono that the film commissioner should respect the principles of accountability and good governance.

GDP up by 8% in third quarter: provisional estimates,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/gdp-8-third-quarter-provisional-estimates.1101619,27-11-2024,"006097.png,006098.png","The Gross Domestic Product for the third quarter of this year increased by 8 per cent to €5.9 billion, according to provisional estimates. 
 In volume terms, GDP rose by 4.9 per cent, the National Statistics Office said on Wednesday.
 The GDP deflator went up by 2.9 per cent compared to the same quarter last year. This represents a decrease of 2.6 percentage points in comparison to the year-on-year rate recorded in the third quarter of 2023.
 The production approach
 The production approach, also called the output approach, measures GDP as the sum of the Gross Value Added (GVA), which is the difference between value of output and the value of intermediate consumption and taxes, less subsidies on products.
 During the third quarter of 2024, GVA rose by 5.7 per cent in volume terms when compared to the corresponding quarter of 2023.
 The expenditure approach
 The expenditure approach is another method used to calculate GDP and is derived by adding final consumption expenditure, gross capital formation and exports, less imports.
 Domestic demand had a positive contribution of 4.9 percentage points to the year-on-year GDP growth rate in volume terms.
 External demand had a neutral contribution.
 In the third quarter of 2024, final consumption expenditure witnessed an increase of 6.3 per cent in volume terms: This was the result of an increase in the expenditure of households and general government of 5.1 and 10.5 per cent, respectively.
 Conversely, non-profit institutions serving households' final consumption expenditure decreased by 1.4 per cent.
 Gross fixed capital formation increased by 5.3 per cent in volume terms.
 Exports and imports of goods and services in volume terms rose by 3.8 and 4.4 per cent, respectively.
 The income approach
 The third approach to measure economic activity is the income approach, which shows how GDP is distributed among compensation of employees, operating surplus of enterprises and taxes on production and imports net of subsidies.
 Compared to the third quarter of 2023, the €435 million increase in nominal GDP was the result of a €223.6 million increase in compensation of employees, a €211.0 million rise in gross operating surplus and mixed-income, and an increase of €0.3 million in taxes on production and imports, less subsidies.
 Gross National Income 
 GNI differs from the GDP measure in terms of net compensation receipts, net property income receivable and net taxes receivable on production and imports from abroad.
 Considering the effects of income and taxation paid and received by residents to and from the rest of the world, GNI at market prices for the third quarter of 2024 was estimated at €5.2 billion.

EasyJet to buy Malta-based SR Technics,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/easyjet-buy-maltabased-sr-technics.1091848,21-06-2024,006504.png,"Budget airline EasyJet is set to acquire Malta-based aircraft maintenance company SR Technics.
 EasyJet plc, Europe’s second-largest budget airline, notified the Malta Competition and Consumer Affairs Authority (MCCAA) of its intention to buy SR Technics, with the authority giving notice of the one-week time window for objections to be filed.
 
 SR Technics Malta Ltd, a prominent maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) company within the aviation sector, originally opened its base in Malta in 2010 and EasyJet is one of its main clients. 
 It recently moved into its cutting-edge six-bay hangar facility at Ħal-Farruġ, which spans 40,000 square metres, with more expansion plans in the pipeline for the next two years. It invested over €42 million in its new facility, which was inaugurated by Prime Minister Robert Abela in March 2022.
 The Zurich-based company currently employs 430 professionals specialising in comprehensive heavy base maintenance services for the Airbus A320 family narrow-body fleet.
 SR Technics was initially set up as the technical department of the former Swiss Air but was established as a separate company in 1997.
 Luton-based EasyJet plc is a European point-to-point airline with a fleet of 336 Airbus A320 family aircraft, operating 1,018 routes across 35 countries and 155 airports. The airline also sells package holidays and travel insurance to customers on an agency basis.
 In its notice, issued in terms of the Control of Concentrations Regulations and published also in The Malta Government Gazette, the director general of the Office for Competition invited interested third parties to submit their written objections on this notified concentration within seven days.
 Last October, SR Technics Malta announced that it had secured a new three-year contract with EasyJet, which it described as a “valuable customer since 2010”.
 “We are extremely pleased and honoured to secure a new three-year contract with our high valued and important customer. This goes to show the incredible relationship we have cultivated as we marked the 13th year of collaboration,” SR Technics Malta general manager, Daniel Galea had said on that occasion.
 Brendan McConnellogue, director of engineering and maintenance at EasyJet, said the airline was delighted to be continuing its longstanding relationship with SR Technics in Malta, “who have demonstrated to us they are the right partner to continue supporting our industry-leading maintenance operations for our modern fleet of over 300 Airbus A320 aircraft”.

 The Standards Committee's measures do not go far enough to address governance concerns, they said in separate statements. 
 The committee ruled this week that Bartolo must apologise in parliament and refund excess payments made to his wife Amanda Muscat, who was paid as a top ministry consultant while doing secretarial work.
 Camilleri, who remains Gozo Minister, and Bartolo were both found guilty of abusing their power by securing false consultancy jobs for Muscat.
 Bartolo has since resigned as Tourism Minister over a separate scandal, but KSU has maintained that Camilleri’s position is untenable.
 “KSU maintains that Clint Camilleri’s position is also untenable and that he should shoulder political responsibility and resign,” the council said in a statement.
 Last week, before Bartolo’s resignation, KSU led 16 other student organisations in calling for both ministers to step down.
 The MEA also expressed dissatisfaction with the parliamentary decisions, with director general Kevin J. Borg arguing that the governance failing at the heart of the scandal ""has not been fully resolved.""
 “We remain concerned that this scandal has negatively affected the psyche and morale of honest workers and citizens,” Borg said. 
 He further criticised Bartolo’s comments that “degrees and qualifications aren’t everything,” labelling them as contrary to the association’s education, training, and meritocracy principles.
 Meanwhile, the Malta Chamber of Commerce, which had urged the government to act decisively, declined to comment further.
 A spokesperson said, “We are not engaging anymore on this issue. We have already said what needs to be said in our press release and will not be commenting any further.”
 Previously, the chamber called for Prime Minister Robert Abela to enforce stricter ethical standards for ministerial conduct, stressing the need to treat such breaches with the seriousness they deserve.
 During Wednesday's parliamentary committee session, Opposition motions demanding that Camilleri resign as a minister,  Bartolo be suspended as an MP for 30 days and Muscat to refund the full amount she earned as a consultant at Camilleri’s Gozo Ministry were voted down by the Speaker, who held a casting vote.
 The Opposition has since said that it is dissatisfied with the sanctions adopted by the committee. Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech has urged people to attend a demonstration planned for outside parliament next Monday - its second such event in week.

 Last week HSBC Bank Malta reported a pre-tax profit of €39.3m for the same period. 
 BOV said its positive performance was influenced by an improvement in operating income, reflecting a growth of 22.9% to €117.4 million when compared with the same period in 2023. This was driven by increased returns both from an interest and non-interest income perspective.
 Net Interest Income stood at €98.3 million, an increase of €24.8 million when compared with the first quarter of 2023. This reflected expansion in both the customer lending and proprietary investment portfolios over the last 12 months, as well as improved rates on cash balances.
 Net fee and commission income was up by 11%, mainly influenced by higher amounts being achieved on credit-related business.
 Operating costs including strategy amounted to €49.1 million, equivalent to a 6.8% increase on previous year results.
 The bank said the Cost to Income Ratio continued trending downwards, standing at 41.8% in the first quarter. These developments were reflected in a 20.4% pre-tax Return on Average Equity, which was a 4.4% improvement over that recorded in the first quarter of 2023.
 ""With a gross loan-to-deposit ratio of 53.4% and strong sanctioning levels of business and retail loans, the Group is well positioned for further growth and to deliver its 2024 targets. The €47 million reduction in the deposit base equivalent to a 0.4% drop on FY23 end results aligns with expectations; nevertheless, the Group retained high levels of liquidity,"" BOV said.
 Speaking during the announcement, BOV Chairman Gordon Cordina said the results were extremely encouraging and testament to the bank’s ongoing efforts to grow its core business.  
 He observed that while the European Central Bank (ECB) had maintained the rate on its deposit facility at 4% since September 2023, it may start reducing the current level of monetary policy restriction sometime in 2024. In preparation of a falling interest rate scenario, the bank has been proactively restructuring its balance sheet, through the redeployment of treasury funds into longer-term assets, and a productive expansion in good-quality credit. The bank’s exposure to cyclical fluctuations in rates has thus been reduced and this should generate a more stable positive performance over time.
 ""We also believe that Malta’s current and near-term economic environment has remained benign, supporting our positive expectations vis-à-vis further growth in our loans, and the preservation of asset quality over the coming months,” he said.

APS confirms its interest to acquire HSBC Malta,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/aps-confirms-interest-acquire-hsbc-malta.1101692,28-11-2024,007001.png,"APS Bank confirmed for the first time on Thursday that it is pursuing the acquisition of the 70.03% stake in HSBC Bank Malta currently held by HSBC Continental Europe and has submitted a non-binding offer.
 Earlier on Thursday, HSBC Malta said a number of bidders had shown interest in acquiring its shares and it would be convening an extraordinary general meeting to obtain shareholder approval to allow the interested parties to conduct due diligence checks and take negotiations to the next level. 
 Times of Malta last September revealed that talks between APS and HSBC’s global shareholders had been underway for more than two years. At the time APS bank CEO Marcel Cassar said the bank owed it to its shareholders to explore opportunities for growth. HSBC Bank Malta had said it was unaware of the talks - since they were being held with the parent company. 
 On Thursday, APS said it is being assisted in the acquisition process by Alvarez & Marsal as lead financial advisor, and Ganado Advocates as legal counsel. Other advisors are lined up to join once work on a potential transaction, including any due diligence exercise, unfolds in due course.
 ""During this period, the bank’s board of directors and management will be engaging with their various stakeholders to help inform them further about the rationale and merits of such an acquisition.""
 The biggest shareholders in APS are the Archdiocese of Malta 55.2% and the Gozo Diocese 12.7%.
 ""As shown consistently in recent years, the bank has been growing steadily, improving efficiencies, services and revenues thanks to the significant transformational investment in technology, people and systems. This has led the APS Bank Group to a strong market position which also brings with it greater responsibilities. The bank has long identified the need for scale as a priority and this led to many months of studies and extensive, professional evaluation that now underpin the non-binding offer,"" APS said.
 ""In the bank’s view, its proposal presents the best future for all the stakeholders of HSBC Bank Malta plc, and of course those of APS Bank plc.""
 HSBC is the second largest bank in Malta with a 21% market share, following Bank of Valletta, which has a 44% share. APS is the third largest bank with an 11% share of the market.

"Cap on TCNs, incentive for Maltese to return home: Chamber's budget proposals",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/cap-tcns-incentive-maltese-return-home-chamber-budget-proposals.1097243,26-08-2024,"006925.png,006926.png,006927.png,006928.png,006929.png","The Malta Chamber is proposing a cap on the percentage of non-EU workers each business can employ, tax exemptions to entice Maltese abroad to return home and parking fees to help end traffic congestion.
 These are among the 36 'priority' proposals outlined by the Malta Chamber in a document ahead of the 2025 budget. 
 The chamber said a strategic workforce was needed to address shortages and ensure a balance between staffing and the country's capacity to accommodate workers.
 Its suggestion to cap the percentage of non-EU workers, known as third-country nationals, comes amid concerns of overpopulation. The chamber said such capping should not apply to businesses providing essential services or where it is otherwise crucial.
 Identifying 12 main priority areas, the chamber called for a new economic model for Malta that favours a high value-added economy over the current model, which it says is based on population growth at lower productivity levels.
  At a news conference, Chris Vassallo Cesareo, president of the Malta Chamber said the time for action is now. 
 ""Last year we presented 219 proposals.  Only four were implemented.  The rest remain valid,"" he said. 
 ""Now we are making further proposals. Without further delay even if difficult or unpopular, the government has to take measures to address the pressing issues.""
 Fielding questions from Times of Malta, chamber CEO Marthese Portelli said she could not comment on the  prime minister’s promise of the ""biggest tax cuts in history"" in the upcoming budget.
  “It would be quite immature to say what our position is because we do not have the details yet, but we can definitely say that any reduced tax rates need to be seen in context.”
 She said chamber's proposal last year for COLA not to be taxed had been met with a negative response “because of financial issues.”
 The document presented by the chamber says that the transformation of Malta's economic model requires a multi-year investment plan on energy coupled with the gradual removal of subsidies, and measures to promote environmentally sustainable modes of transport including the introduction of parking fees.
 On planning, the Malta Chamber advocated for a review of the Strategic Plan for the Environment and Development (SPED), last carried out in 2015.
 It said public areas should be regularly cleaned and maintained and there should be a centrally managed permitting system. 
 On tourism, it calls for a moratorium on applications for tourism accommodation and a ""clear plan"" for tables and chairs, which many have complained have overtaken public space. 
 A percentage of the VAT generated by each locality should be invested back into the area, it said. 
 It repeated its proposal to introduce parking fees in central urban areas, but said these should be payable to an e-mobility wallet, which would be used to fund sustainable transport options.
 With the e-mobility wallet, the government would allocate an annual amount to each wallet to be used for various environmentally sustainable or shared transportation options.
 It calls for improvements in public transport access to and from industrial estates, ensuring coverage of all key routes, all shifts, and better access to factory locations, particularly at night.
 Additionally, it suggests linking car license fees to usage and restricting certain activities that cause congestion during peak hours, with incentives for night shifts and the pooling of delivery fleets.
 While urging the incorporation of planned tax refunds by cheque into revised tax bands, the Malta Chamber also calls for improvements in tax collection, a reduction in public spending, and a focus on value-added expenditure.
 It says the incorporation of planned tax refunds by cheque into the revised tax bands would eliminate the administrative burden of issuing these cheques and improve the monthly take-home pay of employed individuals.
 It also advocates for encouragement in the uptake of supplementary pensions and the implementation of an auto-enrolment with an opt-out mechanism for employees.""
 The Malta Chamber calls for a five-to-10-year energy investment plan, to be developed in consultation with the private sector, with clear milestones and deliverables based on realistic growth projections and the available skills.
  “The plan must ensure that the investment in the distribution network is not only adequate for immediate needs but also serves us well for the next three decades.”
 It should also support broader renewable energy generation and distribution, while addressing the liberalisation of energy distribution.
 Alongside a widespread national campaign on climate change, the Malta Chamber advocates for the gradual reduction of subsidies, with a minimum of six months' advance notice, to avoid subsidising excessive consumption and to increase the uptake of renewables.
 Under the heading 'Value-Added Employment', the chamber called for tax exemptions for highly qualified Maltese people who return to Malta. 
 It is also calling for constant monitoring of temping and outsourcing agencies. Temping and outsourcing agencies would not qualify as permanent employers under its proposals.
 It proposes that employment licenses for third-country nationals be extendable for an additional three years after the first year of successful employment with the same permanent employer, provided that third-country nationals meet certain educational requirements, possess specialised skills in demand, and have a good record of adhering to laws and integrating into society.
 It also advocates for encouragement in the uptake of supplementary pensions and the implementation of an auto-enrolment with an opt-out mechanism for employees.""
 Employers who contribute should be granted more attractive tax incentives than those currently offered.""
 The Malta Chamber has also called for investment to ensure an adequate electricity supply, a stable distribution network, and adequate water supply and sewage systems that meet demand.
 It has put forward proposals to support sustainable renewable energy adoption, including a feed-in tariff for businesses that offers better returns on investment.
 Regarding competitiveness, the Malta Chamber states that the country needs to transition towards a more sustainable approach to infrastructural development that considers economic growth, competitiveness, and environmental, and social sustainability.
 On tourism, it says that “to remain competitive against other Mediterranean countries, quality should be maintained throughout all elements of the supply chain, not least, our infrastructure.”
 The Malta Chamber also notes the increasing turnover and changes in high-ranking positions within government ministries, entities, authorities, agencies, and departments.“
 This instability does not bode well for the country,” it notes.
 It also calls for proactive, coordinated, and impartial enforcement at all levels.
 The Malta Chamber argues that, in addition to aiming to improve business efficiency and productivity, the government must invest in necessary reforms to ensure good governance across the board.“
 Budget 2025 must seek to tangibly transform the current economic model into one that results in a well-being economy benefiting society at large,” it says.
 The underlying principles of good governance play a crucial role in this.
 Ethical businesses are being penalised for being good corporate citizens, while unethical operators thrive by evading or circumventing their obligations due to a lack of proper enforcement and good governance.
 ""Failures in good governance undermine ethical business practices and society at large,"" it said.

Construction 'least important' industry for Malta's growth - national survey,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/construction-least-important-industry-malta-growth-national-survey.1094206,20-06-2024,007251.png,"Construction is the last industry upon which to build Malta’s economy, according to respondents to the latest edition of the State of the Nation survey.
 The survey asked respondents how important they viewed several industries – from financial services to manufacturing, film, and retail – to be in growing Malta’s economy, asking them to rate each industry out of a score of five.
 Two of Malta’s primary industries, gaming and construction, came dead last, with construction scoring a lowly 2.97, comfortably below all other industries.
 Another of Malta’s staple industries, tourism, topped the rankings with a score of over 4.5, with retail and financial services also scoring highly.  
 
 The findings of the State of the Nation survey, now in its fourth edition, were presented during a conference at Verdala Palace on Thursday morning. The survey asked 1,064 people about their views on several issues, including religion, culture and politics.
 The construction sector has long been a bone of contention, with many, including finance minister Clyde Caruana, warning that Malta must overhaul its economic model to move away from construction, or risk facing severe social and economic challenges.
 Other cabinet members, including economy minister Silvio Schembri have been more cautious, saying that the country’s economic model just needs some tweaking.
 Nevertheless, most people appear to be satisfied with their economic situation. Four out of every five respondents say that their standard of living is within the norm, and the number of people who think that they will be better off in a year’s time is on the rise.
 But people are increasingly feeling that their rights are not being adequately protected. Just over half of all respondents (52%) say that this is the case.
 
 This is the lowest portion since the survey began, dropping from a high of 67% in 2022. A further third say that their rights could be better protected, while one in ten believe that their rights aren’t being protected at all.

"Fitch affirms Malta's credit rating, revises GDP growth forecasts upwards",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/fitch-affirms-malta-credit-rating-revises-gdp-growth-upwards.1098091,14-09-2024,007420.png,"Fitch Ratings has affirmed Malta's 'A+' credit rating with a stable outlook, highlighting the country's robust economic performance while drawing attention to fiscal challenges that could pose risks in the future.
 Malta's economy continues to show strong momentum, Fitch noted, highlighting projected GDP growth of 5.7% this year (versus 0.8% for the Eurozone and 2% for other A-rated countries).
 This upward trend has been bolstered by the services and financial sectors and a robust recovery in tourism. In the first half of 2024, tourist arrivals surged past pre-pandemic levels by 32%, according to the credit rating agency.
 Fitch’s GDP projections for Malta have grown more optimistic in the past few months. When the agency last rated Malta, in March, it said it expected 4.1% growth this year and 3.7% in 2025.
 Now it is saying the economy will grow by 5.7% in 2024 and 4.3% in 2025.
 Despite the upbeat growth figures, Fitch pinpointed structural challenges, particularly in the labour market.
 Unemployment is expected to remain low at 3.2% on average over the rating horizon, well below the eurozone average of 6.5%. However, the Maltese economy faces skill shortages and low productivity – issues which persist despite a massive influx of foreign workers. These challenges could hinder future growth potential if not addressed, Fitch warned.
  Prime Minister Robert Abela highlighted the disparity in projected growth rates between Malta and the Eurozone average. That fast economic growth would allow Malta to lower taxes and maintain energy subsidies ""while still reducing the deficit,"" he said.
 Fiscal Concerns and Narrowing Deficits
 Fitch projects Malta’s fiscal deficit to gradually narrow, reaching 4% of GDP this year and declining to 3% by 2026. However, the agency flagged uncertainties regarding the government's fixed-price energy policy, which currently lacks a clear exit strategy. Energy subsidies are closely linked to international price developments, and their future cost could pose fiscal risks, it noted.
 The government has previously said that it will keep subsidies in place until new, cheaper ways of purchasing energy become available. That is expected to happen when a second interconnector is completed.
 Malta’s deficit, which is high by European standards, means the country is currently the subject of EU excessive deficit procedures under new rules introduced this year.
 The government has said it is committed to keeping debt below the 60% of GDP threshold and wants to slash the deficit to 3% within the next two years.
 Following a revision of Malta's national accounts, the country’s debt ratio stood at 47.3% of GDP at the end of 2023. Fitch forecasts that this ratio will rise to 49.6% by the end of 2024, still below the 'A' median of 53.3%. Financing risks are considered low due to ample liquidity in the domestic banking sector and a strong domestic investor base, with only 18% of government debt held by non-residents.
 Malta's external position remains solid, with the country being one of the largest net external creditors in Fitch's sovereign universe. The net international investment position is forecasted to exceed 80% of GDP by the end of 2024, with modest current account surpluses averaging 1.4% of GDP from 2024 to 2026. However, Fitch noted that these external assets are inflated by multinational activities in sectors like finance and aviation, which have limited ties to the domestic economy.
 Fitch noted that uncertainties surrounding the EU's Minimum Tax Directive could also pose medium-term risks to public finances. Corporate tax revenues are a crucial source of government income, helping to balance the low share of labour taxes and the considerable VAT gap, one of the largest in the EU. Malta has opted for a six-year transition period for the introduction of the 15% minimum effective tax rate for companies.
 Fitch noted the government's efforts to improve VAT tax collection and address concerns over tax planning structures as part of Malta's Recovery and Resilience Plan.
 It again highlighted uncertainty surrounding Malta’s cash-for-passports scheme, which was projected to generate revenues of 0.6% of GDP this year. Malta is currently being sued by the European Commission's at the European Court of Justice to end the scheme.
 Malta ranked high on Fitch’s ESG relevance score metric, with the agency saying the country enjoys a stable political environment, effective rule of law, and relatively low levels of corruption.
 Fitch indicated that Malta's credit rating could be upgraded if the government manages to achieve sustained fiscal consolidation, leading to a downward trend in debt. Conversely, the country risks a rating downgrade if government debt continues to rise, economic growth slows or regulatory and taxation changes make Malta less appealing to foreign investors, the agency said.

 The results of the Gozo Business Sentiment Survey noted that business activity on the sister island is expected to be “less optimistic” in the coming six months, while most businesses anticipated stable conditions.
 Half of the respondents (50 percent) expect their business environment to remain unchanged in the next six months, while 30 percent of businesses expect a downturn in their business environment. 
 The construction sector stands out from all the other sectors- with 40 percent of businesses predicting a decline in activity.
 
 “This indicated a more moderate growth in the construction sector compared to that observed in recent years,” the report noted, highlighting how the figures align with the Gozo Regional Development Strategy’s vision to shift focus away from construction. 
 On the other hand, 20 percent of businesses foresee a performance improvement, with more than 30 percent of businesses in the arts, recreational and entertainment sectors anticipating better conditions. 
 The survey, published on Friday, was conducted by the Gozitan Regional Development Authority and the Gozitan Chamber of Commerce. The survey was conducted in September 2024, with the findings compared to those published in June 2024. 
 According to the survey, while issues related to a shortage of suitable employees and rising cost pressures remain the top concerns, their significance has ""declined"".
 Data shows that the shortage of employees continues to be the leading challenge for businesses in Gozo, yet notes a drop in the concern. 
 In September 2023, over 50 percent of Gozitan businesses said the main concern for their business was the lack of suitable employees. 
  A year later, over 40 percent of businesses now believe the shortage of employees is their top concern. 
 Another top concern for businesses is cost pressures. 
 Last year, cost pressure was the leading challenge for Gozitan businesses- with over 60 percent reporting it as their top concern.
  Concerns about cost pressures gradually eased, with the issue reported as 22 percentage points lower in September 2024 when compared to a year prior.
 Sales slowdown also remains a concern, cited by 24 percent of businesses, a rise of eight percentage points from March 2024.
 ""It’s worth noting that seasonal factors likely contribute to heightened concerns about sales in the September period, particularly for certain industries,"" the survey noted.
 ""In addition to these primary concerns, around 30 percent of businesses highlighted other challenges, including issues related to logistics and infrastructure.""
 Regarding prices, most businesses reported that they do not anticipate a change in the prices of the products and services they offer over the next six months, with 60 percent of businesses expecting their output prices to remain stable.

Maltese start-up develops foam tech they say could prove revolutionary,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/maltese-startup-develops-foam-tech-say-prove-revolutionary.1096939,24-08-2024,"007623.png,007624.png","Keith Azzopardi and his team at Smart Materials Limited believe they have developed a revolutionary polyurethane foam that could be used in multiple industries.
 Founded in 2020, the Maltese start-up has developed the game-changing material, which behaves differently from any other foam currently on the market.
 “When you stretch typical foam, it expands, and when you press it, it contracts,” Azzopardi, CEO and co-founder, explained. “Our foam, however, gets harder when compressed.”
 According to him, since the 1980s, big brand names and manufacturing companies across different industries have tried and failed to develop such type of foam on a scale viable for the market.
  A study by Sheffield Hallam University on auxetic foams, which exhibit similar properties, highlighted the challenge: “Auxetic foams could be a potential alternative to conventional foam… However, most of the potential applications are limited by the substantial lack of scale-up manufacturing methodologies to produce large auxetic foam samples.”
 What sets Smart Materials Limited apart is their innovative approach to developing the foam.
 “Others have produced foams with similar properties but we altered the production process. This allows our foam to be far more customisable, achieving properties that others couldn’t,” Azzopardi noted.
 The potential applications for this foam are vast, spanning industries from automotive to footwear and even aerospace. However, the company has chosen to focus initially on revolutionising mattresses.
 “We want to start with mattresses but, eventually, aim to transform the footwear and automotive industries as well,” Azzopardi said.
 Traditional mattresses require multiple layers of foam to provide comfort and support, which results in higher material usage, increased production complexity and more storage space.
 Smart Materials Limited’s foam, needing only a single layer, addresses these issues.
 “Our foam is more adaptable to different body types and uses fewer materials, giving us a competitive edge in the market,” Azzopardi explained.
  Sustainability is another major advantage of their product. According to the European Bedding Industry Association, up to 30 million mattresses reach the end of their life cycle each year. With fewer layers and materials, Smart Materials Limited’s foam is easier to recycle, making it a more sustainable option.
 Azzopardi’s interest in unconventional materials dates back to his PhD in metamaterials – the study of materials not found in nature – under the supervision of Ruben Gatt, an expert in the field. It was during this time that he first experimented with foam.
 “We knew it had potential but we initially walked away from it because we didn’t know how to handle it,” he admitted.
 Today, Smart Materials Limited is ready to bring this innovation to the market. Azzopardi revealed that several major brands in the foaming and chemical industries have already expressed interest in their product. The company is now exploring opportunities to sell the foam’s recipe and customisation techniques.
 Azzopardi envisions Malta as a technology hub, driven by innovations like theirs.
 “I’ll be satisfied when everyone is sleeping on our foam, running in shoes with our foam and travelling in cars equipped with our foam – whether they realise it or not,” he said.

 The Hili subsidiary has been gradually acquiring a major stake in the Sliema-based retail venture over the past years and now holds just over 49.68% of the issued share capital of Tigné Mall.
 It is now out to buy the rest of the company’s shares, which are listed on the Malta Stock Exchange.
 Marsamxett Properties said the board of directors of Tigné Mall was officially informed of its intention on Tuesday.
 Details of the offer, including the buying price and terms and conditions, will be announced over the coming days with the publication of the Offer Document.
 Tigne Mall p.l.c. shares closed trading at 95c on Tuesday.
 The company’s second-biggest shareholder is Mapfre MSV Life p.l.c., which as of April 2023 held a 35.46% stake in the company. Malta’s two largest retail banks, HSBC and Bank of Valletta, also held significant stakes as of October 2023 at 12.81% and 16.7% respectively.
 If Marsamxett Properties succeeds in acquiring 90% of the company, it will then be eligible to squeeze out remaining shareholders and assume sole ownership of The Point. 
 Tigné Mall in the first half of 2023 announced a pre-tax profit of €2.4 million. 
 It said at the time that its occupancy rate was very high, indicating a strong demand for premium retail space.  
 Tigne Mall p.l.c. was set up in 2013 after MIDI plc, which designed and built The Point shopping mall, sold its entire shareholding in the venture. Those shares were purchased by a combination of the previously mentioned institutional investors as well as members of the public. 
 The company's deed over land in Tigne expires in 2099.  
 Malta-based Hili Ventures is a diversified group active in food service, retail, real estate, hospitality, shipping, oil and gas, engineering, and technology. Through its various subsidiaries, the group owns a vast portfolio of commercial real estate assets across Europe, including shopping centres, health care facilities and office buildings.

 GDP calculates the value of goods and services produced by Malta’s economy, effectively measuring how well a country's economy is performing.
 The data shows that GDP grew by 4.6% during the first quarter of this year, now standing at €4.9 billion in nominal terms, or roughly €8,800 for each person in Malta.
 While this is 8.4% (or some €380 million) higher than at the same point last year, it represents a slight dip from the previous two quarters, when it had hit the €5 billion mark.
 
 The data indicates that Malta’s economic growth is largely driven by its services industry, with financial services, real estate and professional or scientific services all recording strong growth rates over the previous year.
 Likewise, exports of goods and services remain a driving force of Malta’s economy, although their contribution to Malta’s economic growth has dipped compared to previous quarters.
 The data suggests that Malta’s GDP growth remains higher than any other EU country.
 EU data published earlier this month shows that GDP across both the EU and the Eurozone had grown marginally by 0.4% in the first quarter of 2024, compared to the first three months of 2023.
 Prime Minister Robert Abela was quick to point this out, posting on X that Malta’s economy had grown at twelve times the rate of that across the rest of the European bloc.
  A longer-term view of the data shows that Malta’s economy recovered strongly in the aftermath of the pandemic, rebounding sharply in the spring of 2021 before gradually stabilising as the months went by, often registering gradual growth from one quarter to the next.
 Central Bank estimates suggest that Malta's GDP is expected to moderate over the longer term, dipping slightly to 3.3% by 2026.

  The NSO said the food index rose largely due to higher prices of milk. The second and third largest contributions were measured in the Restaurants and hotels Index (+0.70 percentage points) and the Miscellaneous goods and services Index (+0.31 percentage points), mainly on account of higher prices of restaurant services and articles for personal hygiene, respectively.

Moody's sees light and shadows in review of Malta's economy,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/moody-sees-light-shadows-review-malta-economy.1093008,25-05-2024,007610.png,"Moody’s believes Malta’s trend of strong economic growth, coupled with a strong domestic funding base and “moderate” debt burden are fuelling a reasonably diversified economy with a “sound” institutional framework.
 However, it believes the country faces challenges in closing its fiscal deficit and in controlling corruption and upholding the rule of law.
 The credit rating agency provided its assessment of Malta’s economy as part of a periodic review of the country’s A2 rating with a stable outlook.
 The analysis was carried out on May 16 and published on Friday. Unlike a credit rating opinion, in which analysts assign a credit rating, reviews are intended to provide an overview of a country's economic performance. 
 Moody's last issued a credit opinion of Malta in November 2023, when it affirmed the country's A2 rating with a stable outlook. 
 In its periodic review, it said it expects Malta's GDP to grow by 4.5% this year and 3.7% in 2025, with “solid” tourism activity and domestic demand supported by real wage growth. The deficit will drop to 4.5% (from 4.9%) this year and 4% the next, it predicts, while the debt-to-GDP ratio will rise to 53.9% (from 50.4%).
 While the country has high per-capita income levels and a relatively diversified economy, its small size poses a challenge in terms of institutional capacity and controlling corruption, money laundering and rule of law breaches, the agency said, adding that the government “has embarked on a process to tackle these issues.”
 The country’s “moderate” debt burden and strong debt affordability metrics are at risk due to high deficits and the gradual impact of higher interest rates, it predicted. These will “more than offset the favourable effect of the country's strong nominal growth.”
 “While the country faces institutional challenges, Moody's expects Malta to continue to engage with the financial community to ensure a more effective enforcement of the regulatory framework, which should support the island's financial competitiveness in a sustainable fashion,” analysts said.
 Prime Minister Robert Abela said the assessment was “another vote of confidence”.
 “They praise our moderate debt burden, sound institutional framework, and the country’s strong trend growth, well above the Euro area’s average,” he said on X, formerly Twitter.
 Moody’s analysts said Malta could see its rating upgraded if it managed to slash the deficit at a faster rate than expected, or if introduced further reforms to bring national institutions closer to those of A1 rated countries.
 The country’s rating could be downgraded if Malta’s debt was to significantly increase, economic growth were to slow or institutional failings when it comes to combating money laundering were to emerge, the agency said.

HSBC’s potential exit from Malta: the inside story,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/hsbc-potential-exit-malta-inside-story.1098110,15-09-2024,"007680.png,007681.png,007682.png","HSBC’s global shareholders and APS Bank were in potential takeover talks as early as January 2023, but negotiations came to an abrupt halt that July when APS stepped back from the deal, according to sources.
 While the deal was off the table for seven months, the international banking giant is believed to have shopped around for an international buyer to take over its Malta operations but failed to secure a name.
 The bombshell news of the potential deal between HSBC and APS, first revealed on Wednesday, has raised questions in Malta’s financial world, with some experts telling Times of Malta they find it difficult how this deal would overcome the regulatory hurdles it is likely to face.
 HSBC’s decision to leave Malta is believed to be driven by its global push to focus on corporate banking in Asia, at the cost of cutting down on retail banking within Europe.
 Sources say that the pause in negotiations left both HSBC and APS free to sound out other options, with HSBC believed to be eager to find a buyer that would allow it to pack its bags and leave Malta.
 There was no further contact between HSBC and APS for some seven months, with the deal believed to be off the table, until talks tentatively resumed in late February 2024.
 Talks intensified in recent months, with both parties now agreeing on a number of key elements of the deal, including the price, the possibility of HSBC retaining a small share in the new bank and to offer assistance with the transition, according to sources.
 But the government is believed to be unsure of the deal with APS, with finance minister Clyde Caruana, especially, insisting on HSBC finding an international buyer to take over its Malta operations.
 One financial expert likened the deal to “a small fish trying to swallow a shark”, saying that the suggestion that APS can muster the capital needed to go through with the acquisition is “hard to believe at face value”.
 A glance at the two banks’ financial declarations reveals that, in many respects, HSBC Malta is twice the size of APS. HSBC holds twice as many deposits, has roughly double the equity and reports almost twice as many funds in its balance sheet.
 The only area where the two report similar figures is in their loan portfolio, with some analysts believing that HSBC has been deliberately cutting down on its loans in order to facilitate a quicker exit from Malta when the time was ripe.
 One analyst suggested that HSBC could look to make the deal more realistic by shifting some of its assets to its other international partners, but admits that even this seems “far-fetched”.
 Stockbrocker Paul Bonello agrees: “This isn’t just the small fish eating the big fish, it’s more than that. The difference in size between the two is just too big”.
 But, inside sources say APS is unlikely to have entered into negotiations without guarantees that it can finance the deal. The bank is believed to have combed through the deal’s financial workings with the help of several top local and international financial advisers.
  Experts agree that APS is unlikely to have been HSBC’s first port of call when putting the bank up for sale, with the bank likely to have first searched for international buyers.
 “HSBC must have been trying to shop around internationally for ages,” Bonello says, arguing that the bank’s eventual departure from Malta had been an open secret for some time.
 Whether the bank was ever likely to succeed in finding a foreign buyer is another matter entirely. Experts who spoke to Times of Malta all agreed that the country is hardly an irresistible proposition to major international banks.
 “Don’t think that major banks are lining up to invest in Malta,” one analyst said.
 “Malta is a tiny market and the administrative costs to meet regulatory demands are high. Combine that with the reputational damage Malta has suffered over the years and you can see why big banks wouldn’t bother with Malta”.
 One observer said Malta’s greylisting would have had a major impact on its reputation, meaning that big, reputable banks would prefer to steer away.
 Malta is made even less attractive by what one analyst described as “ridiculous” one-size-fits-all European Central Bank regulations, which state that the ECB must oversee the operation of the largest three banks in each EU country.
 In practice, this means that several larger banks across Europe are free of the level of scrutiny, and related administrative costs, that Malta’s top three banks face, despite
 Maltese banks being a fraction of their size.
 “With Malta’s relatively small profit margins, investing in Malta only to have to go through that hassle is simply not worth the trouble.”
 Opinions over whether Malta should be fishing for an international player to take HSBC’s place are split.
 The Nationalist Party has already staked its flag, with shadow finance minister Graham Bencini telling Times of Malta that, if HSBC does leave, the government should try to attract another major international bank of the same stature to take its place.
 Analysts are less categorical.
 Some, such as Bonello, say that the loss of a top-tier banking presence could spell bad news.
 “HSBC leaving will make it more difficult to attract serious investment – not gaming or crypto. Malta’s foreign direct investment will suffer and we’ll struggle to diversify our industries,” he said.
 But, Bonello admits, Malta’s track record at attracting foreign banks has often resulted in unmitigated disaster, with the likes of Satabank, Nemea Bank and Pilatus Bank all leaving calamity in their wake.
 Other experts echo Bonello’s fears, warning that HSBC’s departure would essentially “unplug Malta from the international network”.
 Some others are less convinced, saying that similar arguments were bandied about when HSBC was being introduced to Malta in the first place.
 “HSBC came with the promise of connecting Malta to the international grid but, when push came to shove, such as when Malta was struggling to find correspondent banks, they barely raised a finger to help.”
 Ultimately what really matters, some argue, is that HSBC’s place is taken by a reputable bank, “and there is no denying that APS is a good bank”.
 What’s more, they say, recent history suggests that HSBC’s departures from several countries around the world proved to be smoothest when a local bank stepped in to take its place.
 In Greece, for instance, HSBC’s operations were taken over by Pancreta Bank, a bank even smaller than APS, while the bank’s departure from Canada saw the Royal Bank of Canada’s  taking over.
 By contrast, when HSBC quit French retail banking, it did so by selling its assets there to a group controlled by a US private equity firm, Cerberus.
  Even if HSBC and APS can agree on a deal, it will be sectoral regulators that determine whether or not it goes ahead, experts say.
 Since the deal involves systemically important banks (meaning banks large enough that their collapse could wreak havoc on a country’s economy), the deal would need to be approved by the ECB, not just the Malta Financial Services Authority, the local regulator.
 This means that the ECB could well veto an eventual deal, if it believes it to be unrealistic or harmful.
 Bonello believes that this is likely to be the case, for several reasons.
 For a start, he says, the ECB will be worried about what this would mean for competition across the banking sector, with the deal “likely to raise anti-trust issues”.
 Even more problematic, he believes, would be the concerns over APS’ ability to finance the deal in the first place.
 Reports of the deal saw the share prices of both banks sharply shift, with HSBC’s shares  plunging 18% while those of APS surged by almost 12% on the same day, raising questions over why trading for shares of both banks was not temporarily suspended.
 A spokesperson for the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA) declined to comment on the matter, simply telling Times of Malta that while discussions with licence holders are “confidential”, the authority “remains vigilant in overseeing any developments within the industry and will take appropriate measures when and if necessary, in line with its obligations at law”.
 Meanwhile, the Malta Union of Bank Employees (MUBE) told Times of Malta that it is “concerned” over what a potential deal could mean for employees at both banks, particularly those currently holding similar roles in each respective bank, with reports of the deal leaving many employees “in limbo”.
 A spokesperson for the union said that MUBE had written to APS Bank “seeking clarification and/or confirmation to media reports”.

Italian firm selected for interconnector's onshore cabling with €34m offer,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/italian-firm-selt-interconnector-onshore-cabling-34m-offer.1098721,28-09-2024,007706.png,"A Sardinia-based company is poised to be awarded a €34 million deal to manufacture and install onshore cables for a second interconnector that is to be built.
 SELT Spa has been recommended by Interconnect Malta as the preferred bidder for the deal. Given that a 10-day appeal window has now expired, the company is virtually assured of the deal.
 SELT’s offer of €34.2 million was the cheapest of five received for the contract, beating a €41m bid by Hengtong Optic-Electric Co. Ltd., €44m offer by Prysmian Cavi e Sistemi Italia SRL, €59m offer by   KonČar-Ket Ltd and €64m bid by the only local firm in the running, Bonnici Bros Ltd.
 Founded in 2000, SELT describes itself as “an important energy transmission and distribution system operator in Italy” that has implemented projects across the Mediterranean and northern Europe.
 Its Malta contract will require it to supply and install 21km of high-voltage cable in Sicily, running from the offshore cable landing point in Marina di Ragusa to the 220kV substation in Ragusa, as well as 1.8km of cable in Malta between the cable’s landing site at l-Għallis and the Magħtab terminal.
 The tender recommendation decision was communicated on Saturday by Interconnect Malta, the state agency set up to manage energy-related infrastructural projects.
 The contract is the second of four key tenders related to the interconnector project to be awarded.
 The largest of the four, a €185 million deal to supply and install the undersea cable that will link Malta and Sicily, is still accepting offers until the end of October. Another open tender, valued at €12 million, is for the supply and installation of 220kV switchgear, control panels, and fire suppression systems.
 Malta already has an operational interconnector linking its energy network to the European grid, but wants to add a second cable to boost its ability to source cheaper electricity and provide a fallback should the original cable be damaged.
 The project is estimated to cost around €300 million in total, with just over half of that amount, €165 million, supplied through the EU’s European Regional Development Funding programme.  
 Energy Minister Miriam Dalli said the second interconnector project, dubbed IC2, “will provide the capacity needed to integrate more renewable energy, reduce our reliance on traditional sources, and pave the way for future offshore wind and battery storage projects."" 
 Interconnect Malta CEO Ismail D’Amato said the tender award decision was an important milestone.
 “While the complexities and costs involved are considerable, this milestone reflects ICM’s commitment to delivering one of the most critical infrastructure projects in Malta today. We remain focused on ensuring that every step taken is in the best interest of Malta’s future energy needs,” D’Amato said.

Should I insist on a prenuptial agreement because of my fiancé's debt?,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/should-i-insist-prenuptial-agreement-fiance-debt.1097455,31-08-2024,007877.png,"Welcome to The Money Coach, a Times of Malta column where readers can ask questions about life's money issues. Send your questions about personal finances, inheritance, gifting or other personal finance topics to moneycoach@timesofmalta.com. 
 I am a 29-year-old architect and have been in a relationship with my soon-to-be husband for the past three years. I’m a regular reader of your column, and I tend to agree with most of your advice on how couples should discuss and manage their finances.
 That said, I now find myself needing your advice.
 I’ve always been careful to save and spend less than I earn, and this has This has allowed me to build a solid financial base over the past few years.
 Unfortunately, the same can’t be said about my fiancé. He has accumulated a significant amount of debt, primarily from a car loan and several “buy now, pay later” purchases he made over the years.
 My concern is that by marrying him, I might unintentionally put my financial health at risk. Because of this, I’ve been thinking about suggesting the idea of us signing a prenuptial agreement to protect myself.
 I don’t feel very comfortable about it, but it seems like a practical solution that could work for both of us.
 How do you think I should approach this? I have no one to turn to or compare my situation with, as very few couples I know have made such an agreement. I also have no idea how my fiancé would react to it.
 Best regards,
 Worried Bride-to-Be
 Debt can often feel like an unwelcome third party in any relationship.
 As someone who is also a saver and a planner, I understand where you’re coming from. It’s completely natural to want to protect the financial stability you’ve worked so hard to build.
 A prenuptial agreement might seem like a practical solution. That said, it’s important to approach this conversation with care.
 Personally, I believe that the relationship should come first, before finances. But if you’re truly set on this path, there are a few questions you need to consider:
 If you’ve already talked about these issues and reached an agreement, then I don’t think a prenup is necessary. However, if these matters are still unclear, or if you want to be absolutely certain that what you’ve discussed will happen, then it may be time to bring up the prenup.
 If your relationship is strong, a conversation about money should follow naturally. Nevertheless, I have rarely met a couple who didn’t grimace at the idea of a prenup, at least here in Malta.
 Usually such agreements are regarded as an agreement between 2 persons who have considerable assets, or at least one of the parties has significantly more assets than the other.
 In your case, from what you told me, there doesn’t seem to be a big difference in assets, even though he has ‘significant’ debts.
 That is why that before starting a conversation on a prenup, reassure your partner that your primary goal is to build your marriage on a solid foundation with clear expectations. Let him know that you’re not looking to create any division, but rather to ensure that you both have a shared understanding of your financial future.
 The most important aspect here is trust. Remember a prenuptial agreement doesn’t have to imply a lack of trust. Instead, you can explain that it’s a way to ensure that money never becomes a source of conflict between you. It’s about protecting the love and respect you have for each other.
 With the right approach and understanding, there shouldn’t be any issues. Yet, if problems do arise, then now is the best time to tackle them, which is much better than if they had arisen whilst you’re married.
 If, after discussing it, you both agree that a prenup is the right choice, it’s essential to consult a qualified legal advisor. This will ensure that the agreement is fair and reflects both of your interests.
 I’m a big believer that strong relationships trump over anything, and I am positive yours will as well.

Total tax revenue up by €436.3 million in 2023,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/total-tax-revenue-4363-million-2023.1100343,31-10-2024,007906.png,"Total tax revenue in 2023 went up by €436.3 million over the previous year and stood at €5,595.4 million, according to data by the National Statistics Office.
 This figure represents 85.3 per cent of the total general government revenue collected in 2023.
 Direct taxes amounted to €2,548.9 million, making up 45.6 per cent of the overall tax revenue. This marked an increase of €194.5 million compared to 2022.
 The primary component within this category remains the Personal Income Tax, which rose by €138.2 million, while Corporate Income Tax, increased by €41.3 million over the previous year, the NSO noted in its release.
 Indirect taxes also showed notable changes, amounting to €1,978.3 million - an increase of €164.3 million when compared to 2022.
 This is equivalent to 35.4 per cent of the total tax revenue.
 Within this category, Value Added Tax stood at €1,268.8 million, marking an increase of €79.3 million when compared to 2022.
 Moreover, taxes on products totalled €566.4 million, reflecting an increase of €52.8 million over the previous year. This increase can be attributable to higher tax revenue generated from duty on documents, and the tax registration on motor vehicles, which was partially offset by a decrease in gaming taxes and the excise tax levied on cement.
 Other taxes on production added up to €114.2 million, registering an increase of €30.7 million over the preceding year.
 Social contributions paid by employees, employers, as well as self- and non-employed persons accounted for 19.1 per cent of the total tax revenue in 2023, totalling €1,068.2 million.
 This reflects an increase of €77.6 million when compared to the preceding year.
 The tax burden for Malta in 2023 stood at 27.1 per cent of Gross Domestic Product - a decrease of 1.2 percentage points when compared to the total tax burden of 28.3 per cent recorded in 2022.
 The overall tax burden represents the total amount of taxes and social contributions, expressed as a percentage of GDP.
 The data shows an average tax burden of approximately 30.4 per cent for the period between 1995 and 2023.
 This implies a relatively consistent tax environment during these years.
 By the end of last year, direct taxes (which also include capital taxes) constituted 12.3 per cent of GDP, compared to the share of indirect taxes which was at 9.6 per cent.
 Meanwhile, the share of social contributions was at 5.2 per cent of GDP, reflecting a decrease of 0.3 percentage points compared to 2022.

[WATCH] ‘Time Up’: Chamber urges government to transform current economic model ahead of Budget 2025,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/national/130902/time_up_chamber_urges_government_to_transform_current_economic_model_ahead_of_budget_2025,26-08-2024,000011.png,"The Malta Chamber of Commerce has issued an urgent warning to policy makers through their 2025 pre-budget document, making it clear that Malta is in dire need of immediate action to address a wide range of long-standing issues.
 As the Chamber launched its pre-budget document named “Time Up”, it reminded those present that it had been speaking about a number of concerts over the past years, as it argued that much more needs to be done to ensure sustainable economic progress.
 Addressing the media, Chamber president Chris Vassallo Cesareo noted that the business lobby’s previous pre-budget document had already made it clear that fiscal planning was needed to establish a new direction for the country.
 Vassallo Cesareo noted that while government has maintained the narrative that each budget will introduce no new tax, the time has come to address long-standing issues that are now dragging the country to a halt.
 “Even if they are unpopular, the right decisions must be made as soon as possible to address pressing issues,” he stressed.
 Meanwhile, Chamber CEO, Marthese Portelli explained that the sense of urgency present in the pre-budget document comes from the abysmal implementation rate of the Chamber’s previous documents. 
 During the press conference, Portelli explained the business lobby’s document, as she went through the 12 priority areas highlighted in their proposals. These areas are: 
 The Chamber stated that it consistently presented various documents and proposals to policymakers, stressing the importance of achieving political consensus on an economic strategy that prioritises value-added activities, enhanced productivity, quality, and compliance.
 “Occasional improvements have been registered. However, there is still a lot that needs to be done.”
 Among the Chamber's proposals aimed at boosting Malta's competitiveness, the lobby called for the establishment of connections to major Mediterranean ports. Here, Portelli also called on authorities to refrain from penalising legitimate businesses while clamping down on operators who evade or circumvent their obligations.
 The Chamber CEO made it clear that one of the most prominent issues raised by the business lobby year after year is the fragmentation within government departments, agencies and authorities. Emphasis was made on introducing 'Ease of doing business measures', with a focus on digitalisation.
 Another issue that was raised with regards to fiscal discipline was the ""sometimes unfair"" competition between the public and private sector, as well as the headache incurred by the private sector at the hands of the public sector's half-day schedules.
 During her speech, Portelli once again reiterated the Chamber's calls to reduce energy subsidies. She stressed that the current energy subsidies are not sustainable, urging government to re-think the subsidies so that they benefit individuals and companies who consume less, and invest in renewables.
 On traffic congestion, Portelli highlighted a number of carrot-and-stick initiatives that would dissuade individuals from making use of their private vehicles, and push them to use mass transportation methods. The initiatives include paid parking in certain spaces, as well as the introduction of an e-mobility wallet with government allocating an annual amount to every e-wallet to be used for various environmentally sustainable or shared transportation options.
 Addressing tourism, the Chamber CEO once again proposed a moratorium on applications for new tourism accomodation to prevent oversupply. The Chamber's pre-budget document also urged a ""clear plan for tables and chairs which prevents kneejerk reactions and does not allow room for interpretation, basing it on clear criteria which depends on location, kitchen size and indoor seating amongst other criteria, while ensuring unobstructed passage to passersby and disabled persons.""

Malta set new record for foreign worker permits in 2023,theshiftnews,https://theshiftnews.com/2024/09/16/malta-set-new-record-for-foreign-worker-permits-in-2023/,16-09-2024,"000048.png,000049.png,000050.png","Last year, Malta exceeded its record, set just a year earlier (2022), regarding the number of resident permits it issued to non-EU citizens, better known as third-country nationals (TCNs).
 According to new figures published by Eurostat, Malta issued 41,927 new resident permits to TCNs in 2023, an increase of more than 4,000 over the previous year, which was already an all-time high.
 The new figures show that compared to the rest of the EU, Malta issued more than ten times the average number of permits, reaching a record 76 new permits per 1,000 in terms of population.
 The second highest issuer of first-time resident permits in the EU was neighbouring Cyprus, although at a much lower rate of 37 permits per 1,000.
 The latest figures show that the overwhelming majority of first-time resident permits issued by Identity Malta were for employment reasons, resulting in a further 28,000 foreign workers.
 Most new workers were Indians, with an additional 11,000 in 2023, followed by Nepalese (6,515) and Colombians (3,648).
 In 2023, Malta’s foreign population reached 158,368, an increase of 15.3% over the previous year. Malta’s native population only grew by 0.1% during the same period.
 By the end of 2023, Malta’s population reached 563,443, excluding the tens of thousands working irregularly on the island without permits.
 This means that since Labour was returned to power, Malta’s population grew by almost 150,000.
 The latest figures confirm Malta’s growing dependency on foreign workers, mostly paid very low wages, keeping the average Maltese salary low.
 While many, including the Opposition and constituted bodies, have been calling for a revision of Malta’s economic model based on numbers and  cheap labour, the government, led by Robert Abela, has promised to restrict TCNs, targeting those in the transport and food delivery services.
 The prime minister’s promise to appease disgruntlement on the impact of such a rapid increase in population on traffic, infrastructure, waste and wages, among other issues, has not translated into action.
 Identity Malta has been churning out more permits, reaching a record average of 115 permits a day.

Parliament votes to amend GWU headquarters lease agreement as Opposition votes against,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/national/132808/parliament_votes_to_amend_gwu_headquarters_lease_agreement_as_opposition_votes_against,16-12-2024,000057.png,"Parliament has approved a resolution that amends the lease agreement for the headquarters of the General Workers’ Union in Valletta.

 With 41 votes in favour and 33 against, the resolution lifts a restriction that prevented the union from subletting parts of the Workers Memorial Building to commercial entities that do not belong to it.

                     The Opposition stuck to its guns and voted against the resolution despite the union appealing for a different outcome earlier in the day.

 The resolution was presented by Lands Minister Stefan Zrinzo Azzopardi after the Court ruled earlier this year that the GWU breached the conditions of its government lease agreement when it sublet parts of its premises to commercial entities. The Court ordered the two commercial entities – Arms Ltd and Sciacca Grill – to stop operations but it also ruled against the union’s eviction from the building.

 The court case had been instituted by the Nationalist Party, then led by Simon Busuttil, in 2017 after the National Audit Office flagged the contractual breaches.

 The building had been leased to the union in 1957 to be used as its headquarters and for its printing press. However, in 1997, the agreement had been amended to allow the union to sublet parts of the building to entities in which it held at least a 51% stake.

 The resolution lifts the shareholding restriction thus allowing the GWU to sublet parts of the premises to commercial entities. As compensation for the removal of the restriction and to make up for penalties incurred over the years the contract was breached, the union will be paying almost €2 million.

 The Opposition had voted against the resolution at committee stage to remain consistent with its past position. It maintained that stand when the vote was taken in plenary on Monday.

Zammit Lewis is Malta’s choice for European judge,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/national/131249/zammit_lewis_is_maltas_choice_for_european_judge,17-09-2024,000074.png,"Edward Zammit Lewis is Malta’s nominee for European judge and will appear in front of a judicial advisory panel in Luxembourg, a senior government source has confirmed.
 The Labour MP will be interviewed by the Comite 255, a seven-member panel that evaluates the suitability of candidates for judge and advocate-general of the EU courts.
 The grilling behind closed doors is expected to take place on 11 October and if the panel gives a favourable opinion, Zammit Lewis will be appointed judge on the General Court of the EU. He will be replacing Ramona Frendo, who will now serve as judge at the European Court of Justice.
 MaltaToday had revealed in June the former justice minister was government’s preferred choice despite issuing an open call for the vacancy. Applicants for the post included four other lawyers – Jacques René Zammit, David Ciliberti, Rashida Sheikh and Veronique Dalli. They were interviewed viva voce in Malta by a committee set up by the Justice Minister.
 NGO Repubblika had objected to Zammit Lewis’s nomination when the information first leaked and had also written to the Comite 255 panel with its concerns. The NGO said Zammit Lewis would tarnish the reputation of the European Court as a result of his proximity to Yorgen Fenech, the man awaiting trial for allegedly masterminding Daphne Caruana Galizia’s murder.
 Justice Minister Jonathan Attard had described the NGO’s reaction as a “thinly-veiled personal attack”.
 The Comite 255 panel is composed of seven persons chosen from among former members of the Court of Justice and the General Court of the European Union, members of national Supreme Courts and jurists of recognised competence, one of whom is proposed by the European Parliament.
 Who is Zammit Lewis?
 Zammit Lewis served as justice minister until February 2022 when parliament was dissolved. He had been instrumental in implementing several recommendations for constitutional and judicial reform made by the Venice Commission.
 However, he was omitted from Cabinet after the election held in March 2022, which returned a Labour government. He currently serves as chairperson of parliament’s Foreign and European Affairs Committee. Zammit Lewis is a lawyer by profession, having practised in the civil, commercial, administrative and constitutional fields.
 His eventual departure will require a casual election on the 8th District, although the source said Robert Abela is likely to go down the route of co-option.
 Since 2013, Zammit Lewis served as minister in various portfolios, including tourism, European affairs and equality.
 Zammit Lewis came under fire prior to 2022 after his closeness to Yorgen Fenech, the businessman accused of masterminding the Daphne Caruana Galizia murder, was exposed in a cache of leaked WhatsApp chats. The conversations had taken place before Fenech’s involvement in the murder was publicly known.
 But Zammit Lewis was also in the line of fire for disparagingly describing Labour voters as ‘Ġaħan’ in one of the WhatsApp conversations. He later apologised for the remark.
 What EU judges do
 Malta gets to nominate two judges to the EU’s General Court. The outgoing Frendo took up her post at the General Court in 2019 and was earlier this year approved by a panel of judges to serve as a judge at the ECJ, succeeding Judge Peter G. Xuereb.
 Malta’s other nominee at the General Court is Eugene Buttigieg, who was appointed judge in 2012 and whose current term ends next year.
 Judges on the General Court are appointed for a renewable term of six years.
 A judge at the European Court of Justice interprets and applies EU law to ensure its consistent implementation across member states. They handle cases involving disputes between EU institutions, member states, businesses, and individuals, and provide preliminary rulings when national courts seek clarification on EU law.
 Judges also review the legality of acts by EU institutions and can impose penalties for non-compliance, thereby playing a crucial role in maintaining the rule of law within the EU.  ",Kurt Sansone ,Business
Josianne Cutajar will not seek PL deputy leadership,newsbook,https://newsbook.com.mt/en/josianne-cutajar-will-not-seek-pl-deputy-leadership/,25-08-2024,000089.png,"Former MEP Josianne Cutajar has confirmed that she will not be seeking the post of Labour deputy leader for party affairs, a post for which only one candidate has put his name forward: MEP Alex Agius Saliba. Cutajar had publicly opposed the decision to change the party’s statute just this month to allow incumbent MPs and MEPs to contest the post, a decision which appears to have been made to facilitate Agius Saliba’s bid. Agius Saliba will have to balance the new role with his EP position, which requires him to travel regularly between Malta, Brussels and Strasbourg, though he shrugged off any concerns that his EU commitments would hinder his ability to take a leadership role in the Labour Party. She had previously confirmed that she was considering contesting, and said on Sunday that for weeks on end – including that same day – she was being approached by people urging her to seek a post in the Labour Party administration, particularly the deputy leadership. And Cutajar hinted that the decision to change the statute had a bearing on her decision not to run. “After considering the circumstances at length, as well as the decisions taken in relation to this process, I have chosen to continue my work for what I believe in in another manner,” she said. The former MEP however urged all those who would be elected to a top party post: “In this way the Labour Party will be truly victorious, in the best interests of the Maltese, Gozitans and our children,” she said. Lawyer Ishmael Psaila, who is part of the legal team of disgraced former Labour leader Joseph Muscat, said he wanted to run for the role of Labour president but ultimately changed his mind after the party leadership felt that his role as lawyer in the VGH case could hinder the party. Psaila said he was considering running for a PL executive post after being approached by several delegates and activists following the June election results. Writing on Facebook, Psaila said he had already committed to representing “months ago”, a decision “the leadership of the party felt could be obstacle to the party.” He also said that he was of the belief that the legal profession and the political role should not mix but he was only interested in the good of the party. He added that nobody is bigger than the party. Former PL MEP candidate Marija Sarah Vella Gafà also thanked those who approached her to contest the role of president of the party. In a brief statement on social media, Vella Gafà said that she will be focusing on her family and personal commitments following the electoral campaign.",John Paul Cordina,Economy

"Service enhancements at BOV, different opening hours for selected branches
 - The Malta Independent ",independent,https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2024-10-30/local-news/Service-enhancements-at-BOV-different-opening-hours-for-selected-branches-6736265327,30-10-2024,000124.png,"
                
        

         Bank of Valletta said Wednesday it has been upgrading the customer experience and the services offered throughout its branch network while piloting new services in some branches in anticipation of further enhancements expected over the next few months. Enhancements include the consolidation of branches into regions for a more tailored focus on geographic service needs, the pairing of branches into main and satellite outlets to offer specialised services, priority cash services to assist the elderly, as well as upgraded queuing systems to ensure better flow of customers within branches.  Other planned changes are being piloted and include different opening hours for selected branches during the week, based on customer preferences. These changes will be piloted from Monday 4 November from the Branches in Gżira, Ibraġ, Msida, San Ġwann, Sliema, Valletta and Gozo Area. Following an approximate six-week period, the Bank will analyse the traction of this pilot, including obtaining feedback from customers and reviewing data from transaction volumes. The enhanced service offering is planned to be offered permanently from all locations at the beginning of the coming year.
 Regional Service
 With 32 Branches across Malta and Gozo, BOV remains the most physically present Bank in the Maltese community, the bank said. To better serve customers and offer a more personalised service, branches have been divided into two categories (main and satellite) and spread across 4 regions encompassing the North, South, Central East, and Central West, with Gozo also considered as a separate region district. Main outlets will offer full banking services and will also feature longer hours on Tuesdays and Thursdays, also remaining open on Saturdays. Satellite branches will offer fewer specialised services and will be operating from Monday to Friday. A full list of branches, including opening hours, can be found at https://www.bov.com/find-us.
 Cashiering Service
 The Bank will retain Priority Cash Service for the elderly, which was introduced in June 2022. The service is part of the Bank's strategy to continue improving the customer experience in its branch network. The fast-track days are now available every Friday and Saturday from 08:15 to 09:30 from the Main Branches and every Friday during the same time from the Satellite Branches. Cashiering services will be offered from both Main and Satellite Branches and will be available daily until 11:00.
  
  
  
 Customer Feedback
  
 These enhancements have been made following feedback from customers, who prefer longer opening hours to match their lifestyle. Other changes are being made following indications that over-the-counter transactions have decreased by an average of 7,000 per month during the first eight months of 2024, compared to the previous year, equivalent to a 25.6% reduction. This is matched by a shift to digital, which registered an average increase of 130,000 monthly digital transactions from January to August compared to the same period in 2023. This important feedback is part of the Bank's ongoing efforts to match the service offered with the preferences of its customers, striking a bold balance between digital solutions and personalised one-to-one service that some Bank customers prefer.

"HSBC shares plunge 18% in a day, speculation of APS take-over ‘immature’",theshiftnews,https://theshiftnews.com/2024/09/12/hsbc-shares-plunge-18-in-a-day-speculation-of-aps-take-over-immature/,12-09-2024,000146.png,"As HSBC cryptically announced its exit from Malta, the bank’s shares dipped by 18.1% in a few hours and led to frenzied speculation on the stock exchange.
 While many in the banking sector were not surprised by the announcement, as the sixth-most powerful global bank had indicated its intention to leave, the way the announcement was made led to confusion and speculation.
 HSBC shares plunged €0.30c per share, from €1.65 to €1.35, soon after the bank’s announcement that it was “undertaking a strategic review of its indirect 70.03% shareholding in the bank”.
 In other words, HSBC had decided to sell its stake, or at least part of it, and exit the Maltese market.
 It was an open secret in the sector that the global bank had given direction from its headquarters in London to exit problematic jurisdictions, such as Malta.
 The county’s greylisting and related reputational damage continue to be compounded by new scandals involving money laundering and tax dodging.
 While HSBC’s exit announcement was already informally doing the rounds last week, banking experts still described the news as “a big blow to Malta’s economy and international reputation”.
 A veteran top banker told The Shift: “This is not to be taken lightly. HSBC is a world player, and its name and presence in Malta are crucial. Its exit is a blow to the country’s reputation and a vote of no confidence in the island. The government should be very concerned,”
 Others expressed concern over further speculation that APS – the Church’s bank was already in talks to take over HSBC.
 Experts said that if this were true, the Church’s bank would already be in irregular territory as it was obliged to inform the market through a company announcement if such discussions were ongoing.
 “
 Malta’s banking sector is already considered lacking competition, with BOV and HSBC dominating the market.
 Although growing, APS only has a market share of less than 15%, with BOV having 50% and HSBC 35% to 40%.
 Banking sources said that while a 70% shareholding of HSBC should fetch a price in the range of €450 million, APS’ value currently stands at just €200 to €250 million.
 Experts said there were other ways of acquiring the bank without buying the entire 70% stake, but they still consider speculation about APS “very immature.”
 Government sources also expressed their doubts on the APS option.
 “Malta needs more international banking presence and not a reduction of its current banking market. Competition increases with another different bank and not a reduction of players,” a senior government source said.
 The Shift is informed that HSBC has yet to conclude its sale. However, the only international player interested is a still-unnamed Middle Eastern player.
 According to EU banking regulations, the European Central Bank must approve an eventual sale of HSBC’s shares.
 Since HSBC is considered to have a dominant domestic position, the ECB will have to examine all the repercussions, including whether the buyer is fit and proper, anti-trust and competition rules, and prudential requirements, among others.
 Again, according to the experts consulted, the APS speculation doesn’t make sense, as the ECB might strike down such a deal.

"Bolt confirms surge in prices due to low supply of taxis, increased demand",maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/national/130532/bolt_confirms_surge_in_prices_due_to_low_supply_of_taxis_increased_demand,01-08-2024,000147.png,"Prices on the ride-hailing platform Bolt have surged recently due to a lower supply of cabs, which is failing to meet increasing demand levels.
 A company spokesperson told MaltaToday that an unbalance between increasing demand and a lower supply of cabs is resulting in longer waiting times and longer periods of surge prices.
  “Prices are directly influenced by the balance between supply and demand of the marketplace,” the spokesperson said. “Bolt remains firmly committed to transparency and fairness in all matters related to its operations and work policies”.
 The price fluctuations come after hundreds of non-EU nationals applying to work as taxi drivers and food couriers had their work permit applications refused.
 Prime Minister Robert Abela said this is a strategic decision that was taken by the authorities in recent weeks.
 Bolt said it has reached out to government authorities to discuss the ongoing situation and find a solution after, but pointed out that less than 5% of third-country nationals in the country are registered to operate as couriers or cab drivers in Malta through its platform.    ",Nicole Meilak ,Economy

 According to sources who spoke to The Shift on condition of anonymity, the direct order forms part of a larger contract totalling millions of euro.
 Public procurement regulations stipulate that direct order contracts larger than €10,000 require the approval of the Department of Contracts.
 It is unclear whether approval was given as Finance Minister Clyde Caruana has not responded to any questions on the matter.
 Earlier this month, The Shift revealed how Digitalis, a company specialising in online search result manipulation, was engaged through the Ministry of Finance to “rebuild” Malta’s reputation by creating a “positive narrative” for its economic sectors.
 Digitalis’ services were sought to improve the image of various government entities, including the Finance Ministry, the Malta Fiscal Advisory Council, Finance Malta, the Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit, the Malta Financial Services Authority and the Malta Gaming Authority, among others.
 The government agencies targeted for ‘reputation management’ coincide with those tarnished in Malta’s greylisting by the Financial Action Task Force between 2021 and 2022, raising questions on attempts to whitewash scandals using public funds.
 An edition of the government gazette published last week shows a direct order contract of £33,600 (circa. €40,000) awarded to Digitalis Media UK Ltd. at the beginning of November 2023.
 The direct order is entitled “International Branding Professional Services”.
 The Shift’s sources say the published direct order is a payment for negotiation meetings between the government and the firm, not the total engagement.
 It is understood the firm was engaged on a two-year contract worth millions of euro through a direct order, bypassing public procurement regulations.
 Based in London, Digitalis promotes itself as an advisory firm that “helps clients protect and advance their online interests”.
 The UK firm offers online ‘reputation and narrative management’ promising on its website “to make sure your story is being told in the way you want it to be”.
 Questions sent to Digitalis CEO David King and Minister Caruana asking about the firm’s engagement and the deliverables expected from the company remained unanswered at the time of publication.
 The Maltese government is no stranger to using public relations management firms to whitewash tarnished reputations, with the practice gaining popularity under disgraced former prime minister Joseph Muscat’s administration.

Updated: Chambers welcome EU court ruling annulling the 8-week truck return rule - The Malta Independent ,independent,https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2024-10-05/local-news/Chamber-of-Commerce-welcomes-EU-court-ruling-annulling-the-8-week-truck-return-rule-6736264655,05-10-2024,000212.png,"
                
        

         The Malta Chamber of Commerce, Enterprise, and Industry on Saturday and the Malta Chamber of SMEs welcomed the ruling by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) published yesterday, annulling the requirement for trucks to return to their operational centre every eight weeks, as stated in EU Regulation 2020/1055.  The Malta Chamber of Commerce acknowledged that the Maltese Government listened to The Malta Chamber's concerns resulting in successful efforts in presenting Malta's case before the ECJ, together with Lithuania, Bulgaria, Romania, Cyprus, Hungary, and Poland.
 ""We believe that this ruling is a wake-up call for a more informed approach in EU policymaking, one that considers the specific challenges faced by peripheral and island nations,"" the chamber said.
 The ECJ found that the EU legislators had not adequately assessed the proportionality of this measure on all member states when it was first introduced. This ECJ judgement is a decision in favour of Malta's realities as it marks a significant step forward for Malta's road transport operators.
 As declared several times by The Malta Chamber Logistics Business Section, the rule was ""implemented without proper evaluation and resulted in unnecessary emissions, logistical challenges, increase in costs and undue burdens on freight forwarding and haulage companies"".
 For the past years, island nations like Malta were disproportionately affected by the regulation as compared to mainland EU countries, placing our country and our companies at an unfair disadvantage because the now-annulled provision required trucks operating across the EU to return to their home country every eight weeks. For Malta, this meant additional, often inefficient trips involving long distances and ferry crossings. Many vehicles travelled empty, contributing to avoidable traffic congestion on European roads and increasing carbon emissions. This not only undermined environmental efforts but also imposed additional costs on peripheral islands like Malta, where transportation is already more complex due to geographic isolation.
 The Chamber of Commerce, along with European business networks, has repeatedly argued that this requirement conflicted with the European Green Deal's goals of emission reduction and operational efficiency.
 The chamber said it viewed this ECJ decision as a call for a more detailed approach in EU policies, addressing challenges unique to peripheral and island nations. In light of this ruling, The Malta Chamber renews its call for the upcoming European Commission to introduce a ""Territorial Proofing"" or ""Insularity Test"" as part of its Competitiveness Check in the impact assessment process. This test would ensure that EU regulations do not disproportionately affect Member States with unique geographical conditions, such as islands states and peripheral regions. The Malta Chamber stresses that significant legislative changes should undergo thorough impact assessments during the EU decision-making process to prevent unintended consequences, such as those caused by the eight-week vehicle return rule.
 Articles 174 and 175 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union state that the Union should aim to reduce regional disparities, particularly for islands and mountain areas. The Malta Chamber urges the EU to stay true to these commitments by adopting measures that consider the specific needs of these regions within its legislative process, from inception.
 This decision also bolsters Malta's capability to contest similar policies in other areas, including air and maritime transport. Alongside other industry stakeholders, The Malta Chamber has expressed concerns regarding the EU's Emissions Trading System (ETS) for maritime transport, which redirects transhipments to non-EU ports in North Africa. This mirrors the objections submitted in respect of EU air transport regulations that impose an excessive and unjust burden on peripheral island states like Malta.
 Finally, the chamber called for enhanced meaningful dialogue and collaboration within the MCESD to ensure that upcoming EU legislation promotes fairness, sustainability, and operational efficiency for all EU Member States, without discrimination based on geographic location.
 The Malta Chamber of SMEs also welcomed the development, calling for more vigilance to foresee future threats that may negatively impact local Businesses The Malta Chamber of SMEs welcomes the recent EU court ruling. This significant victory ensures that the local transport and logistics sector will not be burdened by disproportionately restrictive rules that fail to take into account the unique challenges Malta faces as a small island nation.
 The court’s decision reaffirms the importance of fair and balanced EU legislation that considers the realities of all member states, particularly those with specific needs for countries like Malta. The SME Chamber acknowledges the work and effort put in Maltese representatives to defend Malta’s interests in this case.
 Moving forward this case in particular underscores the need for continued vigilance in monitoring EU legislative proposals that may adversely affect Maltese businesses, it said.
 The Malta Chamber of SMEs urges national representatives and stakeholders to remain proactive in identifying and flagging potential threats at the earliest stages of the legislative process.

"Property prices in Malta continue to surge, reaching new heights in 2024",newsbook,https://newsbook.com.mt/en/property-prices-in-malta-continue-to-surge-reaching-new-heights-in-2024/,03-10-2024,000254.png,"The latest figures from Malta’s Residential Property Price Index (RPPI) reveal a persistent upward trend in the country’s real estate market, with prices hitting record levels in the second quarter of 2024. According to data released by the National Statistics Office, the aggregate RPPI, which includes both apartments and maisonettes, stood at 161.34 in Q2 2024, marking a significant 6.8% increase compared to the same period last year. This continues the strong growth observed in recent years, with the index having risen from 115.36 in Q2 2018 to its current level. Apartments continue to lead the market, with prices increasing by 6.9% year-on-year to reach an index value of 162.93. Maisonettes also saw substantial growth, with prices rising by 6.6% to 155.83 on the index. The overall RPPI, which includes houses in addition to apartments and maisonettes, showed an even more pronounced increase of 7.0% compared to Q2 2023, reaching 162.84. This surge reflects a broader trend of rising property prices across Malta, with the housing market demonstrating remarkable resilience in the face of various economic challenges. A recent Eurobarometer survey underscores the severity of the situation, revealing that Malta has experienced a 4.6% annual increase in property prices, coupled with a staggering 17.5% rise in rental costs. Over the past 15 years, property prices have escalated by 62.6%, while rental costs surged by 56%, exacerbating the affordability crisis for both locals and foreign residents. Another study published by KPMG earlier this year shows that the median price of an apartment was just over €142,000 in 2013 but now stands at €280,000 as of this year. This means that the price of a finished apartment has doubled in the space of ten years, but wages have not increased at the same rate. The long-term trend in housing affordability paints a concerning picture. A study published by the Housing Authority indicates that the early 2000s were the most affordable years for purchasing property in Malta. The Housing Affordability Index (HAI), which measures the ratio of income to mortgage costs, averaged around 109 between 2000 and 2003. During this period, the price of a finished two-bedroom apartment was just four times the annual income of a typical couple. However, from 2004 onwards, the situation deteriorated rapidly. By 2018, the HAI for single buyers had fallen below 100, signifying that housing costs had surpassed income levels for many individuals. Property prices for couples also rose from 3.7 times their income to 5.7 times, further limiting accessibility. Regional disparities in affordability have become increasingly pronounced. The HAI in popular areas such as Sliema, St Julian’s, and Valletta stands at a mere 62.3, making these locations particularly challenging for new buyers. In contrast, Gozo remains one of the most affordable regions, with an HAI of 152. Despite mortgage interest rates in Malta dropping from 6.5% in 2000 to 2.8% in 2022, the rapid rise in property prices has nullified any potential benefits from lower borrowing costs. Government schemes to assist homebuyers with down payments have provided some relief, but have not fully addressed the growing housing crisis. With the average property price now exceeding €217,000, the required 10% deposit remains a significant barrier for many prospective buyers, especially those without financial support from family.",Jurgen Balzan,Economy
Maltese economy expands at slower pace in first quarter 2023 – Central Bank of Malta - The Malta Independent ,independent,https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2023-08-02/local-news/Maltese-economy-expands-at-slower-pace-in-first-quarter-2023-Central-Bank-of-Malta-6736253813,02-08-2023,000320.png,"

 The Maltese economy in the first quarter of 2023 expanded at a slower pace compared to the previous quarter, the Central Bank said in a statement Wednesday.
 When adjusting for imports, external trade was the main driver of growth, as the contribution of domestic demand though positive, was small. The Bank’s estimate of the output gap remained positive but narrowed, indicating that the degree of over-utilisation of the economy’s productive capacity has eased somewhat.
 The Bank’s Business Conditions Index stood slightly above its historical average. The European Commission’s Economic Sentiment Indicator rose above its long-term average. 
 Developments in the labour market remained positive, the CBM said.
 Consumer price pressures eased somewhat, but inflation remained high from a historical perspective.
 The general government deficit-to-GDP ratio fell while the debt-to-GDP ratio edged up compared with the fourth quarter of 2022.
 GDP and employment growth in Malta were higher compared with the euro area average, while the unemployment rate was lower. However, HICP inflation was higher. While Malta’s deficit-to-GDP ratio was higher than the euro area average, its debt-to-GDP ratio was lower.
 In light of persistent inflationary pressures, the ECB raised its key interest rates again in February and in March. Additional increases were announced in May, June, and July.
 From March 2023, and until the end of June, the Eurosystem began to reinvest only part of maturing securities under the Asset Purchase Programme (APP). Such reinvestments ended as of July 2023. These decisions are reflected in a decrease in the value of securities under this programme.
 The Governing Council reiterated its intention to continue reinvesting the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) until at least the end of 2024.

Attack on cash rebate programme is an attack on film industry - Commissioner  - The Malta Independent ,independent,https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2023-08-25/local-news/Attack-on-cash-rebate-programme-is-an-attack-on-film-industry-Commissioner-6736254343,25-08-2023,000329.png,"

 Anyone attacking the cash rebate programme is attacking the stability of the film industry, Malta Film Commissioner Johann Grech said on Friday.
 In a short, published video on Facebook, full of clichéd phrases normally used by politicians, the commissioner defended the cash rebate system and spoke of efforts to bring more foreign investment in the country.
 The video was ostensibly in reply to a story published by The Sunday Times of Malta in which it was reported that Maltese taxpayers will be paying €46.7 million to the film company producing the Gladiator sequel film. The rebate is part of a cash scheme that promises productions up to 40% cash back if they film in Malta. This sparked criticism on the rebate scheme and questions as to whether the film industry should be afforded such benefits.
 Grech said that over the last few days, he has met with several individuals who were asking about, what he described as “insensitive” attack on the film industry.
 Grech said that he is not going to let anyone hinder the jobs of those working in the industry or the opportunities brought in the country.
 Tourism Minister Clayton Bartolo had earlier in the week also defended the €46.7 million being given as a rebate, saying that the funds are not being taken from other sectors.
 ""When we say we will give €47 million as a cash rebate, it means that while this production is being filmed in our country, over €110 million is being spent. So giving the impression that the country is losing money is completely wrong, is misleading,"" he said.
 Continuing on the same matter Grech said the cash rebate sum given is the amount which has already been spent by the film in question in the country.
 He explained that this system has already been approved by the EU and is already in place on other countries.
 Moreover, he said that the cash rebate system is already in place in other sectors such as the Igaming industry.
 However, the PN reiterates that these millions could have been spent on different sectors, including to strengthen the Maltese culture sector or the improving of local talents.
 On Friday the PN presented a formal request to the Auditor General to investigate the expenditure of almost €137 million from taxpayers’ that the Malta Film Commission paid to foreign companies between September 2018 and August 2023.

HSBC records €118m in pre-tax profits in Q3 - The Malta Independent ,independent,https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2024-10-30/local-news/HSBC-records-118m-in-pre-tax-profits-in-Q3-6736265325,30-10-2024,000921.png,"
                
        

         HSBC Bank Malta reported strong profits with a reported profit before tax for Q3 YTD 2024 of €118.0m, an increase of 17% over the €100.8m profits reported in the same period last year.
 In a company statement, the bank said growth reflects the diversified nature of the business and customer base, supported by the higher interest rate environment. Good progress was reported on the non-interest income as well as robust risk management reflected in continued Expected Credit Losses ('ECL') recoveries.  Revenue was up €19.0m or 11% when compared to Q3 YTD 2023. This was mainly driven by higher customer activity amidst the higher interest rate environment: average interest rates in the first nine months of 2024 were higher than the same period in 2023.
 Non-funds income increased by €2.8m compared with the same period last year with an improvement registered in net fee income, international trade services, foreign exchange and insurance income, the bank said.
 The bank recorded an improvement in the credit quality of its loan book, resulting in a release in ECL of €10.8m in Q3 YTD 2024 compared to a release of €3.7m in Q3 YTD 2023. The Q3 YTD 2024 release reflected recovery on non-performing loans, a release of provisions held for inflationary pressures which did not materialise as well as a general improvement in the credit quality of the book. Operating expenses increased by 12% compared to the same period last year.
 While there were some one-off items, the underlying drivers were increases in staff costs, IT expenses and real estate costs as the Bank continues to invest in people, customer experience, technology and new headquarters in Qormi. In Q3 2024, the Bank implemented a new mortgage system. Furthermore, the roll-out of new ATMs also commenced in line with our plan to replace all ATMs by 2025. Other significant digital improvements are on track.
 Net loans and advances to customers decreased marginally compared with 31 December 2023. Customer deposits decreased from year-end, mainly driven by a decrease in operational corporate deposits which can be seasonal but increased compared to 30 September 2023, the bank said.
 The Bank's liquidity position remained strong and regulatory capital ratios continued to exceed regulatory capital requirements. On 11 September 2024, the Bank announced that HSBC Holdings plc will undertake a strategic review of its indirect 70.03% shareholding. HSBC Holdings plc informed that the review process will consider a range of options and no decisions have yet been made. The Bank remains focused on running its business and will provide further updates as required.
 Geoffrey Fichte, Chief Executive Officer of HSBC Bank Malta p.l.c., said: ""We continued our strong business momentum focused on supporting our customers with a 17% growth in pre-tax profit over prior year. We're pleased to report higher customer activity, the launch of new products including in wealth management, investment funds and insurance and continued to invest in our people and technology in order to make banking simpler, easier and safer for our customers. Our levels of capital and liquidity remain robust amongst the highest in the market. HSBC remains fully open for business, providing the full range of lending services from mortgages, personal loans, cards to long term lending to companies, including energy efficiency loans. On behalf of the entire HSBC Bank Malta team, I would like to thank our customers for their business and our colleagues for their professionalism and support.""

BOV announces pre-tax profit of €223.7 million in first nine months of 2024 - The Malta Independent ,independent,https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2024-10-31/local-news/BOV-announces-pre-tax-profit-of-223-7-million-in-first-nine-months-of-2024-6736265358,31-10-2024,000973.png,"
                
        

         The Bank of Valletta Group on Thursday announced a strong and sustained financial performance for the nine months ending September 2024, with a profit before tax of €223.7 million, up by 36.9% over the same period last year. This positive performance is the result of the continuous expansion of loan portfolios, a drive to improve and diversify net fee and commission income, as well as the Bank's continued focus on its balance sheet optimisation strategy, the group said.  The group's operating income increased from €315.9 million to €359.2 million compared to the same period in 2023. This is reflected in a 14.5% rise in Net Interest Income and a 5.4% increase in Net Fee and Commission income over the same period in 2023. The credit portfolio has also shown consistent growth, resulting in a 9.1% increase primarily due to sustained growth across all segments including business loans, home loans and personal loans. The positive performance was also prevalent on the asset quality side, where the overall non-performing exposures ratio decreased to 2.8% of total balances, as compared to 3.1% in December 2023.
 The investments book maintained an upward trend and increased to €5.9 billion as a result of the purchase of high-quality paper instruments, generating interest income of €92 million over the nine-month period under review. Most of these investments are measured at amortised costs, aligning with the Bank business model to hold securities until maturity to collect interest revenues. On the liabilities side, customer deposits increased by 1% since the beginning of the year, with the increase coming from both personal and non-personal customers.
 When excluding strategy related costs, operating costs registered an increase of 4.0% compared to the same period in 2023, aligned with the Group's efforts to prioritise talent, compensation and benefits, technological advancements and regulatory compliance. In this vein, operational efficiency continues to attract a high level of focus, with the cost-to-income ratio standing at 42.1%, which is 4% lower than the 46.1% achieved in the same period in 2023, driven by cost management and procurement excellence initiatives.
 The Group's liquidity remains well above the minimum regulatory requirements, as do the Group's capital ratios. Pre-tax Return on Average Equity stands at 22.5%, representing approximately an improvement of 3.8% over the equivalent number recorded in the same period last year. The net asset value per share at the end of the third quarter of 2024 stood at €2.4 per share as compared to €2.2 per share as at December 2023, the group said.
 Sustaining BOV's positive momentum - Gordon Cordina, Chairman
 BOV Chairman Gordon Cordina expressed satisfaction on the Bank's sustained performance. ""Bank of Valletta has been on a positive trajectory for a good number of months. We have adopted strategies to ensure sustained growth in our core business areas, strengthening our balance sheet position, managing costs, improving operational efficiency, while focusing on customer centricity and sustainable growth. These results follow the recent announcement of an interim cash dividend of €0.0924 gross per share, as well as the €100 million 5% unsecured subordinated bond issue that closed within 2 days of launch following overwhelming response by investors.""
 Speaking about the economic scenario, Cordina commented, ""The latest economic statistics and forecasts point to relatively benign conditions in Malta, with positive effects on the Bank's business development initiatives and the quality of its assets. Looking forward, the Bank will continue to sustain economic growth within a wider development context of increasing productivity and investment in ESG dimensions, which are fundamental for longer-term business competitiveness and credit quality"".
 Delivering strong financial and operational results -  Kenneth Farrugia
 CEO Kenneth Farrugia commented, ""These results reflect the Bank's efforts towards sustained growth and progress. We have continued to invest in technology, business process reengineering and above all, the customer experience, as part of our medium-to-long term transformation strategy. BOV has also made considerable progress in its ESG journey, setting ambitious emissions reduction targets, aligning with the latest reporting standards, and taking the leading role in influencing local businesses to transition to green. We have also been active on the personal front, with the launch of our Green Home First and Green Home Plus loan products.
 Looking ahead, the Bank remains strongly committed to adapting its business and operational model to market dynamics, continue driving innovation across products, services and processes and foster an organisation-wide culture of service excellence. All these initiatives will enable the Bank to strengthen its focus on stakeholder value, customer centricity and operational efficiency, and equally sustain its performance in the years ahead of us.""
