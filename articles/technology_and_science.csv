Maltese researchers unlock space secret to potential cure,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/maltese-researchers-unlock-space-secret-potential-cure.1094362,25-06-2024,"000245.png,000246.png,000247.png","A Maltese research group has discovered that human blood in space reverts to its foetal type, potentially leading to breakthroughs for thalassaemia patients, whose haemoglobin is dysfunctional after birth and requires a lifetime of transfusions.
 Thalassaemic patients have a genetic problem in adult haemoglobin, and if a way to bring their foetal blood back to high levels is found, their symptoms can be improved.
 With access to data and blood samples of NASA astronauts, the research group could confirm the adult-to-foetal globin switch in spaceflight and its change back on Earth – a key to unlocking a cure for the millions suffering from the severe hereditary blood condition worldwide and 28 Maltese patients.
 Lead author of the study, Joseph Borg, from the University of Malta’s Faculty of Health Sciences, explained that thalassaemia patients, whom he has been studying for decades, have abnormal blood and could do well with elevated levels of foetal haemoglobin, which replaces the role of its deficient adult counterpart.
  Thalassaemia causes anaemia, resulting in fatigue, weakness, a propensity for other diseases due to immunity and, in severe cases, death. Patients can require blood transfusions every six weeks, a cumbersome treatment that often causes other complications.
 “As the name implies, foetal haemoglobin is found in developing foetuses, and this set of genes ‘switches off’ to give way to adult blood,” Borg explained. “Knowing how this switch is controlled – and goes back and forth – is crucial, to say the least,” Borg said.
  Historically, the gene switch occurred from foetal to adult blood, so the inflight switch is a unique opportunity to observe it both ways, he continued.
 “The plan is to now tease out the key molecules responsible for the switch. We use space to identify the key, and once we hold this, on Earth it can be used to design drugs, molecules and inhibitors to treat the blood disorder.”
 While the key has not yet been found, Borg said “we have now chosen a specific road, with no more turns, trial and error, and we know exactly where we are heading. The data is pointing in right direction”.
 A possible conclusion is that the microgravity in spaceflight may elicit the mechanisms behind the gene switch. In this environment, astronauts experience a decrease in red blood cells, possibly due to bone mineral density loss, Borg explained.
 The question now is why the body and blood of astronauts – healthy adults – ‘feel’ the need to revert to innate foetal genes and expression in microgravity.
 “We do not know yet. But that is the next mission,” Borg said.
 Mission possible
 The research, carried out together with other giants in the academic field, used the space environment to complete another important piece of the puzzle, Borg maintained.
 “We had assumed blood would behave differently and that there would be superior levels of foetal haemoglobin in space because this has already been seen in people living in high altitudes and mountains, where oxygen retention is tighter,” he said.
  During the pandemic, he read articles about the work on astronauts and reached out to NASA to inquire about their blood levels.
 “They said they had never looked at foetal haemoglobin, but they had the data and samples and offered to collaborate.”
 The study tapped into the powerful platform made available by NASA’s GeneLab, which provides a wealth of information linking molecular biology and genetics with space medical sciences.
 The local research team used the tools and machines in place for Malta’s blood screening programme, set up in 1990, to study the data from NASA, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency and private company SpaceX, which manufactures and launches rockets and spacecraft.
 It also involved actual blood samples from their respective American, Japanese and private astronauts before, during and after spaceflight.
 “Our hypothesis was that there would be elevated levels of foetal haemoglobin and it was proven correct,” Borg said.
 Before the end of the year, a number of space missions will be carried out to further the studies, Borg said.
 Meanwhile, an ongoing mission, Polaris Dawn, is taking blood from American entrepreneur, pilot and space tourist Jared Isaacman and his three crew members.
 These missions involve a five-day trip around the Earth, going up to 500km or higher from its orbit, Borg noted.
 Findings would further assist space research to improve the quality of life and safety of astronauts, but they would also be used in “space-for-Earth applications” to make a real difference for patients suffering from blood disorders.
 A key player but not the key
 The paper, ‘Spatiotemporal Expression and Control of Haemoglobin in Space’, has been published in Nature Communications and quoted in a wide-ranging article in the world’s leading multidisciplinary science journal  Nature.
 Borg and his colleagues performed the experiments and wrote the paper, with the contribution of Alfred Buħagiar, Josef Borg and Prof. Alex Felice, who, back in the 1990s, pioneered the now well-established field of research on haemoglobin biology.
 The study carries on from Maltese scientists’ breakthrough research for a cure for thalassemia in 2010.
 Borg had identified a molecule responsible for the switch from foetal to adult haemoglobin that occurs at birth thanks to the discovery of a unique Maltese family, who had high levels of the foetal haemoglobin but did not suffer from thalassaemia.
 The hope was that it would get patients to be transfusion independent, but it transpired that locking down this one gene would not be enough to provide a cure.
 “It is a key player, but not the key,” Borg said.

In Pictures: Malta's night skies illuminated by Perseid meteor showers,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/in-pictures-malta-night-skies-illuminated-perseid-meteor-showers.1096699,13-08-2024,"001195.png,001196.png,001197.png,001198.png,001199.png,001200.png","Stargazers were in for a treat last night as the Perseid meteor showers gave a fantastic display across Malta's night sky. 
 The annual astronomical event, referred to in Maltese as id-Dmugħ ta San Lawrenz (The Tears of St Lawrence), usually occurs when the Earth passes through the debris field of the Comet Swift-Tuttle. 
  As the trail of particles shed by the comet make contact with the Earth's atmosphere, they heat up and glow, streaking across the sky as spectacular flashes of light and becoming meteors or shooting stars.
 Across Malta, enthusiasts gathered in some of the islands' darkest places, hoping to escape the reach of light pollution and watch the astronomical light show.
  In Dwejra, Gozo, with car parks packed full to the brim and the sound of hushed voices occasionally breaking the silence to gasp in awe, it was clear that the public was out in full force to enjoy the event. 
 Joseph Caruana, a professor at the Department of Physics and Institute of Space Sciences and Astronomy told Times of Malta that the occasion marked a peaceful communal affair for the most part. 
  ""On account of the darkness at Dwejra – the very darkness which allows the Perseids to shine – one could not quite see where other people were located,"" he said.
 ""One was reminded of their presence by the hushed sighs which carried across the rugged landscape every time a bright meteor whizzed by. The eerie cries of the cliff-dwelling shearwater, rippling across the water, made for a surreal atmosphere at times.""
 He said such enthusiastic attendance is evidence that people have a growing interest in being able to enjoy natural events. 
 ""People want to be able to enjoy nature. The presence of yesterday's crowd, huddled in separate groups at the best remaining dark site on the Islands to witness this annual celestial event, was, once again, a testament to the public's interest in and fascination with the night sky – a shared heritage of humanity,"" Caruana said. 
  He added it is a shame the site is not afforded all the protection that it merits, including monitoring to combat light pollution in protected dark areas across the country. 
 In Miġra l-Ferħa, Rabat, Daniel Cassar Alpert, who attended a meetup to watch the perseids in the area, said that things were a little less peaceful at times, but quietened down later in the night. 
  ""The atmosphere was a little busy at times with cars arriving and leaving creating some light pollution at those times,"" he said.
 ""However after around 1am most had left and the place calmed down and a fresh breeze made it an enjoyable summer night to sit and relax while enjoying the view above.""
 Last year, stargazing events to watch the Perseid meteor showers organised by the Malta Astronomical Society were marred by light pollution, spoiling the once-a-year event for attendees.

"War footage, explicit music videos accessible on children's school tablets",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/war-footage-explicit-music-videos-accessible-children-school-tablets.1102474,16-12-2024,"002681.png,002682.png,002683.png,002684.png","Primary schoolchildren have unfiltered access to explicit music videos, war footage and other inappropriate content through tablets supplied to schools by the Education Ministry.
 The tablets are given out to children attending state schools in years 4, 5 and 6, and can be connected to the internet.
 Times of Malta was approached by a concerned parent, whose eldest daughter had informed her that her nine-year-old sister was watching “a naughty video” on YouTube.
 The video in question was titled ‘Do You Want To Play With My Balls’, an innuendo-filled parody of a children’s story, complete with narrator and illustrations.
  The parent said her complaints to the school and ministry have fallen on deaf ears.
 After Times of Malta was granted access to the tablet, it emerged that clips like graphic drone footage from the war in Ukraine, as well as the notoriously explicit music video of the Cardi B song WAP, were accessible.
 On the other hand, attempts to access websites related to pornography, gambling and alcohol were met with the message ‘Access Denied’.
  “I was shocked when I found this out, but other parents might not. Someone at the ministry is clearly not doing their job. I feel powerless because our kids aren’t being safeguarded,” the parent said.
 “The school told us to report the issue to the ministry because they didn’t get anywhere when they tried to flag it themselves,” she added.
 The mother also expressed anger that children were being allowed to access their tablets during breaktime, as well at breakfast and after-school clubs.
 “The school doesn’t have enough staff so the tablets are being used as a kind of babysitter,” the parent said.
  A learning support educator who works at another primary school echoed the parent’s frustrations, saying it was not unusual for school staff to catch children showing each other inappropriate content, and repeating profanity they had heard online.
 “We’re often the first point of contact for parents who complain, but we can’t keep an eye on all the kids at all times. The situation creates a lot of pressure and anxiety for us. We have too many responsibilities as it is. And we can’t supervise them at all when they’re on the school van,” said the LSE.
 The educator wished to remain anonymous due to a directive issued by the ministry stating that teachers must get written permission before speaking to the media.
 Questions sent to the Education Ministry remain unanswered at the time of writing.

"Comet visible from Malta as it enters solar system after 80,000 years",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/comet-visible-malta-enters-solar-system-80000-years.1098641,27-09-2024,"003159.png,003160.png","Stargazers are in for a special treat over the next few weeks as they get a very rare opportunity to see a comet that is believed to visit our solar system every 80,000 years.
 Astronomer Alexei Pace managed to take a photo of the comet - Comet C/2023 A3, otherwise known as Comet Tsuchinshan-ATLAS - on Friday at 6 am from Tal-Virtù in Rabat.
 “The photograph shows the comet as a faint but distinct point of light, with its tail pointing towards the upper right-hand side of the image, in the pre-dawn sky above the lights of the Maltese landscape,” said Pace, the former president of the Astronomical Society of Malta.
  This comet has been generating excitement among astronomers and skywatchers alike, as it is expected to become one of the brightest comets visible this year. 
 Comets consist of an ice and rock centre, surrounded by a cloud of gas and dust. They are considered leftovers from the formation of our solar system, about 4.6 billion years ago.
 They orbit the sun in highly elliptical orbits that can take hundreds of thousands of years to complete. Every so often, one of these comets makes its way into the inner solar system. As it gets closer to the sun, frozen gases are released creating the tail we often associate with comets. 
 Comet Tsuchinshan-Atlas gets its longer name from the facilities that first spotted it back in February 2023: the Purple Mountain Observatory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (or Tsuchinshan Chinese Observatory) and the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS). 
 It is currently at a point called perihelion – its closest approach to the sun.  
 Right now it is visible mostly from the earth’s southern hemisphere so from locations like Malta it appears low in the pre-dawn Eastern skies.  It is currently visible through binoculars or small telescopes.
 Pace explains that the comet is predicted to brighten further as it approaches its closest point to the Earth on October 12.
 At the moment it is visible just before the sun rises at dawn. The light dampens it out making it difficult to see with the naked eye.
 After the perihelion, it will not be visible for a couple of days, as it will be “behind the sun”. But when it emerges on the other side  - within about two weeks – it is predicted that it will be visible in the west after sunset.  However, comets are notoriously difficult to predict and a variety of factors can impact their visibility.
 “It will reach its brightness peak around mid-October then it will start getting fainter as it continues along its orbit away and back into the depths of space,” Pace said.

'Drop taboos around AI and help students learn to use it',timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/drop-taboos-around-ai-help-student-learn-use-it.1100457,11-02-2024,003254.png,"An artificial intelligence expert has spoken about the need to drop taboos around programmes like ChatGPT, insisting that students should be encouraged to use it.
 Dylan Seychell, who teaches at the University of Malta’s Department of Artificial Intelligence, discussed AI’s potential in the classroom, advocating for its responsible use by students.
 Seychell sees this approach as a way to prepare students for a world that openly embraces technology, fostering greater productivity and accountability.
 “I took a measure when ChatGPT came out that in every assignment I give out, 10 per cent of the mark is given to using that system and telling me how students use it and what they did,” he said.
 He also suggested that AI could be integrated into homework routines to reduce workload. For example, 1,000-word essays assigned as homework could be reduced to a 200-word classroom exercise, and students could use ChatGPT at home to refine their work.
 This approach, he argued, not only lightens teachers’ correction load but also teaches students to self-edit and learn independently.
 This is why the government should provide every Maltese citizen access to AI systems like ChatGPT.
  Seychell was speaking yesterday at a Times of Malta business breakfast titled ‘Malta Vision 2050: Just Another Slogan?’
 AI could serve as a virtual assistant for everyone, from small business owners to students, helping with various tasks that would boost productivity.
 “Can we look at a country where the government creates some sort of measure where every Maltese person has access to software like ChatGPT, Claude, or the others?” Seychell asked.
 “Like that, we have double the population without having to add another car on the road or needing another apartment.”
 Seychell argued that AI could serve as a virtual assistant for everyone, from small business owners to students, helping with a range of tasks that would boost productivity. 
 His proposal was directed at Economy Minister Silvio Schembri, the keynote speaker at the event.
 
 The breakfast discussion was part of a broader conversation on Malta’s goals for 2050.
 Minister Schembri opened the event with an outline of the government’s vision, focusing on four main themes: innovation and technology, infrastructure, sustainability, and talent development. According to Schembri, these pillars aim to improve the quality of life for Maltese citizens, with a view to positioning Malta as a global leader in sustainable, digitally advanced living.
 Other panellists, including Stephanie Fabri, Silvan Mifsud, Stefano Mallia and Jerome Caruana Cilia, were encouraged by moderator Mark Lawrence Zammit to provide tangible suggestions on how Malta could achieve its Vision 2050 goals.

What was that mysterious shape in the night sky?,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/watch-mysterious-cloud-sky-spacex-satellites-expert.1094369,24-06-2024,004744.png,"The “air balloon” and “white line” spotted in the sky on Sunday evening were SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket releasing a satellite train into space, according to a University of Malta professor.
 On Sunday evening several people shared photos and videos with Times of Malta and also on social media showing a ""strange"" white ballon-like cloud and “a white line"" trailing behind it.
 It was no UFO.
 According to Professor Joseph Borg, Maltese sky-gazers were witnessing satellites being released into space. 
 These clouds - called 'SpaceX nebula' - and a white line were spotted a couple of hours after Elon Musk's SpaceX completed another launch from the West Coast in the US: the Falcon 9 (a reusable rocket) launched more Starlink mini-satellites into space.
 Starlink is a satellite internet constellation that provides global mobile broadband. 
  Borg, a professor of biomedical science and director of Spaceomix - a Maltese space biotech company - explained that the white line was the satellites being released into space.
 If they are seen soon after release and are still close together, they appear as a straight line. The later they are seen, he said, the more dispersed they get.
 As for the cloud-like formation around these satellites, he said this might be due to several reasons, including rocket launch exhaust.
 ""After the launch of the Starlink satellites, the rocket’s exhaust can create a temporary cloud in space. This cloud is usually visible shortly after launch and can be illuminated by sunlight, making it visible from the ground, "" he said.
 The cloud could also be deployment debris. During the deployment of satellites, small particles or ice crystals might be released, forming a temporary cloud around the satellite constellation.
 Another option could be satellite reflections, explained Borg.
 The satellites’ solar panels and other reflective surfaces can sometimes create a visual effect that looks like a cloud, especially if the sunlight hits them at a particular angle.
 The cloud could also be due to atmospheric effects. High-altitude atmospheric conditions can sometimes create optical illusions or enhance the visibility of the satellite train, making it appear cloud-like.

You now need eID to check the electoral register,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/you-now-need-eid-check-electoral-register.1098462,27-09-2024,005147.png,"A potential security vulnerability identified on the Electoral Register website has led to the introduction of eID authentication for access to voter information.
 The Electoral Register contains details such as names, surnames, identity or eResidence card numbers and addresses of registered voters. Until August, this data was available as open source.
 The Electoral Commission, which manages the register, said the vulnerability was found during a routine security assessment on its portal in late 2023.
 “In response to this finding, the Electoral Commission promptly authorised introducing enhanced security measures to address the vulnerabilities discovered within the portal. Among these measures was the incorporation of eID authentication,” a spokesperson said.
 A reader informed Times of Malta in August about the changes to the login process. According to the Electoral Commission, the security updates, including eID (electoral identification) authentication, were fully in place by August 2024.
 However, the commission has not clarified whether users who log in with their eID will have their movements on the website tracked.
 The introduction of eID authentication occurred around the time of an ID card racket scandal, in which former MP Jason Azzopardi alleged that around 18,000 identity cards had been fraudulently issued since 2015. Azzopardi claimed marriage certificates and other documents were fabricated by officials from the government agency Identità.
 The scandal is currently under judicial inquiry after a court upheld Azzopardi’s request to investigate the matter. Allegations suggest systemic fraud involving government officials, which could have national security implications.
 However, the Electoral Commission stressed that its new security measures were unrelated to Azzopardi’s claims.
 “The commission is an autonomous entity from Identità,” the spokesperson said, distancing itself from the scandal.
 The commission clarified that the timing of the security upgrade was purely coincidental, emphasising that the eID measures were implemented as a response to internal assessments rather than external allegations.

National orchestra to supply information after data commissioner's complaints,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/national-orchestra-sees-law-data-commissioner.1091693,29-04-2024,005900.png,"Updated 2.47pm with a statement by the national orchestra. 
 The national orchestra said on Monday it had decided to supply information requested by Times of Malta after the data protection commissioner said it seemed to consider itself “above the law”.  
 In a decision published last week, the commissioner ordered the orchestra to give Times of Malta copies of all agreements it has with a Russian-linked foundation that has pumped millions into the local and international music scene.
 The commissioner’s investigation was triggered following a complaint by Times of Malta over the orchestra’s decision to reject a freedom of information request for copies of agreements it has with an NGO called the European Foundation for Support of Culture (EUFSC).
 According to the decision, the orchestra “deliberately and persistently” failed to cooperate with the commissioner’s office during its attempt to investigate whether the orchestra had been justified in rejecting the freedom of information request.
  Times of Malta has reported how the foundation, presided over by Russian-Armenian  Konstantin Ishkhanov, built strong ties among orchestra and government officials, as part of a €12 million splurge on organising music events in Malta and abroad.
 The commissioner said the orchestra’s failure to cooperate with its investigation, coming from a reputable musical institution, is “certainly deplorable and is unacceptable in a democratic society”.
 The orchestra’s board is chaired by Alfred Camilleri, a former finance ministry permanent secretary under both PN and Labour governments.
 According to the orchestra, the agreements with the foundation are exempt from disclosure under freedom of information laws, as they are covered by “legal professional privilege”.
 In March 2023, following the Times of Malta’s complaint, the commissioner invited the orchestra to elaborate on why it felt its agreement with the foundation was protected from disclosure.
 After “several reminders” were sent to the orchestra in April, May and June, the commissioner’s office finally received a reply in July 2023.
 In the reply, the orchestra proposed finding “common ground” with Times of Malta about how to handle the information request.
 It demanded that Times of Malta withdraw its complaint about the rejected freedom of information request, in exchange for being allowed to “access” the agreement with the foundation, whilst agreeing to restrict publication of the actual documents.
 The orchestra further demanded that Times of Malta “must agree that any subsequent publication or media report on the matter should be factual and not speculative, as past reports have been”.
 It further ordered that the orchestra’s “official position” be published alongside any Times of Malta article.
 This approach, the orchestra said, sought to strike a balance between Times of Malta’s right to access documents “while also preventing the misuse of freedom of information requests to generate speculative articles” that could harm the orchestra’s reputation, which it said goes against the spirit of the law.
 Times of Malta rejected the orchestra’s demands, with lawyer Therese Comodini Cachia arguing that they are in clear breach of the law and take an offensive stand towards journalism.
 Comodini Cachia said that the orchestra’s proposal to restrict Times of Malta’s use of the requested documents was a non-starter, as responsible journalism does not allow for complicity in keeping public interest information hidden.
 The lawyer further pointed out that Times of Malta had always reflected the orchestra’s official position in its publications, and had spent months seeking information from the orchestra about its deals with the foundation.
 After the proposal was rejected, the commissioner gave the orchestra a September 2023 deadline to hand over a copy of the documents, so it could decide on the merits of Times of Malta’s freedom of information request.
 Despite further reminders and the serving of an enforcement notice, the commissioner’s requests continued to be ignored by the orchestra.
 In its April 26 decision, the commissioner’s office rebuked the orchestra for its lack of cooperation throughout the investigation.
 The commissioner also emphasised the “urgent need” for legislative changes to give its office the necessary power to “effectively and dissuasively” sanction public authorities that “deliberately fail” to adhere with the orders of the commissioner.
 In a reaction early on Monday afternoon, the national orchestra announced that it had decided to supply the requested information.
 It said it was committing itself to improving its internal procedures so that it could be more efficient in correspondence with entities such as the data commissioner. 
 It also pointed out that as laid down in the decision by the commissioner, two terms were still running., One was a 20 working day limit for the orchestra to file an appeal, and the other was a 20-day limit for the orchestra to supply the requested information if it did not appeal.
 It said it had decided to supply the requested information within the time limit in terms of the law. 
 It also pointed out that it severed all collaboration with the European Foundation for Support for Culture” more than 18 months ago.

 Metsola appears briefly in a segment called ‘breakout elections’, with a clip of her casting her vote at a Sliema primary school. The section also features footage of other women voting, American president-elect Donald Trump and UK Prime Minister Kier Starmer.
 In a voiceover accompanying the segment, Metsola can be heard saying, “2024 will be the biggest global election year in history.”
 More than two billion people across 50 countries – including seven of the most populous nations – were expected to go to the polls this year, according to news outlet  Al Jazeera.
  While the US election arguably dominated the international media landscape, closer to home Europe was also gripped by election fever as the public cast their votes in the European Parliament elections.
 In Malta, Labour won but saw its majority evaporate, losing its fourth MEP to the Opposition Nationalist Party while securing less than half the votes.
 Fortune continued to favour EP president Roberta Metsola, however, who fended off a last-minute challenge from Spanish MEP Irene Montero to be overwhelmingly re-elected to a second term in the strongest win for an EP president in history.
 Meanwhile, in local council elections held at the same time but with results announced later, the Labour Party saw losses but still managed to retain control of 39 local councils, well over half of Malta’s 68 localities.
  Across the pond, last month Donald Trump claimed a ""magnificent"" victory over Democrat Kamala Harris in what has been called one of the most stunning comebacks in US political history.
 Aside from politics, the Google video also shows clips from talk shows and social media, sporting events and music concerts, while taking a look at some of the scientific and technological advancements in the past year.

 The video is the latest in a series of annual videos going back at least as far as 2014, according to a YouTube – owned by Google – page featuring uploads related to the hashtag ‘#YearinSearch’.
 Such look-backs are increasingly common on technology platforms and in mobile applications, with other examples including Spotify’s ‘Spotify Wrapped’ viral marketing campaign and Google Photos’ ‘Recap’ feature.

Watch: How Nico found his voice aged 12 – ‘I always knew he had one’,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/watch-how-nico-found-voice-aged-12-i-knew-one.1091627,27-04-2024,007515.png,"For 12 years Ramona Matthews was unable to have a conversation with her son Nico ­who has nonverbal autism and struggles to express himself. Three weeks ago, however, with the help of an electronic communication device, the two were able to have a long-awaited chat.
 The pair spoke about Nico’s school, his teachers, and his family. While they were chatting, Ramona decided to film the conversation because she thought no one would believe her. “I listen to that video all the time just to hear his voice. This was the first time I ever heard it and that boy has such a beautiful voice,” said Ramona.
 Nico and his twin sister, Amy, are 12. When growing up Ramona noticed that Nico was acting differently to his sister and when he was one-and-a-half he was diagnosed with autism.
 Due to his nonverbal autism, communication has always been a struggle for Nico. He was seven when he said his first word, “mummy”. “Do you know how happy mum was? She called me, his LSE, our grandparents, everyone. It was a huge celebration for us,” said Amy. 
  Ramona said at first it was very difficult finding a way for Nico to express himself as he rejected the communication system available at the time.
 However, in September 2020 he was given a device that would change his life.  The Malta Trust Foundation was able to provide Nico with an Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) device which helps develop functional communication skills, promotes cognitive development, and provides a foundation for literacy development that also helps improve social communication.
 The AAC device was also built according to Nico’s individual needs and Ramona believes that is why Nico has advanced so far. Today, three-and-a-half years after first being given the device, Nico is still not a big talker and prefers using his device as a mode of communication, but he can now answer questions as well as read and write.
 Ramona said the video of the two of them having a conversation has been very impactful on the entire family. When Amy heard the video for the first time she told her mother, “Ma, today a miracle happened.” Ramona believes the reason Nico watches the video of their conversation so often is because he is proud of himself and his accomplishment. “I always knew my son had a voice. The device just helped other people hear it.” said Ramona.
 As a way of giving back to the foundation that helped her son Ramona will be volunteering in The Malta Trust Foundation’s marathon on Saturday. The marathon Għat-tfall kollha, kollha, kollha will be screened on all local channels from noon to midnight.

 The Department of Artificial Intelligence within the Faculty of ICT at the University of Malta has launched Project DIVE (Data-driven Intelligent Video Evaluation) an innovative research initiative that aims to revolutionise competitive swimming training through artificial intelligence technology. The project is led by Dr Vanessa Camilleri and in collaboration with the Aquatic Sports Association of Malta (ASA). In a statement, ASA explained that the project will develop AI-powered tools to analyse swimming performance through video data, providing real-time feedback to athletes and coaches. “Project DIVE represents a significant step forward in combining sports science with artificial intelligence,” Camilleri said, and added that the aim is to help athletes optimise their performance through smart technology that can analyse swimming techniques. This would also reduce the risk of training-related injuries. The project, which has received €80,000 in funding, will focus on developing AI systems capable of recognising different swimming strokes and providing detailed analysis of swimming mechanics. This technology could potentially transform how swimmers train and prepare for competitions. The research team will work closely with experts from the ASA as well as local swimming coaches and athletes throughout the 18-month project duration. The initiative aligns with Malta’s broader goals of advancing both sports excellence and technological innovation.",Monique Agius,Technology

It intends to present several amendments to not only prompt a parliamentary debate but also to achieve a national consensus on the future direction of research and innovation in the country.
 The PN emphasised that the Opposition views the research and nnovation sector as a fundamental pillar of the Maltese economy, capable of providing quality jobs without harming the environment or increasing the population.  ",Matthew Farrugia ,Technology
Introduction of blocking measures to combat scam calls with Maltese numbers  - The Malta Independent ,independent,https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2024-10-25/local-news/Introduction-of-blocking-measures-to-combat-scam-calls-with-Maltese-numbers-6736265227,25-10-2024,000415.png,"
                
        

         The Malta Communications Authority (MCA) has said that, starting from 1 November 2024, technical measures are scheduled to be activated by local network operators to block calls from reaching Malta from abroad where the Caller ID is a Maltese number starting with '+356 1', '+356 2' or '+356 8'.
 ""Moreover, additional filtering will take place to block calls with invalid or prohibited Maltese numbers. These measures may also have an impact on users of internet- or cloud-based communications solutions who place calls with Caller IDs starting with these prefixes. These measures follow a public consultation process launched by the MCA in 2023 and became mandatory following a decision notice published in April 2024.""  ""The measures will filter out potential scam calls reaching Malta from abroad. Following the publication of this decision, the MCA immediately embarked on an extensive campaign to raise awareness with the general public, and amongst users of internet- or cloud-based communications solutions that may be affected by the new blocking measures. Local telephone providers were also required to notify all their telephony subscribers individually.""
 Businesses and other entities who make use of internet- or cloud-based communications solutions to place calls with Caller ID set to a Maltese number starting with '+356 1', '+356 2', or '+356 8' are still urged to ensure that their solutions are provided by compliant service providers, the MCA said.
 ""Otherwise, from 1 November 2024, all such calls towards Maltese numbers would be blocked. Users of such solutions may verify whether their solution will be affected by placing a call from such solution towards +356 2400 2400. Testing is only necessary for solutions that use Maltese numbers starting with the prefix '+356 1', '+356 2', or '+356 8' as the Caller ID. Users calling from a solution that will not be impacted will hear an announcement that their service provider is locally authorised with the MCA.""
 ""On the other hand, if the call fails to connect, or generates an announcement that the number is invalid or does not exist, such users should reach out to the provider of the respective internet- or cloud-based communications solution to seek assistance. More information on the MCA's activities related to combating scam calls, or on the forthcoming blocking measures, may be found in the respective FAQs on the MCA's website www.mca.org.mt/consumer/faqs.

New public electric vehicle fast charging service launched in Floriana,newsbook,https://newsbook.com.mt/en/new-public-electric-vehicle-fast-charging-service-launched-in-floriana/,21-11-2024,000437.png,"Tista' taqra bil-
 A new electric vehicle (EV) fast charging service has been launched at the Malta Public Transport e-bus charging depot in Floriana. In a statement on Thursday, Tallinja explained that the fast charging service is now being made available to the public in conjunction with EVPoint. The facility was established in 2023 when 30 new electric buses were acquired by Malta Public Transport. The company will now allow owners of electric vehicles to charge their vehicles between 9-6pm between Monday and Sunday at the facility. The fast chargers can provide up to 160kW depending on the vehicle that is being charged. Tallinja’s commercial director, Daniel Grech, said through this collaboration the company was making part of the bus charging infrastructure available to the wider public. “Through this initiative we are continuing to support Malta’s transition towards sustainable transport, offering owners of both private and commercial electric vehicles a fast and convenient charging service,” he said. Each charging point is equipped to support CCS2 connectors, is compatible with most electric vehicles, and facilitates fast charging. Charging times vary depending on individual battery capacities, with a boost that can be given within just 15 minutes, and a full charge between 30 minutes and 90 minutes, depending on vehicle specifications. To maximise availability for all customers, vehicles can only be parked at the charging points for a maximum of 30 minutes after charging has been completed. This time limit encourages fair access to charging resources and enables a higher turnover of available spots, helping to accommodate as many users as possible throughout the day. Customers need to download the EVPoint – Charge Forward App in order to make use of this service. Commercial charges apply and are based on individual consumption. Clear and comprehensive instructions are provided at each charging pole, and users are advised to familiarise themselves with the terms and conditions displayed on-site prior to initiating a charge.",Monique Agius,Technology
