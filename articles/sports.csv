Watch: Meet Malta's athletes at the Olympics,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/watch-im-lazy-except-sports-meet-malta-athletes-olympics.1095985,28-07-2024,001308.png,"Five athletes are representing Malta in the Olympic Games - sprinter Beppe Grillo, judoka Katryna Esposito, shooter Gianluca Chetcuti, and swimmers Sasha Gatt and Kyle Micallef.
 While preparing for the opening ceremony in Paris last Friday, three of them found the time to tell Times of Malta about themselves and what they hope to achieve. Meet Beppe Grillo, Katryna Esposito and Kyle Micallef
 Athletics - Men’s 100m Preliminary Round
 
 Grillo's greatest achievement to date has been clocking a time of 10.23 seconds in the 100 metres at the Balkan Championships, where he also secured Malta’s first bronze medal in the event. That performance earned him a spot as Malta’s wild card in the athletics category for the Olympic Games.
 His says his goal at the Olympics is to surpass his personal best. Ideally, he hopes to reach the semi-finals, a feat he believes is within reach. Grillo transitioned from football to athletics at the age of 14. He describes himself as generally lazy, except when it comes to sports, acknowledging that laziness hinders progress in athletics.
 Judo - Women’s 48kg Preliminary Rounds
 
 Esposito began practising judo at the age of four, training under the guidance of her father to whom she obviously attributes her passion for the sport. Apart from being a member of Team Malta, Esposito's most notable achievements include winning bronze at the 2022 Commonwealth Games and securing silver at this year's Algiers Africa Open following a recovery from injury.
 Regarding her aspirations for the Olympics, Esposito stated: ""I want to leave the mat knowing I gave it my all."" When not competing or training, she says she enjoys being in touch with nature with her friends, family, and dogs. In addition to her accomplishments in judo, Esposito is also a skilled amateur baker.
 Swimming - Men’s 50m Freestyle Heats
 
 Micallef, an Australian native, aims to make himself, his family, and Malta proud at the Olympics by recording a satisfactory time in the 50m freestyle. His greatest achievement has been winning gold in the 50m freestyle and the 4x100 relay at the 2023 GSSE.
 ""I have been swimming since I was two months old,"" said Micallef, who started competing at age seven. A sports enthusiast, Micallef is excited to watch various events in person and meet athletes he has long admired.
 The two other athletes on Team Malta are Gianluca Chetcuti, who competes in the Shooting—Men’s Skeet competition, and Sasha Gatt, who competes in the Swimming—Women’s 1500m Freestyle Heats.

Malta’s elusive Olympic dream,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/malta-elusive-olympic-dream.1096439,08-08-2024,"001861.png,001862.png,001863.png","Almost a century has passed since Malta’s first foray into the Olympic Games, when its nine-man waterpolo team reached the quarterfinals of the Amsterdam 1928 games.
 Ninety-six years later, this remains arguably the country’s most successful showing.
 Since then, over 100 athletes have represented Malta across a further 20 editions of the games, each of them aspiring to compete with the world’s best in their respective disciplines and, perhaps, bag a medal.
 All of them have returned empty-handed.
 There have been some respectable performances over the years, from shooter William Chetcuti’s near misses in 2004, 2008 and 2012, to windsurfer Peter Bonello’s ninth-placed finish in 1984.
 There have also been encouraging results in other competitions, not least last year’s Small Nations Games, where Malta topped the medal count.
 But Malta has largely looked on forlornly as several other world minnows took turns competing for silverware.
 This year, Julien Alfred swept to victory in the women’s 100-metre sprint to bag a first medal for Saint Lucia, population 180,000.
 Closer to home, San Marino – population 33,000, a touch fewer than St Paul’s Bay – took home three medals at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, while Liechtenstein’s 39,000 residents have collected a total of 10 medals over the years, albeit all of them in alpine skiing.
 Malta remains one of only eight European countries – and 74 around the world – to have never seen one of its athletes step triumphantly on an Olympic podium.
 Times of Malta spoke to former Olympians and sports educators to try and understand what is holding Maltese athletes back.
  Former Olympic runner Mario Bonello says that much of the problem boils down to starting athletes early.
 “Are we giving sport enough prominence at school?” he asks, rhetorically.
 “We need to widen participation at younger age levels. We don’t know what talent we have because many children don’t participate in sports in the first place,” he says.
 Bonello argues that given Malta’s small pool of children from which to choose, the country needs to up the ratio of children practising sports higher than that of other countries if it wants to start on an equal footing.
 Bonello says that this requires a root-and-branch rethink of attitudes towards sports in schools.
 Instead of sporadic physical education lessons spread throughout the week, he says, more schools should be looking to emulate the model adopted by the National Sports School to offer students the opportunity to dedicate an hour-and-a-half each day to sport.
 Popular sports broadcaster and educator George Micallef agrees that attitudes towards sport often hold Malta back.
 Micallef, a founder of the National Sports School, is today in charge of sports development and recruitment at the Mediterranean College of Sports, an independent school for children over the age of 11.
 “Malta lacks a proper sports culture that is ingrained from an early age,” Micallef says, pointing to what he perceives as shortcomings in athletes’ “performance lifestyle”, or their mindset and day-to-day habits.
 “Being an athlete is more than training and practising a sport, it’s also about sleeping habits, nutrition, perseverance and how you live your life.”
 
 The problem, Micallef believes, is ultimately cultural and stretches beyond just the realm of sports.
 “We tend to pamper youths, instead of encouraging them to stretch beyond their comfort zone and develop discipline, resilience and autonomy,” he says, arguing that these qualities are crucial for an athlete to deal with sporting setbacks.
 Just look at how many athletes move abroad to advance their sporting careers but don’t stick it out, returning home after just a few weeks or months, he says.
 That’s not to say that it all boils down to culture.
 Micallef believes that Malta still lags behind other countries when it comes to sports science, particularly in areas like sports psychology and data analysis.
 Ultimately, Micallef says, “Maltese athletes lack a holistic development that goes beyond purely technical training”.
 These shortcomings emerge in top-level competitions, where the finest of margins can sway a result, he argues.
 Bonello echoes these thoughts when asked whether Maltese athletes tend to underperform during the Olympics, compared to their usual standard.
 “Not everybody was born with the mentality required to win an Olympic medal,” he says, pointing out that pressures and expectations can sometimes play tricks on even the most technically gifted international athletes.
  Both Bonello and Micallef agree that support structures for Maltese athletes are sorely lacking, with athletes frequently finding themselves between a rock and a hard place when faced with crucial career decisions.
 Bonello recalls how, on several instances, athletes had to withdraw from prestigious international competitions because their dates clashed with exams or coursework.
 In one instance, he says, “an examiner accompanied the athlete abroad so the athlete could sit for an O-level exam during a competition”.
 Micallef believes that “we make children choose either education or sports, instead of helping them develop a dual career”. When push comes to shove, he says, many abandon their sporting dreams to focus on their academic careers.
 “Can you blame them? An athlete’s career is short and can be unsteady. We are losing so many young athletes in this way, especially girls.”
 Former runner Tanya Blake, who represented Malta in the Athens 2004 Olympics, certainly doesn’t think so.
 “I don’t agree that the Maltese athletes gave disappointing performances,” she says. “They all earned their right to be there and would have performed to the best of their ability on the day.”
 More broadly, she believes that Malta’s sporting performances are on the up. “I’ve really enjoyed seeing the progress that Maltese sport has made, especially in athletics,” she says.
 “Maltese athletes have shown that they can excel in the GSSE (small nations games), Mediterranean games and Commonwealth games.”
 But why not the Olympics? And why are we being outflanked by fellow European minnows?
 Part of the reason is experience, Bonello says.
 Athletes from the likes of San Marino (“more or less just another Italian town, at least geographically”) have far more opportunities to travel and train with top Italian athletes in their field and gain crucial competition experience, compared to their Maltese counterparts.
 Still, Bonello echoes Blake’s optimism over the upward trajectory of Malta’s sports, especially in light of what he describes as “unprecedented investment in athletics” over the past three years.
 Malta’s training facilities are “generally very good,” he says, and there have been moves to consolidate the progress through more professionalisation in the sector.
 The setting up of Malta’s first-ever national athletics team in 2020 is key to this, he believes. “This means that we now follow athletes throughout the year, not just at competition time,” he says.
 “We’ve started seeing some results in our strong performances at last year’s small nations games and in the recent European Team Championships.”
 But, he warns, this investment needs to be sustained over time, if we want to see the kind of improvements we expect.
 “And by sustaining the investment I don’t mean just throwing money at the problem, it’s about supporting new and emerging athletes to fulfil their potential.”

Malta's paralympic athletes on overcoming challenges as Games begin,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/i-person-i-challenges-i-faced.1097353,29-08-2024,"001875.png,001876.png,001877.png","Maja Theuma was born with achondroplasia, a bone growth disorder that results in dwarfism, yet as she grew up she did not let this discourage her, instead, it defined her.
 “Growing up, I saw the difference between myself and others, but that did not stop me from getting to where I am today,” Theuma told Times of Malta.
 “I am the person I am today because of the challenges I have been through,” she said.
  The 24-year-old is the first Maltese female para swimmer with achondroplasia and is participating at the 17th Summer Paralympics Games in Paris.
 The 2024 Paralympic Games kicked off yesterday evening and run until September 8.
 This is Malta’s 11th appearance at the games and the two athletes proudly waving the Maltese flag are swimmer Theuma and track athlete Antonio Flores.
 Theuma will today be competing in the 50-metre freestyle. Flores will be competing in the 100m and 200m races, scheduled between September 1 and 2.
 Times of Malta met up with the two athletes a few days before they headed to Paris.
 Maja began training professionally just seven years ago, and since then she has participated in numerous para swimming competitions abroad.
 She recalled how although her parents were divers and her brother a water polo player she would play tennis and football at a young age and didn’t show much interest in swimming.
 However, once her brother began professional training in water polo things changed. She started training in 2015 aged 15 and years later has never looked back. 
 “When I’m in the water, I am in my zone, I forget what is happening around me and just focus on my strokes.”
 Training for the games has been challenging, as Theuma trains 11 times a week – nine swimming sessions and two strength sessions.
 “I train twice or three times a day, and right now, every millisecond counts,” she said.
 “The training has been tough in the past few weeks, but the outcome is rewarding. The main aim is to stay focused on myself and my target and not let anything get in the way of that.”
  When asked what her target was for her race, she smiled and said that was a secret.
 This is not the first time Theuma trained to qualify for the Paralympic Games. During the 2020 COVID lockdown, the young swimmer trained in the sea on her own, yet she failed to qualify for the Tokyo 2020 Games.
 “It was challenging, especially because the games were postponed by a year and I spent so much time training on my own. So when I received the news I was upset,” she said.
 “But I believe everything happens for a reason, and now I have more experience going to Paris. I feel more prepared than before.”
 Theuma is not the only athlete who had their eyes on Tokyo 2020.
 A ‘veteran’ in the sport, Antonio Flores had his eyes set on participating in the Tokyo 2020 Games, yet had to pull out at the last minute after injuring his Achilles tendon.
 “It was very difficult to know I qualified, and at the end of one training session I hurt my leg and then had to drop out,” he said.
 The 34-year-old had first competed in the Beijing Paralympic Games with his club foot.
 “I can say that during that time, I stopped speaking to the athletics team and I stopped watching the sport. I just couldn’t do it at the time.”
 Once the Tokyo Games had passed, he began to heal mentally and began his journey to recovery.
 Now, he feels more prepared than ever to compete in Paris.
  “For Beijing, I was just 18, I could say I was immature and just four years in the sport. Now, I have grown, I know my body more and I am more aware of how to move with my blade. During this time in  Paris, I will appreciate the sport more.”
 The 34-year-old had first competed in the Beijing Paralympic Games with his club foot. His career took a halt when he began to feel pain in his right leg. The pain became unbearable, despite trying to run with a brace.
 “I had two options – either reduce my mobility or amputate my leg and lead more or less a normal life.”
 Flores became an amputee, and with strength and determination learnt how to walk, jog, run and sprint once again.
 “While running with a foot problem is very challenging, it is also the most rewarding,” he said.
 “When you are running, it’s not just an activity, it is spiritual. That moment you are in the air and your foot is about to touch the ground feels like you are flying. It is very difficult to explain the feeling.”
 He believes what he has achieved is a result of discipline and patience.
 “You might not see results overnight, but with discipline and patience, you will get to your goal. When I started running with a running blade, I would fall and struggle, but I always got back up.”
 When asked what his goals are for Paris, he said he did not want to put too much pressure on himself, but wanted to enjoy the games.

Works on €35m cycle network to begin in ‘coming months’,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/works-35m-cycle-network-begin-coming-months.1101360,22-11-2024,002566.png,"Works on the first phase of a €35 million national cycle network are set to begin in the “coming months” after a tender for the project was finally awarded.
 Once completed, the first part of the cycle network project (C-SAM) will enhance and establish new cycling and pedestrian routes connecting Msida, Pietà, Blata l-Bajda, Valletta and the Valletta waterfront.
 
 “Infrastructure Malta announced its recommendation to award a contract to RM Construction Ltd. The proposed contract is valued at €7,433,721.43,” a spokesperson for the government agency said.
 Times of Malta understands that the appeal period for rival bidders has ended, and RM’s bid is currently undergoing compliance checks. Works should begin once that is complete.
 “Works should begin in the coming months,” the Infrastructure Malta spokesperson said.
 The first phase of C-SAM was originally given an end-of-2024 deadline.
 In October 2022, Infrastructure Malta, under the direction of then transport minister Aaron Farrugia, announced a plan to build between 50 and 60 kilometres of cycling routes over five years.
 In April 2023, the Transport Ministry said that the first phase of the bicycle network project, C-SAM, would focus on the Grand Harbour area and should be completed by the end of 2024.
 Although a tender for the Grand Harbour project was issued later in 2023, sources indicated that it was not awarded due to a lack of compliant bidders.
 The agency issued another tender last June and applications closed in July.

Qala Saints FC and two players to be charged with match fixing,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/qala-saints-fc-two-players-charged-match-fixing.1093974,15-06-2024,004555.png,"A Gozitan football club and two players are to be charged with match-fixing by the Malta FA Integrity Unit.
 Qala Saints FC and its player Manuel Xerri, along with Żebbuġ Rovers goalkeeper Leonard Camilleri will be suspended by the MFA after being summoned to appear at a hearing about the incident. 
 It follows an investigation into the top-of-the-table clash in the GFA Division One between Nadur Youngsters and Qala Saints at the Gozo Stadium which ended in a 1-1 draw.
 MFA Integrity Officer Herman Mula confirmed that the “approach” happened before the direct clash between the two clubs on March 17. The Malta FA accused the club and the two footballers of attempting to bribe the Nadur Youngsters player.
 Nadur Youngsters went on to win the GFA Division One title when they finished two points clear of Qala Saints at the top of the standings.
 Mula said Xerri and Camilleri will be facing match-fixing charges while Qala Saints have also been accused as the approach was allegedly masterminded by one of their players in a bid to help his own club.
 Xerri, Camilleri and the club Qala Saints are expected to appear in front of the Malta FA’s Board Control Disciplinary and Ethics Committee on Wednesday to respond to the accusations.
 The charges followed an investigation conducted by both the Malta Police Force and the Malta FA Integrity Office.
 “I can confirm that the Malta FA Integrity Unit has just issued charges against two players, Leonard Camilleri and Manuel Xerri, as well as Division One side Qala Saints, which club is carried in liability by their player’s actions following an attempt to bribe a Nadur Youngsters player,” Mula said.
 “As part of the usual proceedings in such cases, both Camilleri and Xerri have been temporarily suspended from any football activity until the hearing is heard in front of the MFA board.”
 The MFA Integrity Officer said Xerri and Camilleri are also expected to face bribery charges in front of the Criminal Courts in the coming weeks and could face a prison sentence if found guilty under the Law of Manipulation of Sport.

Shooters escorted off KM Malta flight after pilot rejects airguns in hold,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/shooters-escorted-off-km-malta-flight-pilot-rejects-airguns-hold.1092744,20-05-2024,"004727.png,004728.png","Four Maltese shooters were escorted off a KM Malta Airlines flight on Sunday after the pilot refused to carry their airguns, despite them having the necessary paperwork.
 The members of Malta Allied Airgunners Club (MAAC) were on board the plane to travel home at 8.30pm after taking part in a competition in Belgium when their problems began. 
 “Over the years, we have travelled with AirMalta (former national airline) for different shooting competitions, and this is the first time we ever had issues,” Natal Falzon, one of the shooters, told Times of Malta. 
 “This happened because the pilot refused to have weapons on his plane, despite us having all the paperwork and permits in order. He said ‘his plane, his call, no guns’.”
 The shooters had faced no problems when they flew from Malta to Brussels for the Mamba Target Open in Grupont.
 An airgun fires pellets using compressed air and does not operate with gunpowder. Falzon explained how before every flight, the group decompressed the pressure of the gun before packing it and the pellets in their suitcase to be placed in the hold luggage.  
 They had taken their seats on the flight when the commotion began.
  “We had all the paperwork on our end, yet once the pilot found out weapons were going to be placed on the plane, he decided he did not want our weapons on his plane,” he explained. 
 The ground crew and airport security were also roped into the incident after the pilot requested a specific document from the Brussels Airport to show such weapons were allowed on the plane. Falzon said the security and ground crew staff said they did not know of such a document.
 Despite this, the pilot insisted that no weapons were to board the plane. 
 “We told him that we had everything in order, we had all the police permits, all the forms necessary and followed the necessary procedures to take our airguns on the plane,” he said, yet the pilot did not want the weapons on the plane. 
  Falzon said the Malta Allied Airgunners Club has travelled numerous times with the national airline to compete in competitions abroad in countries like Bulgaria and the UK.
 ""The pilot told us to get off the plane, but we said we were not planning to do so, we had paid and booked everything six months in advance,"" he said.
 By then security and police staff arrived on the plane, and Falzon said the pilot reported him and his colleagues to the police.
 By the end, the group got off the plane as they could not leave their airguns unattended. 
 ""When we got off the plane, everyone was very helpful to us, the ground crew, the consultant, who was on the phone with us for over 30 minutes trying to solve the situation,"" he said.
 He said KM Malta Airlines also reached out to the group, covering their expenses for a flight back to Malta on Monday evening. 
 ""Everyone went out of their way to help us, the situation was created by one man, who was anti-gun and decided he did not want weapons on his plane,"" he said. 
 In a one-line response, KM Malta Airlines said: ""All was sorted out with the passengers early this morning.""

  The Spartans, under the charge of Luciano Zauri, needed a win to assure themselves of mathematical certainty to secure the Premier League title and the Reds turned on the style with a rampant display.
  Playing in front of the biggest crowd of the season, where over 8,000 fans thronged the National Stadium, Ħamrun Spartans took the lead after eight minutes when Seth Paintsil headed the ball home from a Ryan Camenzuli’s cross.
  Floriana looked rattled and Paintsil went on to bag his hat-trick when he was first to the rebound from Luke Montebello’s cross to fire home and then he was played in by Jonny to slide the ball into the net.
 Elionay killed off the match as a contest with a fourth goal in first-half stoppage time.
  Paintsil was not finished yet and midway through the second half he grabbed his fifth goal to kickstart the Ħamrun Spartans title party.

"Marsa racetrack is a danger to horses, say horse owners",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/marsa-racetrack-danger-horses-say-horse-owners.1097769,09-08-2024,"005344.png,005345.png,005346.png,005347.png,005348.png","The Marsa horse racing track is in “the worst state ever” and poses a danger to horses, according to their owners, five years after a pledge to transform the venue into a state-of-the-art equestrian centre. 
 Gravel, rather than pure sand, has been spread on the racetrack, leading to concerns about injuries to horses due to compete in just a few weeks.
 Other facilities, including the paddock and the old racecourse cannot be used because they are full of rubble.
  The track, managed by Equidrome Malta and run by Malta Race Track Limited, also lacks essential infrastructure, horse owners say. 
 There are no working generators, meaning night-time races are at risk of being plunged into darkness should there be a power outage. Damaged canopies, supposed to shelter horses from the sun, are also on the brink of collapse. 
 Times of Malta visited the venue after being contacted by furious horse owners, frustrated over the dilapidated state of the track that has been hosting racing since 1869. 
  The conditions come despite promises made five years ago by the government and Malta Racing Club for a €28 million project to transform the area into an international equestrian sport centre by 2023.
 Horse owners said they were told in June that the summer championships could not be held this year to allow work to begin on the regeneration project.
 “We love to race but we still accepted their decision to take a few weeks’ break, particularly given the very hot climatic conditions we had this summer,” a horse racing owner said.
 “But unfortunately, no work has been done to improve the facilities. The facilities are at their worse state ever and I am seriously fearing the wellbeing of my horse.”
  The owner added that the paddock had been closed off after being filled with rubble. 
 “This means that during the 20-minute period between one race and another you have 16 horses which do not have any area to wait before the start of their race.” 
 He said a canopy to protect drivers and horses from the rain and sun has been severely damaged and there is danger that it could collapse and injure someone.
 The horse racing owners complained that sand was brought in to cover the racetrack a few weeks ago but “they brought the wrong kind of sand as it’s full of gravel.”
 Another owner claimed that when the mistake was realised, fresh sand was ordered but it was “mixed with the wrong one and put on the racing track with the result that horses will race on a surface full of gravel with a major risk of injury as could end up with a stone in their nails posing serious consequences.”
 The absence of a backup power source is another pressing issue. 
 “If there is a power cut at the Marsa racing track during a race at night, drivers and horses are put at a major risk of getting seriously hurt,” the owners said.
 The old racecourse situated behind the racetrack is also unavailable for drivers and owners as tons of rubble have been dumped along the course, leaving no space for drivers to run their horses.
 A news conference in Castille in 2019 had promised that the consortium would transform the horse racing track into an international sport centre within four years.
 The project was not just to regenerate the racetrack and the existing polo pitch but was also to include facilities for different equestrian sports including flat racing, horse shows and events. Modern stabling facilities were also promised, along with training and rehab facilities that would ensure the welfare and well-being of the horses.
 There were also plans for the stables of Sheikh al Makhtum of Dubai to organise races for horses brought over from Dubai to run in Malta.
  Horse racing owners also complained that they have little incentive to be successful in the local scene as the prize money on offer is exceptionally low compared to foreign competitions.
 
 “In Malta if you win a premier class race, which is the highest division, you pocket €600. In France, if you win a low-key race you take home €7,000. Of more concern is that in Malta you wait for months to be given the money you have won.
 “Despite all this we are still driven by our passion for the sport, and we still invest in buying new horses even though we have very little return,” one owner said.
 Times of Malta has sent questions to the track management and the sports ministry.

'I knew something was wrong moments before race': devastated Olympian Sasha Gatt,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/sasha-gatt-devastating-covid-diagnosis.1096127,31-07-2024,005571.png,"Sasha Gatt realised ""something was wrong"" moments before a race she had spent three years preparing for, the ""devastated"" two-time Olympian said on Wednesday.
 The Maltese swimmer was speaking to Times of Malta hours after testing positive for COVID-19 at the Paris Olympics.
 ""I was devastated because I've been training for three years, including six months in Romania away from family and friends,"" the 19-year-old said.
 Gatt is one of five athletes representing Malta in the Olympic Games.
 Lining up in the first heat of the race, Gatt was up against two other swimmers, namely Singapore’s Ching Hwenn Gan and Chile’s Kristel Kobrich. 
 Gan dominated the race from start to finish as she cruised home in 16.10.13, while Gatt finished a distant third with a time of 17.00.54.
 Gatt's time was over 22 seconds slower than her national record of 16.38.75, which she set in Rome in 2021. Minutes after competing in the 1,500m freestyle heats at the Paris La Defense Arena on Tuesday, she tested positive for COVID-19.
 Despite the race's results and her COVID diagnosis, Gatt said she was ""over the moon"" about the experience and the opportunity to be among the world's best athletes.
 ""I will now focus on my health, get back into training and support Team Malta for the rest of the games.""
 Gatt recalled how moments before she dived into the pool she started to feel unwell.
 She found it ""harder to breathe than usual"" while warming-up for the race.
 “It felt like my throat was closing up, however, I just thought it was the excitement of the race and I just decided to ignore it.”
 Gatt recalled her heart beating ""super fast"" and feeling overwhelmed with excitement.
 ""Hearing the massive crowd cheering gave me goosebumps, and filled me with encouragement to give the best performance of my life.
 ""The moment the arena went quiet, I knew it was time to go and all I thought about was just me, my lane and the race ahead of me.""
 When the race kicked off, adrenaline took over, but after 400m, she found it more difficult to breathe.
 ""I believe everything happens for a reason, and I'm incredibly grateful for every opportunity that comes my way, "" Gatt said, adding that she will never forget the experience.
 ""If you're not winning, you're learning,"" she added. 
 This was Gatt’s only assignment at the 2024 games.
 She had participated in Tokyo in 2021 as one of the youngest Maltese athletes.
  Shooter Gianluca Chetcuti made his debut at the Paris 2024 Games in the Men's Skeet competition. 
 The competition consisted of two days of qualifying events.
 On the first day, shooters participated in three rounds of 25 shots each, for a maximum of 75 targets. On that day,  Chetcuti finished in 28th place with 69 targets hit.
 On the second day (Tuesday) he shot a straight 25 round. In the second and final round of the day, Chetcuti missed three shots to hit 22 each time. 
 He failed to qualify for the final round.
 Judoka Katryna Esposito put on a fighting performance on her Olympic debut on Saturday, but she lost to her competitor Mongolian judoka Bavuudorjiin Baasankhüü.

 Endurance athlete Neil Agius climbed a beach ladder unaided at Għar Lapsi at 9.40pm on Monday, completing a world record 140km non-stop swim, around Malta, Gozo and Comino. 
 A large crowd burst into long applause as the 38-year-old walked to a chair, waving to well-wishers after having surpassed his own world record distance of 125.7km achieved in 2021. 
 ""It was not a swim for me, it was a swim for Malta,"" Agius said in a short comment, looking remarkably well after having been in the water for three days and three nights.
  Belgian ultra-athlete Matthieu Bonne swam 131km around Greece in 60 hours and 55 minutes last year, but his record has not yet been officially verified.
 Doctors quickly checked Agius before he walked up the slipway amid the continued cheers of the crowd. Those welcoming him included Prime Minister Robert Abela and MPs from both sides of the political aisle. European Parliament president Roberta Metsola in a Facebook post said this was a superhuman feat and Neil Agius was ""The personification of ‘Never Give Up’. An inspiration to all of us.""
  His swim will now have to be ratified by the World Open Water Swimming Association, the governing body that oversees this ultra-endurance sport.  
  Agius kicked off his attempt on Saturday at Mellieħa’s Għadira Bay shortly after 9am. 
 At 2pm on Sunday, he had swam clockwise around Malta, made it to Gozo and was rounding the sister island, en-route back to Malta.
 By 7.45am on Monday he had completed 75% of the planned swim.
 He was cheered along by supporters on a small flotilla of boats.  
  Agius set his own record back in 2021, when he swam from Linosa to Malta for a distance of 125.7km and finished in Xlendi, Gozo. 
 This was Agius’ first attempt at breaking that record after he was forced to abandon a similar swim in Spain last year. 
  Agius used the swim to raise awareness about the state of Malta’s marine habitat in collaboration with NGO Wave of Change and marine clean-up specialists Żibel.
 Żibel coordinated three coastal clean-ups during the swim, with a third and final one planned for Monday postponed due to bad weather. So far the collaboration has seen some 790kg of marine waste collected by volunteers who gathered in Spinola Bay, St Julian’s on Saturday, and St Thomas Bay, Marsascala, on Sunday.  
 The public was also invited to collect waste on their own and deposit it in specialised Żibel bins located across the country.   
 All waste collected will be sorted and the aim is to use them to power fully-circular projects.

"Maltese buyer pays record €740,000 for French race horse",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/maltese-buyer-pays-record-740000-french-race-horse.1097366,29-08-2024,006918.png,"Maltese horse racing owner Steve Farrugia has paid a record €740,000 for a yearling trotter in France. 
 The horse, Nodessa Josselyn, a daughter of two Prix D’Amerique winners Ready Cash and Bellina Josselyn, was bought on Wednesday. 
 It is the highest amount paid for a yearling trotter in the history of horse racing in Europe.
 The record deal was completed during the Argana Yearling Sales at the Deuville ring on Wednesday by French trainers Christophe and Vincent Martens as representatives of the Maltese stable headed by Farrugia.
 The previous record on the Deuville ring was held in this yearling category by Hunter Valley who had posted €400,000 in 2018.
 Trainer Vincent Martens was left speechless at the successful bid.
 “I didn’t expect that. We had set a price and Christophe managed it over the phone with the client,” he said.
 “It’s a great honour to take part in this adventure. She’s a unique being, we had to pay the price. I hope she’ll do well in the race... That’ll be my job, by the way (laughs).”
 Christophe Martens said Farrugia was determined to secure Nodessa Joselyn who he described its pedigree as ""the stuff of dreams"".
 “It’s a crazy price. We’re feeling a bit nervous right now,” Christophe Martens said.
 “We have a client who owns a big company in Malta, with whom we’ve had a recent success, and he wanted the top. We had talked about a limit of €600,000 but he also wanted me to call him during the auction and he didn’t stop. It’s his decision.
 “We’re proud and happy while realizing the responsibility that now falls on us. The pressure is going to be there, but we’re going to have to go to sleep, it’s not going to be easy.
 “She’s magnificent. Her pedigree is the stuff of dreams. We’ll see if we can go to the Prix d'Amerique with her or her products in the future. It’s a big investment. But the priority, right now, is to insure her!”
 It is understood that Nodessa Joselyn will not be racing in Malta but its owners are planning to compete in the French scene, and the deal is a further confirmation that Maltese horse racing owners are keen to invest huge sums on horses in countries like France and the Scandinavian countries.
 Nodessa Josselyn is the daughter of two legendary horses in Ready Cash and Bellina Josselyn.
 Trained by owner Philippe Allaire and Thierry Duvaldestin during his racing career, Ready Cash won 40 of 70 races and had a lifetime earning of €4,282,300.
 He was the richest French trotter in history at the time of his retirement.
 The son of Indy De Vive-Kidea won the prestigious Prix d'Amérique in 2011 and 2012 and was also a two-time winner of the Group I Prix De France and champion of the Prix de Paris along with numerous other graded stakes.
 On the other hand, Bellina Josselyn is a also Prix D’Amerique winner and boasts a lifetime earning of €2,686,170.

Gharb football committee resigns after mayor leases ground to rivals,theshiftnews,https://theshiftnews.com/2024/06/12/gharb-football-committee-resigns-after-mayor-leases-ground-to-rivals/,12-06-2024,"000562.png,000563.png,000564.png","A second-division football club in Gozo, Gharb Rangers FC, cannot use its football ground facilities following a decision by the locality’s mayor, David Apap, to lease the ground to football rivals, Victoria Hotspurs FC.
 This decision led to the mass resignation of the Gharb Rangers committee, which said the locality’s mayor did not even inform them about leasing their ground. The Gharb football team currently has nowhere to train and risks being disbanded.
 In their resignation letter, sent to the Gozo Football Association (GFA), the committee members, led by President Joe Cauchi, informed the association they were leaving the club because the mayor decided to lease their facilities to a “third party.”
 Without mentioning Victoria Hotspurs by name, the committee informed the GFA that the mayor did not even consult them on this move and that they ended up without their training ground. This has made their club’s situation impossible to manage.
 Contacted by The Shift, Gharb Rangers President Joe Cauchi confirmed that his club could not use its football ground as Mayor Apap leased it out to football rivals.
 “I have nothing to add to the statement. There is no football club any longer, as all the committee members resigned. We don’t know why the mayor took this decision and for whose benefit. We don’t know anything,” the club president said.
 When asked who owns the ground, the President said it was the property of the local council but has been managed by the football club for years.
 When contacted by The Shift, Mayor David Apap did not want to answer any questions by phone and asked for them to be emailed. The Shift has not yet received his replies to questions sent in writing.
 Sources told The Shift that while Victoria Hotspurs – the Gozo capital’s football team – already had their facilities, they have turned their ground into a parking lot.
 To compensate for their ‘lack’ of facilities, they have now leased the Gharb Rangers ground, locking out the team to which the facilities originally belonged.
 The sources said this latest development was only possible through the intervention of Mayor David Apap.
 This is not the first time Gharb’s mayor, one of the longest-serving in Gozo, has made headlines. In 2013, PN Mayor David Apap, together with his brother Francis, was arraigned in court accused of criminal offences, including usury and money laundering.
 After being forced to resign from the PN, he stayed on as an independent local councillor. Subsequently, he contested the local council elections as an independent through a new political grouping – l-Ewwel l-Gharb – and has been re-elected as mayor ever since.
 Apap denies the criminal charges, but the proceedings remain ongoing in the Gozo Courts.

Neil Agius given hero’s welcome after gruelling 140km swim sets new world record,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/national/131348/neil_agius_given_heros_welcome_after_gruelling_140km_swim_sets_new_world_record,23-09-2024,000373.png,"Ultra-endurance athlete and clean seas activist Neil Agius swam some 140km for 60 hours around Malta and Gozo to set a new world record. 
 On Monday night, Agius swam through a rough swell into Għar Lapsi, the south-west of the island, shortly after 9.30 pm, visibly exhausted but buoyed by the cheers of hundreds of supporters who gathered for the end of the ‘Small Island, Big Swim’ challenge.
  He staggered up a ladder out of the water, unaided, as the crowd waited in still silence until he eventually made it to his feet.
 Medical responders crowded to cover him in blankets and give him a medical exam. 
 He was greeted by dignitaries, including Prime Minister Robert Abela, sports minister Clifton Grima, and Opposition Whip David Agius.
 The swim will now have to be ratified by the World Open Water Swimming Association, the governing body that oversees this ultra endurance sport.  
 Agius set off from Għadira Bay, Mellieħa, shortly after 9am on Saturday morning. 
 From there he swam out from the bay accompanied by a squad of young swimmers and a team of support crew that included skippers, medical staff, and several other volunteers. 
 He then headed southeast and swam along a route that wraps clockwise around Malta.
 He swam throughout the night, and on Sunday he circumnavigated Gozo before heading back to Malta. 
 Off the coast of Marsaxlokk, after 52 hours of continuous swimming, he smashed through the previous world record of 125km which he himself had set back in 2021. 
 Throughout the final leg of the swim, weather conditions deteriorated and became tricky with outbursts of rain, strong currents, winds, and an increasing sea swell. 
 All these made this a far more challenging swim than in previous attempts.
 Neil had already set a world record when he swam from Linosa to Malta covering a distance of 125.7km in 2021. That swim had also taken 52 hours.  
 Since then, there have been several attempts but no one has managed to break this record officially.
 This is Agius’s first attempt at breaking the record after he was forced to abandon a similar swim in Spain last year. 
 At the time he had been forced to leave the water after having been  surrounded by a massive swarm of jellyfish.  
 Since then he has been training, and said ahead of this swim that he felt he was stronger than ever and prepared for the challenge.  
 Agius used the swim to raise awareness about the state of Malta’s marine habitat in collaboration with NGO Wave of Change and marine clean-up specialists Żibel.
 Żibel coordinated three coastal clean ups during the swim, with a third and final on planned for Monday postponed due to bad weather.

"Record beaten: Neil Agius swims past his own world-record distance of 125 km, sets target for 160km - The Malta Independent ",independent,https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2024-09-23/local-news/Record-beaten-Neil-Agius-swims-past-his-own-world-record-distance-of-125-km-sets-target-for-160km-6736264341,23-09-2024,000377.png,"
                
        

         Ultra-endurance athlete and clean seas activist Neil Agius has surpassed his own world record distance by swimming a total of 125 km, but plans on completing another 40 km before leaving the water.
 Agius hit the 125 km mark shortly after 12.30pm on Monday, surpassing the world record distance which he himself had set back in 2021.
 He hit the distance as he swam along the southern coast near Marsaxlokk after 52 hours in the water. In order for his distance to be confirmed he needs to swim to shore and leave the water on his own, but Agius is aiming to swim a total of 160km.  Agius has been swimming for roughly two and a half days (52 hours), having departed from Mellie ħ a Bay shortly after 9am on Saturday morning. He swam out from the bay accompanied by a squad of young swimmers and a team of support crew that included skippers, medical staff, and several other volunteers.
 He then headed southeast and swam along a route that wraps clockwise around Malta. On Sunday, he circumnavigated Gozo before heading back to Malta.
 You can track Agius' progress in realtime, here.
 Support staff said Neil is in good spirits, but faces a challenging final stretch. Weather conditions are delicate and there is an increasing swell in the sea as well as some rain and wind, which is far more challenging than in previous swim attempts.
 In order to complete the full 160km, Agius will have to swim along the eastern coast of Malta, which presents limited opportunities for Agius to make landfall. The athlete needs to leave the sea via land in order for his swim to be considered complete.
 If he enters one of the support vessels he will have forfeited the swim.
 Neil set a world record when he swam from Linosa to Malta covering a distance of 125.7km in 2021. That swim had also taken 52 hours. Since then, there have been several attempts but no one has managed to break this record officially.
 This is Agius' first attempt at breaking the record after he was forced to abandon a similar swim in Spain last year.
 Lead partner, GO are powering the swim and all Neil's endeavours for the next three years. The Small Island, Big Swim is also supported by VisitMalta, Atlas Insurance and Cisk 0.0, as well as Kia, Garmin and Maypole.

  On 5 September, MGRM launches the exhibition ‘The First Walk Under the Rainbow’ at the Malta Postal Museum and Arts Hub in Archbishop Street, Valletta. The exhibition will feature the memories shared by 12 people who either organised or were present in the first Pride march twenty years ago.
 Their memories will be illustrated by a series of portraits and anecdotes, alongside archival material that will be displayed in the exhibition that will run until the 14 September 2024.
 The interviews narrate the run-up to the Pride march, and the way organisers managed to bring together a small group of activists, allies, politicians and members of the community in a day that made history.
 Alongside the exhibition, MGRM is also launching a new publication sharing the same name of the exhibition, which collects the interviews of the same individuals who feature in the exhibition.
 The exhibition is curated by Francesca Zammit. Ascend Creative Studio and Johann Agius were the creative minds behind the interviews, videos and photography. The exhibition also includes photos by Alan Carville and archival photography from MGRM’s own archives. The designs featured in the exhibition, publication and videos are by Adam Brimmer. The project was managed by Robert Attard, MGRM's Community & Outreach Officer.
 The project has been funded through the Voluntary Organisations Project Scheme managed by The Malta Council for the Voluntary Sector supported by the Ministry for Inclusion and the Voluntary Sector.  ",Matthew Vella ,Sports

Detailed plans to expand on ‘master plan’ for motorsports racetrack in the pipeline - MMF president - The Malta Independent ,independent,https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2023-08-25/local-news/Detailed-plans-to-expand-on-master-plan-for-motorsports-racetrack-in-the-pipeline-MMF-president-6736254338,25-08-2023,007506.png,"

 Detailed plans to expand on a ‘master plan’ for a motorsports racetrack in Hal Far are in the pipeline, President of the Malta Motorsport Federation (MMF) Duncan Micallef has told The Malta Independent.
 Discussions on the development of a racetrack up to international standard have been ongoing for years, and Prime Minister Robert Abela in 2021 announced intentions to plan and develop a racetrack in Hal-Far. 
 Included in these plans was also the intention to upgrade existing racing circuits in the area. 
 The Malta Independent reached out to Micallef to ask for an update about the racetrack plans and also about a planning application filed earlier this year that would see upgrades made to the existing drag race track. 
 Asked about the drag strip, Micallef explained that the existing drag strip is not homologated to European standards. He said that this investment is intended to get the strip up to FIA homologation standards to open up the possibility of hosting international events on the track. “Amongst them, as we have been promised by FIA themselves, is to be part of the European Championship calendar.”
 Asked about the likely duration of these works, Micallef said that if everything goes as planned, the work on the drag strip should begin in December and take no longer than 10 months to be completed. “I'm calculating that as long as nothing happens and everything goes well, we should be finished by Q3 next year.”
 Micallef said that the quarter mile track, the karting track and the proposed race track would collectively be double the area of the Ta Qali stadium and adjacent football training grounds combined in terms of scale, making it one of the most expansive development projects in Malta.
 Moving on to the topic of the racetrack, Micallef said that they have appointed the best designers in the world to work on the project. “We already paid half their contract free, so we’re in a very advanced state right now. You could say we’re in a position where we can send the detailed application as well.” He said that there is already an overall “master plan” for the area and that they are currently in the process of preparing a more detailed plan. “The master plan was submitted in 2021. Now we’re looking to file more detailed applications.”
 This newsroom did not find a planning application for a master plan on the Planning Authority's Geoserver. 
 However an application with the Environment and Resources Authority (ERA) to determine whether an Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) would be required for the racetrack project had been filed. The ERA website lists that no such EIA is required, but the current status is listed as “awaiting further updates.”
 As for the application to upgrade the drag strip in particular, the planning application was updated on the 26th of January.
 “One needs to understand that this is not a simple process,” said the MMF President, “I’m involved in property development and I know what it requires.” He said that those who complain do so because they do not understand the process and added that those involved in the field understand the process they are going through. “In development, the more time goes on, the more complicated it gets … Nowadays even to build a block of flats is difficult, imagine a project like this.”
 Regarding potential objections to the development, he said that the project is moving along according to policies. “We applied for the permits. I don’t imagine that because we’re doing things according to permits and policies they’re going to be against it now, when this area has existed for 40 years.”
 Micallef concluded by saying that motorsport enthusiasts are in support of MMF’s work. “What we do is for them, I'm a volunteer. If there is someone more capable than me then he'll take my place, in the end it's not mine. This is something we do for our children.”

MFA insists it is distinct entity from Malta Premier League after Muscat charges,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/national/129148/mfa_insists_it_is_distinct_entity_from_malta_premier_league_after_muscat_charges,14-05-2024,"007873.png,007874.png","The Malta Football Association insisted it is a distinct entity from the Malta Premier League when asked whether it is concerned over developments surrounding the latter’s chairman – Joseph Muscat.
 “The Malta Premier League (MPL), whilst being a grouping representing a number of MFA members (Premier League clubs), is not a member of the MFA itself, and it is therefore an independent body,” an MFA spokesperson told this newspaper.
 Muscat will later this month be charged with accepting bribes, corruption in public office, money laundering and being part of a criminal organisation in relation to the Vitals hospitals deal.
 After exiting politics, Muscat went on to become the chairperson of the newly founded Malta Premier League, which brings together the topflight football clubs.
  “The Malta FA is indeed in the process of setting up a new commercial entity with MPL, which entity is distinct of any of its shareholders,” the MFA spokesperson added.
 Questions on whether the MFA will seek to revise it collaboration with the MPL considering the charges, remained unanswered.
 Similarly, questions to the MPL as to whether Muscat will be suspending himself, and whether the MPL board feels comfortable working with him, remained unanswered.
 The Malta FA and the MPL will jointly manage a newly established company tasked with organising the Premier League for five consecutive football seasons starting from 2024/25.
 The MPL was officially established in August of last year, building on its earlier version, the Malta Professional Football Clubs Association.
 A few weeks later, in October 2022, it was recognised by the Malta FA’s Executive Board as the organisation representing clubs playing in the highest tier of the National Championship.
 In November 2022, the MPL became an official affiliate of the European Leagues (EL), the organisation that brings together the professional football leagues in Europe. Since then, the MPL engaged in constant dialogue with the Malta FA, to deliver a more attractive, competitive, and sustainable Premier League.
 Kevin Deguara case to be assessed by MFA ethics committee after charges 
 Among those facing criminal charges in the Vitals case is Żabbar St Patrick FC President Kevin Deguara. The club was promoted to the premier division from the Challenge League this season.
 A lawyer by profession, Deguara’s company, DF Advocates was involved in a number of deals undertaken by the Labour government since 2013. According to his Facebook profile, he is a director at the American Univeristy of Malta, The Convenience Shop and Dizz Group.
  This newspaper reached out to the MFA to ask whether the criminal charges filed against Deguara could land the football club in trouble with MFA regulations
 “The Association’s Reputational Risk Management Policy states that insofar as cases relating to officers of a member, the matter should be assessed by the Ethics and Compliance committee, and following its recommendation the matter will be discussed and finally determined by the Executive Committee,” the MFA spokesperson said.
 Once formal notification is served onto all concerned, the established procedure will regulate the steps to be taken.
 “In any case, any decision taken shall be at such a stage of a precautionary nature, and a final decision shall be taken once all criminal proceedings are final and binding,” the MFA added.  ",Karl Azzopardi ,Football
