‘Fight for equality far from over’ - Gay rights movement celebrates Pride,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/fight-equality-far-over-gay-rights-movement-celebrates-pride.1098112,14-09-2024,"001851.png,001852.png","Malta’s LGBTIQ community still faces challenges despite the progress seen in recent years, the Malta LGBTIQ Rights Movement said on Saturday.
 “We have achieved a lot in 20 years, but laws don’t transform society overnight, and they are not enjoyed by all,” said MGRM co-coordinator Cynthia Chircop in a speech at Valletta’s Malta Pride Concert.
 She told audience members that since the organisation’s first pride march, the group had continued to garner support and “pride kept growing and change happened.”
 But despite the progress, the community was still facing discrimination at work and when accessing government services, “and the Equality Act has not been mentioned since the last election"", said Chircop.
 She said in Malta the LGBTIQ community was “still waiting for a new sexual health policy to tackle many issues including contraceptives, STIs [sexually transmitted infections] and education”.
 Meanwhile, free access to medicines used to prevent HIV (‘PrEP’ and ‘PEP’) “remains an electoral promise”, she said.
 “Over a year later, the gender clinic still does not have a psychiatrist, affecting trans [transgender] healthcare. LGBTIQ asylum seekers lack access to legal support, are rejected as unfounded or for lack of evidence and risk violence in detention and open centres.""
  Chircop said public incidents of harassment or assault were still being reported, while ""people still question our right to have a family.”
 Pointing to a lack of representation, she said children in LGBTIQ families “feel invisible at school because they don’t see families like theirs anywhere” while bullying and a lack of state support were realities for those in the community.
 Calling bigotry “hard to eradicate”, Chircop signalled the movement’s support for LGBTIQ communities in other countries facing private and state persecution.
 “We march for a future where everyone, regardless of who they are or who they love, can live freely and without fear,” she said.
 “The fight for equality is far from over, and our presence is a reminder to all that we are here, we are queer, we are proud of it, and we are not going anywhere.”
 Chircop thanked the late former PN MP Karl Gouder for ""being vocal in the journey towards marriage equality"" and Nicky Sansone, the inspirational 55-year-old who  died last month following a public battle with cancer.
 She also thanked activist organisations including Moviment Graffitti, Drachma, Aditus, LGBTI+ Gozo, Checkpoint Malta and ARC.
 In a similar call on Friday, Moviment Graffitti said the government should take pride month as an opportunity to help address pending issues faced by the LGBTIQ community and not only stand and march with them.
 Malta Pride started on Friday September 6 and closes Sunday.

'Who will fly our national colours?' Archbishop warns on Malta’s low birth rate,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/who-fly-national-colours-archbishop-warns-malta-low-birth-rate.1102395,13-12-2024,,"Archbishop Charles Scicluna marked the 50th anniversary of Malta becoming a Republic by addressing the country’s declining fertility rate and questioning who would “represent Malta’s identity and fly our national colours” when his generation dies. 
 Delivering a homily at St John’s Co-Cathedral, Scicluna recalled how in 1964, the year Malta gained Independence, Malta’s birth rate was 2.74. In 1974, when Malta became a Republic, it was 2.08. 
 Now, in 2024, Malta has the lowest fertility rate in the EU, with a birth rate of 1.08. Experts forecast that the already low fertility rate will  continue to shrink in the years to come.
 “Malta’s current birth rate is so low, that it is below replacement level,” Scicluna said.
  “We need to think about the roots and causes of this downward trend, and in the interest of our heritage and the preservation of our ethnicity, we need to be proactive in promoting the blessing of offspring to our families.”
 He prayed to God to grant Malta the “blessing of new births in our beloved and sweet land”.
 Scicluna noted how this year’s budget has tried to address the issue and encourage young couples to plan their future and fulfil their “natural vocation” to become mothers and fathers of the country’s future generations. 
 This year’s budget - among other measures - includes a €1,500 one-time payment for the third and every subsequent child, a boost in marriage tax credit and a €250 increase in child allowance.
  Scicluna said measures such as providing fair wages and affordable housing would encourage families to thrive and grow.
 “For what would the Republic have achieved if it makes economic progress and reforms its institutions but does not provide for the gift of future generations,” he asked. 
 ""Who will be there to represent Malta’s identity and fly our national colours when our generation fades away? Who will be there to proudly declare this island as a sweet homeland that cherishes its identity and serves as a haven for the life and love and its people?""
 He concluded his homily by appealing to the people to pray that future descendants will be there when the time comes ""for us to hand over the baton"".
  Scicluna also expressed gratitude for the country’s achievements over the past 50 years and paid tribute to contributions by politicians, public servants, judiciary, army and law enforcement.
 “We should recognise the ever-growing role of civil society and the important contributions of non-governmental organisations in several areas ranging from social services to human rights, to the environment and justice,” he added.
  He also honoured the legacy of Sir Anthony Mamo, Malta’s first president, and commended his successors for upholding the dignity of the office.
 Pontifical Mass was attended by President Myriam Spiteri Debono, Prime Minister Robert Abela, his wife Lydia Abela, Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech, his wife AnneMarie Grech, and other ministers.

Local shortages of ADHD medicines posing serious challenges to sufferers,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/local-shortages-adhd-medicines-posing-serious-challenges-sufferers.1102508,17-12-2024,"002083.png,002084.png","Psychiatrists have voiced “serious concerns” about the limited availability and choice of ADHD medication in Malta, in the context of a global shortage of these essential treatments. 
 Psychiatrist Rosemarie Sacco, president of the Association for Child and Adolescent Mental Health (ACAMH), said this shortfall was adversely affecting the treatment and well-being of individuals with ADHD, both children and adults. 
 Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder typically diagnosed in childhood but that persists into adulthood. It is characterised by difficulties with sustaining attention, emotion regulation, excessive activity, and impulse control. Medication often plays a crucial role in managing these symptoms effectively.
 In Malta, around five per cent of children have a diagnosis of ADHD. However, at present, the country’s government formulary offers a narrow range of treatment options.
 The main medications available locally are methylphenidate-based stimulants and atomoxetine, but both are in short supply. The government formulary includes only a 10mg preparation for immediate-release methylphenidate.
 Additionally, for prolonged-release methylphenidate, the formulary offers only a limited selection of dosages – specifically 18mg, 27mg, and 36mg – each available only under specific circumstances.
 The problem of limited options is compounded by the current global shortage of these same medications, making it even more challenging for psychiatrists to find the right medication and dosage for individuals with ADHD, she explained.
 “Having access to a variety of medication types allows for a more personalised approach to treatment, which is essential for effective management of ADHD,” Sacco said.
 But, up till now, several essential medications like guanfacine, Adderall, dexedrine, and lisdexamfetamine are completely unavailable. 
 These medications are crucial for treating ADHD because they provide different mechanisms of action and benefits, which can be better suited to meet individual patient needs. The lack of diverse treatment options can make it difficult to find effective management strategies for individuals living with ADHD.
  Moreover, “alternatives to the currently available preparations of methylphenidate are critical”, added psychiatrist Daniel Vella Fondacaro.
 For instance, short-acting medications like Ritalin typically require administration during school hours, as their effects only last for about four hours. This can pose challenges for children who need to take medication at school.
 In contrast, longer-acting options may help children manage their ADHD symptoms throughout the school day without needing to take medication while there.
 This flexibility allows treatment plans that better align with each child’s unique lifestyle and daily schedule, ultimately improving their behaviour and ability to focus during school. 
 Concerta is a long-acting methylphenidate that starts working about an hour after you take it and can help manage symptoms for up to 12 hours. However, in Malta, Concerta is not widely available through the government formulary system, which tends to focus on generic versions of medications. 
 Before the current shortage of methylphenidate, Concerta was only accessible to a limited number of individuals who had it prescribed before 2021.
 Since then, “newly diagnosed patients have not been automatically entitled to receive Concerta, meaning they would have to pay a significant amount out of pocket for it”, said Nigel Camilleri, the psychiatrist founder of ACAMH-Malta, who was also sharing his personal experience as a parent. 
  “While generics can be good alternatives in some situations, they aren’t always exactly the same as the brand-name drugs,” Andrea Saliba, also a psychiatrist, emphasised. 
 Concerta has a special release mechanism that is protected by a patent, meaning generics can’t copy how it works. Because of this, it’s important to look at not just how well a medication can be absorbed in the body but also how effective it is in treating ADHD, as differences in how drugs are made can lead to different outcomes for patients.
 Additionally, there are other forms of methylphenidate medications, such as Medikinet XL and Equasym XL, which provide additional options to accommodate different lifestyles. 
 Medikinet XL contains both an immediate-release component (50 per cent of the dose) and a prolonged-release component (50 per cent of the dose), while Equasym XL has a similar set-up with 30 per cent immediate-release and 70 per cent prolonged-release components. 
  The design of these medications allows an immediate effect, while the prolonged-release portion would maintain symptom control throughout the afternoon, eliminating the need for a midday dose during school hours. 
 This means that individuals can benefit from consistent therapeutic effects for about eight hours. This allows the medication to wear off just in time for evening meals and better-quality night sleep, keeping in mind that common side effects include reduced appetite and sleep disturbance. 
 Increasing treatment options can be particularly advantageous for individuals balancing school, work and personal activities.
 The association called for immediate action to address these shortages, expand the formulary and ensure that Maltese patients have access to the full spectrum of evidence-based treatments available in other countries. 
 “Children and adolescents with ADHD deserve the same standard of care as their peers across Europe,” Sacco concluded.

Doctors back call for public inquiry into the benefits fraud scandal,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/doctors-back-call-public-inquiry-benefits-fraud-scandal.1096328,08-06-2024,002264.png,"Doctors are backing a call by a group of NGOs for a public inquiry into the benefits fraud scandal.
 The scandal was revealed by Times of Malta last year, when it was reported that former MP Silvio Grixti was implicated as being at the centre of a scam which saw hundreds of people being granted benefits for severe disabilities they did not suffer from.
 Grixti was subsequently arraigned, along with a number of other people.
 Subsequently, the president of the Medical Association of Malta branded the benefit fraud racket as “organised crime”.
 A group of NGOs last month demanded a public inquiry into the benefits fraud scandal.
 The activists - Repubblika, aditus, The Daphne Caruana Galizia Foundation, Moviment Graffitti, Kopin, KSU, Manueldelia.com, Occupy Justice and UĦM Voice of the Workers - handed a letter addressed to the prime minister at the Auberge de Castille, calling for a public inquiry.
 On Monday, MAM joined the call for an independent public inquiry into the scandal, which it said had ""significantly undermined the integrity of our institutions and eroded public trust in the sickness benefits process"". 
 The association said that ""disturbingly"", members of the cabinet that approved a presidential pardon for those implicated in the fraud are allegedly linked to the fraud, ""raising concern about the fairness of the process"".
 ""In stark contrast, medical professionals, who had their signatures forged as part of this scheme, have received no justice, not even an official apology,"" MAM said.
 It urged full accountability and transparency to restore public confidence and ensure justice is served.
 ""The medical community, along with the general public, deserves a thorough investigation and a genuine acknowledgement of the wrongs committed.
 It is crucial that vulnerable patients receive the support they are entitled to without the interference of political misconduct.""
 MAM said a prospective public inquiry should also address the return of the embezzled funds and the timing of the presidential pardon.
 The ministry involved in this fraud should never be the same one responsible for ensuring that the money is returned, it added.

 The training covers Maltese words and phrases related to patient care, hygiene, first aid and emotional support, with a special focus on empathy and effective communication. The program includes various practical sessions in simulated environments and is being delivered in Malta by a qualified nurse who is a teacher by profession. 
  Of those 200 students, 150 are nurses who are sometimes in charge of wards and who therefore most need to be able to understand patients speaking Maltese. The other 50 spots were given to carers on a first-come, first-served basis. 
 Healthmark recruits, trains and deploys carers and nurses to several of Malta’s hospitals and elderly homes. Jointly owned by db Group and James Caterers, it is the country’s single largest healthcare employer. 
 MTRM is a private company within the General Workers Union licensed and accredited for training by Malta Further and Higher Education Authority (MFHEA). 
 Its mission is to provide adults with educational opportunities to acquire and improve the necessary skills and competencies to become self-sufficient and gainfully occupied.
 Healthmark CEO Charlotte Sant Portanier said the company strived to ensure it provided enough workers to meet Malta’s healthcare demands.
 “But alongside that we must make sure that every worker is not just qualified but also sensitive to our local environment and the needs of our patients,” she said.
 MTRM CEO Lewis Spiteri said the programme was already making an impact on healthcare services and thanked Healthmark for bringing the programme to fruition.

‘I’m still dizzy and exhausted’: the long-COVID patients who remain trapped,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/i-m-still-dizzy-exhausted-longcovid-patients-remain-trapped.1091679,05-02-2024,002459.png,"A long-COVID sufferer has spoken about the way the virus has caused “drastic” changes to her body and impacted every aspect of her life.
 The woman has called for more awareness to help many patients like her who have contracted the virus and have never completely shaken it off.
 Anna* caught the virus in October 2022, having had no previous health conditions. But 18 months later, debilitating symptoms have persisted.
 Back then, she initially had some fever and cold symptoms, but soon started experiencing typical symptoms of long-COVID, including difficulty concentrating, fatigue and post-exertional malaise (PEM), the worsening of symptoms following even minor physical or mental exertion.
 Three months later, she was still hoping it was just a slow recovery. But after about half a year, it became clearer it was more than that.
 “I was unable to do even the smallest tasks of everyday life, such as grocery shopping and showering. I was also unable to read, watch films and listen to music.
 “I was – and still am – experiencing dizziness, palpitations and nausea when exhausted.”
 Anna explained that fatigue was not a feeling of tiredness, but of deep exhaustion, characterised by pain and dizziness as well as the inability to sleep and rest well.
 “Brain fog is a lot less peaceful than the word may suggest. I experience it more as a thunderstorm in the brain,” she said.
 “I had strong symptoms, including cognitive ones, which meant that even organising help was often overwhelming,” Anna admitted.
 Attempts to describe her symptoms have often baffled others, including some doctors, and she has had to keep explaining they were not psychological.
 “In this situation, reading about the experiences of others and research findings greatly helps,” Anna said.
 Her biggest problem has been not knowing who to talk to about everyday life arrangements and questions about continuing or adapting work.
 “I had to learn the technique of pacing to avoid the worsening of symptoms,” Anna said.
 “While doctors were friendly, I got most helpful information, including the crucial technique of pacing, by reading, which, in itself, is a difficult task for most of those affected,” Anna continued.
 Over the last 18 months, there have been some changes in the symptoms and energy levels, Anna acknowledged.
 “Occasionally, however, these make it even harder to know when to stop to avoid worsening symptoms.”
 Anna is going through further cardiology check-ups at Mater Dei Hospital’s Long-COVID Clinic, but her GP has said there was nothing more to be done for her main symptoms of fatigue and PEM.
 “It was and is difficult to explain the disease to friends and colleagues. I believe that more visibility in the public sphere would have greatly helped the process of adapting to my condition, which was often misunderstood as ‘a bit of tiredness’,” Anna said.
 She was trying her best to remain optimistic about a cure. “That is why it is important for the disease to get publicity and for research to get funding.”
 Patients like her needed an official website directing them towards medical and social services and information about how to deal with long-term sick leave, or the need to adapt working conditions, schooling, and so on.
 Those requiring long-term sick leave and those who had care obligations also needed financial support, as well as support with daily necessities.
 Access to anti-viral medication was also called for, given “a big fear” of the worsening of symptoms due to another COVID-19 infection.
 While she still managed to work and go about her daily life, this was only because she was “privileged” to have a lot of flexibility at work and because she stopped all other activities.
 “I am lucky I have recovered to the degree that I can organise my household – but only by planning meticulously, with short tasks and long breaks, and by adapting my lifestyle. I walk much less than I used to – to shops or to work – and sport of any type is out of the question.”
 The hardest part of all this was that even positive input, such as a short chat with a friend, reading a friendly e-mail, or taking a short walk, causes PEM, Anna said.
 “It means that to rest, I have to switch off completely; even my thoughts. This is a daily struggle.
 “It is also a struggle not to worry too much – because, of course, worrying, too, will give you symptoms and take away energy. Even answering these questions causes symptoms.”

Health minister rules out Vitals-like deal for St Luke's,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/health-minister-rules-future-vitalslike-deal-st-luke.1093243,30-05-2024,002460.png,"The Health Minister has ruled out the possibility of a Vitals-like deal for St Luke's Hospital that would see the Gwardamanġa hospital privatised again. 
 On Thursday, JoEtienne Abela said the plan was to revamp Malta's old general hospital and run it as a government-led operation.
 Nine years ago, the Maltese government gave away St Luke's and two other hospitals in a concession deal to Vitals Global Healthcare (VGH).
 VGH was meant to refurbish the hospitals and operate them on behalf of the government. Despite the multi-million deal, pledged projects were never carried out, deadlines were missed and St Luke's remained abandoned. 
  The concession was later passed on to Steward Healthcare.
 A judge described the whole hospitals' deal as ""fraudulent"".
 Former prime minister Joseph Muscat, his then chief of staff Keith Schembri and former health minister Konrad Mizzi are facing charges of bribery, trading in influence, money laundering, and various other crimes.
 On Thursday, health minister JoEtienne said plans are in hand to move outpatient wards, day surgery, and dental procedures currently based at Mater Dei Hospital to St Luke's. 
 The University of Malta's medical and nurses' schools will also move from MDH to Gwardamanġa under new plans, he said. 
 Those plans, include revamping and constructing new buildings in the St Luke's complex. 
 While the government will lead the project, it does not mean stonewalling the private sector. 
 ""Cooperation with the private sector served us in the past and is serving us in the present. I don't see why there should not be cooperation with the private sector.""

Doctors file judicial protest to stop outsourcing of IVF procedures,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/mam-files-judicial-protest-stop-outsourcing-ivf-procedures.1093323,31-05-2024,002299.png,"The Medical Association of Malt (MAM) has filed a judicial protest seeking to stop the government from outsourcing IVF procedures to the private sector. 
 This comes after Prime Minister Robert Abela announced the government would be sending couples on the waiting list for IVF to private clinics for treatment, during an electoral campaign event earlier this month. 
 The government subsequently announced it would be spending €6 million to send some 650 couples for private IVF treatment, in a bid to slash waiting times. 
 But the MAM says that this violates an agreement the government had entered into with doctors following a 2018 strike over the transfer of public hospitals to the private company Steward Healthcare. 
 In this agreement, the MAM said that the government promised it would carry out “meaningful” consultation with the association and obtain its consent prior to forging ahead with any planned privatisation or outsourcing of any services that are offered as part of the national health service. 
 The state disrespected this agreement when it published tenders for these services without any consultation or consent, as stipulated in the aforementioned agreement, the association said. 
 “MAM is protesting that the Government is showing a lack of transparency. This is crucial in the light of the Vitals/Steward fraud,” MAM president Martin Balzan said. 
 “The Association insists that any privatisation of medical services has to abide by signed agreements, have patients' best interest at their core and there has to be proper scrutiny of how taxpayer money is being spent.”
 Balzan added that the country’s health infrastructure was now “in crisis” thanks to the defunct deal that saw three state hospitals handed over to the private company VGH and later Steward Health Care. This crisis can only be resolved if the way forward is planned holistically and with the involvement of all stakeholders, he said. 
 While the MAM is not against involving private sector operators to cut waiting lists, including for IVF, but this should not be done at the expense of ignoring obligations. 
 “The blatant disregard of existing agreements and the lack of consultation does not reassure doctors that the government has learned the lessons from the Vitals/Steward fraud,” Balzan said. 
 The MAM is calling on the government to stop further privatisation until proper meaningful consultation is complete.

Health Minister wants to introduce organ donation after circulatory death,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/health-minister-wants-introduce-organ-donation-circulatory-death.1102219,12-09-2024,002338.png,"The health minister said on Monday that he wants to build on a Bill moved by an Opposition MP to facilitate organ donation by making organ retrieval possible when a patient has 'circulatory death'.
 At present organs can only be retrieved once patients are certified as being brain dead.
 Minister Jo Etienne Abela said in parliament that he wanted to go beyond that so that organs could be retrieved when a patient had 'circulatory death'.
 (That would mean that organs may be taken when a patient's circulatory and respiratory functions have stopped, and death is pronounced by a physician.)
 The minister pointed out that this had already been introduced in other countries, such as the UK, and had led to an increase in organ donations. 
 It was also for this reason, among others, that the hospital's Emergency and Intensive Care departments needed to be enlarged. 
 The minister was replying to questions by Labour MP Rosianne Cutajar.
 He recalled that in October he had backed a bill tabled by Nationalist MP Ivan Bartolo introducing an 'opt-out' system for organ donations.  
 At present, people wishing to donate their organs need to ‘opt-in’ by registering to donate their organs for transplant once they die. Bartolo had proposed to reverse the process so that anyone over 16 would be presumed to have given consent to donating organs unless stated otherwise.
 Abela said he not only backed but had also seconded Bartolo's bill, but he wanted to go further.

Clinic using Chinese medicine to tackle Malta’s obesity crisis,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/clinic-using-chinese-medicine-tackle-malta-obesity-crisis.1098127,16-09-2024,"002656.png,002657.png,002658.png","Malta’s chart-topping obesity rate has led to the setting up of a weight-loss clinic that uses traditional Chinese medicine to tackle the health problem.
 The alternative medicine, based on a form of acupuncture called acupoint thread embedding, is being offered at Paola’s Mediterranean Regional Centre for Traditional Chinese Medicine (MRCTCM), which launched its specialist clinic last month but has been treating around 30 patients since January.
 “The goal of the new weight-loss specialist clinic is to address the underlying cause of obesity, a common health issue in Malta, by applying Chinese therapy without side effects and relying on pharmaceutical drugs,” the centre said.
 Malta has for years topped overweight and obesity lists, with predictions suggesting the problem that over a third of the adult population will be obese by 2030.
 Around a quarter of Maltese adults are already considered obese, putting Malta far ahead on the obesity scale, according to Eurostat and the World Health Organisation.
 In March, the MRCTCM, opened jointly by the Maltese and Chinese government 30 years ago, approached Public Health to propose treating obesity in an alternative way.
 The idea was to invite volunteers to carry out a research programme that would study the effects of acupuncture on weight loss, draw comparisons and collate data that would shed any doubts on how the treatment worked.
 But government funding for the research was not available. So, it has proceeded anyway to offer the therapy at its clinic.
 Centre director Dr Feng Hua has been practising this form of acupuncture for obesity – also known as catgut sutures – on thousands of patients in China for the last 15 years.
 It comes with a major caveat: it is not currently endorsed by scientific organisations such as the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, the Endocrine Society and the FDA.
 But from experience, Dr Feng Hua is convinced of the effectiveness of injecting what is called a collagen line into specific muscles – around 10 selected acupoints – every two weeks.
 She said catgut embedding means cutting down on the frequent appointments of standard acupuncture – the effects of which stop once the needles are removed.
 This is because the collagen lines remain effective in the body until they dissolve after two weeks.
 The prolonged stimulation provided by the catgut sutures, embedded at strategic acupuncture points, reduces appetite and helps regulate the digestive system, reducing bloating, while enhancing and accelerating metabolism, Fua explained.
 She said the treatment was slightly painful, particularly a couple of days after the embedding. Fua maintained patients were able to endure the discomfort and “accept it is doing its job”.
  Fua said it was still early days to see the effects on patients that have attended the clinic since it only opened a few weeks ago. But the centre was confident about the results.
 A female patient in her 40s, who has already undergone the treatment and wished to remain anonymous, told Times of Malta she lost seven kilos over three months, insisting the benefits extended far beyond mere weight reduction.
 This patient, however, was nowhere near obese at the beginning of her weight loss journey. At around 55 kilos, she just wished to shed some more weight.
 A director of a private hospital, she said her “journey” with catgut embedding began as an exploration into alternative weight-loss methods and turned out to be a “transformative experience”.
 It led to an immediate decrease in appetite in her case and was pivotal in helping her make better food choices.
  “Without the constant cravings for unhealthy snacks and sugary treats, I found it easier to base my diet on nutritious, wholesome foods. Fruits and vegetables became the cornerstone of my meals, providing essential vitamins and minerals that not only supported my weight loss but also improved my overall health,” she said.
 The patient said she no longer felt the compulsion to eat out of habit and emotion.
 “Instead, I began to listen to my body’s true hunger signals and chose foods that were both satisfying and nourishing.”
 Asked what happened to patients when they stopped the therapy, Fua said positive results were often retained because they led to changes in lifestyle and dietary habits.
 “Once the body starts to feel so good and healthy, and receives positive feedback, it continues to follow this lifestyle.”
 Fua said catgut embedding also works on and stabilises the endocrine system, so even when the treatment stopped, it continues to work long term.
 The length of the treatment depends on the individual and the amount of weight that needs to be lost, but generally, results are seen after three months, she said.
 The average reduction was around two kilos a month, but this could plateau in the second and kickstart again, Fua estimated, adding she was against quick weight loss because this can be easily regained.
 The lower the starting weight, the harder it could be to shed the kilos, she said.
 The centre’s current profile of patients was mostly female, aged between 40 and 60, but some men have started dropping in since the clinic was officially opened, Fua said.
 Men in Malta have the highest rate of overweight and obesity of the 52 countries making up the WHO’s European region. Women in Malta were the second highest.
 The medical team at the MRCTCM provides other ancient Chinese therapies like moxibustion (the burning of leaves on body points), cupping and Tuina (a Chinese massage) to deal with various diseases.
 Fua said the Maltese were open to and accepting of conventional Chinese concepts and trusted in these alternative forms of treatment, which did not have side effects.
 The overall message is that acupuncture can be used not only to treat pain, and Fua urged those who were tired of using medication for their problems to give it a try.
 “We hope we can help many people because obesity leads to other symptoms, including knee, thigh and hip problems. We see people limping in the streets and we feel sorry for them,” she said.

 His daughter, Anastasia Megally, announced the details of her late father’s funeral on Saturday.
  Megally, a specialist in foetal medicine who worked at Mater Dei hospital, died on 5 July 2023, after developing medical complications. 
 Megally, long-afflicted by a neuromuscular condition, had a long and complicated medical history which, according to his family, was not adequately diagnosed and assessed before medication was administered during his last weeks in hospital. 
 His wife and children fought for a magisterial inquiry to determine the cause of his death. The family repeatedly requested an autopsy, insisting that the procedure was to be done within the scope of a magisterial inquiry. 
 The family sought recourse before the criminal courts seeking judicial authorisation, but their bid proved unsuccessful. 
 The family also claimed hospital authorities were holding the body of Megally “hostage” inside the morgue for months.
 This year, the court held hospital authorities and the Superintendent of Public Health responsible for breaching the fundamental rights of Megally’s family by denying them a private autopsy to determine the cause of his death.

The ‘never secret’ Vitals MoU kept secret for six years,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/the-never-secret-vitals-mou-kept-secret-six-years.1097197,27-08-2024,002986.png,"A Vitals agreement that the government kept under wraps for years was “never secretive”, former Malta Enterprise CEO Mario Galea claimed in court last week.
 Yet, Malta Enterprise fought tooth and nail to keep its contents secret, citing “commercial sensitivity.”
 Various government entities also claimed to the auditor general that they did not even have a copy of the 2014 memorandum of understanding (MoU).
 The auditor general was finally given a copy in 2020, only after a damning report concluded that the mere existence of the MoU indicated collusion between the Vitals investors and government officials.
 Times of Malta  discovered the existence of the memorandum of understanding in 2017, after obtaining a presentation by the Vitals investors bragging about how they had signed an agreement with the government to run the Gozo, St Luke’s and Karin Grech hospitals.
 The presentation referencing the agreement predated the official tender to run the hospitals by several months.
  Attempts by Times of Malta to get a copy of the agreement from Malta Enterprise were rebuffed on “commercial sensitivity” grounds. Judge Joanna Vella Cuschieri upheld Malta Enterprise’s refusal when an appeal was filed.
 Although the memorandum of understanding only refers to the Gozo hospital, the auditor general said it served as the basis for the entire concession being awarded to Vitals through what was meant to be a competitive tender.
 The deal awarded to Vitals and later taken over by Steward was struck down by a court last year on “fraud” grounds. Top former officials, including ex-prime minister Joseph Muscat, face criminal charges over the Vitals deal.
 What does the MoU say? 
 The agreement, signed by ex-minister Chris Cardona, was for the setting up of a Gozo medical school, “which shall include the extension and operation of the Gozo General Hospital”.
 It bound the investors to set up a company in Malta to develop and operate the project, “which company will appear on behalf of the investors on the final agreement”.
 Cardona, who was responsible for Malta Enterprise when the agreement was signed, told a court that the first time he met the Vitals investors was during the signing at Castille.
 Cardona said it was his ministry staff who informed him that the “run of the mill” agreement needed to be signed by him.
 A magisterial inquiry into Vitals uncovered evidence that the government was always planning to include all three hospitals in the deal.
 Brian Tonna, the man who set up secret companies in Panama for ex-government officials Keith Schembri and Konrad Mizzi, was involved in meetings with Pakistani businessman Shaukat Ali about the hospitals project as early as June 2014.
 Ali and Tonna have both been charged in connection with the deal.
 In January 2015, the government was advised that handing the hospitals contract to a group of investors without first issuing a public tender could present a “legal hurdle”.
 It was eventually decided that a request for proposals would be necessary. The request was issued in March 2015, five months after the MoU was signed.
 In an added twist, Konrad Mizzi’s then-permanent secretary Ronald Mizzi appointed Tonna to the evaluation committee that would assess the tender bids, despite his connections with Ali.
 The inquiry found there was “considerable argument” over who should sit on the committee.
 On the closing date of the submissions for bids, Tonna was replaced by his Nexia BT partner Manuel Castagna.
 Mizzi resigned as permanent secretary in July after a court found there is enough evidence for him to face trial in connection with the deal.

"Joseph Muscat, associates linked to Steward slush fund",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/joseph-muscat-associates-linked-steward-slush-fund.1092681,19-05-2024,"003014.png,003015.png,003016.png,003017.png,003018.png","A €1 million “political support fund” created by Steward Health Care is suspected to have been set up to pass on bribes to Joseph Muscat, Keith Schembri and Konrad Mizzi.
 The funds were held by Accutor AG, a Swiss company suspected of being used as a centralised money-laundering hub for payments linked to the hospitals deal involving Vitals and Steward.
 Investigators have zeroed in on how soon after leaving office, both Muscat and Mizzi signed consultancy agreements linked to Accutor, while Schembri is also suspected to have indirectly benefited from the “political support fund”.
 The funds were moved from Steward to Accutor under the guise of a consultancy agreement. Steward boss Armin Ernst described the Accutor agreement in an August 2019 internal e-mail as intended to support “political and government activities and interactions”.
 Investigators concluded that the chances Muscat, Schembri and Mizzi happened to all then go on to independently form relationships with Accutor is considered so negligible that the possibility is excluded.
 
 The trio are facing money-laundering and criminal association charges in connection with the hospitals deal, together with a long list of other individuals and companies.
 Financial experts said the existence of the political support fund was clear evidence that Steward was masking political payments under the guise of consultancy services.
 They observed that had the arrangement in any way been a donation towards genuine political purposes connected to Malta it would not have been necessary to send the payments offshore to Switzerland.
 Muscat inked a consultancy deal with SpringX Media, a company affiliated with Accutor, five months after Ernst made reference to the ""political support fund"" and within weeks of resigning as prime minister in January 2020.
 The ex-prime minister received four €15,000 payments from Accutor and a related company called SpringX Media.
 A January 2022 search of Muscat’s home yielded little evidence that the €60,000 the ex-prime minister received from Accutor and an affiliated company called SpringX Media was for genuine work, according to investigators.
 Muscat was prepared for the search with copies of his consultancy contract with SpringX Media, as well as some “generic” powerpoint presentations linked to the work he claims to have done.
  In comments to Times of Malta yesterday, Muscat said if the authorities required supporting documentation for his work, they could have asked him for the necessary information.
 “I had also written to the police soon after learning that the inquiry was concluded.
 “Instead of calling me to provide evidence to show that the allegations against me were simply a pack of lies, a decision was taken to issue charges against me without hearing me, against all convention.
 “I will now provide this evidence in the adequate forum at the appropriate time. Like I was proven right on the (secret company) Egrant saga, I will be proven right again on Egrant 2,” Muscat said.
 Muscat said extensive parts of the inquiry rely on “hearsay” evidence from a “Indian person”, claiming he received €18 million annually from the hospitals deal.
 On the “political support fund,” Muscat said he is not aware and cannot comment about correspondence and alleged actions by other persons.
 “That is why I believe that the best course in the public’s interest is for the inquiry to be published.
 “Because of this, I have personally taken the initiative before the court to try to make this possible in full legally rather than through selective leaks,” Muscat said.
 Times of Malta revealed Muscat’s link to Accutor in November 2021.
  The Mizzi connection
 Investigations noted how in the days leading up to the August 2019 e-mail about the political support fund, Ernst wrote to Mizzi seeking his support on a major issue that he knew would require the minister’s sponsorship.
 Investigators noted how the issue – namely the transfer of ownership of the Barts medical school – rapidly made its way to cabinet thanks to Mizzi’s support.
 The Barts deal appears to have been aborted after Mizzi resigned from cabinet in November 2019 over the Daphne Caruana Galizia murder scandal.
 A few months after resigning, Mizzi entered into a consultancy agreement with a Maltese company – Ikons Limited. Investigators noted how this coincided with Ikons receiving €180,000 worth of payments from Accutor.
 Investigators discovered how the consultancy agreement, dated March 2020, was between Ikons, Mizzi and Alex Cutajar, a former aide to the minister.
 While Cutajar was assigned specific work tasks under the agreement, investigators flagged how no specific tasks were assigned to Mizzi, raising suspicions why he was included in it.
 Contacted for comment, Mizzi said the allegations against him on the hospitals concession are purely speculative and just conjecture.
 “Contrary to the insinuations, I have never received any payments or committed any wrongdoing. Any claims to the contrary are utterly baseless. No payments were ever received from Ikons. Any attempt to link me with the concession through Ikons is also preposterous,” Mizzi said.
 The ex-minister said that to date, he has only received partial disclosure of the documentation pertaining to the inquiry into the hospitals deal.
 “I now await for further disclosure and look forward to disproving any allegations in court through a rigorous and fact-based process. Further clarity on unfounded allegations will emerge from the judicial process. Until then any rampant speculation does harm to this process,” Mizzi said.
  Schembri’s Whatsapp groups
 The “private relationship” between Malta’s politicians and Accutor is best exemplified in six Whatsapp groups which included Accutor’s owner Wasay Bhatti and Schembri, investigators said.
 In these chats, Schembri and Bhatti discussed foreign investment projects linked to the Accutor company.
 Schembri is believed to have used the ‘political support fund’ payments Accutor received from Steward to develop his business relationship with Bhatti.
 Contacted for comment, Schembri said he had been an easy target for years.
 “These are all lies and presumptions. I deny ever receiving any money from any person mentioned in the inquiry. I hope our justice system will eventually kick off as I still believe that eventually all these devious allegations will get quashed,” Schembri said.
  ‘€18 million earmarked for politicians’ 
 Former Accutor director Kamal Sharma is claiming millions were earmarked for Muscat, Schembri and Mizzi.
 Sharma, a former Accutor director, alleged Vitals consultant Shaukat Ali told him Muscat, Mizzi and Schembri were “partners” in the hospitals deal, and were set to receive €18 million from it.
 
 Ali, a figure who appears to have made millions from the deal, allegedly told Sharma that he was paying the ex-prime minister €15,000 monthly.
 Former partners raise red flags on man behind Joseph Muscat payments
 Investigators said that while Sharma’s testimony was “credible”, they were unable to corroborate the claims as much of the money Ali extracted from Vitals flowed to secrecy jurisdictions like Dubai, Switzerland and Tunisia.
 This, the investigators said, meant they were unable to ascertain the onward flows of these funds and who were the ultimate beneficiaries.
 Contacted for comment, Ali said all the allegations are absolutely baseless and unfounded, and stem from untrustworthy, unreliable and unstable people and sources, whose facts are based on suppositions, lies and fabrications.
 “I will not further comment on this matter as I understand that this matter is pending before the courts of Malta and that I will potentially be charged with matters concerning the allegations mentioned by you in your questions.
 “I feel we have become the victims of a political football and the subject of vile allegations made by mendacious people… I have faith that the truth will be known in court and justice will prevail,” Ali said.
 Sharma told Times of Malta in 2021 that he and his business partner Tyrone Greenshields resigned as Accutor directors after growing increasingly suspicious about the company’s activities.
 In the summer of 2019, the pair say concerned Accutor employees in Malta and elsewhere brought details about many large payments made into and out of Accutor AG between 2017 and 2019.
 These transactions, they say, had not been recorded in the customer relationship management system and records were missing from the usual shared file folders that they accessed regularly.
 The transactions involved parties and sums that neither of the two directors say they knew about.
 They further say Accutor employees had been instructed not to inform them about these transactions, details of which they say were also withheld from reports prepared for the two directors.
 Upon investigating the transactions, Sharma and Greenshields confronted Bhatti about the payments as well as two other Accutor officers, who were authorised to process transactions.
 “They had no reasonable explanations for the concerning financial activities and it was clear that, in their minds, neither Tyrone nor I were supposed to know about these transactions”, the two former directors had told Times of Malta.

Revealed: Steward funded ‘smear’ campaign against Chris Fearne,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/revealed-steward-funded-smear-campaign-chris-fearne.1094706,07-04-2024,"003065.png,003066.png,003067.png,003068.png,003069.png,003070.png,003071.png,003072.png,003073.png,003074.png,003075.png,003076.png,003077.png","A campaign to smear former health minister Chris Fearne with “fake” corruption claims was funded by Steward Health Care, leaked corporate records show. 
 The campaign against Fearne was part of a wider €6.5 million secret operation authorised by Steward to target their perceived opponents in Malta and abroad. 
 Practices included using bank records, accessing sensitive phone data, and planting “fake” media stories about corruption among Maltese officials. 
 The operations were coordinated by senior Steward officials who corresponded regularly with private spies at two London-based intelligence firms called Audere International and CT Group, according to emails, encrypted messages, and financial records. 
 The records were obtained by OCCRP and shared with Times of Malta and the  Boston Globe. 
 Leaked files show how Steward allocated some of the costs for these operations to its budget for running the St Luke’s, Karin Grech and Gozo hospitals. 
 Fearne, who is facing fraud charges in connection with the annulled Steward deal, appears to have been one of the key targets of the Malta operation. 
 
 The ex-health minister and his former chief of staff Carmen Ciantar last year slammed the unknown “dark forces” behind the “fake claims,” which included allegations of an illicit €3.2 million payment. 
  Fearne and Ciantar have urged the police to uncover who was behind the claims. 
 Speaking to reporters, Fearne said the alleged disinformation campaign against him was an “attack on the very integrity and wellbeing of the Maltese State.”
 “If confirmed it would not be coincidental that this disgusting act was carried out at a time when I was rigorously insisting on Steward fulfilling their contractual obligations,” Fearne said, adding that when the allegations emerged last year, he had asked Maltese police to investigate the ""fake documents"".
 Asked for comment on whether police had indeed investigated the claims against Fearne and Ciantar, a Maltese police spokesperson said: “following police investigations, no evidence was found about the alleged matter that could lead to a criminal prosecution.”
 Although Fearne initially backed Steward taking over the contract from Vitals Global Healthcare in February 2018, the relationship appears to have soured thereafter. 
 That same year, Steward Malta CEO Armin Ernst hit out at Fearne when payments under the government contract were held up. 
 “I am truly getting exasperated,” Ernst wrote to Fearne in October 2018. 
 “It is not possible to run the operations of an organization when … revenue transfer from GoM [Government of Malta] become a matter of guess work of what, when and how much will be received. Is there anything else going on I should know about????,” Ernst said in the e-mail. 
  A minute later, Ernst forwarded the e-mail with the words: “Just as an FYI...” to Keith Schembri, chief of staff to former prime minister Joseph Muscat. 
 An investigation by the Auditor General found Schembri and ex-health minister Konrad Mizzi frequently dealt with Steward behind Fearne’s back. 
  By 2021, senior Steward staff contemplated suing Fearne and Malta’s government in the US, where they planned to allege extortion and solicitation of bribes, a leaked email shows. 
 “This is NOT an idle threat,” wrote Steward senior executive Mark Rich in an email to its Maltese lawyers in May 2021. “We are literally prepared to drop a case in US Federal Court naming Fearne and others as bad players… just launching the case will put [Malta’s government] in the penalty box.”
 No lawsuit followed, however, Ernst appeared to have kept tabs on Fearne, and operations codenamed 'Project Albacore' and 'Project Bluefin' were launched, e-mails and documents show. 
  In a December 2021 e-mail, Ernst flagged a media report claiming irregularities linked to the Foundation for Medical Services, which fell under Fearne and Ciantar’s remit. 
 “Attached a report just published that for first time hints at some significant irregularity within Chris Fearne’s realm.
 “There have always been rumors of a romantic relationship between him and Carmen Ciantar,” Ernst wrote in the e-mail. 
 That same month, Steward directed its law firm, Quinn Emanuel, to hire CT Group, an intelligence firm whose staff includes the UK government’s former counter-terrorism chief. 
 In July 2022, CT Group pledged to “deploy into the public domain information about the main opponent of the Client’s concession in Malta” in a commercial proposal obtained by OCCRP. The aim was to identify “improper” behaviour and leak it anonymously to Maltese media.
 CT Group declined to reveal the identity of the “main opponent” when asked by reporters.
  But later that year, CT Group passed on what it said was a bank wire transfer record showing €3.2 million moving to an account held by Carmen Ciantar’s daughter.
 The payment, dated November 2019, was purportedly sent by a former business partner of Igor Levitin, a longstanding advisor to Russian president Vladimir Putin.
 An internal document titled 'Malta: Abuse of Passport Scheme' alleged that Fearne used his ministerial position to lobby to issue a Maltese passport to Levitin’s brother as part of a quid pro quo for the payment.
  Data embedded in the document suggests it was authored by CT Groups’ former director Will Crawford. 
 In October 2022, Ernst sent the bank transfer record and the document alleging abuse in the passport scheme to Steward's UK law firm, Quinn Emanuel. 
  Lawyers for Audere denied that their client had engaged in unlawful conduct, but declined to respond to detailed allegations and questions, citing confidentiality. They said Audere “takes its legal and regulatory compliance obligations seriously and acts in accordance with the same.” 
 CT Group said it is “committed to and complies with all laws and regulations in all jurisdictions in which it works.” It added, “Your email contains serious false allegations,” although it did not dispute specific allegations or respond directly to reporters’ questions. 
 Six months after Ernst passed on the details about the alleged wire transfer, the records and briefing document prepared by Crawford were shared with Matthew Caruana Galizia, the director of the Daphne Caruana Galizia Foundation, via an intermediary.  
  Caruana Galizia contacted the Austrian bank named in the record and the former business partner of Levitin, who purportedly sent the funds. Both said it was a forgery. 
 Sources told Times of Malta that an investigation into the claims by local authorities was unable to uncover any proof to substantiate the purported €3.2 million transfer.  
 Alex Cobham, chief executive of the UK-based NGO Tax Justice Network, called the document a “clumsy and inexpert” fake.
 “While the document claims to relate to a transfer made on 22 November 2019, the SWIFT code (specifically, the message input reference) indicates a transfer made on 22 February 2018.”
 The bank transfer record eventually surfaced last summer on websites elsewhere, including in Ukraine, where it was subsequently picked up by the media in Malta. 
  It is unclear whether CT Group, Steward, or Quinn Emanuel were aware the document was fake.
 Leaked files show how Steward allocated costs for its spy operations to its Malta budget, which was primarily funded by taxpayers under the €90-million-euro per year hospitals contract.
 Soon after CT Group began investigating Fearne for Steward in early 2022, the UK spy firm billed £207,000 (€244,000) to the US company’s Maltese subsidiary, Steward Malta Management Limited, an invoice shows. 
  That company’s leaked bank statements for previous years and an internal budget approved by Steward’s board in February 2023 show that the subsidiary’s main source of income was the Maltese government. 
 The records also showed how bills from CT Group and Audere totalling $2.9 million (€2.7 million) for 2022 had been “allocated to Steward International (via Malta).” A further $1 million (€900,000) “place holder” was budgeted “via Malta” for upcoming intelligence work in 2023. 
 Under instruction from Steward’s general counsel Herb Holtz, Steward initially paid Audere’s bills from its US headquarters, then charged costs back to Malta, financial records show.
 In May 2022, Steward’s senior executives met in Dallas to discuss what are called “intercompany charges”, costs incurred by one subsidiary later reallocated to another for accounting purposes, including Audere, fees of more than $700,000 (€652,000) for intelligence fees paid for by US-based Steward Healthcare LLC.
 But a budget for Steward’s international division approved by its board the following February shows how those Audere fees had been reimbursed ""via Malta"".
 Ciantar whose daughter was named on the ""fake"" record, described the experience as “devastating, both professionally and personally.”
 “You can imagine the horrible sensation of facing these heinous public lies without knowing who is behind them,” she told reporters. 
  CT Group told OCCRP that allegations it handled fabricated documents were “false” and said it “is confident the intelligence sourced is [sic] this project is genuine and accurate"".
 Quinn Emanuel said the firm “has no knowledge of – and certainly played no role in – any of the alleged activities you describe” and declined to comment further, citing attorney/client privilege. 
 Steward Health Care did not respond to a request for comment about Fearne.
 Fearne was not the only person of interest to Steward. 
 Documents show the company enlisted Audere to find information on its own staff. 
 An internal report dated April 2023 included compromising personal information extracted from the company device of a former senior employee Steward worried might leak information to its auditor. 
 Identifying the employee by the codename 'Pudding', the report alleged that he had solicited a sex worker, a possible criminal offence, the report noted. The report’s author was an Audere director, its metadata reveals.
 Separate leaked correspondence from earlier that year shows how a compromising photo of the employee, who is not being named owing to the personal nature of the information Audere compiled about him, was shared with Audere’s founder Charles Blackmore, after he requested a photo of “Pudding”.
  In other correspondence outlining a possible approach to the employee by an “agent,” Blackmore discussed putting the plan to “Herb” - an apparent reference to Holtz. Other correspondence from Audere staff shows that “HH” had engaged the intelligence firm.
 Steward's probe of the employee appears to have been prompted by concerns he might leak damaging information about a possible several hundred million dollars hole in the company's budget to Crowe, an external auditor for a real estate deal Steward was involved in.
 Audere said when contacted that the “false” allegations were “of the most serious kind that could be levelled against an investigations firm and industry professionals. 
 Another target of the operations was British businessman Fraser Perring. 
 Perring’s company, Viceroy Research, makes money by “short selling” stocks — betting that the share prices of other companies will go down, and then publishing negative information which further depresses the prices. 
 Viceroy had just released an investigation into Steward’s relationship with Medical Properties Trust, its biggest stakeholder, alleging Steward had fraudulently overvalued its Colombian assets by around €46 million in a sale to Medical Properties Trust.
 Steward appears to have enlisted Audere to keep tabs on Perring soon after. 
 The assignment was led by Monika Rihma, an Audere director Blackmore described in leaked communications as being “closest” to Steward’s general counsel, Herb Holtz.
 Holtz did not respond to question, and Steward did not respond directly to questions on the intelligence work.
 However, in a comment to the Boston Globe, Steward said, “While general counsel and as a private lawyer since then, Holtz has neither recommended nor sanctioned any illegal or unethical activity.”
 Lawyers for Audere, Blackmore, and Rihma called the allegations “false” and “seriously defamatory” but declined to dispute specific claims, citing confidentiality. 
 Perring told reporters he started to notice strange disturbances at home: his CCTV system stopped working, and he came home to unexpectedly find his door unlocked and computer open. He filed incident reports with the police, though no further action was taken. 
 A surveillance report reveals how a five-man team of security professionals staked out Perring’s home in rural England over six days in March 2023, shortly after Viceroy published its investigation into Steward.
 The report was authored by Greyprism, a security company founded by two veterans former members of the UK’s Special Forces. It documented the location of entrances, exits, and CCTV cameras at Perring’s property, and revealed that a tracker was placed on his car. 
 Greyprism’s report doesn’t disclose who its client was but leaked documents show that the report was in the possession of Audere, which had been working for Steward for more than five years on assignments connected to the Malta hospital deal. 
  An account called viceroyleaks soon appeared on Twitter (since renamed X) and began posting negative slurs about Perring and Viceroy’s research. “This account's sole purpose is to expose #fraud, #scam and #insidertrading of Fraser Perring and Viceroy … YOU WON'T GET AWAY WITH IT!,” the account posted on March 8, 2023.
 Perring later reported the viceroyleaks account to police, who recorded a crime of malicious communications. 
 Leaked correspondence shows how Audere’s Blackmore screened the website’s account’s posts before they went out. In one, Blackmore said he had sent the contemplated post to “HH” for review — an apparent reference to Herb Holtz. 
 Documents handled by Audere detailed other confidential personal information about Perring.
 The information included Perring’s HSBC bank account number and balance, transactions going back over the previous five years —  including from his Swiss private banker — and the numbers, times, lengths, and costs of his recent phone calls. 
 It is unclear how the confidential information was obtained, but Perring told OCCRP that the information was “100 per cent accurate” and that he had never kept records of the information or shared his login details. 
 A document detailing the information also recommended “researching” Perring’s banker’s account which “may prove advantageous in the likelihood it is being deployed as a conduit for VICEROY or other entities.”
  Lawyers for Audere, Blackmore, and Rihma called the allegations “false” and “seriously defamatory” but declined to dispute specific claims, citing confidentiality. 
 A lawyer for Greyprism said its client “acts in accordance with the law” and “would not, and has not, acted in the manner alleged and in breach of its legal obligations.”
 Citing confidentiality, data protection, and legal privilege, the lawyer said Greyprism could not discuss specific cases, but said the company “does not conduct unlawful physical or technical surveillance.”

Health ministry extends 'urgent’ emergency deadline for third time,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/health-ministry-extends-urgent-emergency-deadline-third-time.1096110,31-07-2024,003108.png,"The health ministry has extended its urgent call for private operators to provide emergency health services for the third time, as private hospitals continue to seek clarifications.  
 St Thomas Hospital, St James Capua and Da Vinci Health have all expressed an interest in responding to the call first issued on July 12. 
 They were originally given just eight days to apply, as the health ministry battled to solve overcrowding and waiting times of up to 12 hours at Mater Dei’s emergency department.  
 The call will now run into its fourth week, with a deadline that has been extended three times and is now set to close on August 7. 
 A spokesperson for St Thomas told Times of Malta they intend to submit a proposal but some points “remain unclear”.   
 These include forecast patient volumes and other operational details. 
 Da Vinci confirmed they too intend to participate provided “the referrals are based on the services they can offer.”   
 St. Anne’s Clinic ruled out participating altogether.   
 “While we work with government closely on other PPPs, St Anne’s cannot help with an emergency room on the scale the government requires.” 
 Earlier this month, St James Capua showed interest in the proposal. Its chairman Josie Muscat affirmed his hospital’s capability to meet the government requirements.
 Over the past four weeks, private healthcare operators have been seeking clarifications to the original request for proposals, independently from each other.
 Successful bidders had to prepare their facilities to enter service within four weeks of signing the contract.   
 Asked whether St Thomas would have to employ additional personnel, a spokesperson said, “this depends on the daily number of patients expected to require assistance [and] the matter is being discussed with the authorities.” 
 “Our facilities are already well-equipped to handle emergency cases, but we are assessing whether minor upgrades or modifications are needed  to accommodate the specific requirements,” he added.
 Da Vinci said that to provide the services requested, they would need to employ more doctors, nurses and security officers but the facilities they currently have do not require major alterations.  
 It criticised the design of the request for proposals as “restrictive like a one-size-fits-all”, highlighting that not all private healthcare facilities have the same capabilities and strengths. 
 Private operators have been asked to provide services that include the treatment of uncomplicated head injuries, wounds requiring suturing, chest infections, urinary and skin infections, stable abdominal pains and gastroenteritis. 
 The health ministry has offered a fee structure that ranges from €30 per GP consultation to €200 per 24-hour in-patient stay.
 St Thomas Hospital believes this is “generally fair and reflective of the services outlined.” 
 “However, we are reviewing the details to ensure it aligns with the operational costs and the level of care we aim to provide.""
 Da Vinci said it considers the fees “acceptable, but others are inadequate and do not address the potential additional expenses that often need to be incurred.” 
 St Thomas anticipates it will be able to provide the required services within a few weeks after receiving the final go-ahead. 
 St Thomas is situated in Qormi but runs a sister facility – the Good Samaritan Hospital – in St Paul’s Bay.  Da Vinci Health runs a facility in Birkirkara. 
 Ministry sources had previously told Times of Malta that there are four or five operators capable of providing the services required. 
 Health minister Minister Jo Etienne Abela said on Saturday that outsourcing care “was not crisis management.”

 The Menstruation Pilot Project will involve around 900 secondary schoolgirls hailing from Gozo College Middle School, Mosta's Maria Regina College Secondary and Birkirkara’s St Monica Secondary School.
 Students will no longer have to whisper, usually in shame, to their friends to ask if they have an extra pad or tampon, but now will have dispenser machines at school providing the products for free.
 The dispensers provide two types of pads, for different menstrual flows and one type of tampon. The products chosen were the most preferred by students, according to an initial study for the project.
 The dispensers will have two distribution methods tested. An automatic dispenser, that works by simply pressing a button, and tokenised dispensers, where students will need a dongle.
 Both methods will provide pads and tampons, and there is no capping on how many products students can take. 
 The number of dispensers per school was determined based on the student population. 
  Katrina Delia said she is happy her school, St Monica Secondary, is part of the initiative to end the stigma associated with periods. 
 “It’s not the first time one of us might have forgotten a pad or a tampon at home, or even someone just got their period at school. Now it is comfortable to know I can just grab a pad whenever I need one,” the 15-year-old told Times of Malta.
 She said there is still a stigma on menstrual hygiene, and it can still be a hushed topic among friends. 
 “This is something that women and girls experience, and something normal and we should break the stigma down.”
 Another student, 14-year-old Michela Camilleri, said she knew many young students who see periods as “disgusting”.
 “This scheme will show that periods are natural and perfectly normal,” she said. 
  The pilot project to provide free menstrual products in schools was included in the Labour Party’s electoral manifesto. A budget of €500,000 was allocated to the project.
 The distribution of free menstrual products in all state, church and private schools is planned to begin in the next academic year (2025/2026) and the pilot project will provide the necessary feedback before the implementation of the full-scale project. 
 Speaking during the launch and unveiling of the dispenser machines, Parliamentary Secretary Rebecca Buttigieg said the project’s goal is to reduce the stigma surrounding a “natural process” every woman experiences. 
 She said it is also a way to reduce the absenteeism of female students who fail to go to school during their period and to ease the financial burden of families to purchase these essential products. 
  Buttigieg explained the initial phase of the project included a study to assess the costs of the menstrual products available in Malta and to see the experience of other countries that have adopted similar projects. 
 Several countries have introduced schemes providing access to free menstrual products in schools. The University of Malta took a similar step last year when its students’ council introduced a free menstrual product dispenser at its Msida campus. The locker was broken into by thieves a  month later.
 The government is also discussing the possibility of reducing VAT on these products. Currently, VAT on menstrual products stands at 18%. 
 To address the stigma surrounding menstruation, several initiatives will be launched in schools, including awareness-raising campaigns.

Second mpox case detected - first case found to be of less severe strain,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/second-mpox-case-detected-first-case-found-less-severe-strain.1097564,09-03-2024,003383.png,"A second case of the mpox disease has been detected in Malta, while a case found last week has been confirmed as being of a less severe strain, the Health Ministry said.
 It said the second case involved a Maltese resident who was exposed to the disease through sexual activity in Malta.
 ""The individual is currently clinically stable and does not require hospital admission. The patient has been isolated and contact tracing efforts are underway to prevent further transmission. Further testing is being carried out to identify the specific clade of the mpox virus of this case,"" the ministry said on Tuesday. 
 It also explained that the mpox case reported last week, had been identified as clade II, which is less severe than clade I.  
 Mpox, formerly known as Monkeypox, is caused by a virus, which has two distinct clades: Clade I and Clade II.
 Clade I is predominantly found in Central Africa and is known for causing more severe illness and higher mortality rates.  Due to its severity, the World Health Organisation last month declared Clade I a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). 
 Clade II is less severe and has a significantly lower mortality rate. Clade II is responsible for the ongoing global outbreak that began in 2022, spreading primarily through human-to-human sexual transmission. In Malta, 35 cases were investigated in relation to this global outbreak up to 2023.
 ""The current case in Malta falls under this clade and is the first case being reported for 2024,"" the ministry said.   
 Last week, the ministry said the patient was clinically stable and did not require hospital admission, although isolation was ordered. The disease was contracted by sexual transmission and was considered an imported case.  
 
 Malta first detected earlier strains of mpox in 2022, with the first case reported in May when the patient returned from a country where several cases of the virus had been detected. 
 By August of that year, the number of cases had shot up to 31, with Malta registering the fifth-highest incidence rate of mpox in Europe at the time. 
 Later the government made a vaccine available to primary contacts of mpox patients free of charge.
 Mpox spreads between people mainly through close physical contact with someone who has the virus.
 Close contact includes skin-to-skin (such as touching or sex) and mouth-to-mouth, or mouth-to-skin contact.
 It can also include ""being face-to-face with someone who has mpox (such as talking or breathing close to one another, which can generate infectious respiratory particles)"".
 How to stay safe:
 The Health Authorities urged the public to adhere to the following preventive measures to curb the spread of the virus:
 1.     Safe Sex: Practice safe sex and have open conversations with partners about sexual health.
 2.     Avoid close contact: Refrain from close, skin-to-skin contact with individuals who have a rash resembling Mpox.
 3.     Hygiene practices: Maintain good hand hygiene by washing hands frequently with soap and water or using an alcohol-based hand sanitiser.
 4.     Safe practices: Be cautious during social gatherings and intimate contact. Avoid sharing personal items such as towels, bedding, and clothing with infected individuals.
 5.     Seek medical advice if you experience symptoms or have been in contact with someone diagnosed with mpox.

Miss Malta hopeful was told anorexia would kill her in a year,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/miss-malta-hopeful-told-anorexia-kill-year.1098385,26-09-2024,"003442.png,003443.png","A Miss Malta hopeful has opened up about how she was told anorexia would kill her within a year and why taking part in beauty pageants has given her the confidence to speak out about her eating disorder.
 Edera Fenech, 22, who is representing Mosta in the contest, said she was diagnosed with anorexia just over a year ago, with a devastating prognosis that changed her attitude.
 “I felt I had no choice but to recover,” she told Times of Malta. 
 
 “I was spending four to five hours at the gym and eating almost nothing – maybe a can of tuna, or nothing at all.”
 The young woman described how she struggled to recover.
 “Putting on weight was harder than I thought,” she admitted. “But now, I can call myself a warrior.”
 In recent weeks Edera shared her progress on social media, saying she wanted to use her Miss Malta platform to help others.
 She posted photos of herself when she was in hospital while heavily suffering from the disorder, which is characterised by an intense fear of gaining weight. 
 “I’m standing here to be an inspiration and the voice to help others with the same disorder since we need more awareness,” she said.
 Her aim is to encourage others that it “is possible to feel better”.
 The illness gives sufferers a distorted view of their own body image but Fenech believes taking part in beauty pageants has helped with her recovery.
  “Pageantry empowered me. It gave me the courage to take up space and cement myself in society,” Edera said, adding that the most important thing pageants have taught her is to be a leader.
 She is keen to break the negative stereotypes surrounding beauty pageants, such as Miss Malta, one of the oldest such contests in the country.
 “It’s a lot more than just looking beautiful and parading the stage,” she said.
 Fenech also wants to highlight the misconceptions surrounding anorexia, particularly the belief that it is solely a “woman’s illness” or an issue of vanity.
  “It makes me feel disappointed and frustrated at the same time. Everyone can get this kind of disorder and it’s not a matter of attention but a matter of self-awareness,” she explained.
 She urged anyone struggling with eating disorders to seek help as early as possible and encouraged people to reach out to Dar Kenn għal-Saħħtek, the Centre for the Treatment of Obesity and Eating Disorders.
 Fenech remains grateful for the support she received from her family and her partner.
 “If it wasn’t for them, I’d have never been able to get over it. I wouldn’t be here without them,” she said.

Inspection finds 'no evidence' of butcher turning cats and dogs into sausages,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/no-police-reports-rumours-butcher-selling-cats-dogs-sausage-meat.1094305,22-06-2024,003475.png,"Updated 7.10pm with health ministry response
 A health inspection has found ""no evidence"" that a Gozitan butcher turned sick cats and dogs into sausage meat and sold them on to unsuspecting customers. 
 In a statement after the rumours about the butcher went viral, the health ministry said there were no cases of foodborne illness linked to the man.
 The rumours spread like wildfire on Friday, causing panic and disgust in equal measure. They claimed that several people had fallen sick over the weekend after eating sausages from the butcher, with health inspectors allegedly later uncovering evidence of the misdeed during an inspection.
 But police, health and government sources who spoke to Times of Malta said that although they heard the rumours in recent weeks, there is no evidence to indicate they are true.
 In a statement late on Friday evening, the health ministry said officials within the Environmental Health Directorate had carried out inspections at the alleged butcher outlets but found they were not in operation.
 A team made up of Police, the Veterinary Services Directorate and the Environmental Health Directorate then carried out an inspection on Friday afternoon at various sites in Gozo in relation to the alleged butcher.
 ""No evidence or equipment related to the production of Maltese type sausage was found,"" the ministry said. 
 ""No cases of foodborne illness were reported to the health authorities which were linked to the alleged butcher.""
 A police spokesperson told Times of Malta that they were first alerted to the rumours over a week ago but had not received any reports over the matter.
 Times of Malta has chosen not to name the butcher in question at this stage.
 But members of the butcher’s family who spoke to Times of Malta strongly denied the rumours, describing them as “malicious falsehoods”.
 “This is absolutely untrue. All our family spent our lives around animals and loves animals, so we would never do anything like this,” they said.
 They confirmed that the rumours have been circulating for several weeks, but say they have no idea how or why they started. What’s more, they say, the shop is no longer operational.
 “The butcher shop has been shut for over a decade, so how could we have done the things they are talking about?”
 Attempts to contact the butcher himself were unsuccessful, while calls to the butcher’s landline number indicate that the number no longer exists.

Żebbuġ local council to serve Christmas lunch for the lonely,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/zebbug-local-council-serve-christmas-lunch-lonely.1101941,14-12-2024,003557.png,"The Żebbuġ local council is organising a Christmas Day lunch for those who will be alone on Christmas Day.
 “We want to organise a community safe space for people who would usually be alone on Christmas Day,” Żebbuġ mayor Steve Zammit Lupi said.
 “We talk a lot about loneliness and mental health, but during this month we can get carried away with Christmas decorations and forget about the community spirit.”
 Following discussions with other members of the council, Zammit Lupi approached the parish priest who offered one of the parish’s centres for Christmas Day. Food will be prepared by Rafel Sammut, head chef of Briju restaurant.
 “I will be volunteering on the day, and other individuals have already reached out to volunteer during the lunch,” he said, adding no pictures or footage will be taken during the lunch to respect the privacy of the guests.
 According to Zammit Lupi, this is the first time the council is organising a Christmas Day lunch. Every year the council organises festive events for residents.
 He said while the invitation is open to everyone, it is mainly directed at Żebbuġ residents.
  When asked if loneliness was prevalent in the locality, he said while no one had told him they felt alone, he is aware some residents do suffer from loneliness.
 “I hope other local councils will be encouraged to do something similar and help their residents on Christmas Day,” he said.
 Anyone in need of more information about the lunch can call the council on 2146 8181
 The council’s initiative to bring the community together and ensure no one is left alone at Christmas is similar to the Curia’s annual traditional Christmas lunch organised for needy and lonely people.

Exposed: how millions moved through the hospitals deal,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/exposed-millions-moved-hospitals-deal.1093037,26-05-2024,"003667.png,003668.png,003669.png,003670.png,003671.png,003672.png","A catering company suspected to be involved in a 10% kickback scheme. A medical equipment supplier with hidden owners. A secret shareholder who received monthly €100,000 consultancy payments.
 Investigators who combed through the deal to privatise three state hospitals found signs of crime wherever they looked.
 
 Wire transfers were layered. Consultancies flourished. Incoming cash was used to pay former investors – behaviour more commonly associated with Ponzi schemes. 
 The entire deal seemed designed to divert public money into private pockets.
 And investigators believe it was done with the help of Joseph Muscat and his chief enablers, Keith Schembri and  Konrad Mizzi, who shielded the concession from scrutiny and ignored reports of criminal activity, while they privately fostered personal relationships with key actors.
 The bigger plan
 Investigators believe Vitals – and later Steward – stakeholders had no intention of running Maltese hospitals for the 30-year lease period they agreed to. The real aim, they say, was to quickly find a higher bidder to sell the concession to.
 There was massive money to be made: the 30-year deal has been conservatively valued at €4 billion, and a 2017 study by PwC calculated it would generate €2.2 billion just through medical tourism.
 Selling a business is not a crime. But prosecutors suspect key players involved in the deal did a great deal more than that. According to calculations made by Vitals’ own financial chief, around €26 million was stolen in just the first two years of the 30-year deal.
 Companies that provided services to the hospitals – from cleaning to catering, IT to engineering – were allegedly required to fork out a 10% kickback in exchange for that business.
 Individuals suspected of having a hidden interest in the deal were given massive consultancy contracts, or deals guaranteeing them one-off success fees and settlement payments. 
 And Maltese government money intended for the hospitals was secretly used to purchase companies that were then given hugely lucrative deals by the hospitals, investigators believe.
 The Vitals concession
 Investigators were tasked with parsing the now-cancelled hospitals deal to identify patterns of suspected criminal behaviour.
 It was a difficult task, given the complex web of companies and contracts investors used to structure the concession. And the job was made even more difficult because many of the companies involved were based in secrecy jurisdictions like Dubai and Switzerland, which do not share company or tax information.
 Vitals and Steward received hundreds of millions of euros through the concession between 2016 and 2023, when a civil court annulled the entire deal on the basis of fraud.
 That money was intended to be used to run Karin Grech, St Luke’s and Gozo General hospitals. The investors were also contractually bound to invest millions to revamp those facilities – work they never did. 
  Throughout the concession period, money moved through multiple companies, in different countries, using a network of lawyers, auditors and accountants. In some cases, money sent to some people appears to have then been forwarded to others.
 Practically all the companies involved stopped filing audited accounts from the moment they were involved in the hospitals concession, making it easier to obscure money flows.
 How much money vanished?
 Given the elaborate way in which money was extracted from the concession and moved, it is hard to quantify the total amount of money that investigators believe was misappropriated in all.
 What is clear is that it runs into millions. Vitals’ own financial controller, Saba Abbas, calculated that around €26 million was misappropriated between June 2016 and November 2017 – more than half of all the money Vitals received from the government by that point.
 That €26 million calculation does not include millions more paid to key players through deals structured as consultancy payments or success fees.
 Investigators’ work has led to prosecutors filing criminal charges against dozens of people involved in the deal, including Muscat, Schembri and Mizzi, Ali and other Vitals and Steward shareholders, managers, lawyers, accountants and civil servants.
  All those alleged to have taken money have insisted they are innocent of charges. Muscat has called the investigation a “political vendetta”.
 “The institutions are working – working against Labourites,” he said last month.
 Mizzi has called the charges he faces based on “pure conjecture” and said he received no money through the deal.
 Schembri described the prosecution as “lies and presumptions” and also denied “ever receiving any money from any person mentioned in the inquiry [into the hospitals concession”.
 Steward has argued that it was the one defrauded, saying it was duped into taking over from Vitals on the back of false promises by the Muscat-led government.
 Money flowed in two main directions.
 Huge amounts moved to companies linked to, or controlled by, Shaukat Ali Chaudhry or his family, lending credence to investigators’ suspicions that the Pakistani businessman was the secret owner of Vitals.
 Money also moved from Vitals to another group of Ali-linked companies in Switzerland. These companies also disbursed money to Ali and his associates. But they also paid others linked to the deal, like Joseph Muscat, and served as the vehicle for a “political support fund” that Steward established.
 Cash injections from the Maltese government generally triggered a flurry of financial activity. Vitals habitually made seven- and eight-figure payments to its parent company Bluestone within days of receiving Maltese taxpayers’ money.
 In all, over €21 million was transferred from Vitals to Bluestone between 2016 and the first two months of 2018.
  A 2023 Times of Malta  investigation shed light on some of the things that money bought: luxury hotel stays, cars, private school tuition and even Netflix subscriptions. Vitals director Ram Tumuluri said that money came from “investor sources”, not Maltese concession funds.
 Bluestone would also make payments of its own. In one case, it sent a company called Mount Everest a €3 million ‘success fee’ for having won the Malta deal. Mount Everest is linked to Shaukat Ali Chaudry, a Pakistani businessman who was based in Gaddafi’s Libya before shifting focus to Malta after the Libyan dictator was killed.
 Ali has also denied any wrongdoing, telling  Times of Malta he was never a Vitals shareholder and that claims to the contrary come from “untrustworthy, unreliable and unstable people and sources”.
 1. How the money flowed: Consultancies
 Ali was not a Vitals shareholder – at least not on paper. But he was the single largest beneficiary of the hospitals deal. His companies, sons and wives received millions from Vitals and companies linked to it, while other companies linked to him sent money to others involved in the deal, including Joseph Muscat.
 Consultancy work can be legitimate. But it is also a known method for laundering money and masking illicit payments, as the value of consultancy work is subjective.
 Vitals and Steward paid some eye-watering figures for nebulous consultancy work.
 Ali was engaged as a ‘senior consultant’ on a €100,000-a-month deal. One company linked to him, STE Health, got a €400,000-a-month consultancy deal with Vitals. Another Ali-controlled firm, Global Asset Holdings, charged Vitals €340,000 over 14 months. In theory, that money was to provide a ‘procurement consultant’. Investigators found nothing to justify that expense.
 The money flows continued when Steward Health Care bought out Vitals, investigators concluded.
 Eurasia, owned by one of Ali’s sons, charged Steward €400,000 to carry out ‘global healthcare feasibility studies’ to run hospitals in Ghana and Macedonia. Steward also paid yet another Ali-linked company an €80,000-a-month fee for consultancy work, investigators found.
 Consultancy also looms large in this case with regard to another defendant facing criminal charges – Joseph Muscat.
 Muscat received four payments of €15,000 each over a four-month period from an Ali-linked company, Accutor AG, shortly after he resigned as prime minister. The payments were flagged as suspicious by banks and stopped suddenly. The deal was meant to run for 36 months, for a total of €540,000. 
 Muscat says the money was for legitimate consultancy work that had nothing to do with the Maltese hospitals. Investigators believe the payments fit the modus operandi adopted by Ali and his business network and note that no evidence of Muscat’s work has been found.
 Just as Muscat started receiving payments, another man facing charges in connection with the deal, Konrad Mizzi, was also engaged as a consultant by a company linked to Accutor AG, Ikons Global.
 Mizzi says he never received any payments from Ikons and denies wrongdoing.
 Keith Schembri also had a relationship with the Accutor group. Unlike Muscat and Mizzi, his ties appeared to be longer-term: he was in extensive contact with Accutor chairman Wasay Bhatti about various international projects the group appeared to be planning, in places like Tunisia and the Philippines. 
 Other key figures, like Bluestone’s official owners Ram Tumuluri and Mark Pawley, also allegedly received millions, though investigators believe those two were essentially figureheads who were obliged to then pass money on to others.
 2. How the money flowed: Kickbacks
 More broadly, investigators believe that public money was also extracted from the concession through a network of kickback arrangements with Vitals’ various suppliers.
 Companies contracted to provide all sorts of services – from cleaning to construction, IT to medical procurement, catering to payroll – all seemed to have arrangements in place that allegedly required them to pay 10% backhanders to key players in the concession.
  There appeared to be a boilerplate structure for such arrangements, with a Tunisia-based company, Incorp, playing a major role.
 Incorp was established in 2009 with Ali’s two sons, Asad and Wajid, as its majority shareholders. In early 2017, just as Bank of Valletta asked Vitals for details about Incorp’s shareholders, the Ali brothers vanished from the company’s official structures. Yasar Zafar, a Tunisian involved in other Ali family companies, became Incorp’s sole shareholder.
 Contracts unearthed by investigators indicate construction, cleaning and catering companies hired by Vitals were to pay a 10% kickback on those contracts to Incorp.
 They estimate that the company received well over €1 million in such payments.
 3. How the money flowed: Procurement
 There was a third, more creative way in which the hospitals deal is alleged to have churned out money for its architects: by controlling hospital procurement. 
 One way it allegedly did that was relatively straightforward: it engaged a company owned by Ali’s sons, Eurasia, as the hospitals’ suppliers of IT equipment. Eurasia is the same company that charged Vitals €400,000 to carry out feasibility studies.
 Another method was far more complex.
 Investigators believe key players quietly bought two companies contracted to supply the hospitals, without using a cent of their own money.
 The first, Mtrace, was a medical equipment company developing an expensive cancer treatment device called a cyclotron.
 
 The second, Technoline, had a broader remit: that of exclusively supplying the three privatised hospitals with medicines and medical equipment.
 Prosecutors believe that in both cases, Maltese taxpayer funds were used to secretly buy the companies, on behalf of hidden shareholders that would then profit from the companies’ advantageous positions.
 Vitals spent €2.3 million of concession money on Mtrace and its cyclotron project. But the project went nowhere, the cyclotron languished unused for years, and Steward eventually pawned the company off to Malta Enterprise for €2 million.
 That suggests the concessionaire first used Maltese public money to secretly purchase Mtrace and fund cyclotron development, then charged Maltese taxpayers a second time to sell the company and failed cyclotron project back to them.
 Technoline cost more to purchase – roughly €5 million – and documents suggest that money came from a Jersey-based, Vitals-linked company in the form of a loan note.
 Literally weeks after Technoline came under new ownership, Vitals handed it a contract to act as the hospitals’ exclusive procurement partner. That meant all medical procurement had to go through the firm, rather than the open market.
 Technoline’s bottom line revved up 20% in its first year after the deal, then continued to see average year-on-year growth of 10%. A Steward-commissioned report calculated that the exclusivity deal led to €1.2 million in overpayments in just 10 months.
 Steward gradually wound back that deal, and Technoline’s parent company, Gateway Solutions, used its hefty annual dividends to rapidly pay back the loan that funded its purchase.
 On paper, the benefits of the lucrative deal flowed to the company’s stated owner, Ivan Vassallo. But investigators believe Vassallo was just a front for other, secret shareholders.
  The Muscat government’s role 
 Maltese government officials were aware that not all was well with the concession, documents indicate.
 In June 2016, before Vitals started operations, Muscat received an e-mail warning him about the company’s legitimacy. He forwarded that e-mail without comment to Schembri, who passed it on to Mizzi.
 Three weeks later, a private analysis group engaged by Malta Enterprise concluded that Vitals’ parent company did not have the experience or capital to manage the hospitals concession.
 The deal went ahead anyway.
 Schembri and Mizzi often exchanged e-mails with key players like Tumuluri on their private e-mail addresses. Schembri used six different e-mail addresses to discuss the deal – including one using the alias ‘Frank Pillow’.
 The Muscat-led government consistently pushed back financial deadlines to ensure Vitals and Steward were not deemed in default. Schembri knew from late 2017 that Vitals believed its own director, Tumuluri, had misappropriated millions of euro. Mizzi arranged for Steward to get a €100 million payment if it lost the hospitals deal.
 All those alleged to have profited from the hospitals concession deny wrongdoing, and say the charges they face are based on investigators misinterpreting or misrepresenting facts. Some of those, including Muscat, Schembri and Mizzi, will be arraigned in court next week. Vassallo, Sladden and Hillman will also be charged this week.
 Others, including Shaukat Ali, Armin Ernst, Ralph de la Torre,  Ram Tumuluri and Mark Pawley, are also expected to face charges.

Revised plans and video renders reveal how Malta’s first crematorium could look,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/revised-plans-video-renders-reveal-malta-first-crematorium-look.1100359,31-10-2024,"003720.png,003721.png,003722.png,003723.png,003724.png,003725.png","A funeral company that intends to set up Malta’s first crematorium has submitted revised plans for the facility and visual mock-ups of how it could look.
 The plans were submitted to the Planning Authority by Active Group, which owns Camilleri Funeral Directors.
 The facility will be built on land close to the Addolorata cemetery in Paola.
 The renders show a multi-level crematorium surrounded by tree-lined walkways. Building schematics on the PA website show it containing two columbariums – used for storing urns holding cremated remains – a viewing room and a multi-purpose hall.
 The schematics also show two underground reservoirs, a cold room, reception area, garage and store. The plans for the facility also show grass surroundings including a ‘cremation garden’.
  Active Group Ltd director Johann Camilleri told Times of Malta the plans had been redesigned to conform with PA guidelines for crematoriums rubber-stamped by the planning minister in September.
 He said the changes included reducing the area of the facility from around 700 square metres to 500 square metres and lowering the building’s height.
 Aesthetic changes have been made to reduce the visual impact and better blend with the environment, he said, pointing to alternative building materials and the use of the more “earthy colours” in the new designs.
 Earlier on Thursday, Luqa local council added its voice to that of Paola council, objecting to the plans and calling for an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) while raising concerns over air pollution.
  Responding to the concerns, Camilleri said an EIA was “in progress” and his company was “investing in state-of-the-art equipment with the lowest possible emissions found in the industry,” adding there was “no better alternative.”
 He stressed the distance of the facility to nearby residences was “well within required parameters.”
 Camilleri added that the video renders of the site were conceptual and for illustrative purposes only and not for direct interpretation.
 The new plans submitted to the PA are currently being reviewed, according to the funeral company’s Facebook post.
  The long-awaited guidelines limit cremation facilities to 7.7 metres in height and say they must use the best air-filtering technology on the market while meeting emission targets.
 Crematoriums cannot be built in sensitive areas such as agricultural land, scheduled sites or industrial zones and should be easily accessible.
 Constraints are also placed on the building layout, which should include a mortuary, viewing room, cremation chamber and post-cremation room. Cematoriums should also have a garden of remembrance with a columbarium.
  Malta legalised cremation in 2019, allowing for cremation services to be added to existing cemeteries, with Parliament approving the Cremation Act, legalising standalone crematoria, some three years later.
 While several applications for the development of standalone crematoria have been submitted to the PA since, progress towards building one has been slow due to planning and environmental concerns.
 Meanwhile, families who wanted to cremate their loved ones have been forced to turn to companies in Sicily or the UK – a service that can cost around €4,500.

 A Swiss firm that paid Joseph Muscat as a ""consultant"" had a secret backdoor deal to receive 30% of Steward Health Care's dividends from its “fraudulent” hospitals deal. 
 It is the first time that details of the secret agreement have become known.
 A magisterial inquiry into the failed hospitals deal which led prosecutors to file charges against Muscat and dozens of others only mentions it in passing.
 The secret deal granted the Swiss-based Accutor participation rights in Steward’s Maltese operation – essentially a share of a company’s profits through dividends and earnings.
 Muscat’s government facilitated the transfer of a €4 billion public contract for Steward to run the St Luke’s, Karin Grech and Gozo hospitals in February 2018, after the previous concessionaries Vitals Global Healthcare crashed out.
 Armin Ernst, who led Steward Malta after having served as CEO of its predecessor Vitals, signed off on the secret profit-sharing deal with Swiss firm Accutor Consulting one year later, in April 2019. 
  E-mails obtained by OCCRP and shared with  Times of Malta indicate the profits were intended for Pakistani businessman Shaukat Ali, who had previously held a  hidden interest in Vitals Global Healthcare.
 Ali faces charges of forming a criminal organisation with Muscat, Accutor Consulting owner Wasay Bhatti and others in connection with the “fraudulent” award of the hospitals contract.
  E-mails indicate that the ""substantial debts"" Steward Malta faced meant no dividends were paid out prior to a court terminating the hospitals contract in 2023. 
 Steward Malta did however pay over €7 million to Accutor between 2018 and 2020 for ""political consultants"", ""jet expenses"", ""lobbying"" and ""payroll services"".
 Nine months after the secret profit-sharing agreement was signed, Muscat was put on a €15,000-per-month consultancy by Bhatti. 
 Muscat received four payments totalling €60,000 in payments, two of which came from Accutor Consulting, the same company that was a party to the agreement.
 Investigators suspect the consultancy contract was used as cover to pass on hospitals deal kickbacks to Muscat.
 The ex-prime minister, however, insists the consultancy contract has no connection to the Malta deal. 
 The profit-sharing agreement also gave Accutor Consulting 30% of the equity value if Steward Malta was sold.  
  In a November 2022 e-mail, Ali wrote that he would be open to receiving payments that would help “consolidate” his position via an “exit clause” of “100M,” without giving further detail. 
 Muscat’s government had signed a deal with Steward, guaranteeing it a €100 million government payout if the hospitals contract was terminated.
 A court order to annul the hospitals deal also struck down that side deal. Steward and the Maltese government are currently locked in international arbitration proceedings over that €100 million payment. 
 
 Ali and Bhatti declined to comment when contacted about the secret profit-sharing agreement, citing a court-imposed gag order.
 Muscat and Steward did not respond to a request for comment.
 However, in later comments to Times of Malta following publication, Muscat's lawyer said the ex-prime minister is ""completely extraneous"" to the agreement and had no knowledge of the arrangement. 
 Muscat's lawyer said reference in the criminal inquiry to the agreement ""does not pertain"" to his client.
 ""It is also worth noting that publicly available information shows that Accutor Consulting AG is not owned by the individuals in question [Shaukat Ali and his son Asad], raising doubts about their ability to enter into agreements through this company,"" Muscat's lawyer said. 
 A four-year criminal inquiry into the hospitals deal makes fleeting references to a participation rights agreement, however, investigators appear to have been unable to unearth the full details of it.
 In June 2019, according to the inquiry, Steward Malta boss Armin Ernst forwarded “drafts” of two agreements to a Steward employee. 
 Ernst instructed the employee to “Please delete these files immediately!!!!” after printing them.
 The inquiry report speculates that Ernst may have been keen to delete the files as they would have revealed the existence of the “unnamed participant” granted rights over dividends from Steward Malta.
  Investigators described Accutor as a central link for suspect payments and relationships made between key players in the hospitals deal, including Muscat, his chief of staff Keith Schembri and ex-minister Konrad Mizzi.
 Times of Malta has previously reported how Steward paid Accutor roughly €7.6 million between 2018 and 2020, with invoices and e-mails indicating the payments were for “political consultants,” “jet expenses”,  “lobbying” and ""payroll services.
 According to testimony by former Accutor director Kamal Sharma, the payments to Muscat stopped abruptly after Accutor’s bankers flagged them as suspicious. 
 As regulatory and media attention grew on Accutor in 2021, Ali’s son Asad asked Ernst if the profit-sharing agreement could be shifted away from the Swiss company “at the earliest”.
 A new agreement appears to have been drawn up, with the cut on the Malta dividends instead assigned to a Delaware-based company called K4C LLC. 
  In November 2022, Ali emailed Ernst, requesting payment under the profit-sharing deal, “in order for us to keep receiving funds as everyone else is getting paid from this operation”.
 Ali noted that the request for their money was an “ongoing embarrassing subject"".
 Ernst responded saying he would need to discuss it with Steward US boss Ralph de La Torre, but noted that “no dividends are being taken out of Malta at this stage” due to the “substantial debts” that had been accumulated.
 In February 2023, a civil court terminated the hospitals contract on fraud grounds.
 An appeal by Steward was dismissed in October 2023. 
 While the original court decision had pinned the blame for the ""fraudulent"" deal on Steward, the court of appeal said it also believed there was ""collusion between Steward and senior government officials or its agencies"".
 Steward’s US division filed for bankruptcy in May 2024.

 In a reaction, the shadow minister for health, Adrian Delia, said the latest developments further confirmed fraud in the granting of the hospitals concession. They showed secret manoeuvres to rob the people of Malta and Gozo, undermining their health. 
 Delia said the Nationalist Party would continue to seek the truth and insist on the reimbursement of the €400 million issued as part of the hospitals deal by the government.

Non-communicable diseases are Malta's main cause of death,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/noncommunicable-diseases-malta-main-cause-death.1094550,27-06-2024,"003828.png,003829.png","Non-communicable diseases are the main cause of morbidity, disability and deaths in Malta and worldwide, according to a new report.
 NCDs are described as diseases of long duration, not infectious, and result of a combination of genetic, physiological, environmental, and behavioural factors. This includes cardiovascular diseases, mental health conditions, diabetes, obesity, cancer, and chronic lung diseases.
 The Health Ministry and the Superintendence of Public Health on Thursday launched the Policy Framework for the Prevention of Non-Communicable diseases and Promotion of Wellbeing.
 In 2019, almost 91 per cent of all deaths in Malta were caused by an NCD.
 The framework proposes reorienting health services towards prevention, creating healthier environments, and boosting health literacy and emergency preparedness to decrease mortality rates.
 It stresses that the strategy must focus on data-driven decision-making and advocates for an overarching government and societal approach.
  Health Minister Jo Etienne Abela said the impact these diseases have on our country and population is not insignificant.
 ""It is, in fact, very big,"" he told a conference in Valletta.
 Charmaine Gauci, the Superintendent of Public Health, described the burden of NCDs as enormous, particularly the economic burden created by direct medical costs and indirect costs due to a loss of productivity.
 Gauci, an expert in disease prevention, highlighted that NCDs are largely preventable through effective interventions.
 She suggested eight priority areas to focus on for NCD prevention, including the reduction of tobacco use, reduction of alcohol use, reduction of obesity, access to a healthy diet, an increase in physical activity, promotion of mental health, promotion of environmental health and early diagnosis.
 The WHO Regional Office for Europe supported the framework through the WHO - Malta Country Cooperation Strategy 2022-26, which is aligned with the WHO’s Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of NCDs.

Malta’s first crematorium could open its doors within two years,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/malta-first-crematorium-open-doors-two-years.1098745,29-09-2024,"004102.png,004103.png","Malta’s first crematorium could be up and running within two years, according to a funeral director with plans to build and operate one in Paola.
 Johann Camilleri told Times of Malta his team was revising plans submitted three years ago to conform with planning rules for crematoriums approved by the government last month.
 He said his company Active Group Limited was having to downsize its original plans for a 700-square-metre site to one of 500 square metres – the maximum allowed by the new policy – but remained committed to the project.
 “It is less feasible, but still doable... It will mean a couple of months delay, but this gives our engineers time to see how to reduce the size of the plans,” he said.  
 
 Camilleri said his company was aiming to submit revised plans to the PA by the end of next month and was hoping to offer cremation within the next two years.  
 In 2021, his company Active Group Limited applied to build a crematorium on private land close to the Addolorata cemetery, a location Camilleri described as “ideal” for the facility.
 Addolorata is Malta’s main cemetery and has been in use since the 1860s, although evidence suggests the Tal-Ħorr hill it was built on has been in use for burial purposes since prehistoric times.
 Malta legalised cremation in 2019, permitting cremation services to be offered at existing cemeteries, and in 2022 introduced the Cremation Act, legalising standalone crematoriums.  
 But it would be another two years until a policy for the development of such facilities was approved, with Planning Minister Clint Camilleri rubber-stamping the final guidelines last month, paving the way for companies to turn their ideas into tangible proposals.
  
 Camilleri stressed that despite the development of crematoriums now being given the green light by authorities, “the most important question is how many companies will be allowed to build one”. 
 Warning of the dangers of the sector becoming a “free-for-all”, he said that with estimated demand representing between 500 to 1,000 requests for cremations annually – between 10 and 20 per cent of the around 5,000 deaths per year – it was not feasible to have more than one operator in the country.
 “Malta cannot take more than one crematorium; if there were two, it is very likely they would both go bust... I know for a fact there isn’t the demand to sustain more than one,” he said.  
 Explaining that his planned crematorium represented an investment of around €3 million, Camilleri said his company would be “less willing to invest in top-quality equipment” if the sector was opened up to the free market.  
 Pressed on whether such a warning represented a desire to create a monopoly, he said the government could avoid the dangers associated with monopolies by issuing a tender for a crematorium operator, allowing it to set prices and guarantee quality standards. 
 “Cremation should not be left up to the market,” he said, warning such a scenario could allow “inexperienced operators” to begin operating, driving down standards. 
 However, he said his company would “go ahead anyway” if the government did not decide to issue a tender, pointing to his company’s acquisition of the Paola site and the money it had already poured into research and development for the project.
 Times of Malta understands that at least one other company also has plans to open a crematorium within the next years.
  The newly announced policy, a partial review of existing cemetery regulations, offers design guidelines for standalone crematoriums. 
 It specifies appropriate locations, how the crematorium should be designed sustainably, and ensures compliance with environmental and health regulations. 
 The building should take up no more than 500 square metres and the main structure cannot be taller than 7.7 metres. Additionally, the crematorium must be situated at least 183 metres away from any residential buildings.
 Crematoriums not part of a cemetery will only be considered if outside the development zone but up to 1.5km from the boundary of principal urban areas. In Gozo, cremation facilities will only be considered in Rabat and Xewkija.
 Until now, families wishing to cremate their loved ones had to send the body to Sicily or the UK, a service costing around €4,500.
 The issue came to the fore recently after well-known performer Roger Tirazona spoke about the distress of failing to fulfil his dying father’s wish of having his body cremated and taken to the Philippines.

Concerns raised about youth self-harm rates,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/concerns-raised-youth-selfharm-rates.1096004,08-05-2024,"004262.png,004263.png,004264.png,004265.png","The rate of young people contemplating suicide is gradually increasing with NGOs calling for more to be done to address the mental health of young men and women.
 Richmond Foundation and Victim Support Malta said that today’s young people face an array of pressures that range from the financial, environmental and emotional. All these pressures are exacerbated by social media that amplifies expectations of unrealistic perfection.
 Data obtained from the police about the rates of suicides and attempted suicides by people under 24 has shown a gradual increase over the last decade. Last year five people between the ages of 15 and 24 ended their own life: the highest number since 2014.
 The pattern was reflected in the number of young people who attempted to commit suicide: with 19 people under the age of 24 – including one under 14 – trying to end their life in the first six months of the year – the same amount as the total for 2021.
  The police data shows that the bulk of people who died by suicide in the past decade were men. In fact, 230 out of the 277 total people who died by suicide since 2014 were male. This pattern was also seen in the younger age groups: 22 out of the 29 people under 24 who died by suicide since 2014 were boys.
 “The rise in suicide rates among young people, particularly males, is a complex issue with multifaceted causes.
 “Factors such as academic pressure, social media and societal expectations that often stifle emotional expression can contribute to this alarming trend,” said Gestalt psychotherapist Lynn Sammut, who heads the Well-being Services at Richmond Foundation.
 Sammut is concerned about the mental health of young people. There has been an increase in young people reaching out for help and saying they were having thoughts about suicide, she says.
 “We have also had many young men and their loved ones contacting us as the struggles with relationships and break-ups have a reported high impact on their well-being and at times reportedly result in contemplation of suicide,” she said.
  Karl Grech, from the NGO Victim Support Malta, also raised concerns about the mental health of young people.
 “This period of young adulthood is often marked by individuals trying to determine their life path, leading to feelings of falling behind peers. In today’s world, social media can exacerbate this issue by creating the illusion that everyone else’s lives are perfect, while one’s own life may seem lacking in comparison,” he said.
 Sammut said that Malta’s socio-economic and environmental landscape presents specific challenges for young people. Several factors contribute to the mental health crisis among this demographic.
 These included economic pressures: “While Malta has experienced economic growth, the cost of living, particularly housing, has risen significantly, impacting young people’s financial stability and future prospects. This can lead to increased anxiety and stress,” she said.
 There were also educational challenges as the Maltese education system faced pressures related to overcrowding and teacher shortages.
  Then came social pressures: “A highly competitive job market, coupled with traditional societal expectations and environmental concerns,” she said adding that Malta’s small size and increasing population density contributed to environmental challenges such as traffic congestion, air pollution and limited green spaces.
 “Addressing these issues requires a multi-faceted approach that involves investing in mental health services, improving educational opportunities, creating sustainable economic growth, and prioritising environmental protection,” she said.
 Grech, from Victim Support Malta, said: “Today’s reality is characterised by faster-paced living, less space, fewer green areas to unwind, more chaos, and more work. This leaves people feeling stressed and overwhelmed. Growth should be approached differently to ensure an adequate quality of life for all members of our society.”
  He spoke about the need to invest in a national mental health system at all levels, from primary schools to the broader community.
 “Increasing the number of multidisciplinary mental health professionals in schools can help identify and address issues early, working on both students and their families. As the work done with a student is irrelevant without addressing the issues stemming from the family unit,” he said.
 There was need for more mental health professionals within the community to assist individuals in processing issues that arise at both individual and family levels.
 “Providing distress tolerance skills and psychoeducational tools to both children and adults can help them understand and manage their emotions and experiences,” he said, adding that research had shown a link between lack of expressing emotion and suicidal ideation.
 If you have been affected by suicide, Victim Support Malta offers a free and confidential multidisciplinary therapeutic service. Contact 2122 8333 or e-mail info@victimsupport.org.mt. Richmond Foundation has supported many people through their Olli chat, 1770 helpline and free therapy services.

'Vitals saga threatens Malta's reputation and foreign investment': SMEs Chamber,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/vitals-saga-threatens-malta-reputation-foreign-investment.1092174,05-09-2024,004534.png,"The fallout from the Vitals' saga is tarnishing Malta's reputation and threatening prospective foreign investment, the Chamber of SMEs warned on Thursday. 
 The warning was sounded following the publication of survey results showing that business owners in Malta are mostly concerned about good governance.
 CEO Abigail Agius Mamo told journalists the survey was held before news that a four-and-a-half-year inquiry into the government hospitals' concession deal had been concluded. 
 That inquiry has led to criminal charges levelled at former prime minister Joseph Muscat, current deputy prime minister  Chris Fearne, Central Bank governor Edward Scicluna and several others.  
 Agius Mamo added that had the survey been carried out today, the ""results would have been much worse"".
 Some 400 owners of micro, small, medium and large businesses participated in the survey, claiming that good governance was their top concern, followed by overpopulation, inflation and corruption.
 ""Foreign investors seek our reputation: good reputation attracts reputable investment; bad reputation attracts bad investments,"" Agius Mamo said, warning that politicians set an example via their actions.   
 ""We are constantly urging good business practice: pay taxes and obey the law, but if those at the top don't set a good example, we will face many more problems further down"".  
 SME chamber president Paul Abela said he was especially concerned about Robert Abela's reaction to news that the inquiry had been concluded, comparing the prime minister's statements with those of former prime minister Dom Mintoff.   
 ""The prime minister said he wants to revise how inquiries are conducted.... we used to hear those sort of statements in Mintoff's time. Mintoff used to change the judges when he knew a case would be decided against him,"" Abela claimed.
 Abela has heaped scorn on a magisterial inquiry concerning the Vitals hospitals deal that triggered criminal charges against top political figures, initially claiming the magistrate was purposely delaying the conclusions.
 Once concluded, Abela said that while he did not have a copy of the document, the inquiry was biased and that sections of the judiciary were part of an ""establishment"" that was out to destroy the Labour Party. 
 Employers' bodies,  President Myriam Spiteri Debono,  law students, NGOs, a  former chief justice and politicians have all expressed concern over his comments.
 The SME barometer for the first quarter of this year was conducted by the Chamber of SMEs and MISCO.
 Among others, business owners were asked for the ""two most important issues the country is facing"" that they would like the government to do something about.
 Thirty-three per cent flagged a lack of good governance while a quarter of the respondents mentioned corruption.   
 Thirty-one per cent meanwhile raised concern over overpopulation while 30 per cent said inflation was a top issue for them. 
 Owners were also asked about the challenges that their business was facing. 
 Shortage of employees was by far the biggest issue, with over 40 per cent saying it was one of the two most significant problems for them. 
 However, MISCO director Lawrence Zammit said that rather than a shortage of people, lack of skills was the main issue. 
 Inflation was flagged as the second biggest challenge by a little over a quarter of respondents.
 Almost three-quarters of those surveyed believe the country is headed in the wrong direction. That figure is slightly lower than 2023's last quarter when 80 per cent said Malta is in the wrong direction.

She sat still, staring into thin air for about 10 minutes.
 When she snapped back into awareness she started sobbing. She knew something was terribly wrong with her.
 Rosa was 71 when she was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease. Her brain was dying, her memories were fading away and, perhaps most painfully, she knew it.
 Her daughter, Anne Cuschieri, witnessed the process up close. Anne, the youngest of three siblings, became her mother’s carer and supported her ageing father as he dealt with the heartbreak of being forgotten by the woman he loved.
  Dementia is an umbrella term that refers to several conditions and symptoms associated with a decline in memory or other thinking skills, severe enough to reduce a person’s ability to perform everyday activities.
 Alzheimer’s is the most common type of dementia, causing problems with memory, thinking and behaviour. Symptoms usually develop slowly and get worse over time, becoming severe enough to interfere with daily tasks.
 “My mother knew there was something very wrong with her and she was terrified,” says Anne, sitting in the living room of her Sliema apartment.
 Anne recalls how the family first realised there was a problem when her mother began repeating herself. Soon after the repeating started, the trances followed.
  After consultation with doctors and psychologists, her mother was put on medication to try to slow down the progress of the disease.
 The first years were the hardest.
 “Relatives suffer tremendously. But the dementia patient suffers a million times more. The beginning is very hard. They know there is something wrong with them and they know they are losing their memory,” says Anne.
 The family decided to be open about the condition, informing neighbours because they needed their support.
 Caring for her mother was exhausting for both herself and her father, Joe. So, after some time, Anne – together with her husband and their two children – moved from their Naxxar home to Sliema to be closer by.
  “She started escaping from my father – who had a history of heart disease. She would cross the road without looking and come to me and ring the doorbell and start crying to be let in. She’d say: ‘I want my mummy’. They live in the past. Then she would come upstairs. I’d sit her down and call my father and tell him she is here.
 “She would talk about ‘a stranger’ in the house – referring to my father. Then she would say she has to go because the children are alone at home. There was huge confusion. I’d tell her: ‘Ma, I’m your child’. I don’t know who I was to her when she was talking to me,” Anne says.
  The family tried hard to keep their mother at home – a place that was familiar to her. But things started getting out of hand.
 “She stopped recognising my father. He started locking the door and she started climbing out of the ground-floor window. I was a mess – coping with work, with my father and my mother. I was even helping with my father’s sister – my aunt – who lived round the corner and had dementia too,” Anne says.
 Her aunt, May Borg, had vascular dementia. She wrote down parts of her life story on a calendar to remember who she was.
 “Even she knew she was losing her memory. They grab onto that and they are terrified. They stop wanting to meet people and go out because they know they can’t handle a conversation.”
 Anne’s two older brothers, who both live abroad, supported from afar. She also had great support from her employer who allowed her the flexibility to be able to care for her parents.
 Eventually the family had to move Rosa into a care home.
 “My mum would wake up in the middle of the night and go to the kitchen and start defrosting and eating chicken. She would walk into the shower with her clothes on. My father was weak and could not rest. We were both exhausted: physically, psychologi­cally and emotionally. We were judged with comments such as: ‘I kept my mum with me till the end.’”
  Moving Rosa out of the house and into a care home was traumatic for all.
 The family was also dealing with Joe’s complications from heart surgery and Anne’s diagnosis with cancer.
 As the years passed, Rosa’s condition deteriorated. She died in 2012, 12 years after her diagnosis.
 “You are grieving from the first day because you are losing the person. My father went through moments of frustration. He was a very calm man, but he was very tired. When she moved into a home, he went to visit her every day. He would tell us that he married her in sickness and in health and until death do them part.”
 He died a year later.
  Throughout this, Anne had the support of her family and the Malta Dementia Society. She is now working to ensure that support is even more visible and accessible for people with dementia and their families, and has taken on a more active role in the society.
 Charles Scerri, an associate professor at the University of Malta’s Department of Pathology and co-founder of the Society, said it is beneficial for people with dementia to live in the community if possible as this allows them to remain in a familiar environment.
 This is why early diagnosis is important as it allows for better treatment and gives the person a chance to take decisions.
 While Malta has made great strides in the dementia field, there was still a lack of trained staff and specialisation.
  He spoke about the need for more awareness about how dementia is impacting society. Dementia costs more than cancer and cardiovascular disease. International figures show that dementia costs between €23,000 and €28,000 per person per year.
 Scerri spoke about the need for more investment and about the importance of employment flexibility for filial caregivers.
 According to Eurostat data published last October, Malta recorded the highest rate of deaths caused by dementia in Europe, with just over 80 deaths per 100,000 people in 2020. A total of 6,552 were registered to have dementia in 2018. That figure is expected to reach 14,117 by 2050. 
 This year, the government launched the seven-year National Dementia Strategy.
  The Malta Dementia Society offers support to people with dementia and their loved ones in care homes and in the community. Services include DancingToDementia for people with dementia; Reaching Hands Support Group for relatives; the Malta Dementia Working Group for people living with early dementia; and Kuluri u Tifkiriet, which is a reminiscence art therapy programme for people with dementia.
 Services also include talks, legal support, psychotherapy and cultural outings. In September the society will be holding a conference to mark its 20th anniversary.

 Inspirational Nicky Sansone died on Thursday, two weeks after throwing a party to celebrate her life when told of her terminal cancer.
 She recorded her life with cancer on Tiktok and uploaded her last video just on Wednesday, urging her followers to “enjoy life, live, love, and smile”. 
 Lying in bed, she said it was her last video and thanked her followers before saying in a faint voice: ""Live, love and smile"".
 Sansone, 55, told Times of Malta last week that she decided to throw a party in celebration of her life after being told she had weeks to live.
 Doctors had told her they feared she might not make it to her birthday on August 24.
  “We had to bring it forward because they don't think I will make it until then. It ended up being a bigger event with over 120 people. I was overwhelmed,” she had said.
 Sansone was diagnosed with cancer in November and immediately resorted to TikTok to record her battle and her views of life, urging people to check out any symptoms immediately.
 “Smile, live, love and enjoy life to the fullest,” was the message s
  “For many people, it’s life-work-life-work. They forget to live. The world has become so sad. Enjoy life. Stop fighting. Stop complaining. Live. People worry about such stupid things.  I did too,"" she said. 
  “Some people don’t cherish what they have until it’s gone. So, if you have something and it’s good focus on the good,” she said in an interview with Times of Malta from her bed at the Sir Anthony Mamo Oncology Centre.
 Sansone believed her first symptoms came three years ago, when she started losing weight. But back then she attributed the weight loss to the fact that she had cut alcohol from her life completely.
 In November, she went for a swim with a friend and got so breathless that she had to get out of the water. She went to a doctor who sent her to get an X-ray immediately.
 She went to hospital and tests showed that her lungs were full of water.  She was diagnosed with stage 4 aggressive cancer and began chemotherapy. The cancer had spread and it was too risky to do anything.
 That was when she decided to throw a party to celebrate her life.
 Tributes for Sansone poured in as the sad news of her demise was announced. Most underlined her message: 'Live, love and smile.""
 The MGRM Malta Gay Rights Movement expressed its condolences to her partner and her family. ""We will keep Nicky's memory alive by taking her advice, and ""Live life, love and smile,"" the movement said.

 It was true however that patients had to wait for unacceptable periods of time for all government services as €400 million of investment had gone down the drain, and virtually zero investment had been made in infrastructure in the last 11 years, the union said. The minister had to be honest and admit this publicly and apologise to patients for this situation not blame those who did their best for patients in such unfortunate circumstances, the union said.
 Its reference to €400 million was the sum paid by the government to Vitals/Steward to run three public hospitals in a deal later annulled by the courts because of fraud. 
 Referring to other comments by the minister during a press conference on Tuesday, the union said it was disappointed that the health ministry had not discussed outsourcing of services with it. It pointed out that people in Malta paid €10,000 for an IVF procedure, when most centres in the European Union charged under €2000. 
 The union said it had refrained from publicly alarming the public about the sad decision taken by the health ministry for a ward specifically designed for critical patients needing ventilation to be closed and for patients to be placed in hospital wards which were not equipped for such patients. It said that since these critically ill patients were in danger of dying, respiratory physicians had written to the State Advocate to protest the ministry's decision.  
 The union said it was always ready for discussion but would not be a scapegoat for the government’s failure to sufficiently invest in the health infrastructure.
 In a statement later on Wednesday the Health Ministry denied the claims made by the MAM, saying that the association has been “obstructing” attempts at reform with a “confrontational and negative attitude”. 
 The ministry said it was “devious” to suggest that the ministerial inquiry somehow undermines the medical profession. 
 “It is high time that doctors, patients and society at large are made aware of the obstructive stance that MAM has persistently adopted in MAM-Government interactions. This stance has reached levels that are affecting the transformation of Healthcare Services and society’s expectations of delivery of care,” they said. 
 The ministry listed a number of reforms they say the MAM has “opposed, obstructed or slowed down”, which included: 
 The ministry said it nonetheless remains open to constructive discussion as it continued to hold with other trade unions.

"'This is no TV series' - Muscat pleads not guilty amid drama in court, outside",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/joseph-muscat-charged-bribery-corruption-court-pleads-not-guilty.1093148,29-05-2024,"004849.png,004850.png,004851.png,004852.png","Joseph Muscat pleaded not guilty to bribery, corruption and other crimes on Tuesday, as he entered court to the cheers and adulation of hundreds of supporters. 
 It was the first time in Maltese history that a former politician was charged with such crimes. If found guilty, he faces up to 18 years in prison. 
 The charges stem from a 2015 agreement with Vitals, a company with no healthcare experience, to redevelop three public hospitals. It led to accusations of massive financial mismanagement and corruption. 
 The former prime minister was one of 14 individuals and nine companies charged during Tuesday's historic court hearing.
 
 Among them were his former chief of staff Keith Schembri and former minister Konrad Mizzi. 
 The court session began at 11.30am and lasted more than eight hours, as the magistrate had to manage scores of lawyers following the attorney general’s decision to press charges against the defendants collectively. 
 It was an even longer day for some of the hundreds who answered Labour firebrand Manuel Cuschieri’s call to show up in Valletta to lend  Muscat their support.
 Many arrived early and hung around throughout the day, even after Cuschieri made a silent exit.
 They chanted, clapped and cheered as Muscat, Schembri and Mizzi entered court.
 Some insulted journalists tasked with reporting the event. 
  Inside the court, there was a flurry of legal arguments and procedural challenges. 
 The defence lawyers demanded that the attorney general substantiate the requested amounts for freezing orders with concrete evidence.
 Magistrate Rachel Montebello approved freezing order requests to the tune of millions against the various people facing charges, to defence lawyers’ protests.
 
 Seven hours into the sitting, Francesco Refalo from the AG’s office said the prosecution was asking the court to impose some bail conditions even though the accused were not charged under arrest.
 “And we’re asking this, especially after seeing certain public comments and statements and spin after these charges were filed.
 ""We want to avoid that this case is reduced to a trial by media. We want to protect proper administration of justice and so while this case is ongoing, we want the accused to refrain from further public comments.
 “Those comments are more appropriate to some TV series... And they may undermine the proper administration of justice.”
 He was asked to specify who was attacking the prosecution.
 Refalo pointed to comments by Muscat, Mizzi and Vitals auditor Chris Spiteri on social media as well as press conferences.
  The request by the AG’s office to impose restrictions on the accused drew strong reactions from defence lawyers who said it was an unfair request.
 They assured the court that their clients had no intention of absconding.
 The magistrate prohibited the parties and their lawyer from handing any parts of these records to third parties.
 Only faithful reporting of court proceedings is to be allowed.
 “The case is tried in court and court alone, not through the media. So, the parties and their lawyers are banned from handing any of the data to third parties or making any public comments about any testimonies or evidence in the proceedings,” the magistrate said.
 As for travel restrictions, the court did not prohibit the accused from travelling abroad but they must make sure to appear for every sitting so as not to stultify the proceedings.
 The court also reserved the right to set out further conditions at the next sitting or in the interim.
 To make sure they abide by this obligation the court imposed a personal guarantee of €25,000 on each of the accused.
 During the hearing, defence lawyer Edward Gatt questioned the involvement of a UK expert, referred to as “Sam” in the investigation. Gatt aimed to challenge the expert’s credibility and the procedures followed during the inquiry.
 All defence lawyers in fact registered their objection to all the the experts nominated in the magisterial inquiry.  
 The magistrate overseeing the case emphasised the relevance of the questions posed by Gatt and other defence attorneys, particularly regarding the validity of searches conducted at various locations, including Muscat’s residence.
 Testimonies confirmed that a search at Muscat’s home in 2021 was postponed due to a media leak, raising questions about the handling of information during the investigation.
  Former inspector Anthony Scerri, who participated in the Muscat home search, testified about the process and the involvement of foreign experts. Scerri confirmed that documents and devices were seized during multiple searches at locations connected to the accused, including the offices of Vitals auditor Chris Spiteri.
 But the details that emerged from the courtroom showed the police did not carry out a parallel investigation to the inquiry. They acted under magistrate’s instructions.
 Speaking last night, Opposition leader Bernard Grech said it was confirmed during the court sitting that the police did not actively investigate the hospitals' case.
 This, he said was shameful.
 He said he was warning Police Commissioner Angelo Gafà that he should not continue to serve those who had put him in his post and “controlling him”.
 Grech labelled Muscat and his associates as “political pirates” and criticised Robert Abela for defending them.
 Outside the courtroom, the atmosphere was charged with emotion. Dozens of Muscat’s supporters gathered, expressing their conviction that the charges were politically motivated attempts to undermine the Labour Party’s grip on government.
 
 They chanted slogans in support of Muscat, with some holding placards stating, “I am Joseph Muscat”, reflecting their unwavering loyalty to the former prime minister.
 When Muscat and other defendants finally emerged from court at 8.50pm, a good number were still there, determined to show their support to the very end.
 “This is a repetition of Christ’s story,” one man said, drawing parallels between Muscat’s prosecution and the persecution of Jesus Christ. The case is expected to be lengthy and complex, with significant implications for all parties involved.
 The case was adjourned to June 13 and 19.

Actress launches organ donation campaign after friend’s transplant,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/actress-launches-organ-donation-campaign-friend-transplant.1096886,24-08-2024,"004874.png,004875.png,004876.png","When her close friend had to be urgently airlifted to another country for a heart transplant, a renowned Maltese actress was inspired to start a campaign to encourage people to register as organ donors.
 Lara Azzopardi, known mostly for her roles in local television series and films, brought together the wife of the prime minister, the opposition leader and the health minister, among others, to remind people that their organs can live in other people after their death.
  Azzopardi, who is a nurse by profession, spent seven years working at the renal unit at Mater Dei Hospital and she admits the countless hours she spent working for people who suffered from kidney diseases opened her up to the good cause of organ donation.
 But it was her friend’s serious heart condition and urgent transplant that inspired her to go a step further and launch the campaign.
 When he was 17 he discovered he had cardiomyopathy – a condition that prevents the heart from pumping blood efficiently throughout the body – but managed to live with it normally for 35 years through periodical interventions. During a routine check-up last November, however, his doctor noticed that his heart had been behaving abnormally in the weeks prior to the appointment.
 That is when he was told he needed to be admitted to hospital urgently, and by the first week of December he was airlifted to Sicily to wait for a heart transplant, which he received on December 8.
 Doctors later told him that had he not gotten the transplant in time, he could have suffered a cardiac arrest that could have killed him at any moment, he told Times of Malta.
  Opposition Leader Bernard Grech joined the campaign, saying he and his wife had registered to become organ donors when they were just 22, and said one of the best gifts in life is giving part of oneself.
 Lydia Abela, the prime minister’s wife, said meeting people who need a heart transplant highlights the preciousness of life, and saving people’s lives is the ultimate gift of love.
 Health Minister JoEtienne Abela said that despite being always tragic and unpleasant, death can also be transformed into new life. An organ donor’s death can save up to eight other people’s lives, he said, which is why people should seriously consider registering as donors.
 PN MP Adrian Delia and Public Health Superintendent Charmaine Gauci also joined the campaign, sending out their own messages of hope and urging people to register to become organ donors.
 Anyone who has turned 16 can become an organ donor by signing up through eID on organdonation.gov.mt.
 Alternatively, people can request a registration form to be sent to them by post, which they then fill in and send back, or by filling in the form at Mater Dei’s renal unit.

‘I deleted all my social media apps. Friends thought something was wrong’,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/i-deleted-social-media-apps-friends-thought-something-wrong.1098102,16-09-2024,"004965.png,004966.png","A few weeks ago, Gisèle Degiorgio made a decision that would surprise many of her friends and colleagues. She deleted all social media apps from her phone.
 The 39-year-old pianist and music educator says she is already feeling the benefits. She now feels calmer, and her mind is “more clear and less bothered”.
 “This decision has actually removed from my mind the negativity of social media, such as discussions that turn into arguments and people venting as they immediately turn to social media,” she says.
 Gisèle is of the generation that remembers life before social media, first logging on to Facebook at the age of 22.
 As she grew older, the impact of social media became increasingly negative.
 “When I was younger, I used to see it differently. These were platforms to build connections. But then, as I grew older, I started to feel they are much more invasive. I have ‘followed the flock’ and shared posts and photos to share happy moments.
 ""But then I started to question: Do I need to know if she or he did this and that? I used to find myself wasting time and scrolling while looking at fake concepts of life: people posting about their happy moments painting a picture of perfection. Then, when someone dies, the platform goes to the other extreme,” she says.
 According to a report by MISCO for the Malta Chamber published earlier this year, 90 per cent of people in Malta say they access social media networks at least once a day.
 And Gisèle is not the only one to feel the negativity. Research has increasingly shown that social media can take a toll on mental health.
  Anton Grech, one of Malta’s leading psychiatrists, explains that social media creates pressure on two levels: unrealistic expectations and addiction. 
 People share posts of their best moments.
 “As a result, people are developing unrealistic expectations about their appearances and life. International research shows this is leading to increased cases of depression, especially among young females,” said Grech, clinical chairperson of Mental Health Services.
 The second issue is more insidious – addiction. People are getting addicted to the dopamine kick released in the brain when scrolling and being exposed to “new and exciting” information every couple of minutes. In some cases, this behavioural addiction is taking over people’s lives.
 While Gisèle’s experience didn’t reach that extreme, she still felt the need to step back.
 Her breaking point was when her young daughter asked her to put down her phone.
 “I didn’t want to be that parent who gets lost in my screen, so deleting social media apps is a start. At least I want to try and lead by example.”
 When Gisèle first joined Facebook, the intention was to connect with friends. She moved on to setting up a professional Facebook page and an Instagram account as life – and her career – progressed. 
 After becoming a mother to two children – now aged two and four – she joined online parenting groups in search of advice, but they left her feeling lost.
 “I realised that: I just need to figure it out, like my mother did,” she says.
  Six weeks ago, Gisèle deleted her social media apps. Now she only accesses her accounts from her computer, logging in briefly every other week to share posts about her work.
 When she shared a post announcing her decision, reactions were mixed. While relatives welcomed her brave decision to “detox” from social media, some colleagues were shocked by the idea.
 “Other friends thought something happened – like a cyberattack that drove me to withdraw from social media. Which of course it didn’t,” she said.
 Gisèle is pleased with her decision so far, and she can still communicate with friends via WhatsApp.
 “I do appreciate that social media can be an important tool to let people know about your work. But it was becoming too much. I know that one can choose what to follow on social media but, in the end, it remains a place where people feel the need to get approval, praise and support among many other things. It is not real life… Now I find that I am reading more articles. I hope to pick up a book soon, and my mind is more clear and much less bothered,” she says.
 The excessive use of social media is leading to more young people being diagnosed with behavioural addictions, according to Grech.
 “Over the years, we have seen an increase in this type of behavioural addiction. People seek help for symptoms such as anxiety, low morale, problems with relationships, or issues at work. And when you dig deeper, you find that the cause is social media addiction,” said Grech.
 Countries are beginning to take notice of the issue. This week, the Australian government announced plans to set a minimum age for social media use in response to growing concerns about mental and physical health. The law would make Australia one of the first countries in the world to impose such an age restriction.
 While some advocate for age limits, Grech believes education, not prohibition, is the answer.
 Grech explained there was an additional factor that was contributing to the negative impact of social media – the use of negative and hateful comments.
 “When you say something bad to someone’s face and see their reaction, a natural process kicks in, and you feel bad. This does not happen on social media. It is resulting in a society that is much more cynical and mistrusting,” he said.
 “We have reached a stage where people feel that, if they are not on social media, they are left out – they do not know what’s happening. It has become the new piazza (village square) in a world when we no longer meet face-to-face in the  piazza and get to really know one another.”

Edward Scicluna to be 'sacked' by Cabinet,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/edward-scicluna-sacked-cabinet.1095981,28-07-2024,"004977.png,004978.png","The government is planning to axe Edward Scicluna from his top role at the Central Bank in the coming week, should the governor continue to refuse to resign following a damning court decision.
 The Cabinet will likely make the final decision during a meeting on Tuesday, Times of Malta is informed.
 Scicluna is expected to be replaced by Alexander Demarco, who currently serves as the bank’s deputy governor. The Central Bank of Malta Act and European Central Bank legislation both state a governor can only be removed if found guilty of serious misconduct or if he no longer fulfills the conditions to perform their duties. Sources said the government will base its legal reasoning on the argument that Scicluna can no longer perform his duties because he will be facing trial.
 Government sources conceded that the former finance minister might have a legal argument to challenge the decision but added the government plans to go ahead anyway.
  Scicluna, along with former deputy prime minister Chris Fearne and 13 others, is in court over charges of fraud, misappropriation and fraudulent gain related to the privatisation of Gozo, Karin Grech and St Luke’s hospitals.
 All the accused learned on Wednesday that their case will go to trial after Magistrate Leonard Caruana ruled there is enough evidence ‘at first glance’ for the case to continue. All have insisted on their innocence.
 Following that decision, Prime Minister Robert Abela strongly indicated that Scicluna should step down as governor.
 
 “The correct decision for the Central Bank governor can be seen from the example set by the former deputy prime minister, Chris Fearne and the example set by permanent secretary Ronald Mizzi. I believe good sense will prevail. I believe the national interest will prevail, as will the interest of the sector currently overseen by Professor Scicluna,” Abela had said.
  Fearne resigned from the Cabinet as soon as charges were filed against him two months ago. Mizzi resigned on Wednesday. But Scicluna has refused to budge, telling Times of Malta  on Thursday morning that his position remained unchanged: “I will abide by the EU treaties. We [the Central Bank] are an independent institution. We have our own rules.”
 Since the arraignment in May, Scicluna has maintained that neither the government nor the opposition can compel him to resign. As he dug his heels, the government upped the ante: on Friday he was removed as deputy governor of the Malta Financial Services Authority.
 Sources said they feared Scicluna will not change his position and is prepared to take on the government, potentially leading to an embarrassing legal battle.
 The position of CBM governor is one of the most delicate jobs in Malta, since it requires not only a deep understanding of economic policies and financial systems but also an unwavering commitment to integrity and independence. The government is planning to pass on that mantle to Demarco, who was appointed deputy governor in 2014, after having joined the Central Bank of Malta in 1984. For most of his career, he worked in the bank’s Economic Research Department as a senior economist.

‘How mould made me sick’,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/how-mould-made-sick-took-woman-months-realise-cause-symptoms.1094330,25-06-2024,"005098.png,005099.png,005100.png","Soon after starting a job as a shop cashier, Charlotte began experiencing strong headaches, bowel problems and overall weakness and then “unbearable pain”.
 It took her months to realise the cause of her symptoms: she was breathing in mould particles.
 They were being blown onto her face by an extractor fan that sucked air from a mould-lined storeroom and expelled it above the cash desk.
 Her doctor confirmed that her symptoms matched black mould exposure. Now Charlotte, 57, wants to share her story to raise awareness about the dangers of inhaling mould, a common site in Maltese homes.
 “It was so scary. I thought something was seriously wrong with me. Then I realised it was because of mould. People need to know.”
 According to the health authorities, long-term exposure to mould can be harmful and it is important to treat any mould at home or at work.
 “Preventing mould, or dealing with it quickly if present, is very important and public health authorities stress the need for awareness and taking action to reduce the risks from mould,” a spokesperson said.
 According to provisional data from the National Hospital Information System of the Directorate for Health Information and Research, 16 patients were hospitalised for aspergillosis (an infection caused by mould) between 2016 and 2023. The spokesperson noted that immunosuppressed patients are more at risk of developing all types of infections including fungal infections.
 Most people who are exposed to mould do not end up in hospital. Symptoms due to mould exposure can vary, but common ones include sneezing and stuffy nose; coughing and wheezing; itchy, red, or watery eyes; skin rashes; headaches and feeling tired.
 Charlotte, who did not want her real name used, ticked most of the boxes.
 It all started in October last year when she was looking for a job and a friend offered her one working as a cashier in the bottle shop she owned.
 While working there, she often got congested but initially dismissed it as being sinuses at that time of the year.
 Since it was winter, she did not turn on the air conditioning at work, but she did turn on the air curtain machine located above the main door and close to the cash desk as it circulated the air “like a fan”.
 Then in January she was out with a friend and felt dizzy. Within days she started getting strong headaches. She worried something was seriously wrong with her health.
 The symptoms started piling up, including muscle pain, bloating, loss of concentration and overall weakness.
 One day she went into a storeroom and noticed there was mould. She decided to clean it and, since there was no bleach around, she used a cleaning product. When she was done and went back to the cash, she could smell the cleaning product coming from the air curtain machine. That was when she realised the air blowing onto her was coming from the storeroom. She was inhaling mould particles.
 She asked her boss to treat it but, there was an issue with a leak from a neighbour’s property. The boss covered it in tape, but her symptoms persisted.
 Charlotte went to a doctor who confirmed that her symptoms matched mould exposure and told her to leave the workplace.
 She followed the instruction, she is feeling better now, but some symptoms still linger.
  While the Occupational Health and Safety Authority says complaints about mould are rare, it said employers must ensure their workers’ health and safety, including protecting them from mould at work.
 “To address mould, employers should have skilled staff to advise on necessary measures like improving ventilation, fixing leaks, and addressing dampness… Employers should have systems for workers to report issues and ensure these complaints are investigated,” a spokesperson said.
 If mould is found during inspections, the authority will act according to the law, considering the level of compliance. Actions can include improvement notices, orders to fix issues, fines, or legal action for severe cases.
 Mould is a type of fungus that grows in damp and humid places. It spreads by releasing tiny spores into the air. It can be found indoors and outdoors and can grow on many surfaces like wood, paper, carpets and food. It can look like spots of many different colours, and it can smell musty, the Health Ministry explained.
 Not all moulds are equally harmful. Some moulds, like aspergillus and cladosporium, can cause allergies and breathing problems. Others, like black mould, are more dangerous because they produce toxins.
 “Breathing in mould spores can cause various health problems, especially if you have asthma, allergies, or a weaker immune system. It can lead to allergic reactions, asthma attacks, and other breathing issues. Harmful toxins from certain types of mould may cause serious health problems including nerve damage and, in rare cases, death,” the spokesperson said.
  To prevent problems from mould, you need to control moisture and humidity. The health authorities recommend the following:
 • Use dehumidifiers and air conditioners to keep indoor humidity below 60%;
 • Make sure bathrooms, kitchens and laundry areas are well ventilated;
 • Fix any leaks in your roof, windows or pipes right away;
 • Clean and dry wet or damp areas within 24-48 hours;
 • Regularly check and maintain your heating and cooling systems;
 • If you think you have mould in your home, it is best to remove it with household products, soap and water, or a bleach solution. If you find any difficulties, ask for professional advice.

Free diabetes glucose monitors extended to patients up to 50 years old,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/free-diabetes-glucose-monitors-extended-patients-50-years-old.1098033,13-09-2024,005116.png,"A scheme that provides free continuous glucose monitors to patients of Type 1 diabetes has been extended to patients up to 50 years old. 
 This is the second time the scheme has been extended this year. It was first extended to include patients up to 45 years old in May. Prior to that, it had previously only been available to patients up to  35 years old. 
 In a statement on Friday, Health Minister Jo Etienne Abela said that the government is committed to addressing the conditions of diabetes, as it is estimated that the disease affects roughly 10% of the population. 
 Thanks to an investment of €300,000 the government was able to extend the service to a wider band of people, he said. 
 The adjustment now means an additional 160 people will be able to benefit from the scheme, bringing the total number of people who enjoy the benefit to 950. 
 Sensors inserted just under the skin, often on the arm or belly, detect glucose levels of the wearer and send the information via a transmitter to a smartphone app.
 The user can then monitor their glucose levels to better understand how things like food and activity are impacting them. 
 They can also alert the user to high or low glucose levels so they can make changes to treat or prevent high blood sugar or low blood sugar episodes before they become bigger issues.

WSC blames 'third parties' for E.Coli contamination at two St Julian's beaches,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/wsc-blames-third-parties-ecoli-contamination-two-st-julian-beaches.1092992,24-05-2024,005154.png,"E. coli contamination in two St Julian’s bays was caused by improper waste disposal into water culverts, the Water Services Corporation said on Friday.  
 Health authorities this week warned swimmers to avoid Balluta Bay and  St. George’s Bay because E. coli, a bacteria associated with untreated sewage, was detected in water at both bays. 
 Swimming in the two bays is still not recommended.  
 A spokesperson for Water Services Corporation (WSC), the entity responsible for Malta’s sewage system, said the contamination was not their fault.  
 “The contamination is not caused by WSC's sewage network. Instead, it results from blockages due to third-party activities and improper waste disposal by said third parties into water culverts which shouldn’t be used for such use”.  
 “Our network has been thoroughly tested and confirmed to be leak-free,” the spokesperson said.  
 Sources involved in monitoring sea-water quality said sewage spills sometimes happen because system overloads.  Tourist hotspots like Sliema and St Julian’ sare especially susceptible because of their dense population, particularly in summer months.  
 A spokesperson for the health ministry said the beaches will remain ""closed"" until three consecutive tests for the presence of E. coli are negative. 
 But when Times of Malta visited St George's Bay on Friday morning, many bathers were sunbathing and taking a dip. The only indication that the beaches were ""closed"" were signs warning that bathing was ""not recommended"" due to ""extraordinary circumstances.""  
 The sign makes no mention of the presence of E.Coli in the water.
 E.Coli is the bacteria most commonly associated with food poisoning. While most adults recover from infection with E. coli within a week, the Mayo Clinic notes that young children and older adults infected have a greater risk of developing a life-threatening form of kidney failure.
 This week's two contaminated bay warnings follow a similar warning made for Tal-Għażżien in St. Paul’s Bay last week. That bay was declared free of E.Coli this week.  
 Malta is currently being sued by the EU for what Brussels says is a violation of the EU Waste Water Directive by dumping untreated sewage at sea. 
 MEP candidate Peter Agius has also asked the National Audit Office to investigate the government for misuse of EU funds that were intended to develop sewage treatment facilities. 
 WSC says it is investing €310 million to modernise Malta’s water and sewage infrastructure. They say that money will be used to upgrade sewage treatment facilities to increase capacity and efficiency, improve the sewage network, implement water monitoring technologies and enhance wastewater recycling and reuse initiatives.

Police say they never saw 78 boxes of investigation related to Vitals case,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/police-say-never-saw-78-boxes-investigation-related-vitals-case.1093917,19-06-2024,"005271.png,005272.png","A police officer unequivocally confirmed that the police never investigated the Vitals case but only assisted the magistrate conducting the inquiry, relying on its conclusions when pressing charges against a former prime minister and his associates. 
 The 78 boxes of evidence making up the inquiry were never in police possession and police only assisted in transferring those boxes from the Attorney General’s office to court. 
 That point was driven home by lawyers assisting Joseph Muscat, his former chief of staff Keith Schembri, former minister Konrad Mizzi and a number of other persons and entities charged with money laundering and corruption in their alleged involvement in the now-annulled hospitals privatisation deal. 
 
 The case resumed on Thursday in much calmer settings than the previous first hearing, when rowdy cheering crowds gathered outside the Valletta law courts to support Muscat. 
 The case involves a deal, originally struck in 2015, in which the management of three of the country’s hospitals was handed over to Vitals, a private company, with no experience in healthcare. The concessionaire changed to Stewart Healthcare in 2018.
 At the very start of Thursday's hearing, presiding Magistrate Rachel Montebello mapped the way forward, making it clear the sitting would not extend beyond 3pm, thus directing the parties to make good use of the allocated time, avoiding useless and repetitive questions. 
 It was one of the prosecuting officers who stole the limelight when he was called to the witness stand after the court upheld the defence’s request to produce him as their witness to shed light on how criminal charges had been issued. 
 This information was important for the defence to decide whether to contest the evidence produced so far by the prosecution on a prima facie level.
 The defence argued that the law granted this right to the defence at this early stage of the proceedings before the court decreed whether there was sufficient prima facie evidence for those charged to stand trial on indictment. 
  Failure to allow such witnesses would result in defective proceedings.
 The magistrate upheld that argument and inspector Wayne Rodney Borg, one of the prosecutors, took the stand.
 Defence lawyers fired a series of questions in rapid succession, all basically focusing on the police work done in relation to the Vitals case. 
 Over and over, the inspector explained that that work was limited to assisting the inquiring magistrate by serving notices of summons to those called before her. Other officers were involved in searches ordered by the magistrate. 
 But police “absolutely had no visibility on the inquiry” and did not carry out any parallel investigation. 
 Grilled about his involvement in pressing charges, Borg insisted he had only signed the charges as prosecutor but not as investigator. 
 The decision not to investigate was taken “collectively” with his superiors.
 Asked to identify his “superiors” the inspector named superintendent Hubert Cini, Assistant Commissioner Fabian Fleri and Commissioner Angelo Gafa’. 
 Police “relied on the conclusions of the inquiry,” said Borg, explaining how he had read the proces verbal and most of its appendices. 
 They also consulted the Attorney General herself who was present at a meeting attended by the inspector and three lawyers from her office, currently handling the prosecution. 
 “So you simply parroted what you read in the conclusions,” said defence lawyer Giannella de Marco, suggesting that the police had acted as “parrots” and “postmen”.
 Questioned about whether police had sent for any of the suspects to get their version before pressing charges, the witness invariably gave the same reply. 
 “The police did not investigate… We relied on the inquiry,” said the inspector, who admitted this was the first inquiry he was dealing with.  
 The inspector said he was aware that the inquiring magistrate had sent for Joseph Muscat to give his version. But was not aware that the former prime minister had not done so because of “constitutional proceedings he had instituted.” 
 Muscat’s lawyer, Vincent Galea, asked about a letter sent to the police commissioner by Muscat who wished to give his version. 
 The inspector knew about that letter. But, again, Muscat was not sent for because police had decided to rely on the magisterial conclusions. 
 Lawyer Jason Grima, assisting auditor Christopher Spiteri, said he wished to summon Borg’s predecessor in the case, former police inspector Anthony Scerri, to ask further questions about how police issued charges for an alleged €20 million fraud. 
 That request was upheld and the court ordered that Scerri was to testify in the next sittings. 
 Lawyer Franco Debono, assisting Sciacca Grill Ltd, together with lawyer David Bonello, made one last argument. 
 Since money laundering laws allow suspects to produce a “reasonable excuse” and given that in this case, police had not taken the suspects’ version before pressing charges, their action could result in a potential breach of fundamental human rights. 
 The defence reserved its right to act accordingly at the opportune stage, Debono said. 
 The case continues next week.

Love Islander's story of self harm attempt sparks mental health campaign,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/love-islander-story-suicide-attempt-sparks-mental-health.1094390,24-06-2024,"005390.png,005391.png","A Love Island Malta contestant who shared her story of surviving a self harm attempt at the age of 14 has sparked a mental health awareness campaign. 
 Tamika Ross spoke out during the popular reality TV show on Sunday about her struggles with mental health as a young teenager.
 “When I was about 13, I was very alone at school and home, and I was struggling a real lot with my mental health,” she said. ""And at 14, I had an attempt.”  
 A day after the episode aired, the contestants began wearing green wristbands with the slogan Mental Health Matters and carrying the national mental health helpline 1579. They will wear the wristbands for the remainder of the popular series. 
  The 19-year-old contestant said she shared her story because she thinks many people take mental health for granted and that there should be more awareness towards it.
  ""So many people are struggling and pretending to be good but aren't. Often the people who are smiling the most or making jokes are the ones who are really struggling. I just think there should be more awareness,"" she said.
 ""It is time to talk about it and bring attention towards it.""
 She had shared her story as part of a segment where contestants were encouraged to share important character-developing life experiences that could positively impact others.
 After the episode aired, many people took to social media to praise the teen for her courage in sharing her experience and encouraging her to stay strong.
  The 1579 Mental Health Helpline is a 24-hour national telephone helpline that provides immediate and free emotional support, advice and practical guidance for anyone in need.
 A spokesperson from the ministry of health said ever since the helpline launched in November 2022 around 13,000 people have called in asking for help. 
 Ross was not the only contestant who shared a vulnerable story on Sunday’s episode.
 Another contestant,  Miriam Muscat, shared her experience with a silent miscarriage, while a third, Kyonne Gravina shared what it was like growing up with a father with a criminal past.
 Before entering the villa, he had told Times of Malta that he wanted to use his experience on Love Island ""to show people that I’m different"".

Hospitals’ deal: How did we get here?,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/hospitals-deal-how-get-here.1091958,21-06-2024,"005506.png,005507.png,005508.png,005509.png","It’s crunch time for the hospitals’ investigation.
 After nearly five years, a magistrate has handed 72 boxes of evidence to the Attorney General, indicating criminal wrongdoing in the deal.
 Ex-prime minister Joseph Muscat has already broken his own bad news: “I know I’ll be charged” he said at a press conference last Tuesday, hot on the heels of the inquiry being concluded.
 The details of the inquiry’s findings are not yet public.
 Muscat’s government signed off on a €4 billion deal handing three public hospitals to Vitals Global Healthcare (VGH).
 Despite the grandiose name, the investors behind Vitals had no tangible track record in healthcare.
 The deal was “fraudulent” from day one, the Auditor General and a civil court have previously ruled.
 Why?
 Muscat’s government secretly signed a memorandum of understanding with the investors, behind everyone’s back.
 The government then went through the show of issuing a competitive tender.
 Lo-and-behold, the same investors who signed the secret deal then went on to win the tender.
 It didn’t last long.
 By the end of 2017, Vitals was facing financial ruin, and the Karin Grech, St Luke’s and Gozo hospitals showed little sign of the promised investment.
 Seemingly out of thin air, another company – Steward Health Care – was endorsed by the government to run the hospitals.
 Ex-Vitals director Ram Tumuluri claims top government officials conspired with Steward to kick him and Vitals out.
 The deal with Steward too, would end in tears. A civil court terminated their contract last year, claiming both Vitals and Steward defrauded the government.
 An appeals court went a step further.
 Both the investors and government officials were complicit in the fraud, a panel of three judges, including the chief justice, ruled.
 Despite the strong words, the judgment in the civil court meant little in terms of criminal repercussions on the government officials involved.
 Until now.
  Muscat didn’t just oversee the “fraudulent deal.” He is suspected to have secretly profited from it.
 Weeks after resigning as prime minister, Muscat suddenly started receiving monthly payments of €15,000 from two Swiss companies, Accutor Consulting and SpringX Media. 
 On the face of it, the companies had nothing to do with either Vitals or Steward.
 A money trail uncovered by Times of Malta in 2021 showed otherwise. Accutor was used by Steward to funnel payoffs to the Vitals investors. Millions of euros and dollars were paid into Accutor by Steward.
 In March 2020, Muscat popped up on the receiving end of payments from Accutor.  Muscat claims these payments were for legitimate consultancy work.
 Bogus consultancy agreements are a common tool used to launder payments stemming from corruption. Such agreements give a clean air to dirty money. 
 This is the first time an ex-prime minister has faced a real possibility of prosecution.
 Staring down the barrel of criminal charges, Muscat vehemently denies wrongdoing.
 “Bring it on. I am bracing myself for it and I will fight it to win it,” he said last week.
  Keith Schembri and Konrad Mizzi, the ex-prime minister’s left and right-hand men, will likely face corruption charges.
 The trio have been joined at the hip since 2013, when Labour first shot to power.
 Muscat made Mizzi the public face of the hospitals’ deal. Schembri, as ever, was the one pulling the strings in the background.
 The entire negotiation procedure between VGH and the government remains steeped in mystery. The government committee that led the contract negotiations with VGH failed to retain any documentation relating to its work, according to an audit.
 
 Auditor General Charles Deguara has accused Mizzi of “misleading” his cabinet colleagues over certain financial aspects of a side deal with Steward.
 Mizzi denies wrongdoing.
 The ex-health minister has also been accused of “shirking responsibility” for the deal and refusing to cooperate with the Auditor General.
 Furthermore, Mizzi is said to have consistently signed off on changes to the original deal, that appeared to solely favour VGH’s interests, rather than the government’s.
 It is not yet known whether the magisterial inquiry has uncovered payments to Mizzi or Schembri in connection with the deal.
 Mizzi’s home was searched in 2021 and his mobile phone seized in connection with the inquiry.
 Schembri is known to have visited Accutor’s Swiss offices when he was still Muscat’s chief of staff.
 E-mails made public by Steward indicate Schembri played a key role in securing the company’s takeover of the deal from VGH.
 Both Schembri and Mizzi have kept a low profile since exiting politics in November 2019.
 Schembri was charged with money-laundering in 2021, but not in connection with the hospitals’ deal.
  Mizzi’s successor as health minister, Chris Fearne, as well as ex-finance minister Edward Scicluna are also reportedly facing the prospects of criminal charges.
 Both men have always publicly and privately distanced themselves from the “fraudulent” deal. However, this very inaction may prove to be their downfall.
 As the Auditor General put it, the finance ministry was not even consulted about the privatisation deal.
 Allowing this situation was a “gross shortcoming” in financial management of public funds, in a deal conservatively valued at €4 billion, the Auditor General said.
 Scicluna once famously said Muscat’s government had an inner core – including Mizzi and Schembri, who took decisions in a “kitchen cabinet”, behind the backs of other ministers.
 The ex-finance minister may very well have to answer in court why he let Muscat, Schembri and Mizzi cook up the hospitals’ deal in the kitchen cabinet, without trying to intervene and safeguard public money.
 Fearne too has come under fire for his backseat role in the deal.
 He famously welcomed Steward as the “real deal” in 2017, when they took over from Vitals.
 Although Fearne appeared to have been sidelined during negotiations with Steward, questions have been raised about why he failed to intervene and use his clout as health minister to put an end to the shenanigans.
 Fearne denied any wrongdoing in a statement on Friday.
 “I have no doubt there will be the same conclusions this time around. I have never broken any law or ministerial ethics,” the minister said, pointing out, however, that he could only speak on his behalf.

Maltese missionaries grapple with deadly malaria outbreak,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/maltese-missionaries-grapple-deadly-malaria-outbreak.1097435,09-01-2024,"005324.png,005325.png","Maltese missionaries in Ethiopia are turning to the public for help to buy medicines as they grapple with an unusual, widespread and deadly malaria outbreak in a region they have been working in for 30 years.
 The Maltese missionaries run more than 100 schools and clinics that they have built over the decades in the Jimma Bonga region of Kaffa, Ethiopia.
 The region has long been plagued by other diseases and poverty challenges. But malaria was never one of them, and the devastating outbreak that has struck in recent months caught them off guard and left them struggling to provide enough medication for everyone.
 Nobody – not even the state authorities – is entirely sure what caused the outbreak, but they believe the effects of climate change could have played a part.
  Malaria is a mosquito-borne disease that can be prevented and cured but, in poor countries with lack of hygiene and proper medication, it can kill its victims. Its symptoms range from fever, chills and headaches to organ failure.
  It is particularly dangerous for young children, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems. Malaria is prevalent in some parts of Africa due to the warm, humid climates, a lack of access to healthcare, mosquito nets and anti-malaria drugs as well as inadequate infrastructure, poor sanitation and lack of proper housing.
 Fr Alex Cauchi, director of the Moviment Missjunarju Ġesù fil-Proxxmu, visited the group’s missionaries in the region a few weeks ago. He said that, shortly after he landed, he had to witness the funeral of a 15-year-old boy – who was otherwise healthy – but had been bitten by a malaria-infected mosquito two days earlier.
 “Wherever I went, people spoke to me about relatives they lost to the disease recently,” he said.
 The missionaries have been providing education and healthcare for decades but their clinics have now been overwhelmed with patients seeking treatment.
 They are now appealing to the Maltese public to help raise funds for antimalarial drugs, which are in short supply and expensive in the region.
 “We know there is a cure but the government does not provide it and in pharmacies it’s either extremely expensive or out of stock,” he said.
 A telethon will be held on Sunday and broadcast live on TVM, NET, ONE and Xejk, from 11am to 11pm, to raise money for this critical cause and also in aid of the group’s other projects in Africa and South America.

Swimmer Sasha Gatt tests positive for COVID-19 at Paris Olympics,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/swimmer-sasha-gatt-tests-positive-covid19-paris-olympics.1096090,30-07-2024,005327.png,"Sasha Gatt tested for COVID-19 a few minutes after competing in the 1,500m freestyle heats at the Paris Olympics on Tuesday.
 A spokesman from the Maltese Olympic Committee confirmed that Gatt was tested after the race and returned a positive outcome.
 The Maltese swimmer said after the race that she did not feel at her best during the race.
 Gatt is the latest swimmer to test positive for COVID-19 at the Paris Olympics as several swimmers and waterpolo players were hit by the virus in the past few days in the French capital.
 The most high-profile casualty so far has been Britain’s two-time Olympic champion Adam Peaty who felt unwell after winning silver in the 100m breaststroke on Sunday.
 On Tuesday morning, Gatt was well below her best in the 1,500 metres heats at the Paris La Defense Arena on Tuesday.
 Lining up in the first heat of the race, Gatt was up against two other swimmers, namely Singapore’s Ching Hwee Gan and Chile’s Kristel Kobrich.
 Gan dominated the race from start to finish as she cruised home in 16 minutes 10 seconds and 13 seconds.
 Kobrich took second spot when clocking a time of 16:27.18.
 Maltese swimmer Gatt finished a distant third with a time of 17.00.54. Her effort was over 22 seconds slower than her own national record of 16:38.75 she had set in Rome in 2021.
 This was Gatt’s only assignment at the 2024 Games and was representing Malta in her second Olympic Games.

Activists place 'resign' banner at Central Bank as pressure builds on Scicluna,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/activists-place-resign-banner-central-bank-pressure-builds-scicluna.1096011,29-07-2024,"005338.png,005339.png,005340.png","Activists placed a large banner with the word 'resign' on it outside the Central Bank on Monday as pressure builds on governor Edward Scicluna to step down.
 The NGO Repubblika held a demonstration at the Central Bank demanding Scicluna leave his post after a court found there was enough evidence for him to face trial for fraud related to the privatisation of three hospitals. 
 ""Edward Scicluna, if you have a shred of dignity, go,"" NGO president Vicki Ann Cremona said. ""Time will tell whether you are guilty, but the sense of responsibility to your country should compel you to resign. Step down now, without delay.""
  The civil society protest echoes calls from the Opposition for Scicluna to go, while Prime Minister Robert Abela has strongly indicated he should resign. 
 Last week Scicluna was removed from his role as deputy governor of the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA).
 And on Sunday, Times of Malta reported that the government is planning to   attempt to axe him from his role through a cabinet decision if he continues to refuse to step down and has already found a replacement for the role.
 Scicluna might have a legal argument to challenge the government decision and he told Times of Malta last week that the Central Bank has  its own rules and neither the government nor the opposition can compel him to resign.
 
 Scicluna was appointed Central Bank governor in 2021 and his term is meant to lapse in 2026.
  Around 20 people took part in the short demonstration on Monday morning. 
 Cremona said Scicluna was being egoistic, because he was clinging to his seat, despite knowing that he could be pushing away foreign investment to the country, putting people's jobs at risk.
 ""If he resigns, he won't die of hunger, mind you. He will have at least three pensions - one as a former MEP, another as a former minister, and another as a professor - and they're not the minimum pensions many people have,"" she said.
 ""Let us remind you that he had also gotten a €100,000 severance package to leave his ministerial job. We hope he's not expecting some other similar package to leave this role, because we will not accept that.""
  Cremona also said that Repubblika has formally asked the European Central Bank (ECB) to sack him.
 Calls for Scicluna's resignation started in May when he, along with former deputy prime minister Chris Fearne and 13 others, was arraigned in court over charges of fraud, misappropriation and fraudulent gain related to the hospitals deal.
 They all insist on their innocence, but Fearne had resigned immediately whereas Scicluna did not.

Joseph Muscat files  court challenge to €30 million asset freeze,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/joseph-muscat-insists-30-million-assets-freeze-excessive.1094501,26-06-2024,005512.png,"Former prime minister Joseph Muscat is challenging a €30 million freezing order imposed on his assets as part of criminal proceedings related to the hospitals deal.
 The assets freeze was imposed last month when Muscat was charged with money laundering, bribery and corruption, among a host of other charges related to the deal that saw three state hospitals handed over to Vitals Global Healthcare. He pleaded not guilty.
 Lawyers for Muscat have filed an application challenging the freezing order in court, saying that the sum of €30 million was inflated and that any freezing order with respect to Muscat should instead be limited to the €60,000 mentioned in the proces verbal of the magisterial inquiry that led to the arraignment.
 The lawyers insisted that before issuing the freezing order, the court should have itself been convinced that there was enough evidence to justify the amounts, instead of simply resting on the assertions of the prosecution that it was so.
 Lawyer Ishmael Psaila also pointed out that earlier this week a lack of clear evidence had seen a freezing order issued against Sciacca Grill lifted. That solidified the need for the prosecution to substantially prove how it drew up the figures listed in the freezing order.
 In his rebuttal, prosecutor Francesco Refalo said that the court at its discretion, may see fit to approve a freezing order if there was valid reason to do so and when the charges made against the accused supported the issuance of such an order.
 The prosecution, he said, had followed the letter of the law when drafting the freezing orders and that the amounts requested for the assets freeze related to the circumstances of the case. Refalo added that it was not the competence of the court hearing this challenge to decide on the merits of the case, but only to decide whether there was a valid enough reason to issue the freezing order or not.
 During the same proceedings, lawyer Stefano Filletti, appearing for Adrian Hillman, who stands accused of fraud and money laundering, argued that there was no documentary evidence to support issuing a freezing order against him and said that he had been targeted simply due to his friendship with Keith Schembri, Muscat's former chief of staff -who is also one of the accused.
 Pointing out that he would be resting on similar points of law to rebut all the defendants challenging the freezing order, Refalo went on to tell the court that he wished to compare the situation to when freezing orders were signed off during an arraignment. When a person was arraigned under arrest and the prosecution requested a freezing order, the court would not have seen any evidence to support this request and it based its decision on the circumstances around the charges.
 Similarly, he said, in this case, freezing orders were based on similar circumstances.
 Lawyers for Sciacca Grill also briefly made submissions during proceedings. On Tuesday, Magistrate Rachel Montebello discharged Sciacca Grill, a company that operates a chain of restaurants, from proceedings due to the prosecution failing to sufficiently prove why it had been included in proceedings. The prosecution held that the company, which once had ties to Keith Schembri, had skimmed money off contracts it received to supply the state hospitals. But lawyers Franco Debono and David Bonello successfully argued that the prosecution did not produce a shred of evidence to substantiate its claims.
 In court on Wednesday, Debono requested the court to note that, given the previous day’s events, the effects of the freezing order on the company had been extinguished due to a lack of prima facie evidence and out of “extreme caution” he asked the court to declare this as fact.
 Lawyer Edward Gatt, representing Keith Schembri and Konrad Mizzi, requested a constitutional reference on the current laws that regulate freezing orders, as in their current form they may present a situation in which the accused’s right to a fair hearing could be breached.
 Gatt said that in relation to this, proceedings had become “frustrating and tedious” and were becoming an obstacle to people being able to attain justice.

"New sexual health strategy proposes free emergency contraception, condoms",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/new-sexual-health-strategy-free-emergency-contraception-condoms.1102251,12-10-2024,"005796.png,005797.png","Emergency contraception should be added to the national formulary and condoms distributed for free, a long-awaited sexual health strategy unveiled on Tuesday recommends. 
 The strategy has now been opened to public consultation for feedback before it is finalised. 
 Health Minister Jo Etienne Abela launched the two-month consultation for the National Sexual Health Strategy 2025-2030 on Tuesday, and he described it as being “grounded in robust research”.
 The strategy aims to be inclusive and equitable to all populations including migrants, people with disabilities and LGBTIQ+ individuals, he said.
 “No strategy is perfect. It would be childish to expect it to be perfect in any way… This does not detract from the basic truth – that sexuality and sexual behaviour is individual, private,” he said as he called on the public to have their say during the consultation process.
 The public consultation for this strategy will be open for two months and begins on 11 December.
 To prevent the spread of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), the strategy suggests providing free condoms to anyone aged over 16. Adding the emergency contraception pill to the national formulary will help make it more accessible, it adds. 
  The emergency contraception pill, also known as the morning-after pill, was not available in Malta until 2016 when it was made legal and started being sold over the counter at pharmacies.  
 Abela also kept to a promise made a year ago, as the strategy proposes free preventive treatment against HIV for those who are at risk of contracting the virus.
 Treatments include PrEP and PEP: PrEP is a medication taken before sexual activity and reduces the risk of HIV transmission. PEP is a treatment that needs to be taken within 72 hours after a high-risk sexual encounter.
 This is the first time that Malta's sexual health strategy has been updated in 14 years.
 To this day, Malta's sexual health public policies are based on a strategy that was published in 2010 and was already considered outdated by GU Clinic doctors at the time of publication.
 An updated policy was originally meant to be released in 2021 but was sent back to the drawing board, because the research it was based on was found to be years out of date. Its revision was further delayed by the COVID pandemic. 
 The launch comes just days after Malta held its first-ever rally for World AIDS Day, underscoring the importance of timely and effective sexual health policies.
 Superintendent of Public Health Charmaine Gauci said it was important that everyday people felt a sense of ownership of the strategy, as sexual health was part of everyday life.
  The strategy direction was aligned with a World Health Organisation action plan and other EU policies and strategies, she said. Available data was evaluated, various stakeholder meetings were carried out and current government policy documents were reviewed. The public was also surveyed in 2022 and 2023. 
 “The vision is that we need to ensure that all members of the population...are enabled and supported to receive reproductive support,” Gauci said.
 Gauci also pointed out that Malta's rate of all STIs, except for chlamydia, is higher than the EU average. 
 Alexia Bezzina, a consultant in public health medicine, gave an overview of the strategy document and its recommendations.

Health authorities detect first case of mpox in Malta this year,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/health-authorities-detect-first-case-mpox-malta.1097389,30-08-2024,005872.png,"The first case of mpox of the year has been detected in Malta, health authorities announced on Friday. 
 At this stage, authorities have not identified whether it is the new variant of the virus, which has sparked global alarm.
 The patient, who represents an imported case of the disease, which was sexually transmitted, is clinically stable and does not require hospital admission. 
 A health ministry spokesperson said the patient has been isolated and that contact tracing is underway to prevent further transmission. 
  The ministry urged the public to take the following precautions to reduce the risk of mpox transmission: 
 Malta first detected earlier strains of mpox in 2022, with the first case reported in May when the patient returned from overseas in a country where several cases of the virus had been detected. 
 By August of that year, the number of cases had shot up to 31, with Malta registering the fifth-highest incidence rate of mpox in Europe at the time. 
 Later the government made a vaccine available to primary contacts of mpox patients free of charge. 
 The UN health agency says on its website that mpox spreads between people mainly through close physical contact with someone who has the virus.
 ""Close contact includes skin-to-skin (such as touching or sex) and mouth-to-mouth, or mouth-to-skin contact (such as kissing),"" it says.
 It can also include ""being face-to-face with someone who has mpox (such as talking or breathing close to one another, which can generate infectious respiratory particles)"".
 WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris said Tuesday that if a person with the virus had lesions, ""if you're talking closely to someone, breathing on them, physically close, face-to-face, there is a possibility"" of viral spread, ""but this is a minor source"".
 Instead, ""what we're seeing is the close, physical skin-to-skin"" contact as the chief route of transmission, she told a briefing in Geneva.
 ""When you're talking to somebody, you're spitting out droplets,"" but ""it's not a very major form of transmission - and it's not a... through-the-air, long-distance sort of transmission"".
 ""More research is needed to fully understand the transmission dynamics,"" Harris added.
 The WHO recommends the use of facemasks for those with mpox, their close contacts and health workers treating them.
 There are two subtypes of mpox: Clade 1, endemic in the Congo Basin in central Africa; and Clade 2, endemic in West Africa.
 The surge in the DR Congo is being driven by surges of two different Clade 1 strains.
 The first is an outbreak in northwest DRC of what was previously known as Clade 1, now called Clade 1a.
 The second, in northeastern DRC, is a new offshoot of Clade 1 called Clade 1b, which was first detected in September last year and is spreading rapidly.
 The spread of Clade 1b, and its detection in nearby countries, were the main reasons behind the WHO sounding its top emergency alarm.
 Clade 1 mpox is known to be more virulent than Clade 2 mpox and has a higher fatality rate.
 As for whether Clade 1b is more dangerous than Clade 1a, Harris said: ""We don't have that data."" 
 ""Studies are underway to understand the properties of the new strain. But available epidemiological data doesn't really suggest that the clade 1b variant causes more severe cases and deaths.""

Woman given weeks to live throws party to celebrate her life,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/woman-given-weeks-live-throws-party-celebrate-life.1096143,08-01-2024,"005947.png,005948.png","A terminally ill woman who decided to throw a party after being told she could have weeks left to live said she is determined to celebrate life “second by second”.
 Nicky Sansone, 55, threw “a party in celebration of my life” in St Julian’s last Saturday after fearing she might not make it to her birthday on August 24.
 “We had to bring it forward because they don’t think I will make it until then. It ended up being a bigger event with over 120 people. I was overwhelmed,” she says.
  Sansone started documenting her story on TikTok after she was diagnosed with cancer in November. The video she shared of her birthday party had more than 23,000 views as people inundated her with messages of admiration and support.
 She uses her channel to share her own views about the importance of enjoying life and to urge people to check out any cancer symptoms immediately.
 “Smile, live, love and enjoy life to the fullest,” is the message she wants to leave behind.
 “For many people, it’s life-work-life-work. They forget to live. The world has become so sad. Enjoy life. Stop fighting. Stop complaining. Live. People worry about such stupid things.  I did too. Now, if I go for a drive, I appreciate seeing the sea twice as much as before.
 “Some people don’t cherish what they have until it’s gone. So, if you have something and it’s good focus on the good,” she says as she sits in a hospital bed at the Sir Anthony Mamo Oncology Centre where she was recently moved into palliative care.
 Sansone believes her symptoms started when she started losing weight about three years ago. Back then she attributed the weight loss to the fact that she had cut alcohol from her life completely.
 “I had gone through a rough patch and alcohol had become a problem. I decided I had to stop and I did. It’s been three years and two months now,” she says. After changing her lifestyle to a healthier one, she started walking and swimming regularly.
  In November, she went for a swim with a friend and got so breathless that she had to get out of the water. She went to a doctor who sent her to get an X-ray immediately.
 She went to hospital and tests showed that her lungs were full of water. Doctors extracted 500ml from each lung. They tested the liquid and found traces of cancer. Further tests showed it likely originated from her ovaries and spread throughout her body. She was diagnosed with stage 4 aggressive cancer and began chemotherapy.
 Sansone says she carried out smear tests over the years but was not regular with them and skipped them occasionally.
 Things went well initially.  The plan was to operate to remove the tumours spread around her body but when surgeons opened her up they realised the cancer had spread and it was too risky to do anything.
 They changed her treatment and tried different options until the oncologist told her that there was not much more that could be done.
 “I asked: ‘how much do I have?’ She said: ‘it’s hard to say’.”
 That was when she decided to throw a party to celebrate her life.
 Among those present were many from the LGBTIQ community who turned up to thank Sansone for her contribution. In a Facebook post shared after the party, the MGRM described her as “an important person in Malta’s LGBTIQ history and an amazing, beloved woman who changed many people’s lives…”
 They described how she was one of the first women who offered LGBTIQ people a space, through opening Gaiety, in Paceville around 30 years ago  and, later, when she opened Nix Bar, in St Julian’s.
 Back then, in the 1990s, the gay community had no place to go, recalls Sansone who witnessed the change unfold as people no longer felt they had to hide.
 “I’m overwhelmed. I still can’t believe what’s happening… I had opened gay bars but did not expect recognition,” she says.
 She goes on to add that, as an animal lover, her main worry for the future is leaving her two cats Tiger and Billy – but she knows they will be in safe hands as her friends will be taking them in.
 Her cats feature in some of her TikTok posts where she talks about how “they know”.
 Apart from her treatment journey, her posts also document happy moments such as when her avocado plant sprouts, scenes from a recent trip to Sicily and getting her favourite ice cream from a kiosk in Baħar iċ-Ċagħaq.
 She also laughs at herself such as at how, because of a side effect of chemo on vision, she must use a magnifying glass to check the expiry date on the eggs in her fridge.
 Her videos also contain messages of awareness about regular health checks. She talks about having ADHD and OCD and her determination to fight to continue living and to try to remain positive despite the good and bad moments.
 Throughout her videos, where she thanks her followers for their kind words and support, she repeats the message to “enjoy life to the fullest”.
 “In my posts, I tried to be as positive as possible telling people to enjoy life and not take it for granted as you never know what’s round the corner. Your perception of life changes so much when you are in this situation. I’ve forgiven people who have done me wrong. Because... Why? Like this, my mind is at peace,” she says.

Mount Carmel to be converted into home for elderly - minister,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/government-planning-convert-mount-carmel-old-people-home-minister.1097448,31-08-2024,006158.png,"Mount Carmel hospital will be converted into a home for the elderly, Health Minister Jo Etienne Abela has announced
 Speaking during an Fliving debate with PN MP Adrian Delia, Abela said the government plans to phase out the psychiatric services offered by the hospital. 
 Instead, the government plans to convert the hospital into a ""second St Vincent De Paul"". 
 He said the Attard hospital is ideal for this use. 
 In May, the government initiated a four-year plan to close down Mount Carmel.  
 He cautioned that improving the healthcare service is not just about ""new buildings."" 
 The minister said adequate human resources, including foreign workers, were needed. 
 Abela also announced that Mater Dei Hospital will be offering ""after-hours"" operations during the week and on Sundays, in a bid to cut down waiting lists. 
 Pressure on the country's healthcare service came into sharp focus this week after a 55-year-old man died at Mater Dei Hospital's emergency waiting room where he was left waiting despite allegedly complaining of chest pain.  
 Abela has announced an inquiry into the death. 
 The minister has previously announced plans to increase the number of round-the-clock health centres in Malta from three to five.
 Another project - the Paola Health Centre - has been plagued by delays. 
 The government is mulling severing ties with the contractor responsible for the Paola health hub after a series of missed deadlines in the project’s final stages means it has been unable to open its doors to the public.
 Although construction work has been completed, sources say the contractor has missed as many as 17 deadlines in recent months, most linked to certification and quality control.
 Ex-prime minister Joseph Muscat and a slew of other former government officials are facing charges linked to corruption in the health sector.

The footballer who got his sight back: 'I saw three footballs instead of one',timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/the-footballer-got-sight-back-i-saw-three-footballs-instead-one.1097585,09-07-2024,"006249.png,006250.png,006251.png","Judy Kandal’s dream to one day play football in Saudi Arabia was almost cut short when his vision began to blur  and he was “seeing three footballs instead of one”.
 Eye tests revealed that the 21-year-old had an eye condition known as keratoconus in which his cornea – the clear, dome-shaped front of his eye – became thinner and gradually bulged outward into a cone shape.
 This resulted in distorted vision because the job of the cornea is the refraction of light and focusing.
 Five months ago, he underwent a partial cornea transplant and is now about to resume his passion and play football again.
  “If my life was at 60%, I feel like it’s at 90% now,” said Judy as he sat for an interview in the operating theatre at St Thomas Hospital where, five months ago, transplant surgeon Andre Grixti replaced part of his cornea.
 Judy, who is Kurdish, moved to Malta when he was three years old. He was born in Turkey and his family then moved to Syria and, later, Iraq. In 2006, during the Iraqi civil war, the family came to Malta where they had other relatives, including Judy’s grandparents.
 “We came for a better future and Malta was able to provide that and I’m very thankful for that,” he says.
 Judy attended primary and secondary school in Malta and went on to become a restaurant manager. Football has been a great love of his since he picked up a ball at the age of six.
  “I started playing with Ħamrun Spartans and spent eight years there. Then, I moved to Melita for a year… There was an activity for players who wanted to try joining the Stoke City FC Academy in the UK. I went for it and got chosen but, a week before I was meant to go to London, my grandfather died of cancer, so I did not go,” he says.
 The promising striker was also shortlisted to play with Malta’s national team but could not be part of the squad as he does not have Maltese citizenship.
 Then, about three years ago, round about the time when he joined Gżira United, he started noticing that something was wrong with his vision.
 “My vision was so clear before but, as years passed, I started noticing my vision was going blurry. At work, I couldn’t see clearly when taking bookings… when playing football, I would see three balls rather than one.”
 At first, he thought this could be a symptom of exhaustion. But, after some time, he went to see a doctor.
 His doctor was Grixti who is leading a new programme of full and partial cornea transplants at St Thomas Hospital, a private hospital in Qormi.
 The hospital recently began performing transplants with corneas from abroad after entering a strategic partnership with a European tissue bank – Banc De Sang Teixits.
  Based in Barcelona, Spain, the organ bank is supplying donated corneas to patients at St Thomas Hospital. This means they do not have to rely on the limited local cornea donations.
 Grixti explains that the cornea is made of three main layers: the outer layer, or epithelium, the stroma and the inner endothelium. 
 “Conventionally, a full transplant is carried out that replaces the full cornea. However, certain diseases affect a particular layer of the cornea, and we have now moved to partial transplants,” he said.
 One condition that benefits from this type of partial transplant is keratoconus – Judy’s condition.
 In this case, the intervention carried out is called a deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK) that involves replacing the two top layers and keeping the inner layer, which is the one that leads to most corneal rejection. This also means a faster recovery time for the patient.
 Judy has about a month left before he can be cleared to return back to the pitch. Now that his operation has been successful, he has set his sight beyond Maltese shores.
 “I dream to go to Saudi Arabia, or any Middle Eastern country, to play football,” he says.

No cases of mpox registered in Malta - health ministry,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/no-cases-mpox-registered-malta-health-ministry.1096935,19-08-2024,006274.png,"No mpox cases have been registered in Malta this year, the health ministry said on Monday while advising those travelling to affected countries to take precautions to avoid contracting the virus.
 Health authorities were ""closely monitoring any potential cases"" and had strengthened surveillance systems to detect and respond to suspected cases of mpox, it said in a statement.
 “Early diagnosis is crucial, and the public is being informed about recognising the symptoms,” the ministry said less than a week after the World Health Orgnisation (WHO) declared mpox a global public health emergency.
 The virus, formerly called monkeypox, causes fever, muscular aches and large boil-like skin lesions.
 The ministry said people living in or travelling to affected countries, and those in close contact with affected communities were at “moderate’ risk of contracting the virus.
 Those travelling to the affected countries without close contact with the local community were considered at low risk, it said. 
 The ministry recommended avoiding close contact with people suffering from a rash resembling those caused by the virus, and to avoid contact with objects and materials used by those diagnosed with mpox.
 Rashes caused by mpox usually begin on the face before spreading to elsewhere on the body, and start as a flat sore which develops into an itchy or painful liquid-filled blister, according to the WHO. 
  The ministry encouraged the public to wash their hands frequently and employ alcohol-based hand sanitiser.
 Those with symptoms of the virus or who have had close contact with someone with symptoms are advised to speak to their family doctor about testing and treatment, it added. 
 Formerly called monkeypox, the virus was first discovered in humans in 1970 in what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
 It is an infectious disease caused by a virus transmitted to humans by infected animals but can also be passed from human to human through close physical contact.
 In May 2022, mpox infections surged worldwide, mostly affecting gay and bisexual men, due to the clade 2b subclade - a variant of mpox. In response, the WHO declared a public health emergency which lasted from July 2022 to May 2023. 
 A global public health emergency is the highest alarm level under International Health Regulations, which are legally binding on 196 countries. 
 Back in 2022, Malta's monkeypox case rate was one of the highest in Europe.
 That outbreak, which has now largely subsided, caused some 140 deaths out of around 90,000 cases.
 The clade 1b subclade, which has been surging in the DRC since September 2023, causes more severe disease than clade 2b, with a higher fatality rate.
 The WHO warned that more Clade 1 mpox cases were likely to be confirmed in Europe soon after Sweden announced the first case outside Africa.
 Last week, the Democratic Republic of Congo said the mpox outbreak had killed 548 people there so far this year.

Duo planning Sicily-to-Malta ‘Kayak4Kate’,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/duo-planning-sicilytomalta-kayak4kate.1097444,09-03-2024,006010.png,"Three months after getting into a kayak for the first time, Andrew Pisani is planning to paddle 100 kilometres between Malta and Sicily for charity.
 The 42-year-old Caritas worker will set out with personal trainer Robert Scerri, 43, from Marina di Ragusa on the morning of September 29 and plans to arrive at around 5 pm in Exiles, Sliema.
 Their biggest supporter will be five-year-old Kate Feriggi, as the challenge aims to raise funds for therapy to help her live with Tatton-Brown Rahman Syndrome.
 Kate is one of just 200 people in the world with the condition, characterised by physical and intellectual disabilities.
  Pisani volunteered to join Scerri, an avid kayaker, when he first heard about the challenge, dubbed Kayak4Kate.
 “I didn’t think it would be that hard,” he laughs. “I feel the pressure but I know we can do it.”
 The duo are training rigorously, spending six days a week in the gym and on the water, with their longest kayaking session so far being 65km in a single day. They have so far managed to raise €10,000.
 During the challenge, they will be supported by a boat carrying around 10 people, who will provide nutrition, guidance and also emotional support.
 Kate will track their progress from abroad, where she will be undergoing therapy.
 “She will be with us in spirit and online,” said Scerri, who was inspired to create the challenge after meeting Kate. “I am excited and confident we can do it.”
 Last year, Kate’s parents told Times of Malta how she requires three to four hours of therapy each day with the treatment costing €2,500 a month.
 Her mother said she is so thankful for the pair’s efforts to help her child.
 “To have friends like this is a blessing for us,” she said.

"'He's innocent, but even if he's not...': Crowds voice their support for Muscat",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/he-innocent-even-not-crowds-voice-support-muscat.1093117,28-05-2024,006135.png,"Updated 12.30pm with longer video
 Joseph Muscat’s alleged role in a massive fraud that stole millions from Maltese pockets mattered little to the throngs of people who gathered outside the law courts in his support on Tuesday morning.
 “He’s one of the greatest people in Malta,” one demonstrator told Times of Malta. “I think he’s innocent, and even if he isn’t…. he lifted me up off the ground. I used to get a €570 pension, now I make over €900.”
 That sentiment was reflected in comments others gave Times of Malta.
 “He filled Malta with money,” one said. “He made us decent,” another said. “When he came to power, we started living.”
  Demonstrators filled Republic Square from 9am, well before Muscat and others were scheduled to be arraigned in court and charged with bribery, corruption, money laundering and other crimes.
 The former prime minister is among 14 people to face criminal charges on Tuesday in connection with the €4 billion, 30-year deal the Muscat government signed to privatise state hospitals.
 That deal was annulled by a civil court and panned by the National Audit Office, which drafted three separate reports about it. It was also flagged as a suspected criminal enterprise by experts engaged as part of a magisterial probe, which was concluded last month.
 Investigators found that money provided by Maltese taxes to run three state hospitals was moved through a convulted network of companies by professionals engaged by the deal’s key players. The misappropriation amounted to millions of euro.
 Muscat has denied any involvement and said the case is based on conjecture.
 All that mattered little to the people gathered in Republic Square on Tuesday morning.
 “This is a repetition of Christ’s story,” one man said, drawing parallels between Muscat’s prosecution and the persecution of Jesus Christ.
 The crowd – mostly older and largely male – chanted “Joseph, Joseph” as they waited for the former prime minister to show up.
 A Times of Malta reporter only spotted a handful of young people in the crowd, and none of them wanted to speak on camera. Most women asked to comment also declined to do so, or were stopped from doing so by their partner or friends.
 “When I emailed him at 1am, he replied the next day,” a man said when asked why he was there. “I think he’s to be taken more seriously than the courts. He’s a just man.”
 Labour Party officials have confided that they worry tempers could flare within the crowd.
 And there were slight signs of that as a Times of Malta reporter milled through the crowd, seeking people willing to talk about their presence there.
 “Are you a prophet?” one man barked as the reporter asked a demonstrator if he thought Muscat was innocent.
 
 “We’re here for Joseph, not to promote you,” a woman told journalists.
 Another grabbed the reporter’s arm, but was quickly escorted away and told off by other demonstrators. “He’s just doing his job,” another told the angry crowd circling the reporter.
 But while the crowds were keen to publicly back Muscat, in private some acknowledged they had concerns.
 “Police never take you to court for nothing,” one confided off-camera. “But I’m a Mintoffjan, I had to come today.”  
 The crowds were also less willing to back Muscat’s lieutenants Keith Schembri and Konrad Mizzi, who will also appear in court to face charges on Tuesday.
 “I can only speak about Joseph,” many said when asked if they believed Schembri and Mizzi were being framed, too.
 And one made it clear he was not just there because of the hospitals scandal. The Nationalist Party, he said, was the cause of many of Malta's current ills. 
 ""Traffic is all down to them [PN],"" he said. ""They didn't build a single road during their time in power, so now the government has to redo them all at once.""
 What about the increase in cars on Maltese roads? 
 ""Well obviously cars would increase, because before everyone went hungry and now there's work. Labour brought employment so people need to buy cars,"" he reasoned.

Six elderly hospitalised during July heatwave,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/six-elderly-hospitalised-july-heatwave.1096045,08-02-2024,006239.png,"Six elderly people were admitted to hospital because of health conditions exacerbated by the recent heatwaves.
 A health ministry spokesperson said the six patients, all over the age of 60, required hospitalisation between July 1 and 22.
 “On preliminary investigation into the reason for admission, these patients were not admitted as a direct consequence of heat-related incidents but because of some form of infection, mainly chest infection, causing fever that dehydrated them quicker because of the additional background heat,” the spokesperson explained.
 Malta and Gozo were this month hit by sporadic power outages amid high temperatures, with some localities experiencing power cuts that lasted for more than 20 hours.
 At the same time, the weatherman issued a yellow weather warning, as the air temperature was to rise to 36°C.
 Enemalta blamed the faults on heat damage to high-voltage cables. To control the situation, Enemalta installed 14 diesel-powered generators in various localities to cope with the crisis.
 Times of Malta reached out to the health ministry in the wake of the Superintendent of Public Health’s call for people to look out for vulnerable and elderly people. She revealed that a total of 80 “excess deaths” were recorded during a heatwave that hit Malta last summer.
 ‘Excess deaths’ refer to the number of deaths from all causes during a crisis above and beyond what would have been expected  under ‘normal’ conditions.
 The health spokesperson said there were no reported deaths due to direct effects of heat ‒ namely dehydration and heatstroke ‒ from July 1 to 22.

Watch: ‘Stroke erased my speech… but I’m alive’,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/watch-stroke-erased-speech-i-m-alive.1093016,28-05-2024,006343.png,"Ryan Armaoui is on a remarkable journey to regain his speech after a stroke seven months ago temporarily erased his ability to communicate.
 As he slowly rebuilds his vocabulary, the 28-year-old’s message is clear – there is always hope.
 Ryan has set up a Facebook support group – Malta Stroke Survivors – to help stroke survivors who might be struggling to pick up the pieces.
 “I want to help anyone. I cannot do much, but I can speak to them... I will try to speak to them. I found support and I want to be of support to others.”
 Before the stroke, Ryan was working as an assistant manager at Olea restaurant. Part of his work was being front of house and meeting and greeting patrons. “I like to speak a lot. This was a part of my job I loved,” says Ryan, recounting the day of the stroke.
 It was a Sunday lunchtime last October when he was stocktaking at the restaurant that forms part of the Salini Resort.
 “I felt a headache. It kept escalating. It felt as if my head was exploding. There was pressure. Imagine someone squeezing your hand. But instead of feeling it on the outside, you feel it inside your head. I knew this was not something I could control… I was OK at 1pm. I was far from OK at 3.30pm. I don’t remember anything after that.”
  Ryan passed out at work.
 Minutes before he collapsed, he told a colleague he was not feeling well and asked him to call his girlfriend – Sarah Camilleri. He knew something was seriously wrong. He was rushed to Mater Dei Hospital.
 For Ryan, this was a blur and his next memory is being in hospital and feeling confused.
 ‘I could not remember the words’
 When he regained consciousness, he could not understand what was being said. It was like people were speaking a foreign language. And when he tried to speak, he could not find the words.
 “I would know, for example, that a teacup is something you drink from. But I could not remember the word,” he says.
 Ryan had suffered a stroke, which is caused by blocked blood flow to the brain or sudden bleeding in the brain.
 According to Research Trust Malta, stroke is the most common cause of severe disability in Malta with one in four men and one in five women expected to have a stroke by age 85.
  In Ryan’s case, the stroke impacted the areas of the brain that control speech and language, which is known as aphasia. The stroke also affected his right peripheral vision on both eyes.
 “Language took the biggest hit. And it’s the thing I loved. I really like people. It bothered me a lot that I could not express myself: what I was seeing and thinking.”
 During those 10 days in hospital, some words started coming back slowly. Meanwhile, his girlfriend acted as his “interpreter”.
 “I would point at items, and she says the word. When I was in hospital, my girlfriend played the film Harry Potter. It was the movie we would watch at home when one of us was sick. Listening to it helped me remember words.
 “Learning was pretty fast. Once you learn the words, they stick. It’s like there is an ‘off’ button for each word and you have to switch them all back on,” he said, recalling that he would stammer to talk as he started the path to recovery.
 In January, a friend introduced him to tutor, Fabienne Buhagiar, and she started tutoring him to catch up on the lost language.
 His stammering improved as his vocabulary – in both Maltese and English – was rebuilt.
 But in the beginning of April, Ryan suffered an epileptic fit.
 His doctor told him this was not uncommon following a stroke. It forced him to slow down a bit and take things a bit easier, but did not impact the progress he had made.
 Things have changed since the stroke: he cannot drive and travelling is difficult.
 What did not change is his overall positive attitude towards life.
 “For me, it’s a daily thing to improve. I’m 28 and I’m fighting to make it. Whatever it takes, I need to find a way. It was hard to find someone who went through it. I want this to improve. More than anything, I wish to help others who are living through it.
 “You never know what’s going to happen. I have a routine where I kiss my girlfriend before leaving the house and she does the same. Thank God, that day I did. Imagine I did not. That would be really sad. The day of the stroke was a normal, routine day at work. It was a normal, good day. It wasn’t. But I’m alive.”

Bank Of Valletta silent on €36m Steward loan after bankruptcy filing,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/bank-of-valletta-silent-36m-steward-loan-bankruptcy-filing.1092099,05-08-2024,006367.png,"Bank of Valletta remained tight-lipped on the future of the €36m loan given to Steward Health Care when contacted by Times of Malta, after the company filed for bankruptcy in a US court on Monday.
 In a written reply, BOV said that it “cannot comment publicly on confidential client matters”.
 “We reaffirm that we have in place very strong due diligence and credit governance processes that meet regulatory requirements and expectations. The Bank adheres to all its regulatory obligations and informs the market as needed,” a bank spokesperson said.
 BOV were asked whether the bank featured as a creditor in Steward’s bankruptcy filing and what action the bank took to recoup the funds.
 In a statement published on Tuesday afternoon, PN called on BOV to “clarify its position” on the loan in the wake of Steward’s bankruptcy.
 This needed to be done in the interest of “the hundreds of thousands of Maltese people who trust the bank with their money”, as well as for the sake of Malta’s financial system, the party said.
 Taxpayers to foot the bill in case of default
 BOV had granted Steward a series of loans throughout 2018 and 2019 amounting to just under €36m, raising questions by independent candidate Arnold Cassola over the due diligence carried out by the bank.
 The loans were guaranteed by the government, effectively meaning that taxpayers would be footing the bill if the company defaulted on the loan.
 It is unclear how much of these loans have been repaid.
 Last year, Justice Minister Jonathan Attard said that Steward had “kept up” with loan repayments, but the news of Steward’s bankruptcy suggests that the matter now lies in the hands of a Texas court.
 Steward took over the concession that had awarded St Luke’s Hospital, Karin Grech Hospital and Gozo General Hospital to Vitals Global Healthcare in 2018, but the company’s presence in Malta was short-lived.
 Maltese courts scrapped the deal altogether in early 2023, under the suspicion of fraud. The decision was confirmed on appeal later in the same year, with courts finding ""collusion between Steward and senior government officials or its agencies"".

Watch: Doctor-assisted dying should start being debated 'in new year',timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/watch-doctorassisted-dying-start-debated-in-new-year.1102241,12-10-2024,006379.png,"Malta should start discussing the introduction of doctor-assisted dying “in the new year” with the UK Bill serving as a blueprint for the national debate, Health Minister Jo Etienne Abela said.
 He stressed that the government would continue enhancing efforts to improve palliative care - also known as end-of-life care.
 However, in extreme circumstances where there was no hope, assisted dying could apply.
 The Labour Party committed to commencing a national discussion on euthanasia.
 The 2022 general election manifesto  stated: “The time has come for a national, mature discussion on the introduction of voluntary euthanasia for terminally ill patients.”
 The minister echoed what he said in an interview with Times of Malta in March when he recalled a close friend who was battling an illness and said that: “We will offer palliative care to patients, of course, but sometimes even the best palliative care leaves the patient in a lot of pain with no hope of surviving. In those circumstances, I believe doctor-assisted suicide is suitable and justified.”
  The UK Assisted Dying Bill passed its second reading last week following a debate that divided MPs across party lines. The bone of contention centres around whether sufficient safeguards are in place to prevent abuse.
 The UK  bill lays out a legal framework for people with terminal or incurable illnesses to seek medical assistance in ending their lives. Key provisions include: eligibility criteria requiring the individual to be over 18, mentally competent, and suffering from unbearable pain due to a terminal or incurable illness.
 It states that two independent doctors must evaluate the patient’s condition to confirm eligibility, followed by judicial approval from a high court judge, who ensures that all legal safeguards are followed.
 The bill also mandates consultation with family members, though the final decision lies with the patient, who retains the right to withdraw the request at any point before the procedure. 
 Following last week’s Second Reading, full approval and implementation may take up to two more years. After further committee reviews and potential amendments, the bill will need additional votes in parliament.

"Increase in diver treatments at Malta’s hyperbaric unit, surpassing 50",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/increase-diver-treatments-malta-hyperbaric-unit-surpassing-50.1098389,24-09-2024,006476.png,"Malta’s hyperbaric unit has treated 57 divers so far this year, already surpassing its yearly average of 50, according to data obtained by Times of Malta.
 The country operates two hyperbaric facilities: one at Mater Dei Hospital, which typically treats 50 divers annually, and another at Gozo General Hospital, which averages around 30 divers each year.
 Hyperbaric oxygen chambers treat and prevent decompression sickness – a condition caused when divers ascend too quickly, leading to nitrogen bubbles forming in the bloodstream.
 The chambers gradually return divers to safe pressure levels, preventing the dangerous effects of the condition. 
 Dr Stephen Muscat, former head consultant at Mater Dei’s hyperbaric unit, said he expects the number of treated divers to rise further as the diving season is still under way.
 The period from August to October is often regarded as the best time of year for scuba diving due to more affordable accommodation prices, which attract foreign divers to Malta.
 In addition, he noted that a growing interest in technical diving – which involves greater depths and complex decompression stops – is making divers more prone to accidents.
 “Malta is fast becoming a mecca for technical diving and with the right preparation and training, it can be an enjoyable experience. However, it exposes divers to several risks. That is when the hyperbaric units are required,” Muscat said.
 Technical diving requires specialised training, experience and equipment to manage the increased risks compared to recreational diving.
 
 Dives often exceed the 40-metre mark and involve careful planning for decompression stops.
 Participants on technical dives use specialised equipment, including multiple gas cylinders, different gas mixtures, rebreathers and other gear that is not used in recreational diving.
 Technical dives also often involve meticulous planning for gas management, decompression schedules and contingencies for emergencies.
 Muscat pointed out that even highly skilled and well-prepared divers can face unexpected situations and may require treatment at either of the two units.
 He said that most diving schools in Malta are professional and take extremely good care of their instructors and students. 
 But recent incidents have shown some are willing to take more risks than they should, with Muscat referencing a recent incident off Wied iż-Żurrieq. 
 On September 10, five divers were rescued by the Armed Forces of Malta and the Civil Protection Department after they were swept out to sea by strong currents and large waves.
 Two of the divers required hospital treatment.
 
 “In this particular case, the divers did not require the hyperbaric unit, but it shows how extra care is due even when inclement weather is forecast,” he said.
 Muscat proposed the introduction of ‘dive marshalls’ to assess conditions and determine whether diving should be allowed, particularly in the areas known for diving accidents such as Żurrieq and Ċirkewwa in Malta, and Dwejra in Gozo.
 “Besides saving lives at no cost, if put in operation, there would be less need for helicopters to take to the skies and for emergency doctors and nurses to risk their lives,” he insisted.
 He also believes such a system would help with safeguarding Malta’s reputation as a safe diving destination.
 The hyperbaric facilities in Malta and Gozo are currently operated by two consultants: Kurt Magri replaced Muscat as clinical lead, while Lyuvisa Matity, a Hungarian national, has been working in Malta for the past eight years.
 One other consultant is currently suspended following the death of a Polish diver while receiving treatment at Malta’s unit on July 6.
 Times of Malta revealed this week that the consultant had gone home leaving the patient under the observation of a junior trainee.

 Times of Malta reported on Sunday that the company had set up a €1 million fund that was suspected to have been aimed at passing on bribes to Joseph Muscat, Keith Schembri and Konrad Mizzi.
 The funds were held by Accutor AG, a Swiss company suspected of being used as a centralised money-laundering hub for payments linked to the hospitals deal involving Vitals and Steward.
 “Steward strenuously objects to the suggestion that the company created a ‘political support fund’. We have never been asked for – nor provided – financial favours by any current or former Maltese official or minister and no such fund ever existed,"" the company said on Monday.
 The company made no reference to the fact the Maltese appeals court in October declared the contract as null after confirming fraud. Senior government officials were complicit in the privatisation fraud and the Maltese government had failed in its duty to protect the national interest, and defended Steward throughout the process, the court had said.
 Steward said it had purchased a concession for an end-of-useful life small community hospital, a rehab facility in poor shape; and an abandoned asbestos-infested building.
 ""We also inherited many unexpected liabilities totalling over €60 million. The original terms of the concession have been described by the Government of Malta itself, the EU, and the National Audit Office as “unbankable”.
 Steward spent years negotiating with the government in good faith to bring the concession in line with regulations and make it bankable,"" the company said.
 “It is during this time that Steward hired and paid Accutor as a business management consultant for a limited period. Those efforts to regularise the contract were unsuccessful and Steward was left with no choice but to terminate the contract for breach and launch legal proceedings against Malta with the International Court of Arbitration,"" the US-based company said. 
 Steward claimed that Malta's media ""indulges in ridiculous conspiracy theories and conjecture"" and complained that it was not asked for information.
 ""We also understand that this may be an issue of interest for the magisterial inquiry and the courts. It is astonishing that this inquiry has taken over four years to conduct, reportedly costing over €10 million, and yet we have never been asked once for any information related to the content of this article,"" the company said.
 It insisted it was ""consistently transparent.
 ""However, neither the Maltese media nor the courts seem interested in dealing with the facts.”

‘We couldn’t honour my father’s dying wish’: Roger Tirazona,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/we-couldn-t-honour-father-dying-wish-roger-tirazona.1097469,09-02-2024,006552.png,"The father of actor and singer Roger Tirazona had one final wish before he died – to be cremated and have his remains sent to the Philippines – a wish his family could not honour because Malta keeps waiting to build its first crematorium.
 Tirazona, who is also a visiting university lecturer, said his family was unable to fulfil his father’s wish due to the advanced stage of decomposition and the associated logistical challenges, compounded by the emotional strain of grief they were going through.
 
 Since Malta legalised cremation but still has no crematorium, it was very difficult to transport the body to the nearest crematorium in Sicily and “the wishes of a dying man couldn’t be honoured”, his son said.
 “His body was interred in a state grave where his remains will be removed eventually and lost forever,” he wrote.
 “I always believed that politics was there to serve the people and their existential concerns as well. What could be more existential than honouring a man’s life and death in a dignified way?”
 Roger Tirazona Senior died on January 11. Speaking to Times of Malta, Tirazona said his father died at home in his sleep, “covered by a blanket and his body stayed in that circumstance for quite some time” before he found him.
 Since he was in an advanced state of decomposition, the mortuary staff did not even use the burial clothes the family provided – a traditional Filipino outfit called ‘Barong Tagalog’.
 “We were not allowed to open the sealed casket due to rapidly advancing decomposition. I doubt that in these circumstances, flying the corpse to Sicily would have been practical, or respectful, to be honest,” he said.
 The family’s experience is not unique. Many have faced similar challenges in recent years, as the country’s only option for cremation has been to send remains overseas. This process can be both costly and emotionally taxing for grieving families.
 Despite the law legalising cremation in Malta being passed in 2019, progress towards building a domestic crematorium has been slow. While several applications have been submitted, planning and environmental concerns have hindered the process.
  Local funeral directors and advocates have called on the government to prioritise the establishment of a crematorium, citing the growing demand for this service and the environmental benefits it offers. They argue that a local facility would not only provide families with a more convenient and affordable option but also reduce the need for overseas transportation.
 “I cannot for the life of me fathom why this is the case, in 2024. Cremation is a fundamental civic service, that should be encouraged and subsidised by the government for environmental reasons, apart from meaningful existential reasons for the Maltese population,” Tirazona said.
 “It is incredible that this service exists for our deceased pets, but not for humans who opt for it.”
 Even worse, the grief and trauma of losing his father overwhelmed him, making it difficult to handle practical matters, he admitted. If cremation were a straightforward option, he could have honoured his father’s wishes without the added stress of arranging transportation to Sicily.
 “Not to mention that had we taken him to Siciliy, it would have made the burial tremendously more expensive. Such service should be accessible to people of all means and should not be setting people behind around €5,000 in airline charges and other expenses,” he said.
 “It is far better and more practical than a burial in overly saturated state-owned graves – and with a growing population, how long will these last?”
 Questions were sent to the health ministry.
 Since Malta legalised cremation in 2019, there was a significant increase in the number of people who began to consider this new burial option for themselves or their relatives.
 The law not only introduced a burial alternative, but also allows people the flexibility to decide what to do with the ashes. It specifies that each crematorium has a mortuary, a viewing room, adequate facilities for the extraction of implants from the body, a cremation room and a storage room for remains.

Joseph Rapa dropped as APS Bank director after Vitals criminal charges,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/joseph-rapa-dropped-aps-board-directors-vitals-inquiry-charges.1092195,05-09-2024,006634.png,"Joseph Rapa, the former health permanent secretary facing criminal charges over the Vitals' deal to run three state hospitals has been dropped from the APS board of directors.
 Rapa led Chris Fearne's health ministry as its top civil servant between March 2013 and May 2022, spanning the period of negotiations with Vitals and Steward and throughout the concession period.
 On Thursday the bank said that on May 8, the Diocese of Gozo, as a Qualifying Shareholder, had decided to ""temporarily withdraw the re-appointment of  Joseph Rapa as director"".  
 His charges are identical to two other permanent secretaries - Alfred Camilleri and Ronald Mizzi - meaning he is charged with fraud, having made fraudulent gains and misappropriation.
 He will also be charged with having committed crimes he was duty-bound to prevent.

Steward Health Care files for bankruptcy in the US,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/steward-health-care-files-bankruptcy.1092011,05-06-2024,006799.png,"Steward Health Care, the US healthcare giant embroiled in the ‘fraudulent’ privatisation of three of Malta’s public hospitals, is filing for bankruptcy, the company announced on Monday.
 In a statement, the company said that “it has commenced an in-court restructuring process through the filing of voluntary petitions for relief” in a Texas court.
 Steward CEO Ralph de la Torre said that a “primary factor” in its decision to file for bankruptcy was “Steward continuing to face challenges created by insufficient reimbursement by government payors as a result of decreasing reimbursement rates”.
 “Filing for Chapter 11 restructuring is in the best interests of our patients, physicians, employees, and communities at this time,” he said.
 Steward currently runs over 30 hospitals across the US, but has become increasingly embattled in recent years as its debts racked up.
 Steward became a household name in Malta in early 2018, when it took over the concession that had awarded St Luke’s Hospital, Karin Grech Hospital and Gozo General Hospital to Vitals Global Healthcare.
 The concession was annulled by Malta’s courts last year, under the suspicion of fraud. The decision to scrap the concession was confirmed on appeal, with courts finding “""collusion between Steward and senior government officials or its agencies"".
 Steward and the Maltese government have since been locked in arbitration proceedings.
 The saga took a new turn last week, as news broke that a magisterial inquiry into the role of Joseph Muscat and several other public officials in the deal had been completed.
 The inquiry spells bad news for many of the saga’s most prominent faces. On Tuesday, Muscat said that he expects to be charged, while others, including EU Funds Minister Chris Fearne and Central Bank Governor Edward Scicluna are also  expected to face lesser charges.
 Muscat, who has long been fighting to have the inquiring magistrate Gabriella Vella removed from the case, described the case as a personal “vendetta”. Meanwhile, Fearne insisted that he had never broken any law or ministerial ethics.
 Developments across the pond
 In a press conference in the US on Monday, Massachusetts state governor Maura Healey delivered a broadside against Steward's management following news the company had filed for bankruptcy.  
 “This situation stems from and is rooted in greed, mismanagement and lack of transparency on the part of Steward leadership in Dallas,” she said, as reported by Boston 25 News.  
 According to the news network, Steward employs 16,000 workers in the state and caters for 200,000 patients annually.  
 While reassuring state residents that hospitals operated by the company would be “operating as usual,” Healey said she could not guarantee there wouldn’t be disruptions.  
 Commenting on the bankruptcy, she said: “Ultimately, this is a goal of getting Steward out of Massachusetts.”  
 Last week, the state activated its ‘Incident Command System’ to maintain patient access to Steward healthcare facilities. 
 Steward’s demise follows the company's announcement last month it was closing its New England Sinai Hospital in the state after announcing in January the centre's financial performance had plummeted by 1,600% over the past five years.  
 The company blamed “skyrocketing expenses” for the decision and said it owed around $50 million in unpaid rent, according to Boston 25 News.

The network that enabled the Vitals ‘Ponzi scheme’,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/the-network-enabled-vitals-ponzi-scheme.1093059,27-05-2024,006859.png,"Investigators did not mince their words. 
 The hospitals' deal had all the hallmarks of a “ Ponzi scheme”.
 Its design was simple: divert millions in public funds into private hands. 
 A close-knit coterie of politicians, enablers and front men were the suspected beneficiaries of the scheme. 
 The supposed investors behind Vitals, trusted by Joseph Muscat’s government to run three public hospitals, did little by way of investment. 
 On the rare occasion when private funds were invested in the hospitals, these were largely “swallowed up in fees and expenses” charged by people connected to Vitals, or used to refund earlier investors. 
 Public money was even used to buy or establish companies to generate private profits. 
 One such example is Technoline. 
 A total of €5 million in public funds was used to buy the medical supply company. 
 Former government officials Keith Schembri and Konrad Mizzi were set to take a cut from this, via a secret stake in Technoline. 
 Saba Abbas, Vitals’ financial controller, drew up a report estimating that €26 million in public money was siphoned off in just under 18 months. 
 The report landed on Schembri’s desk in 2017. Instead of immediately reporting the fraud to the police, investigators suspect Schembri used the information as leverage to boot out Vitals and usher in Steward. 
 This mass suspected diversion of public money had many alleged enablers and architects. 
 Auditors, lawyers and accountants were all allegedly complicit. 
 Some faces are familiar, others less so. Nexia BT’s Brian Tonna earned himself the moniker of a “professional money launderer”. 
 Tonna, who set up secret Panama companies for Schembri and Mizzi, was one of the early “architects” of the hospitals project. 
 Technoline’s owner on paper, Ivan Vassallo, is another suspected launderer. 
 Vassallo “created” invoices to lend a façade of legitimacy to suspected kickback payments. 
 Vitals' auditor Chris Spiteri was allegedly paid to look the other way.
 Instead of scrutinising transactions, Spiteri “set aside his professional ethics” and accepted a €50,000 bonus from Steward to give the Vitals books a clean bill of health. 
 The result: a “clean but ultimately unethical audit of Vitals,” which facilitated Steward’s takeover of the hospital concession in 2018. 
 Lawyer David Meli, who represented both Vitals and Steward, was identified as being in a position of authority to identify suspect financial arrangements and flows involving public funds. 
 The law firm DF Advocates and its partners have also been pinpointed as key enablers in the early concession deal. 
  Muscat, Schembri and Mizzi have been charged with criminal association. 
 This was not just about turning a blind eye. 
 Investigators charge that the ex-prime minister, his chief aide and the former health minister were actively complicit. 
 Of the three, Schembri is the one most heavily implicated.  He and “secret” Vitals beneficiary Shaukat Ali were two sides of the same coin. 
 The moment Mizzi signed off on the deal, Ali earned himself a $5 million success fee payable to a company in Dubai. 
 
 At that same moment, Ali was actively setting up “money laundering structures” in Dubai for Mizzi and Schembri.
 The timing was not a coincidence, investigators allege. 
 Similar “money laundering structures” were set up for Mizzi and Schembri in Panama. Muscat stood by his two men when their Panama plans were outed in 2016. 
 Unproven claims linked Muscat to a third Panama company – Egrant. 
 The three ex-government officials have once again been connected to “money-laundering structures”, this time in Switzerland. 
 Accutor, a Swiss company, was pumped with millions in cash by Steward Health Care. 
 Steward had been ushered in by Muscat’s government as the saviours of the hospital deal. 
 After pumping Accutor full of cash, Muscat, Schembri and Mizzi formed either direct or indirect financial relationships with the company. 
 The chances of these relationships having been formed independently and by coincidence are “negligible,” investigators say. 
 Others in power stood by while all this happened. 
 Politicians and their mandarins failed to put a stop to the rot. 
 Chris Fearne,  Edward Scicluna and their respective permanent secretaries Joseph Rapa and Alfred Camilleri have all been charged with fraud. Mizzi’s permanent secretary Ronald Mizzi has also been charged. 
 The inquiry offers snippets into their actions... or inactions. 
 Fearne was e-mailed details about the Vitals “consortium” by Tonna as early as July 2014. 
 He was also copied in on e-mails about the due diligence – or lack of it – that had been carried out on the people behind Vitals. 
 At the time of this correspondence, in June 2016, Fearne had already taken over from Mizzi as health minister. 
 Other evidence suggests Fearne was kept in the dark about certain aspects of the deal. 
 Scicluna too appears to have taken a backseat role throughout. 
 Months after the deal was sealed, e-mail correspondence shows Scicluna was still awaiting financial details about the concession from Mizzi. 
 A presentation about the deal’s impact on public finances was given at the Office of the Prime Minister. Mizzi and Schembri were present. Scicluna and Camilleri were not, investigators concluded based on analysis of e-mail correspondence. 
 Scicluna also appears to have been unaware that Camilleri sat on the board of Projects Malta. Projects Malta was the government entity tasked with handling the “fraudulent” award of the contract to Vitals. 
 “He [Camilleri] is either dumb by accepting to be on a board when he is not informed on what is happening or he was getting paid and thus he closed an eye or else he knew what was happening and he did not say anything to anybody”, a ministry official told Scicluna. 
 Ronald Mizzi appears to have been heavily involved at various stages of the concession. 
 According to testimony, members of the Projects Malta evaluation committee were directly answerable to him, bypassing the entity’s former chairperson Adrian Said. 
 Mizzi e-mailed Said a list of the people who would be appointed to the evaluation committee. The initial list included Tonna, who was later replaced by his colleague Manuel Castagna.

Consultant to be charged over Polish diver’s death,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/consultant-charged-polish-diver-death.1098740,29-09-2024,006863.png,"A magisterial inquiry into the death of a Polish diver has found grounds for a hyperbaric consultant to face criminal charges for involuntary homicide.
 The inquiry has recommended that the 43-year-old consultant be held accountable for his failures on the day of Krzysztof Białecki’s death on July 6.
 If convicted, he could face up to four years in prison and a fine of €11,646.
 The report, led by Magistrate Joe Mifsud, concludes that the medical specialist’s absence during critical moments and his reliance on a trainee contributed to Białecki’s death. 
 The mismanagement of his treatment, including incorrect assumptions about the dive depth and an improper diagnosis of his condition, were further evidence of negligence.
 Krzysztof Białecki, 48, died while receiving treatment at the hyperbaric unit, hours after trying to save another diver.
 His death followed an unfortunate diving accident involving diver Dominik Dubaj during a dive on the wreck of Le Polynesien, located at a depth of 60 metres off Marsascala.
 Both divers were part of a pod of seven who had received the necessary permits from Heritage Malta to explore the wreck.
 During the dive, Dubaj, 45, experienced problems, panicked and began an uncontrolled ascent. Białecki attempted to assist him, and both men surfaced without completing their decompression stops.
 Dubaj was rushed to Mater Dei Hospital but died shortly after. His death was attributed to a cerebral artery gas embolism and pulmonary barotrauma.
 Białecki, though initially stable, later succumbed to decompression sickness.
 The inquiry found no negligence on the part of the dive organisers, Dive Shack, or the other divers, noting that all appropriate measures were taken to save the lives of Dubaj and Białecki.
 However, the care provided to Białecki at the hospital was scrutinised, particularly the actions and decisions of the hyperbaric consultant in charge.
 The inquiry revealed a series of critical errors in the medical specialist’s management of Białecki’s treatment.
 Notably, he left the hospital during the crucial moments of Białecki’s care, delegating responsibility to a higher specialist trainee in medicine, who, it was noted, “was still undergoing training and thus ill-equipped to handle complications and make key treatment decisions”.
 Although the consultant instructed the trainee to maintain phone contact, advising him not to make major decisions independently, he was absent from the hospital for a prolonged period in the afternoon.
 He returned only at 6.40pm, approximately 10 minutes after Białecki suffered cardiac arrest in the hyperbaric chamber.
 The inquiry also raises serious concerns about the treatment provided, particularly regarding the consultant’s incomplete understanding of the circumstances surrounding the dive.
 He admitted in his sworn statement that he was unaware of the exact depth at which the divers were operating, mistakenly assuming it to be 50 metres when the wreck lies at 60 metres.
 This misjudgement led to incorrect assumptions in his treatment approach.
 The inquiry notes how during the initial treatment phase, Białecki experienced difficulty breathing due to low-pressure valves not opening properly.
 Although this issue was eventually resolved, the treatment profile was not paused, and the lost minutes were not compensated, resulting in a greater nitrogen load in Białecki’s blood.
 This delay, while not the direct cause of death, exacerbated the condition.
 The consultant also misdiagnosed Białecki’s condition over the phone, suspecting oxygen toxicity when, in reality, the diver was likely experiencing decompression sickness.
 He advised administering Ativan, a sedative, though he incorrectly stated that it was available in injectable form when it is only available in pill form.
 While the consultant believed the Ativan was never administered, evidence showed that two 1mg Ativan pills were given to Białecki at 5.10pm.
 As the evening progressed, Białecki’s condition deteriorated. At 6.20pm, he became agitated, removed his mask and complained of increased abdominal pain and shortness of breath.
 The trainee, who was outside the main chamber, informed his superior of the deterioration. But the consultant, still away from the hospital, declined the trainee’s request to summon an anaesthetist in preparation for CPR.
 Białecki suffered cardiac arrest at 6.31pm, and the CPR team was alerted.
 The consultant arrived at the hospital at 6.42pm, but by then, the situation had become critical. Białecki was declared dead at 7.10pm.
 The consultant has been suspended pending the outcome of the magisterial inquiry.
 There is one other known fatal incident in similar circumstances – in 1985, a fully conscious diver entered the chamber for treatment but died later.

No need for alarm over COVID cases – health minister,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/no-need-alarm-covid-cases-health-minister.1094572,28-06-2024,006951.png,"There is no reason to be concerned about June’s surge in COVID-19 cases, Health Minister Jo-Etienne Abela told Times of Malta.
 “We do not think there is any cause for alarm,” he said when asked about the spike in the number of cases.
 Since the beginning of June, there have been 232 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and three deaths from the disease.  Abela said the three people who died were aged between 70 and 86.
  There are currently 83 COVID patients at Mater Dei Hospital but none are in the Intensive Care Unit. There are also eight patients at Saint Vincent de Paul home for the elderly.
 Abela said: “It might be very transmissible and therefore, in situations where there are mass gatherings, like any other virus... the influenza virus, the common cold virus… if a virus is very transmissible, the cases will rise.”
 The minister also said the cases are no more serious or complicated than expected and they are not causing any stress on the health services.
 According to figures compiled by the health ministry, there were zero COVID cases in March and single-digit cases in April, but numbers increased in May and surged in June.
 According to Abela, most COVID cases in Malta are of the JN.1 variant, a subvariant of the Omicron variant.
 However, as of yesterday, there were also three registered cases of the LB.1 variant. The LB.1 variant is more transmissible than JN.1.
 “We urge personal care, but there is no need for alarm,” repeated Abela. He dispelled the notion that mandatory masks would be reintroduced but did say that if vulnerable people feel inclined to wear one, they are encouraged to do so.
 Furthermore, he encouraged people to practice personal hygiene, such as washing their hands and using alcohol-based hand sanitisers when necessary.

 The new helpline operated by between six to eight Servizz.gov agents handles everything from reports of abuse to advice on construction, health and safety.
 Of the calls, more than 700 were transferred to the Building and Construction Authority while more than 200 went to the Occupational Health and Safety Authority.
 Massimo Vella, CEO of Servizz.gov, who released the figures to Times of Malta, said the numbers were “higher than we expected”.
 “It shows that people wanted and needed a service like this,” he said.
 The 138 helpline – given the digits of construction victim  Jean Paul Sofia’s birthday – was launched on August 5.
 Agents from Servizz.gov take the calls before directing them to the appropriate entity, either the BCA, which is responsible for safeguarding construction sites and neighbouring properties, or the OHSA, which looks after worker health and safety.
 The most common calls were about dust emissions, non-compliance with BCA protocols on construction sites and fears of property damage due to nearby construction.
 For the OHSA, common issues reported include workplace accidents and construction workers failing to adhere to safety regulations, such as wearing protective clothing.
 Vella remarked that nearly everyone in Malta has witnessed health and safety regulations being ignored in the construction industry.
 “When I see these incidents take place, I get a chill down my spine,” he said.
 “If a person sees a lack of safety regulations in place, as a result, they won’t feel safe, which builds insecurity.”
 He said the helpline means people now have a service to use to address their concerns.
 “The spirit of 138 is that we now all have a voice,” he said.
 The average time it takes to handle a call on the round-the-clock deadline to the 138 helpline is five minutes, he said.
 He added that Servizz.gov had launched a programme in March that would use data analytics to improve performance across its 24 hubs.

 In a statement published on Wednesday afternoon, the bank said that he would ""step aside from the exercise of his function, in order to devote more time to defend his innocence which he reaffirms"".
 It said the move was ""for a temporary period, until the outcome of the court proceedings.""
 Scicluna will be replaced by Alexander Demarco, the bank’s deputy governor as of tomorrow. This situation will remain in place “until the outcome of court proceedings”, the bank said.
 Scicluna’s decision, and his temporary replacement by Demarco, have already been communicated to Christine Lagarde, the European Central Bank president, the bank added.
 The statement brings an end to a protracted impasse between Scicluna and the government, with Scicluna saying that he was prepared to resort to European courts had he been sacked by Cabinet.
 The stalemate was eventually resolved during a lengthy Cabinet meeting on Tuesday during which an agreement for Scicluna to step aside by mutual consent was devised.
 Scicluna, whose term as Central Bank governor will end in December 2025, will retain his full pay throughout his hiatus.
 The former finance minister faces charges of fraud and misappropriation in relation to the Vitals hospitals case.
 Last week, a court ruled there was enough evidence for him and former health minister Chris Fearne to stand trial.
 The key reason for the decision was their failure to object to cabinet decisions on a controversial hospitals deal, which handed three hospitals to Vitals Global Healthcare and Steward and was later declared fraudulent.

"Double-check patient identity, healthcare workers ordered",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/health-ministry-orders-staff-doublecheck-patient-identity.1097570,09-03-2024,007411.png,"Healthcare workers have been ordered to double-check patients' identities when offering services, in what appears to be a response to recent allegations of idenitity fraud.
 A letter circulated among staff in all government healthcare institutions on Tuesday instructed them to confirm the patient's identity by asking for their ID number, full name and date of birth.
 Demographic data, such as address, mobile number and telephone number should also be checked, the letter says, and patients should also be asked to present their ID card, residence permit, passport or driving licence.
 Times of Malta saw a copy of the letter which the Ministry's Permanent Secretary sent to staff.
 It was sent out just weeks after dozens of people claimed to have discovered that their medical files contained upcoming appointments for serious tests and surgeries they did not need, data about hospital admissions they never underwent and medication they were never prescribed for illnesses they never had.
 One man who went for a check-up at a public healthcare clinic in June was even told his medical records listed him as having died in March.
 The complaints surfaced after lawyer Jason Azzopardi claimed last month that Maltese ID card holders were “robbed” of their identities and that several ID numbers were allegedly assigned to other people through corrupt practices at Identità.
 The anomalies largely remain a mystery and there is an ongoing data protection investigation and a magisterial inquiry into Azzopardi's claims.
 Although Tuesday's ministerial circular does not specify that the new orders were issued to deal with this matter, staff were instructed to make all the checks that would specifically avoid these conflicting medical records.
 Staff were also told to cross-verify health records, for instance.
 ""Before accessing or updating any health records confirm that the identifiers in the patient's health records match the details provided by the patients or their authorised representative. This applies to every point of contact, including, but not limited to registration, consultation, test ordering, diagnostics and treatment,"" the letter said.
 ""When confirming identity engage the patient by asking them to state, not just confirm, their information (for example: 'Can you please tell me your date of birth?', instead of: 'Is your date of birth [x]'?). This practice reduces the risk of errors due to miscommunication or assumptions.""
 The instructions say that if at any point during the process, the system flags discrepancies the information must be verified again and any discrepancies must be documented and ""escalated immediately to the Medical Records Department"".
 ""Compliance with these guidelines is mandatory,"" the letter reads. ""Failure to follow these guidelines may result in disciplinary action.""
 Identità welcomed the news that patients’ identities will now have to be confirmed before receiving a service. 
 In a statement on Tuesday, the state agency said that such practices should be adopted by all organisations. 
 It added that regulators should ensure that private entities that fall under their responsibility make themselves compliant with all regulations, including those related to data protection.

The secret Vitals 'owner' with hands all over the deal,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/red-flags-vitals-owner-triggered-probe.1092806,22-05-2024,"007437.png,007438.png","Corruption red flags concerning one of the key players in the Vitals deal should have triggered further scrutiny by the government and lawyers involved, an investigation has found.
 A 'Shaukat Ali Chaudhary' was among those charged with a multimillion bribery case in Lahore, Pakistan back in 2002, lawyers working on his bid to take over Maltese state hospitals discovered.
 He was subsequently convicted but received a presidential pardon, Pakistani media reports dated 2008 and 2009 showed. 
 Ali - a Pakistani businessman with Maltese citizenship believed to be the hidden hand behind Vitals - told  Times of Malta that he was not the same person named in Pakistani media reports. 
 ""Shaukat Ali is a very common name in Pakistan and Chaudhary is the surname of millions of Pakistanis,"" he said. ""The Shaukat Ali you are referring to was a politician. To my knowledge he passed away some time ago,"" he said. 
 Concerns about Ali's potential criminal past, however, were sharp enough for lawyers in late 2014 and early 2015 to classify him as a politically exposed person associated with a bribery scandal in Pakistan. 
 Those lawyers were preparing paperwork for a bid by the Ali-controlled company Crossrange to take over three Maltese state hospitals.
 Ali appeared intent on effectively taking over Malta’s healthcare sector. As lawyers prepared his bid to run the public hospitals, he was also negotiating to buy 49 per cent of Saint James Hospital, the largest privately owned hospital in the country.
 The deal with Saint James fell through but Ali’s plans with the Maltese government were safer: he already had a signed memorandum of understanding with the Joseph Muscat government.
 But there was a problem. The government couldn’t award the hospitals concession directly. EU rules required it to issue a public call for the concession.
 A public call meant due diligence checks and more scrutiny and it is unlikely Ali would have passed EU-required checks, given the due diligence red flags.
 After Ali’s name was flagged, Crossrange was removed from all paperwork related to the bid.
 Instead, the bidder was listed as Vitals Global Healthcare, a newly incorporated firm that was 100 per cent owned by Bluestone Investments.
 Vitals went on to win the 30-year, €4 billion contract to operate Karin Grech, St Luke’s and Gozo General hospitals. The National Audit Office and a civil court both concluded Vitals should have been disqualified from bidding because it had secretly negotiated the deal with the Maltese government before tendering began.
 The entire concession was repealed and annulled by a judge in 2023 and is now the subject of a raft of criminal prosecutions against a series of politicians, lawyers and accountants involved in the deal.
 A number of lawyers are among those facing charges. Ali, who is based overseas, is also expected to be charged with crimes.
 When contacted, Ali confirmed that he is likely to be charged in court.
 He said allegations were “absolutely baseless” and came from “untrustworthy, unreliable and unstable people and sources, whose facts are based on suppositions, lies and fabrications”.
 “I feel that we have become the victims of a political football and the subject of vile allegations made by mendacious people,” Ali said.
 He told Times of Malta that he was ""never owner nor director of VGH or any of its subsidiaries or related companies.""
 While Ali does not appear anywhere on Bluestone’s ownership structure, he had myriad links to the company, investigators probing the hospitals deal found.
 His son, Asad, was put in charge of negotiations with the Maltese government.
 Ali’s wife sat on Bluestone’s board and various companies linked to Ali received millions of euros from Vitals, either through massive consultancy contracts or by being engaged by the hospitals as suppliers.
 One of those companies, Mount Everest FZ, was the very first firm that Bluestone paid as soon as it received its first tranche of money from the Maltese government. Mount Everest FZ was the single largest recipient of funds from Vitals owner Bluestone, investigators have concluded.
 And when Vitals looked to hire a financial controller and auditor, it turned to people within Ali’s trusted inner circle: his financial controller, Saba Abbas, and auditor Chris Spiteri.
 Spiteri, who is also facing criminal charges, has said he never had any knowledge of wrongdoing and that he has been unfairly targeted for prosecution.
  Ali had another, lucrative link to Bluestone in the form of a 2015 deal that would see him net €100,000 a month as a ‘senior consultant’, investigators have concluded. 
 Ostensibly just a consultant to Vitals owner Bluestone, Ali also got the most expensive company car in the Vitals fleet – a €120,000 Mercedes Benz worth more than the car assigned to its managing director, Ram Tumuluri. His sons and wife were also assigned company cars, despite having no official roles at the company.
 Tumuluri was the Canadian-Indian businessman who served as the public face of Vitals Global Healthcare. But investigators think he was effectively just a frontman. Ali, they believe, was the man really calling the shots. 
 Ali is alleged to have operated massive, State-owned charities in Muammar Gaddafi’s Libya and one of his sons had business in the country with the daughters of former PN minister – later Labour adviser – John Dalli.
 Investigators believe that it was Dalli who introduced Ali to Muscat. Soon, Ali was describing himself as an “unofficial adviser” to Muscat, at the time Malta's prime minister.
 Muscat was aware of that, e-mails show, and did nothing to deny it.
 He has previously told Times of Malta that Ali was not listed as one of his advisers and that he had “no say about how people describe themselves”.
 Dalli stopped short of denying that he introduced the two when asked about that in 2023 by  Times of Malta.
 Ali told Times of Malta he had ""no friendship or any kind of relationship"" with Gaddaffi and that ""as per my knowledge John Dalli has nothing to do with the VGH project."" 
 Months after Muscat resigned as prime minister in 2020, he started receiving €15,000-a-month payments from another company linked to Ali – the Switzerland-based Accutor Consulting, which was previously called VGH Europe.
 Muscat says those payments were for legitimate consultancy work he did for the company. Investigators say he did not provide any evidence to back up that claim, save for an employment contract.
 Ali’s ties to Maltese politics stretched beyond the prime minister, however.
 He got a residency permit through Malta’s golden visa scheme and eventually even became a citizen. But, while investigators unearthed three separate Maltese passports in his name, state agency Identità has no record of Ali, his permits or passports.
 
 Ali told Times of Malta he only had one valid passport, which he renewed when it ran out of available pages or expired. 
 The Pakistani magnate is believed to have had a long-standing business relationship with Muscat’s trusted lieutenant, Keith Schembri and was in close contact with Schembri throughout the period under investigation.
 Within days of Vitals being awarded the deal to run the Maltese hospitals, Ali was helping Schembri and Mizzi set up secret companies in Dubai, similar to those they created in Panama.
 The former OPM chief of staff is also suspected of having interests in other, foreign projects led by yet another Ali-linked company, Spring, including a hospital in Egypt, a bank in Tunisia and a data centre in the Philippines.
 Schembri resigned as Muscat’s chief of staff in December 2019. But he continued to take an active interest in Spring’s business affairs; when the COVID-19 pandemic hit the following year, Schembri allegedly worked to secure deals for the company to sell hand sanitiser and virus testing kits.
 Muscat, Schembri and Mizzi all stand accused of corruption and bribery in relation to the hospitals deal. They are expected to plead not guilty when they appear in court for their arraignment next week.

"After near-death ordeal, JPO calls for more awareness about allergens",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/after-neardeath-ordeal-jpo-calls-awareness-allergens.1092677,19-05-2024,007467.png,"After experiencing an extreme allergic reaction out of thin air, a former MP is on a mission to raise more awareness about allergens and how to be prepared for them.
 Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando, a former member of parliament and current chair of the National Skills Council, was enjoying a walk in the countryside last week, one of several long treks he has been taking in preparation for an upcoming walking holiday.
 But while in one moment he was enjoying the scenic vistas of Mellieħa, in the very next his tongue began to swell and his throat started to constrict shut, severely restricting his breathing.
 Pullicino Orlando had experienced anaphylaxis – a severe and potentially fatal allergic reaction that usually occurs in response to an allergen, such as nuts or a bee sting.
 Speaking to Times of Malta, he admitted that while it was not the first time he experienced such an incident, he is still reeling from the effect it has had on him.
 “I was only walking through the countryside and suddenly it just started to happen,” he said.
 “It had happened to me once before and, I wouldn’t say that I had taken it lightly exactly, but I knew it was happening and was able to take precautions.
 “But this time it was worse and I was by myself in the middle of nowhere.”
 Thanks to an incredible response time and care from the emergency department, he was able to treat the anaphylaxis in time and come out on the other side of the incident unscathed.
 Pullicino Orlando, a well-known dentist, said the biggest lesson that has been imparted to him through this experience was to never leave the house unprepared and urges everybody who suspects they may also be susceptible to experiencing such extreme allergic reaction to do the same.
  “When I experienced it the first time, I was told that it could very likely happen again,” he said.
 “Now the lesson is learned and I will never leave the house without an EpiPen again, because in cases like this, a few minutes could really spell the difference between life or death.”
 EpiPens, or Epinephrine autoinjectors, are small devices that can be used to treat anaphylaxis as soon as symptoms are spotted.
 A dose of epinephrine solution, usually injected in the upper thigh muscle, is generally able to treat the symptoms of anaphylaxis in one dose.
  In doing more research on the topic, Pullicino Orlando has found that anaphylaxis can commonly occur in a food service setting, particularly when a person is served food that may unwittingly contain allergens that could trigger a reaction.
 “Part of the way I want to deal with what happened is to raise awareness about how easily it could happen,” he said.
 One such case that has stuck with him is that of Australian Nathan Anderson, who died from anaphylaxis on the street in New South Wales on the way back to his hotel room – where he was going to get his EpiPen.
 Anderson was out to dinner with some friends, having informed the wait staff of the allergens he was sensitive to. Unfortunately, due to an oversight, he was served a hummus that contained tahini (sesame seed paste) despite having warned that he was allergic to sesame.
 Having forgotten to bring an EpiPen with him, Anderson left the restaurant to retrieve it as soon as he started to feel symptoms but collapsed on a footpath on his way.
 Acknowledging that it is sometimes very difficult to prevent cross-contamination in food service, he said that more education efforts are needed to underscore how dangerous undisclosed ingredients in food can be.
 “I do feel in some areas training and awareness of the depth of the dangers that allergens pose in places where food is served is lacking,” he said.
 “Given the proximity to allergens, I would also like to see restaurants stocking EpiPens and training their staff how to use them; perhaps it should even be made obligatory. When you read horror stories of families who make it clear they are allergic to something and still find themselves unwittingly eating that food, it’s a terrible shame and it ruins lives.”
 Pullicino Orlando added he thinks that given the short shelf life and cost of EpiPens ‒ just one injector costs roughly €70, the government should consider distributing them for free.
 “I am fortunate that I do not have to think twice about purchasing EpiPens when I need them, but for others, the cost may very well be inhibiting and there should be fewer barriers to such a life-saving device,” he said.

"Vitals MOU did not give it any undue advantage, former ME boss insists",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/vitals-mou-give-undue-advantage-former-me-boss-insists.1097122,23-08-2024,007480.png,"A memorandum of understanding signed with Vitals Global Healthcare in 2014 gave them no undue advantage when bidding on a concession to run state hospitals, the former Malta Enterprise chief who drafted “a good part” of that document testified on Thursday. 
 Mario Galea insisted Vitals “could not have drawn an advantage from the information I gave in that MOU, because there was no information linked to the concession.” 
 “And if any other bidder had approached me, I would have given the same information,” he said when testifying at the second Vitals case on Thursday. 
 Galea was head of the Foreign Direct Investment unit at Malta Enterprise at the time. He would go on to be promoted to CEO of the entity. 
 His testimony focused on the MOU signed in October 2014. The National Audit Office had concluded that Vitals should have been precluded from bidding on the hospitals concession, as there was “significant overlap” between it and the MOU Vitals signed months before. 
 That concession was annulled by a court last year on the basis of fraud. Prosecutors have since pressed charges against many people involved in the deal. 
 Testifying in the case against former health minister Chris Fearne, former finance minister Edward Scicluna and others, Galea said that the government had wanted to attract foreign medical schools to Malta long before Vitals entered the scene. 
 A number of schools were shortlisted. 
 Barts was one of two that made it through the final shortlisting and a “Maltese professor” who worked with Barts “opened a window,” he said, leading the way to discussions which ultimately led to a signed agreement with government.
 That agreement focused on Gozo and included several obligations, namely the building of a medical school, an anatomy centre and training facilities for various medical specializations. 
 Anyone interested in running public hospitals would have to submit to those obligations concerning Gozo. 
 “My interest was always to ensure that all we promised Barts would be fulfilled,” said Galea. 
 “So how did you get to know about Vitals?” asked AG lawyer Rebekah Spiteri. 
 “I went to a meeting coordinated by the chief of staff at OPM [Keith Schembri],” replied Galea, adding that this was a “normal” procedure whereby Malta Enterprise would meet entrepreneurs to get an idea of what their investment consisted of. 
 Galea subsequently sought a “technical opinion” from audit firm RSM to make sure that the hospitals project was of an industrial nature in terms of law. He said he only met the Vitals representatives in person once. The MOU was signed by then-economy minister Chris Cardona. 
 On Wednesday, Cardona testified that Galea had told him to “just sign the MOU”.  In  testimony on Thursday, Cardona insisted that his testimony had been misquoted in various news outlets.
 Galea told the court that he “explained to [minister] Cardona the investor’s obligations.” 
 Vitals were given three to four months to submit a business plan and they did so, presenting it at a first floor meeting hall at Castille while led by Ram Tumuluri, Galea said. 
 Then-Energy and Health Minister Konrad Mizzi and then-parliamentary secretary Chris Fearne were also present. But the two had no involvement in the preceding months, he said. 
 Following that presentation, Galea received communication from Minister Mizzi who told him “this is not what we have in mind.” 
 “I told Cardona. We wrote to Vitals explaining that their business plan was not in line with what the government wanted.” The MOU was withdrawn. 
 Galea also said that he had drafted “quite a good part” of that document which he later described as “a piece of paper” bearing no validity. 
 “It was never something secretive….it was a normal MOU,” Galea testified. 
 Despite that claim, the MOU remained under wraps for years and was only exposed by Times of Malta in May 2017, more than two years later.
 Malta Enterprise battled against a  Times of Malta Freedom of Information request for a copy of it, and  won that battle. The National Audit Office also struggled to obtain a copy, with the Office of the Prime Minister, Fearne, Cardona and Mizzi’s ministries all telling it they had no information about it. 
 Under cross-examination by lawyer Stefano Filletti, Galea said that that MOU had “nothing but the conditions related to Barts.” 
 “From the information I gave in the MOU [Vitals] could certainly have not gained an advantage because there was no information linked to the concession. And if any other bidder had approached me, I would have given the same information.” 
 Asked whether he had given Vitals any information during the first meeting or subsequent communication to place them in an advantaged position, Galea replied in the negative, stressing “u lanqas kelli” [and I didn’t even have any].
 Former Lands Commissioner Peter Mamo presented a number of letters issued in 2015 and 2016, signed and countersigned by former minister Cardona, Minister Michael Falzon and former parliamentary secretary Deborah Schembri. 
 Those letters were to authorize the transfer of sites from the Lands department to Malta Industrial Parks. The owner would still be government and the lands would still be registered as “government property.” 
 He confirmed the relevance and importance of those letters, noting that they carried a minister’s signature. 
 Once Lands had verified that all property in question belonged to government and any necessary expropriations completed, the department issued two legal notices to effect the transfer to MIP. 
 Nowadays, such transfer does not take place by legal notice but by public deed. 
 Auditor General Charles Deguara told the court that in the National Audit Office’s view, the request for proposals to privatise three state hospitals was “essentially an extension of the MOU, with the sole difference that the MOU concentrated on Gozo while the RFP included St Luke’s and Karin Grech hospitals”. 
 The two documents came just five months apart. 
 Analyzing the evidence from a good governance point of view, the NAO flagged various shortcomings. 
 There should have been a more equitable sharing of risk, rather than government taking on too many risks while the concessionaire got the guarantees. 
 Since health authorities were not sufficiently involved in this health-related project, needs were not properly identified. 
 Since for the first four years, Vitals did not publish audited accounts, there was no clear picture of the financial state of the concessionaire. 
 That situation emerged when Steward took over and published audited accounts. 
 Lack of documentation made it difficult to find out “who contacted who” since the NAO received conflicting versions as to whether government approached Steward or vice versa. 
 There was also “unnecessary haste,” went on Deguara. 
 Under cross-examination, he confirmed that former permanent secretary Joseph Rapa never made any payments he ought not to.
 The negotiations committee kept no records or data and that was “very bad from a good governance” aspect. 
 “Do you know that the Attorney General - who was then State Advocate-  and who is now charging all these people here, gave [legal] advice for this contract not to be terminated?”asked Fearne’s and Scicluna’s lawyer Stephen Tonna Lowell.
 “Personally I don’t know but if you give me time I’ll check,” said Deguara. 
 However, he confirmed that under Fearne’s watch, there was some issue as to whether certain payments were due on the concession.
 “The [then] State Advocate gave legal advice saying that those amounts were to be paid.” 
 The case presided over by Magistrate Leonard Caruana continues in October.

 The government, therefore, needs to prioritise making walking and cycling (known collectively as 'active mobility') safer and more attractive than car use, the consultative document, called Strategy for Health-Enhancing Physical Activity recommends.
 The white paper was launched by health minister Jo Etienne Abela and Education Minister Clifton Grima on Thursday.
 It highlights actions the government needs to take to get more of Malta’s population moving. Among others, it recommends improving Malta’s walkability and bikeability.
 “In the EU, Malta recorded the lowest proportion of individuals who regularly engage in recreational or non-sport-related physical activity - including activities such as cycling - and one of the lowest proportions of individuals who walk at least four days a week,” the policy document notes.
 “This likely implies a lack of safe walking, cycling, and micro-mobility infrastructure in Malta, possibly coupled with a poor bicycle culture,” it adds.
 It suggests the drafting of national strategies for walking and cycling.
 Walking routes should ensure that pedestrians can safely walk from one village centre to another and get to amenities like bus stops, ferry terminals, playgrounds, shops, and schools. Roads should also be safe for those commuting by bicycle, the document adds.
  The document also notes that car-centric mobility has created unappealing and unsafe conditions for active transportation.
 A modal shift from the car to walking, cycling, and public transport would change this.
 “Road mobility strategies shall ensure that pedestrians, cyclists, users of micro-mobility, and collective transport are prioritized over private car use, in view of the negative environmental and health externalities of cars.”
 Town spaces should also be accessible and appealing to encourage the elderly to walk more. Tree canopies should be given priority in urban environments to reduce heat and make the area more pleasant.
 The strategy, which is up for consultation as of Friday, comes as three-quarters of Malta’s adult population rarely or never participate in active recreational activities like cycling, dancing, or gardening.
 Obesity rates in men (31%) and women (27%) are also significantly higher than the European Union average (17% for men and 16% for women). Obesity rates in children have also been increasing in recent years.
 Heart disease, cancer, and diabetes are all associated with a sedentary lifestyle and obesity.
 The health ministry document suggests introducing a minimum number of hours for physical activity in schools. Schools should have adequate facilities that encourage being active, and school trips should also promote physical activity.

 Plans for the new hospital were announced by the government in May, but no timelines had been given at the time. The project will be handled directly by the government. 
 Abela had said that Gozo would have a modern and comprehensive medical infrastructure for the provision of a high-quality healthcare service.
 The new hospital is projected to have around 400 beds.

US agents seize phones of Steward's De La Torre and Ernst: reports,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/us-agents-seize-phones-steward-de-la-torre-ernst-reports.1101593,26-11-2024,007742.png,"US federal agents have seized mobile phones belonging to former Steward Health Care CEO Ralph de la Torre and former Steward Malta CEO Armin Ernst, the Boston Globe has reported.
 Citing sources, the Globe said agents served both men with a search warrant and seized their phones in recent days.
 Both de la Torre and Ernst are among dozens of people facing charges in Malta in connection with the privatisation of three state hospitals – a deal a court struck off by a court last year, which concluded it was marked by signs of fraud.
 However, neither of the two men has yet appeared in a Maltese court to answer to charges. De La Torre’s lawyers have said that is because he is also facing charges in the US, while Ernst’s lawyer told the court his client’s wife is ill.
 De La Torre is Steward's majority shareholder and led the company in the US and abroad. Ernst served as CEO of its international operations, including its Malta branch, having previously served as CEO of the original hospitals concessionaire, Vitals Global Healthcare. 
 In May, Steward declared bankruptcy in the US, citing roughly $9 billion in liabilities. It is now being investigated for fraud, bribery, and corruption. The company was at one time the largest private healthcare provider in the USA.
 Several Steward board members, including former US House Speaker John Boehner, have been summoned to answer questions as part of that probe.
 Neither De La Torre nor Ernst has been charged by US prosecutors with any crime related to Steward’s bankruptcy so far, though De La Torre faces criminal proceedings over failing to testify when summoned by a US Senate committee.
 But legal experts who spoke to the Boston Globe said the fact that both men were subject to search warrants suggested prosecutors were closing in on them.
 Under US law, search warrants must be granted by a magistrate on the basis of “credible evidence” that a crime has been committed.
 “This [search warrant] makes it more likely to me that the prosecutors think that [de la Torre] is a participant in a crime” not a bystander, Mitchell Epner, a former federal prosecutor in New Jersey, told the news outlet. “Very often in a situation like this the underlings have already been contacted.”
 It is not known whether US prosecutors have been able to access the content of the two men’s phones. Another man facing charges in Malta in relation to the hospitals deal, former Prime Minister Joseph Muscat, refused to give prosecutors the password to his phone.
 A court heard last week that it will most likely take a year before the phone can be cracked.

 Investigators looking into the hospital deal discovered how the then OPM chief of staff would frequently use multiple e-mail addresses for the same conversations.
 “We have identified that Schembri and his associates routinely changed e-mail accounts during the course of e-mail conversations. This may indicate an attempt to mask the whole content of a message chain.”
 In one example, Schembri and then Health Minister Konrad Mizzi used their private e-mail accounts to communicate with Vitals director Ram Tumuluri in the days leading up to the formal signing of the concession contract.
 
 The conversation, which was found in Schembri’s ‘Frank Pillow’ e-mail, appeared to be about ongoing efforts by Tumuluri to secure close to €200 million in financing for the promised revamp of the St Luke’s, Karin Grech and Gozo hospitals.
 Schembri then forwarded the conversation from his ‘Frank Pillow’ e-mail account to another account linked to his Kasco business.
 Investigators said this exchange was significant, as it showed both Schembri and Mizzi were aware - prior to signing the Vitals contract - that Tumuluri had yet to raise the necessary financing for the project, but failed to raise the alarm.
 This financing by Vitals would never come, leaving the hospitals in a state of disrepair. 
 The use of their private e-mail accounts further suggested that Schembri and Mizzi were “privately” assisting Vitals, in a manner that was “separate but parallel” to their government roles.
 
 While not illegal, the use of private e-mail accounts to conduct government business leaves major gaps in accountability during sensitive discussions about the use of public funds. 
 Attempts by the Opposition to outlaw the practice as part of a wide-ranging anti-corruption bill have been shot down by Prime Minister Robert Abela’s government.
 Further examples of Schembri using his private e-mail account were found when Steward was negotiating the nuts and bolts of its takeover from Vitals.
 On January 21, 2018, Steward president Armin Ernst sent an e-mail to Schembri’s Gmail account clearly setting out Steward’s final position regarding the Vitals purchase.
 In the e-mail, Ernst flagged how Vitals had misused public money to fund the purchase of medical suppliers Technoline and Mtrace, another company that owned an expensive cancer treatment device called a cyclotron.
 Investigators said it would appear evident from the absence of any shocked response from Schembri that the misuse of public funds “was not news to him”.
 In fact, Vitals' financial controller Saba Abbas had already drawn up a report for Schembri detailing how Tumuluri allegedly misappropriated €26 million in public money from Vitals.
 Rather than immediately reporting this to the police, investigators say Schembri appeared to have instead used the knowledge as leverage over Tumuluri.
 Schembri, Mizzi and ex-Prime Minister Joseph Muscat are all set to face money-laundering and criminal association charges on Tuesday.

How much will Edward Scicluna earn until the end of his term?,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/how-much-edward-scicluna-earn-end-term.1096107,31-07-2024,007600.png,"After a week-long to-and-fro with Cabinet, Edward Scicluna agreed to temporarily step aside from his role at the helm of Malta’s Central Bank on Tuesday evening.
 Robert Abela confirmed that the agreement, which was reached “by mutual consent”, will see Scicluna retaining his same employment conditions, effectively placing him on gardening leave where he is entitled to the same salary and perks he received throughout his tenure.
 A reply to a parliamentary question several years ago sheds some light on this.
 In early 2021, Finance Minister Clyde Caruana told parliament that the Central Bank governor receives a basic pay of €115,000 and a 20% “responsibility allowance” (some €23,000).
 In total, this brings Scicluna’s salary up to €138,000 per year.
 At the time, this represented a significant bump over what his predecessor, economist Mario Vella, received.
 In the same parliamentary reply, Caruana revealed that previously the governor received a €100,000 pay packet, without the additional responsibility allowance.
 This means that Scicluna’s salary is some €38,000 higher than that of his predecessor.
 The salary bump was down to a discrepancy between the pay of Central Bank deputy governors and chief officers at MFSA, Caruana explained.
 Once the Central Bank’s deputy governors had their pay upped to match those of MFSA chief officers, the Central Bank governor’s pay was also bumped up to maintain “relativity” with his deputies, he said.
 Scicluna’s salary isn’t believed to have changed since 2021, with Caruana confirming as much in a reply to another parliamentary question about the matter last year.
 Scicluna is a little over three and a half years into his five-year tenure which is will end on 31st December 2025. This means that Scicluna is owed some €195,500 between now and when his term expires.
 Although his pay increased, Scicluna kept the same fringe benefits as his predecessor, many of which are customary in high-ranking public roles.
 So Scicluna has access to the use of a car, has his telephone and WiFi bills covered and benefits from a medical insurance plan. These are set to remain in place throughout his suspension.
 According to reports in The Shift News, Scicluna also received a yearly €12,000 honoraria for sitting on the MFSA board of governors, as is customary for Central Bank governors.
 But Scicluna has likely already lost this honoraria when he was axed from the board last week.
 His Central Bank salary isn’t his only income.
 Having served as an MEP between 2009 and 2013, Scicluna also receives an MEP’s pension, roughly equivalent to some 3.5% of his salary as an MEP for each full year in office. At the time of Scicluna’s election to the European Parliament, an MEP’s pre-tax salary was in the region of €92,000 annually.
 But sources told Times of Malta that Scicluna does not receive a pension as a former member of Cabinet, as would typically be the case, having joined Cabinet after the pensionable age of 61.

"Schembri, Mizzi request for recusal is turned down",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/schembri-mizzi-request-recusal-turned.1098456,23-09-2024,007857.png,"The Chief Justice and two judges turned down a request for recusal in a constitutional appeal by Keith Schembri and other high-profile defendants claiming that the current law on freezing orders breached their fundamental rights. 
 The decision was handed down early on Monday morning by Chief Justice Mark Chetcuti who is presiding over the challenge fronted by the former OPM chief of staff and former minister Konrad Mizzi during criminal proceedings where they stand accused of money laundering and other offences allegedly linking them to the fraudulent Vitals hospitals' deal. 
 Schembri and Mizzi along with all other defendants were targeted by millions worth of freezing orders, with the current law allowing them only seven working days to contest such orders before the criminal courts. 
 They argued that such a legal scenario created a situation of inequality of arms since the prosecution had an unlimited term to request a variation of such a freezing order. 
 The judge presiding over the criminal proceedings upheld the defendants’ request for a constitutional reference. 
 In July, the First Hall, Civil Court in its constitutional jurisdiction dismissed the applicants’ claims, stating that any review of freezing orders fell entirely within the discretion of the Criminal Court.
 The applicants appealed. 
 But at the first hearing earlier this month, the appellants raised the issue of recusal of the three judges, primarily because they were the same judges who had delivered the final decision annulling the Vitals concession.
 While confirming that the concession was fraudulent, the judges had also declared there was collusion between the concessionaire and high-ranking government officials. 
 That pronouncement meant the judges had already expressed an opinion in respect of the appellants now facing prosecution over their alleged involvement in the now-annulled deal. 
 On Monday, the Chief Justice together with Justices Giannino Caruana Demajo and Anthony Ellul declared that the recusal request was “not justified.”
 The current proceedings concerned shortcomings perceived by the appellants in the Proceeds of Crime Act, the law concerning seize and freeze orders. 
 The appellants claimed that the law impacted their fundamental rights to a fair hearing and peaceful enjoyment of private property. 
 That matter had nothing to do with the merits of the judgment whereby the hospitals’ concession was annulled, said the judges. The appellants also claimed the report of the inquiring magistrate into the hospitals’ deal made reference to that judgment. 
 That claim was rebutted by the prosecution who argued the judgment was only mentioned in the timeline of facts. 
 Such a reference did not impinge upon the impartiality of the judges now hearing the appeal about the freezing orders.
 And when confirming the annulment of the concession, the judges had not passed judgment in respect of any of the appellants in their personal capacity.
 When deciding upon the alleged shortcomings in the law regulating freezing orders, the court would not decide upon the merits of the criminal charges faced by the appellants, observed the judges. 
 That decision fell solely within the remit of the criminal courts. 
 When all was considered, the court turned down the request for recusal and adjourned the case for oral submissions next week.

"Use pride as an opportunity to help LGBTIQ community, Graffitti urges government",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/pride-opportunity-help-lgbtiq-community-graffitti-urges-government.1098031,13-09-2024,007961.png,"The government should take pride month as an opportunity to help address pending issues faced by the LGBTIQ community and not only stand and march with them, Moviment Graffitti said on Friday. 
 Ahead of Malta's annual pride march on Saturday the group said that the march is not only a colourful celebration but a political manifestation. 
 While the country has seen a lot of progress in legislation and policies that protect the LGBTIQ community, this does not mean that there is no place for political action. 
 One such issue is the gender wellbeing clinic in Paola not functioning properly for at least a year, as the lack of a psychiatrist has created long waiting lists for new cases to be considered. 
 ""Many young people who have been waiting for the service have had to resort to private healthcare since the state service has left them waiting and they felt they could not wait anymore to start the process of affirming their gender identity,"" they said. 
 Graffitti also highlighted that despite the government making an electoral promise to provide pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for free from hospital, this is still not available, despite Malta having one the highest rates of HIV diagnoses in Europe. 
 PrEP and PEP are courses of medication taken before or after exposure to HIV that help prevent transmission of the virus. 
 ""Those who are at risk of HIV infection and can afford it, have to buy the medicine themselves. Those who do not, risk contracting the virus and further spreading it in the community,"" they said. 
 And despite Malta being lauded for having the most progressive LGBTIQ rights in Europe, LGBTQ migrants do not feel safe or included in the country, Graffitti added. 
 ""LGBTIQ+ asylum seekers face illegal detention and risk being deported because they cannot prove their sexual orientation,"" the group said. 
 ""Malta considers eight of the countries that criminalise homosexuality as safe, putting LGBTIQ+ migrants at risk of having their asylum application rejected. If they are sent back to these countries, they can face years of imprisonment. LGBTIQ+ asylum seekers are not safe living in detention centres, risking discrimination and stigma as well as their safety.""
 Additionally, they said that LGBTIQ asylum seekers who are HIV positive face additional challenges, as they are not separated at the initial reception centre. 
 It also becomes difficult if not impossible to access essential services, including life-saving antiretroviral therapy and gender-affirming healthcare services that include continuation of hormonal treatment.
 ""Moviment Graffitti would be proud of being in the top position on the LGBTIQ+ index when the rights of the whole LGBTIQ+ community are protected,"" they said.
 ""It calls on the authorities to take the opportunity to act in favour of the LGBTIQ+ community not just march with them.""

"‘We must strive for a dignified end of life, not the anticipation of death’ – Archbishop Scicluna",newsbook,https://newsbook.com.mt/en/we-must-strive-for-a-dignified-end-of-life-not-the-anticipation-of-death-archbishop-scicluna/,29-11-2024,,"Tista' taqra bil-
 Archbishop Charles Scicluna called for greater investment in palliative care, underlining the importance of a dignified end of life over the anticipation of death. Speaking on RTK103’s Għal Kulħadd this morning, the Archbishop addressed the ongoing debate surrounding ‘assisted dying,’ currently under discussion in the UK Parliament. The Archbishop explained that the proposed law would permit individuals in challenging circumstances to opt for an early death with assistance, often bypassing the option of palliative care. “This approach settles for death rather than investing in care,” he said, urging a focus on ensuring dignity in the final stages of life. Religious leaders and many experts have voiced their concerns over such legislation, advocating for a shift towards improving end-of-life care. Archbishop Scicluna reiterated their shared stance: “We need to invest in a dignified end of life, not in anticipating death.” Speaking on the programme, Kenneth Delia, CEO of Hospice Malta, described the organisation’s mission as fostering hope for patients and their families. “Our aim is to protect life, ensuring patients live as well as possible until the end,” Delia said. He highlighted Hospice Malta’s commitment to easing patients’ journeys through medical, emotional, and spiritual support — the cornerstones of palliative care. Delia also cautioned that focusing solely on death would undermine the purpose of organisations like Hospice Malta, which strive to enrich the lives of individuals facing terminal illness. Archbishop Scicluna reflected on the Church’s role in supporting Hospice Malta, noting significant contributions made in recent years. In 2016, inspired by the Jubilee of Mercy, the Church handed over the Adelaide Cini Institute in Santa Venera to Hospice Malta, enabling the establishment of St Michael’s Hospice. Earlier this year, the Archdiocese also donated Dar Saura in Rabat to the Malta Trust Foundation for use as a centre for children with disabilities. The Archbishop expressed gratitude for Hospice Malta’s vital work, stating: “The Church is committed to ensuring that Hospice Malta continues to offer its invaluable services to the Maltese people, particularly those in need of palliative care.” Archbishop Scicluna praised Hospice Malta’s mission as a “prophetic vision” that aligns with the Church’s values. He described the organisation’s work as part of a “hymn of hope” and expressed optimism for the future of St Michael’s Hospice. As Malta approaches the Jubilee of Hope, which will be launched on Christmas Eve, the Archbishop said he hoped the residential care experience at St Michael’s Hospice would stand as a testament to the country’s commitment to compassionate and dignified end-of-life care.",Jurgen Balzan,Health

Health Ministry terminates Paola health hub contract after contractor misses multiple deadlines,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/national/131055/health_ministry_terminates_paola_health_hub_contract_after_contractor_misses_multiple_deadlines,06-09-2024,"000117.png,000118.png,000119.png","The Health Ministry has issued a termination notice to the contractor responsible for the Regional Hub project in Paola.
 “This decision was made after a period of evaluation, during which the Ministry, together with the Foundation for Medical Services, explored all possible avenues to avoid this outcome and, above all, the delays in completing the works,” it said in a statement on Friday.
 The Vincent Moran regional health hub in Paola is ready, but corruption-hit Technoline has so far failed to deliver the medical equipment. Photos showing several clinical rooms, corridors and waiting areas suggest that works on the regional health hub are completed.
 However, despite having fully functional electrical and water connections, the building seems to lack the medical equipment, which was supposed to have been supplied by Technoline.
  The regional health centre, named after Vincent Moran, the Paola-born doctor who served as health minister in past Labour administrations, cannot yet open its doors to the public, despite being scheduled to open in 2021.
 Audit firm Grant Thornton had been tasked with analysing the repercussions of terminating the contract.
 “Unfortunately, despite the best efforts and repeated attempts, the contractor has repeatedly failed to meet critical deadlines, resulting in further delays to the project. Consequently, the Foundation for Medical Services has issued several penalties in accordance with the terms of the contract and legal requirements. The Ministry has been involved in judicial proceedings against the contractor, which have now reached their final stage,” the ministry said on Friday.
 After exhausting all other options, it was determined that terminating the contract is the only viable solution to ensure the Regional Hub is completed and delivered to the public as soon as possible. “Our top priority remains the health of our patients, and we are committed to delivering this crucial facility without further delays.”
  “The Ministry emphasises that the contractor has always been paid what is due according to the contract, but we also have an obligation to ensure that public funds are used in the best interest of the people,” it said. “Therefore, the Foundation for Medical Services is already taking steps to ensure the final works are completed as soon as possible and to expedite the project's completion. We will continue to work tirelessly to ensure the facility becomes operational at the earliest opportunity, so it can start serving the community and improving our healthcare services.”
 Technoline under criminal spotlight
 Technoline is one of the companies under the spotlight in the criminal cases instituted against several individuals and firms involved in the Vitals hospitals contract. The firm and its owners have been hit by a court-imposed freezing order.
 The magisterial inquiry into the hospitals deal flagged Technoline as one of the vehicles by which former minister Konrad Mizzi, ex-OPM chief of staff Keith Schembri and their business associates, sought to acquire kickbacks from the Vitals deal.
 Indeed, Technoline had been acquired by one of its employees – Ivan Vassallo – using a private loan supplied by Vitals from funds passed on by the government as part of the hospitals deal.
 READ ALSO:  Vitals cash funded Technoline, with Schembri-Mizzi as intended owners
 However, the magisterial inquiry also cast a spotlight on how Vassallo, Schembri, Mizzi and others also sought to take kickbacks from the Paola health centre tender.
 The tender was mired in controversy after it was originally awarded to SP BB International JV, a consortium that included Ray Vella & Co Ltd, Pantalesco and Shapoorji.
 But three firms, including Ergon-Technoline JV, objected to the tender and argued that their exclusion from the tender was illegal. They pointed out that the selected bidder put forward an offer that was €3.6 million higher than the cheapest one.
 The contract was eventually revoked and given to Ergon-Technoline JV. It is understood that Technoline was responsible for supplying the medical equipment.
 The magisterial inquiry uncovered how Ivan Vassallo had drafted an agreement whereby Eurybates – a company that would benefit Schembri, Mizzi, Vassallo, Pierre Sladden and Adrian Hillman – would help Ergon in submitting a tender to design and build the Paola Primary Healthcare Regional Hub.

 A Greek consortium, Salfo-Ado JV, also entered into an agreement with Eurybates to provide business information services. This consortium went on to win a tender for project management and technical supervisory services for the Paola regional healthcare hub.
 No money was identified to have flown into Eurybates, but a parallel company called Encore Trading Ltd – under the control of Ivan Vassallo and Pierre Sladden as associates of Keith Schembri – received almost €100,000 in October 2019. Investigators suspect these payments were a kickback for the Paola Regional Hub tender.  ",Karl Azzopardi ,Health
WATCH: Andrea Calleja’s challenge is to walk again  - The Malta Independent ,independent,https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2023-08-20/local-news/Andrea-Calleja-s-challenge-is-to-walk-again-6736254194,20-08-2023,000159.png,"

 One moment, Andrea Calleja (above with his parents Maria and Antonio, centre, his uncle Nick, left, and girlfriend Karen) was a strong athlete, full of life and ambition, a sportsman who enjoyed tough competitions that brought all his abilities to the fore.
 The next moment, Andrea was being rushed to hospital, not knowing if he was going to survive and, if he did, not knowing whether he would be able to walk again, much less compete.
 Andrea was taking part in the competition known as The Grid last October, when tragedy struck. He suffered a serious spinal injury when he slithered down an inflatable slide into a pool of water.
 Life had changed abruptly for the 31-year-old. These last few months have been a constant battle for him to regain the skills we all take for granted. 
 It has not been easy. And it is expensive too. This is what has pushed his family into launching a crowd-funding exercise to be able to pay for all the treatment and rehabilitation that Andrea needs.
 This is the challenge that Andrea is facing now. And, when there’s a challenge, Andrea does not hold back. It’s as if the bigger the test, the harder he tries. “I want to get my life back” he said in comments to The Malta Independent from Rome, where he is currently undergoing rehabilitation treatment. 
 His target is to at least start walking again.
 He feels more encouraged knowing there is a challenge, his mother Maria told this newspaper in an interview at our offices.
 The days in hospital
 Andrea showed his true character and fighting spirit right from the start, in the difficult hours and days that immediately followed that day.
 Emanating pride in spite of a trembling voice, Maria said Andrea did everything within his power to ensure he moved out of the Intensive Care Unit following the accident. She said that doctors had told him that a breathing tube that had been inserted into the windpipe would normally be removed after 90 days. Well, Andrea’s condition allowed him to have it removed after 86 days. That was a small, but significant victory that gave him even more courage on the road to recovery.
 Maria explained that although those four days might mean little to the normal person, for Andrea it meant everything “because it meant that he was getting out of the ITU four days before”. 
 Going back to the terrible experience that the family went through on 8 October 2022, Maria said that unlike previous obstacle races her son took part in, she was too tired to attend this one. 
 She recalled how it was Andrea’s father Antonio who had informed Maria of the whole ordeal. After the race their son was to meet his father for a typical father-son date-bonding over a football match game. Instead, the family went to hospital as Andrea was fighting for his life.
 The family understood the severity of the injury just when they arrived in hospital. Karen Vella, Andrea’s girlfriend, who was also a participant in The Grid, explained what had happened.
 Andrea had hit his head on a rock and became paralysed there and then. Maria said that he had remained conscious throughout all of this “but could do nothing”, could not move. She also added that the amount of water he had swallowed made the situation even worse for him.
 It resulted that Andrea had injured vertebrae C3 and C4, which in turn seriously damaged his spinal cord. From feedback given by doctors, Antonio said that Andrea was told that he might regain some mobility in his upper body, however, the same result was not guaranteed for his lower body.
 Maria, with tears in her eyes, recalled how the family was always worried that Andrea would injure himself while riding his motorbike; instead, he was injured while taking part in a sports event. “Everyone’s destiny is written,” she said.
  
 The rehabilitation
 Andrea spent Christmas in hospital, from where he was later transferred to Karen Grech rehabilitation hospital. He exhausted every kind of physiotherapy option he could have benefitted from in Malta between January and March, following which he went to Rome where for the past five months has been undergoing specialised physiotherapy.
 Maria said that Karen and Andrea, whom she described as being soulmates, work together to better his situation. Apart from spending as much time with him as possible, Karen also helps Andrea carry out research that comes in handy in his recovery. 
 “Unfortunately, here we don’t have a spinal unit,” Antonio said, adding that although the family has nothing but praise for the physiotherapy he was being given at Karen Grech rehabilitation centre, the medical section lacks the necessary equipment that Andrea needs.
 Andrea has now managed to regain mobility in both hands up to his wrists. However, in order to attempt to regain some mobility from his waist down, in the coming months Andrea will be travelling to Thailand, where a hospital there specialises in the treatment that the family said he requires. 
 Andrea and his girlfriend came across a new form of treatment for severe spinal cord injuries. In Thailand, Andrea will be operated on his spine, where two small microchips will be placed, one on his upper spine and one on his lower part.
 The treatment, which is also known as epidural stimulation, will allow the chips to communicate and transfer information to the brain which in turn sends signals to the body to produce movements.
 In describing what she felt when Andrea and Karen informed her of the decision to go to Thailand, Maria said that “all we can do as parents is to be supportive”.
 She said that Andrea is the kind of person who needs to be aware that he has gone through all options before giving up on something. 
  
 New type of normality
 Contacted via internet in Rome, Andrea said that although regaining 100% of his mobility back is almost impossible, this new treatment may guarantee a new type of normality, where he could start walking again with the aid of walking sticks. Additionally, the chip implanted in the upper part of the body may also give him back mobility of his fingers.
 Having already turned to the generosity of the public to fund his treatment in Rome, collecting around €83,000, Andrea is now hoping to also cover his operation in Thailand through the same means.
 In total the operation, without counting travelling expenses, adds up to a whopping €150,000. This is the amount of funds that the family is hoping to reach through this crowd-funding initiative.
 This has to be paid by the beginning of November with the surgery taking place later that month.
 Asked what this means for him, Andrea said that he is trying to get his life back.
 “I lost many things in these last 10 months (since the accident happened) … they seemed like eternity especially when you would have to spent weeks or months looking at the hospital ceiling, while combatting an infection,” he said. 
 He said that this would also mean more time with his family and work as an insurance agent “which is very important to me”.
 Andrea is also doing his part to raise the funds he needs by selling his car, an Alfa Romeo, and motorcycle, a Kawasaki Ninja 400.
  
 Life after the accident
 Andrea recognises the fact that he needs to adapt to his new life. He said that the first thing he remembers as soon as he opened his eyes is that “three men came to give me a bath”, adding that never in his life did he imagine he would be in such a situation.
 He said that if one does not accept their new future, apart from making their own life miserable they will also have a negative impact on their loved ones.
 Apart from working for himself, he also needed to work for his parents and girlfriend, who have assisted him all the way since the accident happened.
 Andrea said that he used to be a very independent person; now, because of his condition, he has to ask people to do things for him.
 “It’s not boring, it’s depressing, there are days where I want to close myself in a room and cry or break something,” he said.
 Maria highlighted how before the injury he used to exhaust himself in a football game or through games on the PlayStation “but now he can do none of these”.
 “Unfortunately, you have to light up a flame within yourself, which not everyone is capable of doing,” he said, adding that this is needed in order to fight.
 Andrea said that until there is hope “I will continue to keep fighting, however I do not wish to remain like this as we had too many plans and ideas of things to do”.

Health minister avoids comment on Mater Dei death as independent inquiry launched,theshiftnews,https://theshiftnews.com/2024/08/29/health-minister-avoids-comment-on-mater-dei-death-as-independent-inquiry-launched/,29-08-2024,000272.png,"Health Minister Jo Etienne Abela has refrained from commenting on the death of 55-year-old Stephen Mangion at Mater Dei Hospital on Tuesday, citing ongoing investigations as an independent inquiry and a magisterial investigation have been launched.
 Mangion, a retired police officer, arrived at Mater Dei’s emergency department at 8.30pm on Tuesday, complaining of severe chest pain. According to initial police reports, he was asked to wait and did not receive immediate attention. Mangion collapsed and died at 11pm after hours of waiting despite receiving CPR.
 Claire Mangion, the deceased’s niece, vented her frustrations on Facebook, condemning the hospital’s handling of her uncle’s case. She wrote, “Reality hits home… my dearest uncle Stephen Mangion was asked to wait and wait even though he had chest pain until he collapsed and died at the emergency department at Mater Dei. A failed system that needs to change.”
 Eyewitness Manuel Debono supported these claims. Debono said, “A man walked in, looking unwell… He registered at reception, and we heard him tell them he had chest pain. After 20 minutes, he still hadn’t been called for triage… He went outside, collapsed to the ground, and died in the waiting area.”
 In response to the outcry, Abela told the press that an independent inquiry would be held. Magistrate Joe Mifsud will also conduct a magisterial investigation into the events at the Floriana Health Centre that preceded Mangion’s visit to Mater Dei.
 Abela assured the public that the findings of both inquiries would be published within three weeks. “As a ministry, we want transparency. While we commend what is good, we must address shortcomings with justice.”
 Abela also acknowledged understaffing at the emergency department and stated that measures, including wage increases for staff, are being taken to address this issue.
 The health minister faced questions regarding a proposal to outsource emergency services to the private sector. He said, “There is an ongoing evaluation process that I cannot comment on,” and regretted that such a service was not available earlier.
 Nationalist Party health spokesperson Adrian Delia expressed concern over the broader implications of the incident, stating, “I write with caution and without placing blame on anyone. But I have been saying for a while that the situation in the emergency department is critical… And there will be consequences. And that’s what’s happening.”
 Delia called for immediate, collaborative action to address the crisis.

Lack of staff makes northern health hub ‘mathematically impossible’ – minister,newsbook,https://newsbook.com.mt/en/lack-of-staff-makes-northern-health-hub-mathematically-impossible-minister/,18-11-2024,000315.png,"Health minister Jo Etienne Abela dismissed the creation of a northern health hub as “mathematically impossible” due to staff shortages on Monday, confirming that he could not see this human resources issue addressed any time soon. Abela made this claim during question time in Parliament as he answered a question by Nationalist MP and former St Paul’s Bay mayor Graziella Galea on the government’s apparent decision to abandon plans to build a regional health centre in Qawra. The centre would have been a northern health hub which would complement the southern health hub built in Paola: whose opening has been delayed amid disputes with a contractor. The government had previously planned to build such health hubs in the north and south, and just last year, when Chris Fearne was health minister, plans for a health hub on Qawra land presently used as a car park were made public. Amendments to these plans were even presented last December – less than a month before a cabinet reshuffle assigned health to Abela – to save a number of mature trees from destruction. But these plans are now being dismissed as unworkable by Abela, as he confirmed once more in his answer to Galea. “Right now, a northern health hub is mathematically impossible because of human resources,” he said. “We just cannot afford it, and not because we can’t provide the required funds, building or machinery. But funds, building and machinery alone will not suffice.” The minister also confirmed that a lack of human resources remains the main stumbling block in the implementation of more modest plans for the expansion of government primary healthcare services in Malta: increasing the number of health centres that are open 24 hours a day from 3 to 5. At present, the Paola, Mosta and Floriana health centres provide 24/7 care: the minister has not mentioned which two additional centres would also operate on a 24/7 basis in the future. Abela confirmed that around 70 more doctors need to be employed to make this possible, and that 27 had been recruited this year, but others would have retired or changed line of work. Consequently, the minister said that he expected it would take three years to increase the number of health centres opened 24/7. “Could we also consider a northern health hub in the future? Possibly,” he added. “But without human resources it would be a non-starter.”",John Paul Cordina,Health
"Second Mpox case registered in Malta, first case identified as less severe strain - The Malta Independent ",independent,https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2024-09-03/local-news/Second-Mpox-case-registered-in-Malta-first-case-identified-as-less-severe-strain-6736263910,03-09-2024,000323.png,"
                
        

         A second Mpox case has been registered in Malta, while the first case of the virus has been identified as being the less severe out of the two strains of the virus.
 In a statement on Tuesday, the Health Authorities confirmed that the Mpox case reported last week, has been identified as Clade II. This update stems from thorough laboratory testing and analysis.   Mpox, formerly known as Monkeypox, is caused by the Monkeypox virus, which has two distinct clades: Clade I and Clade II. 
 Clade I is predominantly found in Central Africa, Clade I is known for causing more severe illness and higher mortality rates.  Due to its severity, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared Clade I a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) in August 2024.
 Clade II meanwhile is less severe and has a significantly lower mortality rate.  Clade II is responsible for the ongoing global outbreak that began in 2022, spreading primarily through human-to-human sexual transmission.
 Health authorities said that in Malta, 35 cases were investigated in relation to this global outbreak up till 2023. The current case in Malta falls under this clade and is the first case being reported for 2024.
 “Another Mpox case has been confirmed in another Maltese resident who was exposed through sexual activity in Malta. The individual is currently clinically stable and does not require hospital admission,” the authorities said.
 “The patient has been isolated and contact tracing efforts are underway to prevent further transmission. Further testing is being carried out to identify the specific Clade of the Mpox virus of this case.” 
 Public Health Advisory:
 Given the confirmation of Clade II Mpox, the Health Authorities advises the public to adhere to the following preventive measures to curb the spread of the virus: 
 1.     Safe Sex: Practice safe sex and have open conversations with partners about sexual health.
 2.     Avoid Close Contact: Refrain from close, skin-to-skin contact with individuals who have a rash resembling Mpox.
 3.     Hygiene Practices: Maintain good hand hygiene by washing hands frequently with soap and water or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
 4.     Safe Practices: Be cautious during social gatherings and intimate contact. Avoid sharing personal items such as towels, bedding, and clothing with infected individuals.
 5.     Seek medical advice if you experience symptoms or have been in contact with someone diagnosed with Mpox.
 The Health Authorities said that they remain committed to monitoring the situation closely and will provide updates as necessary. “We urge the public to stay informed and follow the recommended guidelines to ensure their safety and well-being.”

 15 people lost their lives in Malta at work in 2022, which the highest amount of workplace fatalities since 2004. These figures were reported by Eurostat in a survey that found that 3,286 people died all over the European Union while they were working, 61 less than in 2021. It was reported that this might have been related to economic recovery after the Covid pandemic. Malta recorded 6 more workplaces deaths in 2022 when compared to the 9 workers who lost their lives while working in 2021. In 2022 and 2023, the Occupational Health and Safety Authority (OHSA) reported 20 fatalities at work. 55% of these deaths occurred in the construction sector. Apart from this, Eurostat found that in Malta, 1,564 workplace accidents occurred meant that a worker spent four days or more recovering. This figure is slightly lower than the one recorded in 2021 and significantly lower that the one registered in 2019, when 2,202 accidents took place. In 2014, 2,632 workplace accidents that left workers injured occurred. According to another study conducted by Eurostat, around 670 workers suffered from some kind of bone fractures.

PN says government should provide AIDS medication free of charge to all - The Malta Independent ,independent,https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2024-12-01/local-news/PN-says-government-should-provide-AIDS-medication-free-of-charge-to-all-6736266195,01-12-2024,000375.png,"
                
        

         The Nationalist Party on Sunday said that government should provide free medication for the AIDS illness, and should transform the GU Clinic into a walk-in clinic.
 In a statement on World Aids Day, PN MPs Graziella Attard Previ, Adrian Delia and the PN Equal Opportunities Forum (FOIPN) called on government to ensure greater accessibility to PrEP and PEP medications for AIDS prevention and treatment, and for these to be provided free of charge to anyone in need.  It said these medications are crucial both for prevention and for the treatment of the HIV virus, which leads to AIDS. 
 “This was an electoral promise by both parties, yet the Government continues to drag its feet on the matter,” the PN said.
 On this day, the PN honours and pays tribute to the victims of this disease, while reaffirming its commitment to reducing the incidence of AIDS and supporting all individuals affected or at risk.
 According to UNAIDS, AIDS should no longer be a global threat by 2030 if everyone's fundamental rights are respected, the statement said.
 The PN MPs advocated for concrete objectives, such as the elimination of stigma against individuals living with HIV, regardless of their gender; greater awareness of the medications that prevent the transmission of HIV by individuals considered positive undetectable, and increased accessibility to PrEP and PEP medications, which should be provided free of charge to anyone in need.
 Additionally, the PN continued to insist on the need for the GU Clinic at Mater Dei Hospital to be more accessible. 
 “This should be achieved by transforming the clinic into a Walk-in Clinic to promote healthy sexual practices,” the statement said.
 The PN said it remains committed to being proactive rather than reactive, focusing on solutions that address prevention, treatment, and support for all individuals affected by or at risk of contracting AIDS.

 The family of the doctor Naged Megally announced the details of his funeral, which will be held on Monday 19 On Facebook, his daughter Anastasia Megally, said that her father will be given a final farewell on 19th August at 4:45pm in St Margaret Parish Church in Sannat, Gozo. The obstetrician Megally who was a doctor who specialised in foetal medicine and worked at Mater Dei Hospital died in July last year while he was being treated at Mater Dei Hospital after developing medical complications. Megally was admitted to hospital in May and was being given treatment at Intensive Treatment Unit. Despite showing signs of improvement, the family was informed of condition affecting the breathing pipe, and he died two days later. This condition was eventually identified as the cause of death. Last June, the Court ordered the Chief Executive of Mater Dei Hospital and the Superintendent of Public Health to authorise an autopsy, after finding them responsible for violating their right to private life and the family of Naged Megally. This was after his family was refused a private autopsy to determine the cause of death. The autopsy was ordered after his wife, son and two daughters of the doctor asked a number of times for an autopsy. In March, the family filed a judicial protest against the Health Minister, the Chief Executive of Mater Dei Hospital, Chief Medical Officer, and the State Advocate. The family also requested a magisterial inquiry. A police report was filed and the inspector contacted the magistrate. The magistrate, however, refused to open an inquiry since a death certificate had already been issued. The magistrate, however, ordered the Police to continue investigating. The family filed an appeal asking for a magisterial inquiry, but this was refused by the Court in February since the appeal did not have the necessary prerequisites to open a magisterial inquiry.",Miguel Azzopardi,Health
"Hillman, Sladden, Vassallo identified as ‘brothers’ in Maltese freemasonry lodge",theshiftnews,https://theshiftnews.com/2024/06/04/hillman-sladden-vassallo-identified-as-brothers-in-maltese-freemasonry-lodge/,04-06-2024,000426.png,"Aqra bil-Malti.
 Three individuals were identified as Freemasons and members of one of the main masonic lodges in Malta in the hospitals’ magisterial inquiry investigating the theft of millions of public funds.
 The inquiry notes that the former Times of Malta managing director Adrian Hillman, his business partner, contractor  Pierre Sladden, and Technoline owner  Ivan Vassallo were all ‘brothers’ in a secret masonic lodge.
 The inquiry also identified lawyer Larry Formosa of Gozitan Cosrya Legal as another Freemason. Formosa assisted Technoline’s Ivan Vassallo in transferring his company’s shares onto Hillman and Sladden, nominees for Keith Schembri and Konrad Mizzi, the inquiry found.
 According to the inquiry, Vassallo occupied a prominent role in the Sovereign Grand Lodge of Malta and acted as its Secretary General.
 Research by The Shift confirmed the trio’s membership in Malta’s oldest Freemasons society, based in Valletta’s Marsamxett. It is unclear whether Hillman, Sladden, or Vassallo are still members.
 When The Shift contacted Simon Cusens, the Grand Master of the masonic lodge, he could not confirm whether Hillman, Sladden, and Vassallo had been expelled.
 “As you know, one of our main principles is secrecy, and we cannot share this information with non-members,” he told The Shift.
 “What I can tell you is that when I took over as Grand Master in 2019, something which I take very seriously, Ivan Vassallo did not occupy any senior role in our masonic lodge,” Cusens insisted.
 At the same time, Cusens, whose family was the original owner of Technoline before it was sold to Vassallo and his hidden partners for €5 million, made it clear that he was appalled at what he read in the inquiry and what has been revealed so far.
 “As a society, we had nothing to do with what has happened. It’s disgusting,” he told The Shift. Cusens also referred to his name mentioned in the inquiry as the original owner of Technoline.
 “Ivan Vassallo was my employee at the time of the sale, and I knew he did not have the means to buy Technoline. However, during negotiations, he never let slip who his real financiers were,” Cusens insisted.
 “What I can say is that my family business’s sale to Gateway Ltd was concluded after due diligence, and at that time, nothing of what we now know had emerged,” he said.
 “I had also consulted a serious lawyer to make sure that all was above board, and I have all documents to prove this,” Cusens added.
 Technoline was bought by Vassallo’s Gateway in 2017 and passed onto Vitals Global Healthcare through a series of companies used as fronts for money laundering.
 While on paper, Ivan Vassallo appeared as the owner of Technoline, Sladden and Hillman were inserted as shareholders in other companies, including Gateway Solutions, to be able to buy Technoline.
 The money – €5 million to buy the medical supplies company – came directly from the hospitals’ concession, as Vitals Global Healthcare had no funds until it started receiving millions from the government. The Shift revealed this in January 2019.
 Just after Technoline’s takeover was finalised, Vitals Global Healthcare issued an exclusive contract for the procurement of medical equipment for the hospitals’ concession, thus guaranteeing millions would be funnelled through this arrangement.
 Hillman and Sladden were the secret business partners of Keith Schembri, heavily involved in the hospitals’ heist.

 “We have the political will that others do not and can never have to provide businesses with the solutions to the problems they face today, primarily those related to competitiveness, traffic congestion, and governance,” he said.
  Opposition leader Bernard Grech earlier this afternoon he led a PN delegation in a meeting with the Malta Chamber of Commerce, Enterprise, and Industry.
 Malta Chamber officials, led by President Chris Vassallo Cesareo and CEO Marthese Portelli, explained to the PN leader that many of the proposals presented in the Chamber's pre-Budget Document had already been put forward, but only 1.8% were adopted by the government.
 In fact, of 219 proposals, only four were accepted in the 2024 Budget. The Chamber is reintroducing these proposals for this year's Budget in a document called “Time-up,” which identifies 12 areas that need to be addressed as soon as possible.
 They explained the need for a budget based on more added-value and argued that the economic model based on population growth is not sustainable, emphasising the immediate need to address existing problems as quickly as possible.
 Grech recalled that four years ago he proposed holding a national conference to analyse and address the challenge of population growth, but at the time, this proposal fell on deaf ears.
 “Now, the government has announced a new policy to align migration with labour market needs, four years late,” he said.
 Time can no longer be wasted, said Bernard Grech, adding that it is clear that businesses in Malta are feeling the burden of inaction in various sectors, but the Labour Government lacks the political will to address the problems they face.

‘Imprisoned in my own home’: man waits for urgent knee operation for 10 months,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/imprisoned-home-man-waits-urgent-knee-operation-10-months.1093817,18-06-2024,"000043.png,000044.png","Story updated on June 18.
 A man who was imprisoned in his own home for eight months as he waited for a knee replacement operation to be able to walk again and step outside has finally been given a date.
 Mario Carbone has been unable to walk and leave his Cospicua home due to the pain since August and has been in a wheelchair since January – when he was hospitalised following a fall at home.
 “My father just turned 63. He worked all his life, sunrise to sundown, to provide for his three children, so my mother could stay home and take care of us. Now he cannot enjoy his retirement because the system failed him,” his daughter, Daniela, said.
 She explained how her father, who worked as a labourer, had knee problems for many years. Finally, after years waiting, he had a knee replacement operation on his right knee in October 2022.
 The operation was a success, and he was recovering nicely. Then in February 2023, he had an accident and hurt his knee, leaving him in a lot of pain. Three months later, he was seen by the surgeon who operated on him and was told that the case was too severe now, and the family needed to see another specialist.
  By August, Mario was told by a doctor at a private clinic if he was not operated on soon, he would end up in wheelchair, his daughter said.
 “He was also told that he would get operated on in September 2023,” she said.
 She said that surgeon Dorian Xuereb took interest in Mario's urgent case and a date for an operation had finally been set.
 According to a recent reply to a parliamentary question, 510 knee replacement operations were carried out last year between January and November.  Until October 2023, there were 991 people on the waiting list for a knee replacement.

'Make my day': Joseph Muscat dares critics to reopen Egrant case,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/make-day-joseph-muscat-dares-critics-reopen-egrant-case.1101232,19-11-2024,000256.png,"Joseph Muscat has welcomed the prospect of an inquiry into Panama company Egrant being re-examined, saying it would give him a chance to “prove the conspiracy theorists wrong once again”.
 In a right of reply sent to Times of Malta on Tuesday morning through his lawyer Charlon Gouder, Muscat said he had nothing to hide.
 “There are those who might argue that now the Egrant case should be reopened,” the former prime minister said.  
 “As I said numerous times when such a possibility was floated, including by the said court experts who salivated at the idea of getting paid even more public funds: Make my day!
 “I have nothing to hide and will only take further satisfaction in proving the conspiracy theorists wrong once again.”
 Muscat was responding to a Times of Malta article which noted that a court expert he wants criminally prosecuted had played a major role in the 2018 Egrant inquiry.
 That probe was requested by Muscat himself and centred on allegations that the offshore company was secretly owned by his wife, Michelle.
 The inquiry found no proof of that and was unable to establish who owned the company. It concluded that signatures related to the firm were falsified and that the testimony of key witnesses, most notably that of former Pilatus Bank employee Maria Efimova, contained some significant discrepancies.
 One of the court experts who worked on the probe, Miroslava Milenovic, also played a key role in a separate probe into the hospitals concession signed by Muscat’s government, which was annulled last year on the basis of fraud.
 That probe led to criminal charges against Muscat and others. They all deny accusations.
 Muscat and other defendants last week asked the police to investigate Milenovic because she was listed as a “forensic accountant” in the Vitals probe but did not hold an accountancy warrant.
 Milenovic was also described as a “forensic accountant” in the Egrant inquiry.
 In his statement on Tuesday, Muscat said he was precluded from commenting on his ongoing criminal case due to a court order to that effect.
 However, he argued that in the Egrant case, the work of court experts was just one of the inputs the then-magistrate leading the probe took into account.
 The magistrate “confronted versions, asked questions, made his own assessments and came up with his own report”, Muscat argued.
 “Secondly, given that I was the victim in the Egrant frame-up, I never had the opportunity to confront Ms Milenovic in court,” he added.
 Muscat said he would delight in disproving the Egrant allegations a second time. 
 The former prime minister made similar statements in a July 2023, interview, when he dared critics to request a second Egrant inquiry but warned them he would then sue them when the probe cleared him. 
 “A good boxer has to be able to take as many punches as he can give. But I will then be punching back,"" Muscat said at the time.

€6 million for 650 couples on IVF waiting list to get private treatment,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/6-million-650-couples-ivf-waiting-list-get-private-treatment.1092792,21-05-2024,"000502.png,000503.png","Around 650 couples on the waiting list for IVF treatment will be able to receive it at a private clinic, thanks to a €6 million investment from the government, Health Minister Jo Etienne Abela said on Tuesday. 
 The investment was announced by Prime Minister Robert Abela earlier this month. 
 The government already fulfilled its promise to refund the cost of IVF-related medicine for couples who choose to undergo the procedure privately. The separate investment was announced earlier this year, where it was announced around 285 prospective parents who underwent the procedures last year were to benefit from the refund. 
 The Health Minister said the government will enter into negotiations with one private clinic in Malta that is licensed to offer all IVF services. 
  Abela said the government could not ignore the 650 couples who are on the Mater Dei Hospital's IVF procedures waiting list and said couples will receive a ""holistic service"" with all costs covered. 
 He said special attention will be paid to the age of the prospective mothers, highlighting that older women will be a priority to have the procedure as soon as possible. 
 “We cannot guarantee success in such a procedure, but we are ready to commit and cover the costs from the beginning to the end of the procedure for each couple,” Abela said. 
 Few details were provided during the press coverage, apart from Abela saying all treatments will be covered, such as consultations, importation, or distribution of gametes, and those who need to use IVF using a donor will also be offered this service. 
 Further details were provided in a press release published shortly after the press conference, where it was explained that within six months the services will be provided to the 650 prospective parents.
 Out of the 650 couples, 300 include people who will be doing IVF treatment, and around 200 others who are in the process of freezing and storing fertilised eggs and are waiting for 'embryo transfer'.
 Another 100 people waiting for IVF using 'donor oocytes' or 'donor sperm', and around 50 prospective parents who will be given intrauterine insemination service (IUI), a treatment that gives sperm a better chance to fertilise an egg, as well as the Preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) service where necessary.

Malta hit by rise in COVID-19 cases,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/malta-hit-rise-covid19-cases.1094454,25-06-2024,000507.png,"Malta is experiencing an increase of COVID-19 infections, with three deaths and 232 confirmed cases since the beginning of the month. 
 The latest figures released on Tuesday show the number of cases more than doubled in two weeks. 
 A health ministry spokesperson said ""precautions"" were being taken at Mater Dei where 83 people with COVID were treated since the beginning of the month but stressed that none were admitted to intensive care.
 He said no new variant has been recorded with all patients being treated for a mutation of the Omicron varient.
 
 According to figures compiled by the health ministry, new cases were as low as zero in March and remained in single digits throughout April. 
 But new cases began to increase in mid-May before spiking in June. Malta registered 32 new cases during the week of June 3-9 before surging to 84 cases registered between 17 to 23 June.
 
 The spike in cases coincides with the European Parliament and local election results, when huge numbers of people crammed into the election counting hall in Naxxar. However, health authorities have given no reason for the rise in numbers.
 The spokesperson said the precautions being applied at Mater Dei Hospital over the rise of cases are those applicable to transmissible respiratory infections such as influenza.
 “Persons admitted with symptoms suggestive of respiratory infection are tested through a respiratory screen and positive cases are isolated in line with ECDC protocols,"" he said.

Watch: Free preventive HIV treatment to be introduced next year,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/watch-free-preventive-hiv-treatment-introduced-next-year.1102151,12-09-2024,000541.png,"Preventive treatment against HIV – PrEP and PEP – will be available for free next year, Jo Etienne Abela said. 
 The health minister told Times of Malta that funds were allocated for such free treatment in the 2025 budget and said the measure will cost “millions”.
 PrEP is a medication taken before sexual activity and prevents HIV transmission. PEP is a treatment that needs to be taken within 72 hours after a high-risk sexual encounter.   
  A 30-day supply of PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis) costs around €57, while PEP costs over €600. Providing PrEP and PEP for free is in the Labour Party’s electoral manifesto. 
 Last week, activists called on the government to follow through with its electoral promise in a joint statement by Checkpoint Malta, HIV Malta, MGRM, Moviment Graffitti, LGBTI+ Gozo, ARC – Allied Rainbow Communities and Aditus.
 “Activists once again reiterated the need for free PrEP and PEP. Countries which have introduced free PrEP and PEP, or that have highly subsidised it, have seen dramatic reductions in new HIV rates, in contrast to the reality of Malta’s ever-increasing rates of new HIV acquisition,” the statement said on World Aids Day.
 On Thursday morning, Abela said the government would be publishing its sexual health strategy for public consultation “in the coming days”.
 Providing HIV preventive treatment for free is part of that plan, he said.

‘Emergency room wait times have reached 8-10 hours’,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/emergency-room-wait-times-reached-810-hours.1092200,05-10-2024,000822.png,"Waiting times in Mater Dei Hospital’s emergency room has reached an average of eight to 10 hours, with Health Minister Jo Etienne Abela set to announce expansion plans for the building this month.
 Malta Union of Midwives and Nurses president Paul Pace told Times of Malta at a media event that patients at the emergency room are having to wait up to 10 hours until they can be fully processed by medical staff.
 “In emergency, we have what is called the waiting time – which is the time you spend waiting until a doctor can see you, and processing time – which is the time you spend in the emergency room until you are either sent home or admitted to a ward,” Pace explained.
 “As the situation  is today, we are seeing that waiting time is taking from eight to 10 hours on average, and obviously when processing takes long, it’s going to affect the waiting time as well.”
 The health minister, who also attended the media event, told Times of Malta that the government is working on a multi-phase action plan to tackle space and time issues at Mater Dei, with the primary focus being doubling the number of cubicles in the emergency room from 35 to 70.
 The plans, the minister said, are set to be announced this month.
 Other phases of the expansion plans will include moving administration workers out of the Mater Dei building and transferring the outpatients to St Luke’s Hospital, expanding the ITU and expanding the cardiology department, with plans to add a third operating theatre there, he said.
  “It’s not enough to just create more space at the emergency because we also have to think downstream, that is where patients are going to end up after they’ve been processed by emergency,” Abela said.
 “There are prime areas of the hospital which could be used to offer care to patients that are currently used for administration, for example. These areas need to be vacated.”
 An expression of interest to find suitable office space for administrative staff had already been issued, the minister said.
 “They cannot remain on site,” Abela said.
 “Everyone can agree that Mater Dei was built to meet the needs of the population at the time and today we know that the reality is different. Space is limited and it must be used to cure patients.”
 However, Pace added that while investing in infrastructure is a good step forward and a move that the union supports, it is critical that investment in human resources is kept at the same pace.
 The emergency department is understaffed as it stands, Pace said, and would need to be increased further to make use of double the space.
 “The number of cubicles will double from 35 to 70 but, at the moment, we’re not even using all of them because we don’t have enough nurses,” he said.
 “Today emergency is working with some 40 nurses less than needed, and with the new cubicles the minister has mentioned, we will need another 85 nurses.”

 A Eurostat survey issued Thursday reports that among the EU countries, Malta recorded the highest number of healthy life years at birth in 2022 for women (70.3 years), ahead of Bulgaria (68.9 years) and Slovenia (68.5 years). 
 In contrast, Denmark had the lowest number of healthy life years for women (54.6 years), followed by Latvia (55.4 years) and the Netherlands (56.3 years).
 The highest number of healthy life years for men was also recorded in Malta (70.1), followed by Sweden (67.5) and Italy (67.1), while the lowest ones were found in Latvia (53.0 years), Slovakia (56.6 years) and Denmark (57.1 years).
  In 2022, the number of healthy life years at birth in the EU was 62.6 years on average, 62.8 years for women and 62.4 years for men.
 Life expectancy at birth for women in the EU was, on average, 5.4 years longer than that for men (83.3 years compared with 77.9 years).
 Healthy life years - free from activity limitations - represented 75% and 80% of the total life expectancy for women and men, respectively.
 Therefore, on average, men tended to spend a greater proportion of their somewhat shorter lives free from activity limitations, the survey says.
 Most of the data on health status and health determinants come from two surveys: the EU statistics on income and living conditions (EU-SILC), which provides annual data on issues like long-standing illness or health problems  and the European health interview survey, which provides every five years a large variety of data on health status.
 In 2017 the European Observatory’s Health Systems in Transition Report had also shown that Maltese people live on average 90 per cent of their life in good health, better than any other European country. The trend was maintained along the years, with a Eurostat report in 2022 saying that  Malta had the second longest healthy life expectancy in the European Union, surpassed only by Sweden.

"Government spent €10.6m on Outpatients Block plans, only to scrap them - MAM",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/government-spent-105m-outpatients-block-plans-scrap-mam.1098471,24-09-2024,"000761.png,000762.png","The government wasted €10.6 million in planning a new outpatients block and acute psychiatric facility at Mater Dei Hospital before scrapping the idea, and it is now about to spend another €10m on planning an alternative, the MAM Medical Association of Malta said on Tuesday.
 
 The acute psychiatric facility and outpatients block were projected by then Health Minister Chris Fearne. Three years went into their planning and the ideas were extensively discussed and supported by all stakeholders, the MAM said.
 ""Unfortunately, (current health minister) Jo-Etienne Abela has scrapped all these plans and without proper consultation, wants a completely different plan cramming five acute psychiatry wards on top of the Emergency Department while the outpatients block is being scrapped completely,"" the association said.
  ""The decision to modify plans will require a new expenditure of another €10 million on plans, a delay of at least two years to start actual construction and another two-to-three years for completion,"" it said.
 It also pointed out that there is a February EU deadline for the completion of the new health hub in Paola and should that deadline be missed, the EU may seek recovery of €50m of its funds allocated for that project.
 The association urged the health minister to prioritise patients, stick to the original plans and get on with construction.
 ""While MAM still trusts that Minister Abela has good intentions the current impression is that millions (of euro) are voted for health, but nothing gets done,"" it said. 
 Meanwhile, Paul Pace president of the Malta Union of Midwives and Nurses said that his union was never consulted, and never agreed, with the plans for the new outpatients building.
 He said in a reaction to the MAM statement that the nurses’ union was in favour of shifting outpatients to St Luke’s Hospital as this would ease traffic congestion and parking problems at Mater Dei outpatients and free the building to be used as a mother-and-child space.
 Some 900 patients visit outpatients daily he said.
 “MAM is objecting to shifting to St Luke's as that will stop the consultants from leaving the hospital early,” he said.
 In reply to the MAM’s statement, the Health Ministry said on Tuesday that the doctor’s union had been selective in their facts and left out important details that contextualise the government’s vision to proceed in the way that it did. 
 In a statement, the ministry said that at the time that the plans were being drawn up the government was not in control of either St Luke’s or Karin Grech hospitals and plans are already in motion to regenerate these buildings and re-integrate them into the public healthcare system. 
 “The MAM is aware of this and so it cannot on one hand criticise that nothing is being done with these buildings and on the other hinder work that is going to lead to these hospitals to start fulfilling important roles in our country’s healthcare system,” the ministry said. 
 They added that by actioning these plans they would be avoiding eliminating the Mater Dei helipad. 
 While the MAM has a leading role to advocate for its members' rights, this does not include becoming an arbiter of strategic management or infrastructural projects in the sector, they said.

"Edward Scicluna opens up about stepping aside, insists he remains governor",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/edward-scicluna-opens-stepping-aside-insists-remains-governor.1096101,31-07-2024,000785.png,"Edward Scicluna says he was prepared to go to the European Court of Justice to fight any attempt to remove him as Central Bank governor - and only agreed to step aside temporarily ""until I clear my name"". 
 Speaking to Times of Malta for the first time since he reached a compromise with government, Scicluna insisted he remains governor with his full salary.
 “Had the prime minister relieved me of my duties, I would have resorted to the European Court of Justice and had I won I would probably have been refunded my lost income.
 ""I will step aside only for the time being, but I will remain governor until the end of my term,"" he said.
 Scicluna described how he was called in to Castille on Tuesday during a lengthy cabinet meeting. It was convened by Robert Abela with the intention of removing Scicluna after a court ruled there was sufficient evidence for him to stand trial over the hospitals deal. 
 
 “I took legal counsel when it became apparent that I was going to be relieved of my duties because that would have been illegal,"" Scicluna said.
 He said the prime minister and cabinet appointed three senior ministers, his former colleagues in cabinet, who were tasked with convincing him to avoid going down the legal route.
 Scicluna did not mention the names of the ministers involved but Times of Malta understands they are Owen Bonnici, Ian Borg and Michael Falzon. 
 “They asked me to consider this proposal.  At first, I was reluctant to accept because I am resolute that I was not taking people for a ride.”  
 Scicluna said that the arrangement was not imposed on him.
 He continued: “I would have preferred staying at my desk but at the moment I cannot until I clear my name.  It could be a few months down the line, but I will clear it.”
 Scicluna confirmed that he will be retaining his salary.
 
 Scicluna said that the terms of the agreement respect the autonomy of the Central Bank of Malta and are according to the provisions of the Central Bank of Malta Act (Chap 204).
 Article 8(3) (a) of the CBM Act states: “In the event of the absence of the governor, the governor shall designate a deputy governor to perform the duties of the governor… and the deputy governor so designated shall have and may exercise the powers and perform the functions of the governor.”
 Alexander Demarco, deputy governor since January 2014, will be filling in for Scicluna. 
 Scicluna had been adamant all along that the prime minister could not fire him from office, even though he has been charged in court with fraud and misappropriation in relation to the Vitals hospitals case.
 “I was not challenging anyone.  Every institution is governed by its own rules and conditions and members have duties and responsibilities towards the institution they belong to.  The prime minister can ask ministers to resign but he cannot ask them to forfeit their seat in parliament,"" he said.
 As governor of the central bank, Scicluna sits on the governing council of the European Central Bank.  “Not even the ECB requires my resignation”, he said.
 “In Malta we are not familiar with the role of Central Bank Governor.  We never realised how important it is.  The EU Treaties, the Statutes of the European Central Bank and even Maltese law are worded in such a way as to prevent governments from playing dirty tricks.""
 Article 14 of the ECB treaty says that “a governor may be relieved from office only if he no longer fulfils the conditions required for the performance of his duties or if he has been guilty of serious misconduct.""
 Article 8 (5), of the CBM Act lays down that ""The governor and the deputy governors may be relieved of their office only if they no longer fulfil the conditions required for the performance of their duties or if they have been guilty of serious misconduct.""
 In 2019 the ECJ ruled against the Latvian government when it tried to remove Ilmārs Rimšēvičs from head of the country’s Central Bank.

IVF treatment goes private as public hospital clinic closes for upgrade,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/ivf-treatment-goes-private-public-hospital-clinic-closes-upgrade.1096887,22-08-2024,000801.png,"The first patient files of 178 people awaiting fertility treatment have been sent by the government to a private clinic so that the couples can start the long-awaited process of becoming parents.
 These patients are among the 650 who have been on the waiting list to receive treatment at the state-owned Mater Dei IVF clinic, which will be  undergoing refurbishment to improve the technology used.
 The target to reopen is later this year.
 “The contract between the government and Hope Fertility and IVF clinic has been signed with a commencement date of August 1, 2024. 
 To date, a total of 178 patient files have already been sent to Hope clinic to start the evaluation process, also since most cases have been waiting for more than six months, and new testing and screening need to be carried out,” a Health Ministry spokesperson said.
 Applications for treatment of the 178 patients have already been approved by the regulatory authority, the Embryo Protection Authority. Meanwhile, new patient lists are being sent to Hope daily, the spokesman said.
 In June, Health Minister Jo­Etienne Abela announced that the clinic that carries out IVF procedures at Mater Dei will be closed for six months while it is being expanded and upgraded, with patients sent to a private clinic instead.
 The government allocated €6 million so that around 650 couples, who are on the Mater Dei waiting list, could get their treatment at Hope Fertility and IVF clinic.
 But before that could happen, the health authorities had to secure the procurement of new equipment to replace that purchased in 2014, when the clinic started operating. 
 That process has started but some parts are pending.
 “The procurement started in May 2022 and 23 calls for tenders were published for 92 pieces of equipment and 55 consumables/materials/reagents. All of them are awarded except two calls of highly specialised critical pieces of equipment for collecting, processing, storing and distributing gametes/embryos. Final calls for offers closed on July 22,” the spokesperson said.
 
 Asked what would happen to couples who could not afford to wait longer for treatment at Mater Dei, and went private at their own expense before government signed the agreement with Hope, the spokesperson said that “patients who opted to do their treatment at the private clinics, irrespective if they were on the waiting list of MDH or if they just opted to do their treatment privately in Malta, would get a refund of their treatment medication with effect from January 1, 2023.”
 To date, 84 applications have been received by the Embryo Protection Authority from both patients undergoing treatment at Hope and patients undergoing IUIs (intrauterine inseminations) at other registered clinics.  These applications total to a refund of €236,043, he said.
 There would be further refunds for medication given to patients undergoing treatment at MDH as of January 1, 2022.
 The authority has so far approved over 780 applications, which amount to €1.2 million, pushing total refunds above €1.4 million.

 While phthalates are normally used as plasticisers to soften and increase the flexibility of these materials, paraffin is used as a flame retardant, while lead and cadmium in dyes and paints give colour.
 However, the presence of these chemicals is restricted due to the potential harm to human health, the MCCAA said in a statement.
 A total of 10 children’s clothing and footwear products, including printed T-shirts, matching sets, slippers, and rain boots were tested.

Ministry looks to scrap Paola health centre contract,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/ministry-looks-scrap-paola-health-centre-contract.1096931,20-08-2024,000858.png,"The government is mulling severing ties with the contractor responsible for the Paola health hub, after a series of missed deadlines in the project’s final stages means it has been unable to open its doors to the public.
 Audit firm Grant Thornton has been tasked with analysing the repercussions of terminating the contract.
 A notice announcing the €20,000 direct order to the audit firm, issued in April, appeared in a recent edition of the Government Gazette.
 The direct order asks Grant Thorton to help authorities reach an “informed decision on whether to terminate the contract re the Paola Regional Health Hub and the respective repercussions”.
 Sources within the health ministry told Times of Malta the move comes in the wake of a series of missed deadlines that have stalled the government’s final takeover of the building.
 Although construction work has been completed, sources say the contractor has missed as many as 17 deadlines in recent months, most linked to certification and quality control. The government cannot sign off on the project and take over the building until this certification is completed, sources say, otherwise, it would be assuming responsibility for any issues that could later emerge.
 The dispute has spilled over into the courts, with arbitration proceedings between the contractor and the government currently underway. Submissions in these proceedings have been filed recently, with government sources expecting an outcome in the coming weeks.
 The Paola health hub has had a troubled history from the get-go.
 It was first announced over a decade ago but never got off the ground because the government did not have a title to the land.
 The project was eventually greenlit in 2017, with the site of the former Paola boċċi club earmarked for a €39m investment that would cater for  almost a third of Malta’s population.
 At the time, the authorities had said the health centre would open by 2020.
 The project soon hit a bump in the road when several bidders objected to the decision to award the project’s tender to SP BB International JV, a consortium made up of Bonnici Brothers, Ray Vella and Pantalesco, among others. In a series of appeals, bidders argued that the adjudication process was tainted.
 An adjudication board ordered that the bids be re-evaluated, with the Department of Contract reversing its original decision and awarding the project to the Egron-Technoline consortium, whose bid was €4m cheaper than the original winners.
 The almost-completed health centre, now named the Vincent Moran Health Centre, after the late doctor and Labour health minister, came under the spotlight again in the days leading to last June’s MEP elections, with the authorities promising that it would be opening “in the near future”.

 Stephen Sammut Nurminen says he was the first person to run from the west to the east of the country and raised almost €6,000 for charities that supply food to homeless and vulnerable people. 
 The 38-year-old was supported by a team including his partner, a videographer, a driver and his pet dog, Nemo.
 As well as mountainous terrain, he battled temperatures of over 40 degrees and the humidity was “something I have never experienced before”, he said.
  The challenge involved running the 748km distance between the western city of Mae Sot to the town of Mukdahan, on the border with Loa, a distance almost equivalent to 17 marathons. 
 He ran 75km a day and completed it late on Tuesday after 136 hours and 38 minutes. 
 “I must admit, I feel a bit empty this morning, and I already miss being out there, running on the road,” he said.  
 “I am not as tired or sore as I imagined but that is all thanks to the great care we gave my body during the run. The team, especially my partner, were amazing in making sure that I always had what I needed, before, during and after every run.""
  The run was not without its lows, including one heartbreaking moment on day seven, after the athlete was joined by a new running mate, a stray dog the team nicknamed Chai. 
 After keeping pace with the team for 63 kilometres, Chai got bitten twice by other stray dogs but was sadly hit and killed by a ""speeding maniac"" four kilometres shy of the end of that day's run.
 The athlete said Chai's death devastated the team. 
  Sammut Nurminen and his team faced other challenges, including keeping safe from the strong sunrays and staying rehydrated. 
 Another key element during his run was to keep his feet dry to avoid any painful blisters- an important lesson he learnt back in 2022 when he had to cut a Sicily run short, albeit after 240 kilometres. 
 While his original challenge was to cover 765 km, Sammut Nurminen explained that the team took another road to get to Mukdahan, as the original one was full of traffic. 
  Despite the lows, the athlete and his team experienced many beautiful memories together.
 “I was also blessed to see my team grow and become closer day by day and the hospitality of the Thai people in each town that we passed through.”
 The athletes’ test of resilience, patience and determination were all for a good cause, to raise funds for Soup Kitchen OFM and Dar Hosea. 
 Valletta-based Soup Kitchen OFM provides prepared meals three times per week for people in need, as well as legal and psychological help. Dar Hosea aids vulnerable women exploited into prostitution. 
 He aimed to raise enough funds to distribute 5,000 meals for both charities and so far, the athlete has raised €5,978, which translates into 1,495 meals. Donations can still be sent through his GoFundMe page.

 Abela admitted that a circular issued to government healthcare staff on Tuesday, which instructed staff to confirm the patient’s identity by asking for their ID number, full name and date of birth, was in response to recent allegations of identity theft.
 “We don’t live in a bubble. We obviously take note of what is happening around us,” Abela said when asked why this measure was only introduced now.
 Abela admitted that health authorities had come across “several situations where there were mistakes” but insisted that most inconsistencies are down to human error, often at the point when a person is registered to the system.
 “Whoever is inputting patient details is human and humans all make mistakes. Even a single changed digit can bring up somebody else’s records.”
 Abela said that the new measures are intended “to make sure that our system is more robust” and do away with as many of these “mistakes” as possible by beefing up the verification process.
  “I’ve worked in hospitals, even in Malta, in which there are different ways to identify patients,” Abela said. “Improving our level of security in the public health service is a positive step.”
 Allegations of identity fraud hit the limelight in recent weeks, after former MP Jason Azzopardi called for a magisterial inquiry, claiming that some 18,000 identity cards were issued on the back of documents fabricated by Identità officials since 2015.
 The fears grew over the following weeks, with a spate of reports of possible identity theft being flagged, including within Malta’s healthcare services.
 One man who visited a healthcare clinic for a checkup in August discovered, much to his dismay, that his medical records listed him as having died in March.
 Meanwhile, at least a dozen others say they faced similarly surreal scenarios, from phantom hospital appointments to diagnoses of illnesses they never contracted.
 Elsewhere, scores of people reported receiving letters from telecoms company Epic addressed to people who never lived at the listed address.
 Suspicions over the possible racket intensified late last month after a man admitted to fixing letterboxes to residences to provide addresses for residence permits for third-country nationals.

 Sam Diamond travelled to Malta last week to spend some time with her sons before starting chemotherapy in the UK and decided to shave her hair off as “I could not bear seeing it fall out”.
 In an emotional moment caught on camera, her son, Liam Diamond, helped shave off his mum’s hair and then began to shave off his own.
 “I didn’t want my mum to have to do this alone,” he said. “We’re very close – we’re like magnets. We take care of each other and support each other. We’re very connected. Soul-bound.”
  The footage shows Liam shaving the last part of his mother’s hair while she is lost deep in thought. When he suddenly starts shaving his own head, his mother jumps up in shock and surprise before kissing and hugging him. She then continues to shave his head.
 “It was this huge shock,” she said. “When you see your son doing a journey with you, it’s heart-breaking. It’s not a mother-son relationship. We’re like best friends.”
 Sam spoke to Times of Malta from the UK, where she is preparing to start six months of chemotherapy on Monday before six months of radiotherapy and an operation.
 She was diagnosed with cervical cancer after a smear test returned with an abnormal result and she is now being treated for stage 3 cancer, meaning it is more advanced. 
 Sam is speaking out to raise awareness about the importance of regular smear tests after missing her test for several years due to the business of life. She mistook erratic periods for the early signs of menopause and wants women to be vigilant. “Women are working, raising children and running the house. But it is so important to find time for that smear test,” says Sam who has two sons and a daughter.
 Born to a Maltese mother and British father, she lived in Malta for about 23 years.
  Liam was five years old when he moved to Malta and lived here ever since – except for two years during his teens when he returned to the UK. He played 16 seasons of football and is now a player with Pembroke. He had to take a break after a “rough year” in which he suffered a knee injury last August but plans to return in a few months. Sam describes her son as “the sort of child who was so lovable and would do random things”.
 Shaving off his hair for his mum was one of them – although he admits he had preplanned it. “I never shaved my head. The last time I was about eight years old. What you don’t see in the video is how much my mum cried when they cut her hair.
 “I had planned to shave it and my girlfriend would film it. But then my mum started recording with her phone. She kept pressing ‘record’ and ‘stop’. Then there was a point – after it was shaved – that she pressed ‘record’ and she sort of zoned out. Then I shaved mine,” he says.
 And when he shared the post on social media he wrote: “Dear mum… I know this journey is gonna be crazier than any other year you have lived but, deep inside, I know God is with you, and you will prevail as the winner of this quest. But I’d like you to imbed these words into your everyday going through chemo: ‘I will never know how strong I am, until being strong is the only option I have’.
 “You’ve got this. I love you millions. Now we’re both bald.”

"Over 5,000 students attend mental health first aid course",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/over-5000-students-attend-mental-health-first-aid-course.1093247,30-05-2024,001170.png,"More than 5,000 Year 9 pupils have completed a first aid course for mental health offered to 13-year-olds in all secondary schools.
 The course was designed by the Richmond Foundation and the Commissioner for Mental Health to help pupils identify signs of mental health challenges and the type of help they need to give.
 The prime minister's wife, Lydia Abela was also involved in the organisation of the courses, which were spread over 25 hours.
 Abela had a discussion with ninth-year students at Żejtun St Tumas More College where she said that the community must be sufficiently informed and trained to help people with mental health challenges.
 She said this initiative was a tangible example of how mental health was no longer a taboo but was on the agenda of public discussion.  
 Present at the school were Education Minister Clifton Grima and Health Minister Jo Etienne Abela.
 The courses benefited from donations in the 'Smiles with Miles' initiative led by Abela and funding by the Bank of Valletta.

'I was told I had been dead for three months’: patients fear identity theft,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/i-told-i-dead-three-months-patients-fear-identity-theft.1096873,18-08-2024,"001228.png,001229.png","A man who went for a check-up at a public healthcare clinic two months ago was told his medical records listed him as having died in March.
 The man is among at least a dozen other people who claim to have discovered that their medical files contained upcoming appointments for serious tests and surgeries they did not need, data about hospital admissions they never underwent, medication they were never prescribed, by doctors they never visited, for illnesses they never had.
 Some of the mysterious anomalies are now the subject of an investigation by the Data Protection Commissioner.
 Times of Malta spoke to many of those affected on condition of anonymity. All said that they worried their data would be meddled with further if they revealed their identity.
 The man who was told he had ‘died’ is only in his early thirties and discovered the issue by chance, when he visited a clinic in June for a check-up.
 “The receptionist asked me for my ID card number and I saw her input it in her computer. She looked at the screen, looked back at me and asked me to repeat the number,” the man told Times of Malta.
 “I did, she inputted it again, looked at the screen again, looked back at me and said: ‘It says here you’ve been deceased since the end of March’.”
  Staff at the clinic were very helpful and saw to his needs that day, he said, but he later had to go to Mater Dei’s medical records office to rectify the error.
 “It could have been a genuine mistake, but it was very strange to me, because during the period I was marked as ‘deceased’ I travelled abroad, I worked and paid tax and even received the voting documents for the EU parliament and local council elections and voted normally without any hiccups,” he said.
 “I only discovered the issue when I needed to visit the clinic.”
 The man noticed another error on his medical record, however. It said that two days before he ‘died’, he was admitted to the hospital outpatients department, when in fact, he was not.
 Even more mysteriously, his name and identity card number were correct on the records – only the data seemed to belong to someone else’s medical history.
 Several people’s accounts of similar experiences have been surfacing online since lawyer Jason Azzopardi claimed a couple of weeks ago that Maltese ID card holders were “robbed” of their identities and that several ID numbers were allegedly assigned to other people through corrupt practices at  Identità.
 This week a magistrate upheld Azzopardi’s request for a magisterial inquiry into the alleged scam. So far, it remains unclear whether reports of hospital appointment errors are connected to these allegations.
 People who spoke to Times of Malta claim to have been contacted from hospital and clinics over the past months to confirm an upcoming appointment for a test, operation or treatment scheduled for the following weeks.
 The appointments listed their correct name and ID card number, but the medical details were not theirs.
 Appointments even included the name of the doctors who had presumably made the referral – only these people had no such conditions and never visited those doctors.
 One mother said she received an appointment for her teenage child to undergo a medical test. A quick Google search revealed that this was for a very serious illness related to a major organ.
 When she inquired about it with customer care, the representative was surprised the mother was not aware of the appointment as the system was showing there were three doctor referrals for it.
 The mother said the appointment was cancelled but when she asked whether it was an error, the customer care representative was not able to confirm that.
 Another man was called twice from hospital – last week and this week – to be reminded that he had a surgery coming up. Only it was not his surgery.
 Others discovered their medical records showed they were admitted to hospital, underwent tests and were prescribed medication by several doctors. None of that ever happened to them.
  One man, who owns a business and employs over hundred people, turned livid when he discovered, by chance, that he was also affected.
 He said he was reading social media comments about the issue this week, when he turned to his wife and told her that if it happened to him, he would be so mad he would probably sue the government.
 “That’s when my wife said: ‘Why don’t you check your MyHealth account?’ We checked and sure enough, there it was – it said I went to a clinic for blood tests last September. That’s impossible, as I was living abroad back then,” he said.
 “I’m now extremely concerned about my employees, because if my bank suspects I have committed some identity theft, they could close all my accounts. This is very serious.”
 Another man – a professional who holds a PhD – said he received a letter about four months ago confirming a hospital appointment he had never scheduled.
 “It was strange because the letter went to my parents’ house, and I have not lived there for more than two decades. And the name of the street wasn’t even the name the street has now, but a name it previously had back then.”
 While some of those impacted worry about the repercussions of what could be identity theft, others appear unperturbed.
 “I know I haven’t visited doctors for the condition they told me I had. I know I wasn’t admitted to hospital and that no doctor referred me to any surgery, so I knew I had nothing to worry about and dismissed it as an administrative error,” one man said.
 The Information and Data Protection Commissioner confirmed that he is investigating the issue but said it would be “presumptuous” to speculate on what the issue might be at this early stage.
 “Investigations on complaint-based and ex-officio cases have been initiated or are in the final internal process of being launched,” Commissioner Ian Deguara said.
 “The scope and purpose of our investigations are primarily to establish facts while ensuring that the parties’ right to be heard is guaranteed throughout the process. On the basis of those findings, legal deliberations will be made and a legally-binding decision issued.”
 Corrective actions would then depend on a number of factors, including the nature and gravity of infringements and the degree of responsibility of the “controller”, he added.
  Health Minister JoEtienne Abela told Times of Malta he was concerned by the “extremely serious allegations”.
 He said he was “not personally aware of any such complaints” but offered to look into the cases individually.
 “We shall inform the people concerned that we will scrutinise their records for any inaccuracies,” he said.
 Identità said it has no control or responsibility for the data validation techniques employed by the Mater Dei appointment system or any other third-party system, including that of private companies.
 “It is essential that third-party IT systems implement strong and robust data validation methods to ensure their data is always up-to-date and compliant with GDPR regulations,” it said.
 It also said it has not received such complaints and explained each ID card holder is assigned a unique number, “generated from the birth act number recorded when a child’s birth is registered, with the last two digits reflecting the year of birth” and that death certificates are recorded in the public registry system only when a death certificate has been issued by a doctor and when a family member registers the death.

A fifth of over 70s die within a year of a hip fracture,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/a-fifth-70s-die-year-hip-fracture.1093769,22-06-2024,001746.png,"A fifth of people aged over 70 die within a year of a hip fracture, a new study has shown as it calls for better fall-prevention strategies and education.
 And of the patients who suffered a hip fracture through a fall in their own home, almost a fifth ended up in a care home within six months of the accident
 “This result highlights how a proximal femoral (hip) fracture is often a major life event, having both a medical and social impact,” according to the study ‘Hip fractures in older persons in Malta’, published in the recent edition of the Malta Medical Journal.
 Researchers collected data of 195 people over 70 who had fractured their hip in Malta between May and October 2019 and followed them up a year later.
 There were a total of 11 deaths (5.8%) in the first 30 days from the fracture. This increased to 33 deaths (17%) at six months and 41 (22%) deaths at one year from the hip fracture.
  During the six-month period, 34% of the patients were men and 66% women.
 The majority ‒ 147 hip fractures (75%) ‒ occurred in patients who were living at their own home. The remaining 25% occurred in patients who were living in care institutions. 
 Of the 147 patients who were living at home before the fracture, six were lost to follow-up as they left the island. Of the remaining 141 cases, 26 (18%) were living in a care home within six months.
 A study called ‘Post-operative mortality related to waiting time for hip fracture surgery’, published in the National Library of Medicine in 2004, looked at the difference in one-year mortality between two groups of patients who were operated for hip fracture in Malta. Results showed that survival at one year was
 better when patients, who are medically fit for surgery, were operated on the same day of admission.
 Speaking in the context of a nurses’ industrial action in August last year, the Association of Orthopaedic and Trauma Surgeons had said: “Delaying surgery in any bed-bound, immobile trauma patient risks an increase in morbidity and even mortality. This is especially true with elderly patients who have sustained a hip fracture.”
 Until a few months ago, patients were made to wait up to five days. But, over the past year, the situation improved, sources said.
  “Waiting time to surgery has improved at Mater Dei as we now have dedicated hip fracture lists so that these frail patients get priority for their surgery,” said a surgeon, adding that the waiting time was currently between 24 hours and two days.
 An orthopedic surgeon noted that the issue with these patients was that most  were very frail and with multiple other health problems.
 “They present a challenge to the anesthetist as they have poor heart, lung and kidney function. They can have several complications, such as chest infections, deep vein thrombosis and pressure sores before or after surgery. They usually have a few years to live in any case and the hip fracture is sometimes the last straw in a failing body,” the surgeon said.
 The surgeon added that a lot needed to be done about fall prevention.
 “Pavements are a disaster,” he said.
 The dire need to repair Malta’s pavements was flagged recently in a report, compiled by the Faculty for Social Well-being, that laid out recommendations to address loneliness – that is impacting more than half the population.
 In January, 82-year-old Carmelina Borg recounted how she lived in fear and ended up confined to her Sliema home after tripping over an uneven cobbled pavement and fracturing her hip.
  While Borg had no control over the state of the pavement, some accidents are preventable.
 “There needs to be more education to these elderly people. Like not to have loose carpets and not walking in darkness when they wake up at night. They could have physical therapy to remain fit and able bodied. All to reduce risk of fall,” he added.
 His words were reinforced by the recent study that showed that over a quarter of the cases – 52 (27%) – had contact with the hospital emergency department or were discharged after a hospital admission, within the 90 days before the fracture. Most pre-fracture visits (48%) were due to medical problems and 21% due to falls.
 “As a result, we would suggest that elderly patients admitted with acute medical problems, have sensory impairment or undergo elective surgeries should be screened for falls and fracture risk and be referred to falls prevention clinics,” the report said.
