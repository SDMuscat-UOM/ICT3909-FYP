‘Churches will come to life with music’: organ festival returns for 11th year,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/churches-come-life-music-organ-festival-returns-11th-year.1101016,17-11-2024,"003231.png,003232.png","This Friday sees the welcome return of the Malta International Organ Festival, a celebration of the organ and its music and a creative journey through some of the country’s richest sacred spaces.
 Entering its 11th year, this year’s organ festival presents 10 concerts in churches across Malta and Gozo featuring a host of local and international artists.
 The festival opens with a performance by Grammy-nominated US organist Cameron Carpenter, described by Gramophone magazine as “one of the great virtuosos of our time,” at St Paul’s Anglican Pro-Cathedral in Valletta.
 Over the following two weeks, the festival will see organists joined by vocalists, brass and woodwind musicians and even an orchestra for the event’s closing concert at Paola’s Basilica of Christ the King on December 7.
 “We’re celebrating communities, our heritage and music in the centre of our towns and villages and have the best of the best coming to Malta to entertain us,” said the festival’s founder and artistic director Joseph Lia.
 “There are a lot of nice aesthetics – architecture, paintings, carvings and all the art incorporated in these churches – plus the music, which is one of the highest performing art forms.”
 Describing organ music being played in churches as “giving an additional dimension to these [church] works of art,” Lia said Malta’s sacred spaces will “come to life with music” throughout the festival.
 ‘Mega star’ 
 Despite the organ’s long history, the instrument and its repertoire continues to be developed – not least by maverick US organist Carpenter, who made waves with the debut of his self-designed electronic International Touring Organ, the world’s first full-scale portable organ. 
 Describing Carpenter as a “mega star... a big name,” Lia stressed the festival was seeking to showcase the wealth of music written for the instrument, pointing to the variety of musical themes explored and the range – and calibre – of musicians coming to perform.
 Saturday sees a concert dedicated to improvised variations on Maltese hymns, with performances the following week featuring works by Bach, Piazzola and Puccini.
 A Christmas-themed concert takes place on December 2, meanwhile, with an eclectic performance featuring various artists held the following Thursday.
 Ancient origins
 While a precursor to the organ – utilising waterpower instead of bellows – is thought to date back more than 2,000 years, the earliest version of the modern organ emerged in Europe around the eighth century.
 The organ had become a fixture in churches by the 10th century while continuing to see design refinements and improvements through into the early 17th century.
  By the early 18th century, it had become an important instrument in the arsenal of Baroque composers, particularly Bach (1685-1750), perhaps the most famous proponent of the instrument and composer of the fabulously dramatic Toccata and Fugue in D minor, a work that has become synonymous with the instrument.
 Malta’s organs
 With a strong Christian tradition, Malta is home to some 130 organs, most of which are housed in churches.
 In December last year, a new 4,000-pipe organ was installed in Paola’s Basilica of Christ the King while this year saw the completion of restoration works on the 200-year-old organ housed in Valletta’s St Dominic parish church.
 Both organs will feature in this year’s festival, with the Paola organ taking centre stage for the event’s grand finale featuring music for organ and orchestra.
 Describing the organ as “the king of the instruments,” paying homage to its “rich tones and colours and grand, majestic power,” Lia noted the festival also sees the inclusion of smaller, more “delicate” organs in churches such as St Mary parish church in Gudja and Valletta’s Jesuit church oratorio.
 “Our forefathers crowdfunded our churches with very good organs – some are big romantic organs, some are ancient organs of historic value and there are smaller organs comparable with the size of the space,” said Lia, a baritone singer.
 “This is why I started this [the festival], because I was working with organists when living abroad, and they knew that we have such very good organs – so we started discussing the possibility of organising a festival here.”
 New concert hall?
 While Malta boasts a wealth of sacred spaces to enjoy organ music, Lia would like to see Malta’s capabilities to explore the instrument expanded, stressing the need for a new purpose-built concert hall.
 “Something we lack here in Malta is a philharmonic hall with an organ – a secular concert hall like other European countries have,” he said.
 While stressing his love of sacred music, explaining he was “born in sacred music, great music,” Lia thinks a new concert hall equipped with an organ could allow him and others to explore a greater range of repertoire.
 “As an artistic director, I would be freer to programme more music... there’s not only sacred music, but there’s other music that sometimes involves the organ too,” he said.
 However, keen to stress the unique nature of the festival and its performance spaces, Lia encouraged those new to organ repertoire to “come and experience this in our churches.”
 “In this stressful world, audiences can come and relax in these places that were built for worship and enjoy this music.”

TVM’s news channel to drop 'news' from logo,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/tvm-news-channel-no-more-pbs-drop-news-logo.1098276,19-09-2024,003135.png,"The national broadcaster will no longer have an official news channel as of next week, with TVMnews+ dropping ‘news’ from its logo. 
 On Thursday morning, television producers received an email from PBS, informing them that as of Monday 30 September, TVMnews+ will become TVM+. The email also included the channel’s new logo. 
 The change has come ahead of the new programme schedule.
 This is the second revamp the channel has experienced in recent years. 
 TVMnews+ replaced TVM2 in 2021, after a massive rebranding effort by the national broadcaster.
 When the new channel was first announced, PBS said it would focus exclusively on news, sports, culture, history and current affairs programmes. 
 At the time, Times of Malta spoke to four  TVM reporters anonymously who all complained that TVM's news had been relegated to a ""government noticeboard"" and proper journalism was being ""stifled"".
 Viewers have noted that most current affairs programmes migrated from TVM to TVMnews+, and instead of focusing solely on news, the channel now broadcasts discussion programmes and documentary-style shows. 
 Shows such as ‘Paqpaq’, a programme on motorsports,  Tgħid x’Inhu?, a programme discovering objects in local museums, and a biographical documentary on different Maltese women's careers,   Il-Mara, are broadcast weekly on TVMnews+
 The most recent Broadcasting Authority report, published in August, noted how only an average of 5,589 people followed TVMnews+, a drastic drop when compared to TVM's 72,000 plus audience. 
 The report noted how viewers preferred to watch the news bulletin on TVM, rather than on TVMnews+.
 TVM is the most followed TV station: 41% of local viewers mentioned TVM as one of the three TV stations they watched the previous day.
 Questions have been sent to PBS.

Valletta lights up for Republic Day spectacle,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/valletta-lights-republic-day-spectacle.1102462,14-12-2024,"003248.png,003249.png,003250.png,003251.png,003252.png,003253.png","On Friday evening, the facade of the President’s Palace in Valletta served as a canvas narrating the island's history, as Malta celebrated the 50th anniversary of becoming a Republic. 
 For the significant anniversary, the day’s celebrations reached their climax in the evening, when a spectacular audiovisual show 'L-Istorja, Aħna’  took place at St George’s Square.
 During the occasion, President Myriam Spiteri Debono said this year’s celebration theme emphasises the need for all of us to reflect on Malta’s history and participate in writing its future. 
 She said the 50th anniversary is an opportunity to honour those who came before us and the sacrifices they made to bring us where we are today. 
  “It should also allow us to reflect on where we stand now, and what we are prepared to do for those who come after us,” she said. 
 She also noted the persistent challenges, both locally and internationally, and stressed the importance of responding to them appropriately.  She highlighted how material deprivation, social exclusion, over-development,  and population growth, as relevant and pressing concerns.
 Spiteri Debono concluded her speech by urging everyone to collectively pledge to continue Malta’s journey for the benefit of future generations and to raise and uphold Malta's name.
  During his speech, Prime Minister Robert Abela emphasised that Republic Day was not just about honouring the past but about “laying the foundations” for a bright future. 
 He described the establishment of the Republic as a significant achievement of the Maltese people, noting how over the past 50 years, the nation shaped an identity rooted in strong family values. 
 “No nation can forget its roots,” he said. 
 “The sense of identity must be passed down to future generations,” he added, highlighting the importance of passing on Malta’s unique language and identity to future generations. 
  Abela said Malta’s sovereignty is based on its economic resilience and it is through “unity, hard work, and identity” that the nation can take the Republic forward into the next 50 years. 
 He said there will be further reforms in democracy and a focus on improving the quality of life for the Maltese people. 
 ""We want to see our country leading the way in the green energy transformation, at the heart of the digital transition, celebrating the arts, and proudly showcasing the expressions of its artists,"" Abela said.
   Festivals Malta through the National Festivities Committee- and in collaboration with the Office of the President organised various activities throughout the long weekend. 
 The day started with a pontifical Mass at St John’s Co-Cathedral, followed by a ceremonial parade by the Armed Forces of Malta, who greeted President Myriam Spiteri Debono and Prime Minister Robert Abela among others in St George’s Square. 
 At noon, an investiture ceremony and medal awarding was held in the Grand Council Hall at the Grand Master’s Palace.

No public bus service for Ed Sheeran concert as logistical issues loom,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/no-public-bus-service-ed-sheeran-concert-logistical-issues-loom.1094338,24-06-2024,003273.png,"Public buses will not be operating a special service for the Ed Sheeran concert or even enter Ta’ Qali on Wednesday, as logistical concerns loom ahead of Malta’s biggest-ever paid concert.
 More than 30,000 fans are expected to watch the British icon, but while large concerts are normally held at the Floriana Granaries, Wednesday’s event will be held at the larger Ta’ Qali picnic area.
 Those attending will not be allowed to park their cars near the Ta’ Qali venue, with organisers providing a subsidised €10 return bus service at seven shuttle pick-up points across Malta instead.
 The service is on a first-come, first-served basis and is starting at 5.30pm, well before the concert.
 The response has been so overwhelming that the organisers have added more shuttle service pick-up points. But there is a limit to the number of vehicles available.
 Tickets for the shuttle service from Paola, for example, are already fully booked.
 Several raised concerns about the planned shuttle service on social media.
  “The pick-up locations aren’t even big enough to hold enough buses to cater for all those people,” one woman said.
 Some said it was unfair having to pay another €10 after having paid for concert tickets while others said public buses should introduce a one-off service to the venue to help with transporting fans.
 But when contacted, Malta Public Transport said public buses are being diverted away from the concert, so those planning to use public transport to get to Ta’ Qali will have to walk from the stops along the central link road to the concert, around 30 minutes.   
 A Malta Public Transport spokesperson said: “Due to the traffic management measures in place for the Ed Sheeran concert at Ta’ Qali on June 26, buses are being diverted to pass through the Central Link and stop on bus stops ‘Qali 1’, ‘Qali 2’ and ‘Qali 3’ – about a 30-minute walk.”  
 Thousands are expected to fly to Malta for the concert to watch Sheeran, who is behind major hits like Shape of You and  Perfect.
 The concert is the biggest since the Robbie Williams concert at the Granaries last September. More big concerts are expected next month, including Tom Jones, Ronan Keating and the Isle of MTV.

Artist claims Maltabiennale censored his artwork; organiser says it's 'absurd',timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/artist-claims-maltabiennale-censored-artwork-president-say-absurd.1098493,25-09-2024,"003401.png,003402.png,003403.png","Maltese artist Keit Bonnici has claimed his artwork at the inaugural Maltabiennale.art was ""censored"" after it was removed without his consent and stored for a month in an undisclosed location.
 Bonnici said that his installation, Fuq l-Art , went missing on May 1, and only discovered its whereabouts after the biennale ended on May 31.
  Fuq l-Art involved bubble-wrapping and tightly securing one of Valletta’s iconic red telephone boxes. The box was topped with a bright yellow postage sticker bearing the origin ""United Kingdom"" and a blank section for the destination. The artwork was a commentary on decolonisation and the evolving role of monuments in public spaces.
 Speaking to Times of Malta, Bonnici said, ""As artists, we rely on exposure for our work. For one-third of the agreed duration, my piece wasn’t shown to the public - which affects my livelihood.” 
 The artist insisted he had not been informed about the reason for the removal and only retrieved the artwork from Heritage Malta after the biennale ended. “Why was my artwork held in secret storage for a month? Neither I nor the curators knew where it was. I was only allowed to collect it after the biennale was over. Heritage Malta never responded to my questions about this.”
 But Mario Cutajar, president of the biennale, dismissed the censorship claims as ""absurd"".
 He explained that Bonnici's work had been selected, approved, and sponsored for the exhibition. According to Cutajar, the artwork had become ""unsightly"" due to damage, prompting the organisers to ask Bonnici, via artistic director Sofia Baldi Pighi, to work on the maintenance of the piece.
  “On April 23, we asked Bonnici through the artistic director to carry out maintenance on the artwork that week. Nothing was done. One week later, on April 30, we repeated our request, stating that if repairs were not carried out, the piece would have to be dismantled. Again, nothing happened, and the artwork was removed that evening,” Cutajar told Times of Malta.
 The piece was damaged because parts of the bubble wrap were ripped off by members of the public, he said.
 Bonnici, however, defended this as part of the artwork’s evolution, saying the public's interaction with it was integral to the piece.
 “It’s a travelling object, and like anything transported, it can get battered. I have no issue with people interacting with the artwork. When an artwork exists in public space, it has the chance to evolve.”
 Artistic director Baldi Pighi assumed the role of mediator between Bonnici and the organisation and supported the artist’s stance. She shared her communications with Times of Malta, which showed her disapproval of dismantling the piece.
 “Artworks are mechanisms to foster discussion and convey critical thought, and once again, Keit Bonnici’s work proves effective,” she said.
 Baldi Pighi emphasised that out of the more than one hundred artworks in the biennale, the ones placed in public spaces have had the most impact.
 “Ask any person living in Malta, whether art professional or not, and the works they will remember are those in public spaces,” she added.
 A broader conversation about reclaiming public space for discussion and creativity is needed, Baldi Pighi said, pointing out that movements like Moviment Graffitti and eminent local artists ""have been crucial in the drive towards transforming public areas into sites for debate and free thought.” 
 Cutajar, however, criticised the timing of Bonnici’s public claims, questioning why the artist had waited over four months before speaking out. “I’m quite sure that had Mr Bonnici been censored in any way, he would have cried foul immediately, without waiting more than four months and claiming it in a post advertising the artwork for sale or exhibition.”
  Bonnici said he had been working on resolving the issue privately for months, with support from the biennale curatorial team and the Malta Entertainment Industry and Arts Association. Due to financial and legal concerns, however, he had chosen not to go public until recently.
 “I tried to speak earlier, but my hands were tied. We were still waiting for material reimbursement from Heritage Malta,” he explained.
 MEIA has since supported Bonnici, claiming that his case was not an isolated incident.
 “We received several concerns from other participants and MEIA members about organisational and ethical issues,” the association said.
 It added that discussions with Cutajar and Heritage Malta CEO Noel Zammit had revealed “a troubling lack of understanding of contemporary art practices, a dismissive attitude toward concerns, and an unwillingness to acknowledge any wrongdoing”.
 Bonnici was not the only artist to claim censorship at the biennale. Italian artist Sara Leghissa also reported that her pro-choice artwork Unborn Celebration was censored during the event.

New €1m fund to support Malta's indigenous film industry,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/new-1m-fund-support-malta-indigenous-film-industry.1096058,30-07-2024,"003484.png,003485.png","Arts Council Malta has announced a €1 million scheme to support the indigenous film industry.
 The Screen Support Scheme comprises five strands: screenwriting, development, short film, feature-length production, and cultural programmes. It covers works of fiction, documentaries, and animations, while one strand supports cultural programmes.
 ""We are among the few whose national-scale cinematographic expression is yet to materialise. The road is long, but every beginning has its end,” The chair of Arts Council Malta, Albert Marshall, said. 
 Financial support for Maltese filmmakers was previously under the remit of the Malta Film Commission, which fell under the Tourism Ministry and there was ongoing controversy over millions spent to support foreign film productions in Malta, as compared to support for the local film industry itself.
 The Creative Malta programme, widely known as the film fund, had handed local filmmakers €600,000 yearly to finance local film productions.
 The fund has now been increased to €1 million under the Culture Ministry.
 Earlier this month, Marshall said the film fund needs to be tripled to €3 million for Maltese indigenous films to thrive alongside the foreign movie industry—an increase he reminded people about at the launch. 
 “The Council has declared that there was a strong need for lobbying to increase the fund to €3 million, which is the promised amount,” said Marshall.
  During the launch, Culture Minister Owen Bonnici welcomed the scheme and said it was essential that all continued to work hard to strengthen the cultural and creative sectors. ""Therefore, it’s extremely important that we listen to the sector and work hand in hand to further strengthen it.”
 Director of Funding and Strategy at the Council, Mary Ann Cauchi said that the scheme will offer support through a mentorship process to encourage those new to the industry to apply.
 To apply for any strands, applicants must be independent audiovisual entities and submit complete applications by September 24 at noon. The results will be announced on November 21 and 22.

Watch: The nightclub that’s still partying like it’s 1999,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/watch-the-nightclub-still-partying-like-1999.1101130,17-11-2024,"003706.png,003707.png,003708.png","Stepping into Beachaven in St Paul’s Bay is like entering a 1990s time capsule. The seaside club, one of the last of its kind, still has its original décor – and there are no plans to update it.
 Most other popular nightclubs of the era like Natasha’s, Tattingers and Styx have since closed while venues like Liquid, known as Vibes in the 1990s, have rebranded and updated.
 But Beachaven still has its disco balls, neon lights, purple furniture and the club’s crown jewel: its glass dance floor.
 “People love it,” said 73-year-old owner Godwin Cutajar. Apart from a few upgraded lights and a revamped sound system, the club has remained largely untouched since it was last decorated more than 30 years ago.
 Cutajar first came across the venue as a customer in the 1970s, when it was known as Fondatore, and took over management in 1977 despite having no experience in catering or bar operations.
  Initially an outdoor lido with a beach club, the space underwent various transformations before Cutajar settled on its now iconic 1990s aesthetic.
 “So many people tell us, ‘Don’t change it. Leave it like that,’” shared his wife, 65-year-old Jeanette. The couple met in the club’s early years when disco classics from Donna Summer and Saturday Night Fever filled the air.
 “It’s the Beachaven love story,” Jeanette laughed, adding that she first visited the club due to her parents’ summer home nearby.
 “No one thought it would work, and here we are, married for 37 years,” she added. The couple, from different sides of the island – Godwin from Żebbuġ and Jeanette from Sliema – recall the sacrifices they made for Beachaven.
 Jeanette describes nights when Godwin would sleep at the club on crates of beer with only a mattress.
  “Beachaven is the love of his life, even before me,” she laughed.
 Keeping Beachaven alive for nearly five decades has been no easy feat, and the couple has faced many challenges, including frequent encounters with the police.
 “The police used to come en masse,” Jeanette recalled.
 They would often shut down Beachaven’s parties due to complaints about noise levels and parking issues affecting the coastline. However, after investing in heavy soundproofing and learning to carry all necessary licences, the police problems faded away.
 There was also some controversy among more conservative members of society as the clubbing season would open on Good Friday when everywhere else would be shut.
 “People would say, ‘what a shame’,” Jeanette said.
 The most recent threat to Beachaven came in 2019, when a powerful storm shattered two windows and flooded the seaside club.
 “The dance floor was full of fish from the fish farms,” Jeanette said. “We thought the club was finished.” But with help from friends, they managed to restore the space and continue operations.
  In 2015, after a stroke, Godwin’s eldest son Karl returned from abroad to help run the family business. The club’s management has now been passed to the younger son, Simon, who has been working there since he was 16.
 “My first memory of the club was sneaking in as a kid until my parents found me and kicked me out,” recalls Simon, now 30.
 Inspired to follow in his father’s footsteps, Simon has no plans to modernise the club’s retro charm.
 “Some people tell me to update it, but there are already so many modern places. I don’t think there’s anywhere else with this vibe left,” he noted.
 The Cutajar family believes Beachaven’s true magic lies in its ability to welcome generation after generation – four and counting. Under Simon’s management, Beachaven continues to attract an older crowd seeking nostalgia and a younger generation drawn to its now-retro vibe.
 Looking back on his years at Beachaven, Godwin is proud of the club’s legacy and pleased to pass it on to his son.
 “As far as I’m concerned, I’ve done everything there is to do, and now it’s Simon’s turn,” he said.

Alexandra Alden’s Eurovision song disqualified for breaking competition rules,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/alexandra-alden-eurovision-song-disqualified.1102535,16-12-2024,003866.png,"Updated 4:55pm
 A song submitted by former X Factor Malta judge Alexandra Alden has been disqualified from the Malta Eurovision Song Contest 2025 after being published in violation of competition rules, the public broadcaster announced Monday.
 In a statement, PBS said Alden’s song Magnolia was disqualified from Malta’s Eurovision song contest after it “received information” the song had been published prior to the end of November in violation of competition regulations.
 “Following a thorough investigation and verification of the facts, PBS has taken the necessary steps to ensure compliance with the competition rules,” the broadcaster said.
 The regulation cited by PBS says the lyrics and music of songs submitted to the competition must “not have been commercially released” before November 30.
 In instances of songs being made available before the given date, including on social media, artists should inform PBS for the broadcaster to make a decision on their eligibility, the rules say.
 The announcement comes just days after the 24 semi-finalists for the competition were revealed by Magic Malta’s hosts Daniel and Ylenia.
 A jury and the public will select the winner, who will represent Malta at the Eurovision Song Contest in Basel, Switzerland in May.
 Concluding its statement, PBS - which broadcasts the Eurovision Song Contest on its TVM television channel - said it was “committed to maintaining a fair and transparent process for all participants”.
 In a statement later on Monday, Alden said she was ""so disheartened"" by the decision and put the incident down to an acoustic ""prototype"" version of the song filmed ""years ago"".
 The singer said she had asked the person responsible to remove the song immediately, aware it could affect her submission to the competition.
 ""I informed PBS of what had taken place to be transparent and professional. It was already too late"", the singer said.
 ""I perform often and trying out works in progress of songs in a low-key, informal setting helps the creative process"", she said, adding that a new album featuring the song was not yet commercially available and the song was not yet ready for release. 
 ""I understand and respect the decision taken by PBS to avoid any potential friction with the Eurovision organisers and I wish the contestants so much luck"", said Aldren. ""Sing your hearts out.""

 The Australian actor, who was behind classic films like Braveheart and  Lethal Weapon, is among an 11-member team scouting Malta following an invitation by the Malta Film Commission.
 Prime Minister Robert Abela welcomed Gibson and the production team on Wednesday to discuss an upcoming production.
 Gibson is currently filming the sequel to 2004's The Passion of the Christ, which he co-wrote, produced and directed.
 The new film Resurrection is expected to bring together several actors of the original cast of  The Passion of Christ, featuring Jim Caviezel and Francesco De Vito. Reports say the film will be shot in Israel, Morocco and Italy.
 During the meeting on Wednesday, Abela said Gibson noted the strides made by the film industry in Malta. 
 Questions about the five-day visit have been sent to the Malta Film Commission. 
 Gibson was one of the most successful Hollywood stars of the 1980s and 1990s. He has been nominated three times for an Oscar - winning two in 1996 (Best Director and Best Picture) for Braveheart and nominated in 2017 for best director for  Hacksaw Ridge.

New Jurassic World movie will start shooting in Malta in July,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/new-jurassic-world-movie-start-shooting-malta-july.1091682,21-06-2024,"004048.png,004049.png,004050.png","A new Jurassic World film is set to start shooting in Malta this summer with Scarlett Johansson expected to take the lead role.
 The production has booked almost all facilities at the Malta Film Studios in Kalkara this summer and is set to shoot bet­ween July and September, multiple film industry sources told Times of Malta.
 The world-renowned franchise will only film part of its latest movie in Malta and there are no shoots scheduled on location.
 The Malta Film Studios offers, among other facilities, two infinite-horizon water tanks that film productions generally use for large-scale sound effects and underwater shooting.
  The Jurassic franchise first hit the big screens in 1993, with its blockbuster Jurassic Park, based on a novel by Michael Crichton and directed by Steven Spielberg.
 A sequel followed in 1997 and then in 2001, 2015, 2018 and 2022.
  The 2022 film, called Dominion, starred Hollywood actor Chris Pratt and was also partly  filmed in Malta, with scenes shot in Valletta, Vittoriosa, Mellieħa and Pembroke in 2020.
 In the film, Malta starred as a hub for a dinosaur black market where velociraptors leap over churches and chase lead characters through the streets of Valletta in chaotic scenes.
 Very few details have yet emerged on the new film, with Hollywood reporters saying it is set to premiere in July 2025 and that Johansson is expected to take a lead role in it.
 A two-time Oscar nominee, the 39-year-old actress shot to fame with the film Lost in Translation, and she is mostly known for playing the Black Widow in several Marvel Studios films, including the Avengers.
 The Jurassic World film is the latest in a series of big-time productions that have filmed in Malta over the past years, all of which made the best out of the remarkably generous government scheme that gives them 40 per cent cash back on almost all expenses incurred while their production films in Malta.
 The government has repeatedly said it is committed to retain the rebate – albeit controversial – to attract more blockbusters to Malta, and for the film industry to become a leading ‘motor’ in the island’s tourism strategy.

 Verdict: The photo was taken in Los Angeles in 2018, showing a 91-year-old man after he suffered a racially motivated attack. The photo is being used by scammers to gain popularity.
 A photo of a seemingly lost bloodied and bruised man circulating online is just the latest in a long series of scam posts that have travelled the world and reached Malta’s shores.
 The posts show an older man struggling to get off the ground as blood streams down his face.
 “Does anyone recognize this old man?” the posts ask. ""He showed up at our house"".
 “Let’s flood our feeds to help find his family”.
 And people certainly obliged. One post was shared over 1,300 times by unsuspecting Facebook users on Monday and Tuesday, many imploring their friends to reach out to them with any information.
  But a quick online search quickly reveals that this photo is several years old and taken on the other side of the world.
 The man in the picture is Rodolfo Rodriguez, a (then) 91-year-old Mexican man who was the victim of a racist attack when he was assaulted with a brick on a Los Angeles street back in 2018.
 Rodriguez had travelled to Los Angeles to visit his family in California when a group of people attacked him with a concrete brick, telling him to “go back to Mexico”.
 He survived the attack, emerging with a broken cheekbone and several bruises on his face.
 The gang leader, Laquisha Jones, was arrested days later and eventually sentenced to 15 years behind bars.
  The Facebook posts sharing the Rodriguez’s image in Malta trace a well-worn path in an effort to dupe people.
 Last year, a spate of similar posts showing lost children and  injured dogs hit Maltese social media, each being shared thousands of times.
 And, more recently, scammers took to sharing photos of a three-year-old boy, claiming he was found in Malta.
 These photos are often shared by fake Facebook profiles to local property pages, each time asking readers to share the post as widely as possible. Comments beneath the post are often closed to prevent people from pointing out that this is a scam.
 The posts are believed to be an example of a sympathy scam in which a page or post tries to receive a large number of likes or follows by pulling at people’s heartstrings.
 The scammers will then change the post’s contents to promote a fraudulent scheme, often a fake cryptocurrency investment, banking on the post’s thousands of likes and shares to give it some added legitimacy.
 Scam Facebook posts such as this often contain several tell-tale signs suggesting that the post may be a hoax.
 The Facebook posts sharing this picture are just the latest in a long series of scam posts.
 The photo shows a 91-year-old Mexican man, Rodolfo Rodriguez, who was attacked in Los Angeles in 2018.
 The story was widely reported in the USA and internationally, often using the same photo used by scammers.
 The claim is therefore false as the evidence clearly refutes it.

Sam Smith gives spectacular show at Summer Daze festival,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/sam-smith-gives-spectacular-show-summer-daze-festival.1096803,16-08-2024,"004287.png,004288.png,004289.png,004290.png,004291.png,004292.png,004293.png,004294.png,004295.png,004296.png,004297.png,004298.png,004299.png,004300.png,004301.png,004302.png,004303.png,004304.png","UK singer Sam Smith dazzled crowds in Ta' Qali on Thursday as they headlined the main event of the annual Summer Daze festival.
 Organisers said on Friday that more than 30,000 people attended the festival's main event on Thursday, with 65% of them specifically travelling from overseas to attend. 
 With an electrifying show that had attendees dancing and singing along throughout the night, Smith took the audience through a journey of their musical career, from the softer ballads of the first album to the more recent and racier dance tracks that had everyone dancing along.
 With the set featuring the figure of a woman lying asleep, spray painted with slogans that included the phrases “liberation”, “autonomy”, “revolution”, “ cease fire now” and “protect trans kids”, Smith was heralded to the stage with a spectacular light display and dancers holding flaming red torches up high.
  The crowd erupted into frenzied cheer as Smith made their appearance descending a small staircase in towering platform shoes, with a smile shining under an impressively waxed moustache and an elegant Vivienne Westwood pearl earring dangling from their lobe.
 Smith started off with familiar hits from their early career, including Stay With Me, I’m Not The Only One and  Like I Can, making a brief pause in the set to get the crowd to sing Happy Birthday to Julia, the band’s bassist. 
 While the heat didn’t seem to be keeping the crowd from enjoying the evening, Smith seemed unprepared for the temperature for the evening to border on 30 degrees.
 “I’m regretting all my outfit changes for the evening,” Smith said, before launching into a rendition of Too Good At Goodbyes. 
  Nevertheless, the heat didn’t stop them from changing into a series of daring outfits, including a billowing black gown, a puffy skirted coat of rainbow tulle and back into a slick black coat and veil, concealing a more revealing get up for a much-anticipated finale. 
 Smith went through a series of more dance-oriented hits, including Promises, Latch, I’m Not Here To Make Friends and Desire, which saw dancers tumbling into spectacular displays of movement in time to the thumping beat. 
 But the most anticipated moment of the show came in its finale, with Smith and entourage pulling out all the stops to deliver an exhilarating rendition of the sexually charged hit Unholy. 
  Smith took to the stage in a corset and thigh-high stockings, as the dancers came out in long, blonde wigs in imitation of Kim Petras, the German pop star who also features on the song, in a high-energy performance that had the crowd dancing along enthusiastically and screaming for more, finally ending in a fireworks display over the stage. 
  Fellow Brit Becky Hill, who rose to prominence after appearing on the first season of The Voice UK in 2012, had already managed to get pulses racing earlier in the evening with a fun and high-energy set. 
 Clad in leather and with a blonde ponytail swishing behind her as she danced across the stage, Hill’s powerful voice had people jumping in no time, starting the crowd off with a call and response for Crazy What Love Can Do. 
  Hill ran through familiar hits, including Back and Forth, Afterglow and  Disconnect, that left attendees with a deep bass line thumping in their chest as they sang along bathed in neon lights. 
 She expressed gratitude to the crowd, both because she had been recently recovering from laryngitis and for audiences enthusiastically returning to live performances after the COVID-19 lockdowns.
 “I’m so glad we made it through that and that we have live shows and music and partying again because this is my life,” she said, before launching into a version of Never Be Alone. 
 She went on to close off with I Wish You Well and  That’s What I Remember. 
  Organisers said on Friday that over 30,000 people attended the event, with 65% of attendees coming from overseas to watch the show. 
 These largely came from the UK, Italy, France, Germany, Poland, Spain, Turkey, Ireland and the US, they said. 
 Overall, the week-long festival is expected to attract some 60,000 attendees across all of its events. 
 “The pull of such an international audience is a testament to the quality and appeal of the headliners that SummerDaze continues to bring to the Maltese Islands, as well as partnerships with global brands such as the BBC, Creamfields and their newest addition of partnerships with the renowned Universal Music Group,” the organisers said in a statement. 
 “These relationships put Malta on the map and make it the more obvious destination for music lovers worldwide.”
 This edition of the Summer Daze Festival was organised in partnership with Universal Music Group, BBC Radio 1 Dance Anthems and Creamfields and also featured Shaun Farrugia performing on Thursday. 
 Events are set to continue throughout the rest of the week with Vida Loca at Uno Malta on Friday, a BBC Radio 1 Live Broadcast at Uno Malta on Saturday and close with performances by Kungs and Danny Howard on Sunday night at Cafe Del Mar.

 The Malta Entertainment Industry and Arts Association is also proposing incentives for property owners who rent to creative organisations.
 The association said in a statement the creative sector in Malta is a critical driver of economic growth, social cohesion and cultural identity.
 ""While the government has made notable progress in improving cultural infrastructure, particularly through investments in public cultural organisations and programming, the current resource and budget allocation to public projects and institutions versus the sector at large creates an imbalance that seriously limits the creative's ecology full potential.
 ""This misalignment has led to significant gaps in funding distribution and necessary operational foundations, leaving Malta's private creative industries struggling to compete,"" the MEIA said.
 Despite their capacity to be key drivers of sustainable economic growth, the island's creative industries remained undervalued, underfunded and lacked a definitive long-term sustainable plan, the association said.
 Outdated perceptions about the sector's role in the modern economy and the disappropriate focus continued to constrain its growth potential, it added.
 ""By ensuring an equitable distribution of resources and fostering a more supportive ecosystem for both public and private initiatives to co-exist and collaborate, these proposals seek to promote long-term sustainability and unlock the economic and social potential of Malta's creative sectors.""

Detective work required to match royal portraits with their frames,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/detective-work-required-match-royal-portraits-frames.1096889,23-08-2024,004494.png,"It is hard to tell how many paintings and portraits in the national collection have been dismounted from their original frames only to be fitted to others with which they share no common history.
 Judging by recent evidence, historical anecdotes about misplaced or looted items are not hard to believe.
 Historically, in many instances, the culprits were members of the invading French army in 1798 or were 19th-century British governors, officials and their wives in equal measure.
 The French are known to have removed items from palaces and auberges to be sent to France while the British relocated pieces of art or tableware from one auberge to another.
 In other cases, the reason for the disappearance of certain artefacts is less ‘criminal’. Materials deteriorate over time, especially when, in the past, they were subjected to outdated conservation methods below the standards of modern scientific techniques.
 Invasions of wood-eating termites, for example, would cause wooden frames to slowly disintegrate, necessitating their replacement.
 Historical disruptions and past administrative oversights aside, the matter is well known in professional circles but was recently raised by Richard Cachia Caruana, an eagle-eyed visitor.
 He served as a personal assistant and head of secretariat for Prime Minister Eddie Fenech Adami and adviser to Prime Minister Lawrence Gonzi until 2012. He was also Malta’s first permanent representative to the EU.
 Cachia Caruana observed that the portrait of Grand Master Pinto at the Palace in Valletta hangs in a frame belonging to the portrait of Emperor Francis I (Francis Stephen).
 Another portrait depicting Grand Master Ximenes “is found ‘squatting’ in a frame belonging to Emperor Charles VI”.
 These are not isolated incidents; other paintings also hang in incorrect frames.
 Sandro Debono, former senior curator at the Palace, confirmed the complexities that mark the history of the national collection.
 Basing his arguments on his doctoral research, Debono confirmed that the issue is historic and dates back to the French and British periods.
 “Historical looting and relocation of items contributed to the current confusion which can only be addressed by a veritable piece of detective work,” he said.
 The issue is not whether Emperor Francis I would have anything to say about being misidentified as Grand Master Zondadari. Or whether Grand Master Pinto would complain about having his portrait mounted to a frame belonging to a portrait depicting the Holy Roman Emperor.
 Cachia Caruana argues that misaligned frames and portraits, originally diplomatic gifts with significant historical importance, offer a skewed representation of Malta’s rich history.
 “The art might not always have been the most original, but the political message [in their donation] was important. These works should not only be judged on their artistic merit but on their historical and political significance as well.”
 He stressed the need to contextualise these artworks properly. “Heritage Malta now has the resources to re-examine every painting in their collection, including those previously deemed unimportant.”
 Emmanuel Magro Conti, a senior curator at Heritage Malta, acknowledged the issue and detailed ongoing efforts to rectify it.
 Speaking to Times of Malta, Magro Conti explained that the national agency, responsible for conservation and cultural heritage since its establishment in 2002, inherited these problems from the former Department of Museums.
 “We have been aware of these mismatches for quite some time now and we are thoroughly analysing what we have in our collection as we seek to construct their histories,” he said.
 The correct identification of the Holy Roman Emperor Francis Stephen, in a portrait that was noted in past inventories to be that of Grand Master Pinto and eventually Zondadari, is a relatively recent development.
 “These attributions were revoked, and research based on symbols, crowns, decorations and facial features within the portrait was carried out. Analysis of coats of arms, initials and/or symbols was also carried out in the quest for correctly attributing paintings with their frames.”
 Magro Conti said Heritage Malta is aware of several other mismatches, including a pair of frames featuring portraits of Grand Masters de Rohan and Ximenes, the former sitting correctly while the latter mounted to a frame that should belong to a portrait of Carl Theodore of Bavaria.
 All the shifting of these portraits occurred over a century ago during the British period.
 “These frames have been identified because they bear intertwined letters such as EM, which stands for Emmanuel Maria de Rohan, or FS, which stands for Franz Stephan, the Holy Roman Emperor.
 “We seem to have two Carl Theodore frames and one painting. The other frame with the Grand Master Ximenes portrait features the same coat of arms as those on the more elaborate Carl Theodore of Bavaria and even the intertwined capital letters CT, not CF for Charles Francis VI.”
 Magro Conti emphasised the importance of making informed decisions based on solid research and meticulously painstaking work.
 “Misaligned paintings and mismatched frames are only the tip of the iceberg. Scattered crockery and items from various dinner and tea services, flatware, cutlery and incomplete pieces of suite furniture, can only be re-united through a proper use of old inventories and laborious hands-on work.
 “We appreciate receiving observations from the public. We will make the necessary corrections when the time is right and we have solid bases for these changes to take place,” he assured.

New film budget reduces funding per project,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/new-film-budget-reduces-funding-per-project.1096309,08-08-2024,004574.png,"The Arts Council’s new fund for indigenous films has an increased budget of €1 million but film-makers can now access less funding per project.
 The Screen Support Scheme, launched last month, replaces the Film Commission’s Creative Malta programme and shifts the indigenous film fund from the Tourism Ministry to the Culture Ministry.
 Despite the increase from the last official Creative Malta budget of €600,000 to the Screen Support Scheme’s €1 million, individual projects will receive less funding.
 Funding allocation per project has decreased in four categories: scriptwriting, development/pre-production, and production of feature and short films.
 For example, the maximum eligible budget for short films is now €20,000, compared to the €30,000 that had been allocated under Creative Malta.
 The maximum eligible budget to produce feature films has been reduced to €300,000, compared to the €380,000 awarded previously.
 While the number of projects eligible for funding has increased, some categories, like feature film production, still fall short.
 Film producer Oliver Mallia said: “Given the limited funding, a producer can apply for €300,000 from a total fund of €460,000. This means only one film can receive the full amount available.”
 The Screen Support Scheme includes five strands: screenwriting, development, short film production, feature-length production, and cultural programmes. The cultural programme strand is new, but the scheme lacks a strand for promoting and distributing local films, which was part of Creative Malta.
 While Mallia appreciated that the Arts Council listened to stakeholders before launching the scheme, he expressed his concerns about this omission.
 “Given the limited funds available, there is no support for distributing and circulating films,"" he said. ""This is a real blow to productions currently in post-production and looking at a release in the coming months.”
 He added: “You cannot perform miracles with a limited fund of €1 million. I never regarded this call as the answer to our issues; ACM has limited funds. What is important is what happens next; will it improve?”
 Arts Council Malta chairperson Albert Marshall previously called for the film fund to be tripled to €3 million for Maltese films to thrive alongside the foreign movie industry.
 Mallia believes the issue extends beyond funding and should focus on developing a comprehensive film policy covering all aspects from development to exhibition.
 He said it was incomprehensible that the ministry awarding funds to local filmmakers was not the ministry responsible for film.
 “All state aid support to cinema happens because of its cultural importance and not because of tourism, so maybe it’s time to revamp and move the Malta Film Commission under the correct ministry.”
 A spokesperson for Arts Council Malta said that the recommendations that came from the research consultation led to several changes in the funding block.
 ""The primary objective of these adjustments is to maximize the available funding and broaden the scope of beneficiaries who can be supported by the scheme,” they said.
 “Arts Council Malta has already gone on record stating that this is a first step and that the overall sum allocation needs to be increased in the coming years. As it always does with regards to the various funding programs it administers it will keep making necessary internal requests whenever it deems fit and justified as is in this case.”

'We played Ed-Sheeran for our first wedding dance and now we'll see him live',timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/we-played-edsheeran-first-wedding-dance-now-see-live.1094512,27-06-2024,004699.png,"Lucianne Spiteri Gonzi was among those who could not wait for Ed Sheeran's concert on Wednesday night. 
 Wearing a T-shirt featuring the artwork of the British singer's hit album ""X,"" she  told Times of Malta that the pop singer has a special place in her heart.
  ""We played one of his songs for the first dance at our wedding,"" she said, standing alongside her husband. 
 Spiteri Gonzi hopes to recreate those memories when and if the British star performs ""Thinking Out Loud"" for the Maltese crowd. 
 Further up a queue waiting for transport to the concert venue, 23-year-old Sherice Abela, who was with her sister-in-law, said she was looking forward to attending her first-ever big-name concert. 
 ""I'm really excited; it's great to have these sort of events in Malta,"" she said. 
 ""I'm not his number one fan, but I love his songs.""  
 Spiteri Gonzi and Abela were waiting for transport at the Addolorata parking area to take them and many others to the Ta' Qali venue.
 Cars were not being allowed near the venue to avoid congestion, and many fans opted for a €10 shuttle bus service. 
 At the Paola parking people gave their two cents on the concert's car-free concept. 
 ""It's not a really good idea, they told us to come here a 5.30pm....... It's a long time to wait before the concert, and it's hot,"" Claire Borg who was waiting alongside her family said. 
 ""It's a good idea to provide transport, but a €10 fee after paying €100 for the concert was a bit unnecessary,"" another concertgoer said. 
 As he walked to the bus with his girlfriend, Enrique Galea, said he backed the car-free concept, saying it would stop people from drinking and driving. 
 Many expressed concerns over logistical issues after the event organisers announced that no cars would be allowed to park or even enter anywhere near the concert. 
 Shuttle services across Malta left for Ta' Qali at 5.30 pm. At Addolorata, long lines had already started forming half an hour before departure time. 
 But people were quickly being put on buses, and by 5.35 pm, all the packed buses had departed for the concert. 
 Those opting to use cab services like Bolt, Uber and e-Cabs still had to walk for around 20 minutes before getting to the concert. 
 All three platforms said they expected demand to surge before and after the concert. 
 The three cab companies advised independent drivers and fleets that employ drivers to be available for Wednesday night. 
 ""We certainly are expecting a surge in demand during this event and are concerned that there are not enough mobility options to cater for the demand that we anticipate,"" a spokesperson for Uber said.
 As a result, cab prices are expected to be significantly higher than usual. 
 ""Our suggestion would be to try and plan your movements outside of peak time. Arrive a little earlier, leave a little earlier/later,"" the spokesperson said.

 Tourism Minister Clayton Bartolo provided the figure in response to a parliamentary question by Nationalist Party MP Julie Zahra.
 Bartolo said his ministry spent €100,000 on advertising and events linked to the event, while the Malta Tourism Authority spent €224,713.
 He said the funding was approved by the Finance Ministry.
 In June, the House was told that the biennale’s launch event - held in March at the National Museum of Arts in Valletta - cost €72,383 excluding VAT.
 The total budget allocated to the biennale was €1.7 million.
 The Maltabiennale.art was held between March and May and included the participation of 80 artists from 23 countries whose work ranged from painting and drawing to installation, sculpture, and video.
 The Maltabiennale.art received criticism from the arts industry lobby MEIA, which slammed a “lack of professionalism” behind the large-scale event.

Culture clash as Book Festival and Comic Con share date,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/culture-clash-book-festival-comic-con-share-date.1096505,08-09-2024,004914.png,"Book publishers and the head of the National Book Council say a date clash between two cultural events could impact the already struggling publishing industry.
 The Malta Book Festival is scheduled to take place at the MFCC, in Ta’ Qali from November 6 to 10 while Malta Comic Con will run over the weekend of November 9 and 10 at the Eden Arena, in St Julian’s.
 Merlin Publishers’ Chris Gruppetta said they did not have the manpower to attend both events.
 “My concern with the clash is that there’s a significant overlap in the people interested in books and comics, so the two events will cannibalise each other’s attendees,” Gruppetta told Times of Malta.
 “This year, the publishing industry is already in a crisis, so we are relying on book festival sales for a lift,” he added.
 He said, after a two-year hiatus, Merlin Library publishers will take part in the Book Festival and not Comic Con.
 National Book Council head Mark Camilleri described the clash as “unfortunate” and that the council had announced the dates of all its major events, including the Book festival, back in January
 “Both the Malta Book Festival and Malta Comic Con enjoy overlapping audiences while sharing common stakeholders,” he said.
 Publishers, booksellers and illustrators will have to juggle their time between these two large events.
 Camilleri explained that, by the time the Comic Con dates were made public, it was  too late to make any changes. The book council had contacted Comic Con organisers but efforts to resolve the issue were unsuccessful.
 “Malta Comic Con is a private entity and is fully within its rights to set its dates as it sees fit,” he said.
 “While we regret the clash this year, one hopes it can help draw attention to the importance of cooperation among cultural entities on the island, in a way that is mutually beneficial to all.”
 However, Wicked Comics, the organisers of Malta Comic Con, does not see the date overlap as a problem. Co-founder Fabio Agius believes people will be “delighted” to have multiple events to enjoy.
 While the clash was unfortunate, it was out of their control, he said. “These days, so many events are held in Malta it is virtually impossible not to clash with another,” Agius said.
 “Many people that attend the comic convention are interested in multiple scenes and will attend various events related to arts and culture. Experience has taught us that such clashes cannot be helped.”
 Agius pointed out that the Comic Con runs for two days while the Book Festival spans five days, giving people the opportunity to attend both.
 He said Wicked Comics had previously met with the Malta Book Festival organisers to discuss potential collaboration but the events were found to be logistically different.

 Magna Żmien will be organising a talk titled The Place We Knew Isn’t That Far Away on the project and will be sharing exclusive footage for the collection for the first time on Monday, June 24. The event is targeted towards current and former Sliema residents to share their memories, but everyone is welcome. 
  The Magna Żmien Foundation archive focuses on saving analogue Maltese memories primarily from private collections.  
 The collection includes portraits of women in swimsuits at Fond Għadir, groups of friends joking along the front and recordings from a wedding at the former Imperial Hotel. 
 Photos and recordings primarily date back to the 1950s and 1960s. 
 Their latest project, supported by the Arts Council Malta ICO Fund, is sourced from the large archive private collections owned by Paul Caruana.  
  Caruana donated his collection to Magna Żmien to keep his family’s memory alive. The footage in Caruana’s collection was created by his father, uncle and Joseph Darmanin, also known as Il-Gululu. 
  Il-Gululu was a former president of the Malta Photographic Society whose portraits of his friends in his hometown manage to create an idyllic snapshot of a bygone era. The focus on Sliema was spearheaded by the foundation’s artistic director, Andrew Alamango, who is from Sliema and feels a strong connection to his roots.  
 Kris Polidano, a researcher at Magna Żmien, said Sliema has always held a unique place in Maltese youth culture.  
 “For generations, Sliema has been the go-to town for young people to hang out. My grandparents met at Chalet, as did many other couples back in the day, and even when I was a bit younger Sliema was where my friends and I would meet.”   
  A key feature of the collection is the series of photographs focusing on the landscape of Sliema.  
 
 The footage depicts Sliema as a village with a pulse as opposed to the cosmopolitan, commercial town it has turned into over the last 30 years or so.  
 “Of course you see the landscape changing but the heart and soul of Sliema remain the same,” she said. 
 The free event will take place Monday, June 24 at 7pm at the Valletta Design Cluster in Valletta.

Bestselling mystery writer Anthony Horowitz is book festival’s special guest,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/anthony-horowitz-book-festival-special-guest.1094421,25-06-2024,005105.png,"Famed mystery writer Anthony Horowitz, the creator of teen spy Alex Rider, has been announced as the Malta Book Festival’s special guest, the Book Council announced on Tuesday. 
 Horowitz, who rose to prominence among young readers with his Alex Ryder books, has more recently taken to penning mystery and espionage stories for beloved characters James Bond and Sherlock Holmes.  
 The theme #bindingworlds has been chosen for the 2024 edition of the festival, with the aim being to highlight the power that literature has to bring together people from all walks of life. 
 Artwork by illustrator Ed Dingli has also been incorporated to highlight this theme, having created four different worlds of literary endeavour. 
 Born in 1955, Anthony Horowitz is a prolific British author whose work spans a variety of genres. Known among younger readers for his Alex Rider series of teen espionage novels, Horowitz was also notably licensed to produce fresh Sherlock Holmes and James Bond stories as blessed by the Conan Doyle and Ian Fleming estates, securing his position as an ever-dependable writer of high-quality and hi-octane entertainment with a global reach.
 More recently, his Hawthorne and Horowitz series — whose fifth book,  Close to Death, was released last April — takes a playfully meta-fictional stab at the murder mystery genre, with Horowitz writing himself into the stories as a John Watson-like presence to the titular Detective Hawthorne. 
 Horowitz is also no stranger to the world of audiovisual entertainment, both through adaptations of his literary work and his own screenwriting efforts. 
 The Alex Rider books have enjoyed both film and TV adaptations, while his 2016 novel, Magpie Murders, was made into an acclaimed BBC series starring Leslie Manville, whose six episodes were broadcast in 2023. 
 As a screenwriter, Horowitz was behind notable successes such as Midsomer Murders and the BAFTA-winning series  Foyle’s War.  
 Horowitz’s participation at the MBF 24 builds on a growing history of illustrious authors to grace the festival, with names like Salman Rushdie, Irvine Welsh, John Boyne, Naomi Klein, Joe Sacco and many others having participated at the event since its revamp from a fair to a festival in 2013. 
 
 “Needless to say, the National Book Council is excited to have an author like Anthony Horowitz headlining this year’s edition of the MBF,” National Book Council chairman Mark Camillieri said. 
 “While the Festival remains an integral part of the country’s cultural calendar and a proud reference point for the National Book Council’s work, we would be remiss if we rested on our laurels without striving to provide genuine added value for all of our visitors.”
 During the festival, Horowitz is expected to participate in several events, including a writing masterclass, a show for children and an interview with an academic. 
 The full programme of events for the 2024 Malta Book Festival (6–10 November) will be published in the coming weeks.

Malta's Eurovision entry Sarah Bonnici ready for battle ahead of semi-final,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/malta-eurovision-entry-sarah-bonnici-ready-battle-ahead-semifinal.1092074,21-06-2024,"005129.png,005130.png,005131.png,005132.png,005133.png","As Malta's entry for the Eurovision Song Contest, Sarah Bonnici, prepares to take to the stage on Thursday, she is well aware she faces a challenge to qualify for the final.
 While the bookmakers say the chances of the 25-year-old securing a spot in Saturday's showpiece are low, the singer is ready for battle. 
 ""I am doing all I can to deliver a great performance, one I can look back on and feel proud of and be satisfied,"" she said. 
 ""Despite it being very challenging and the reality of the odds, I am very happy to face this with great courage, as I have been working so hard. We (the team) have prepared for this for so long, and we are ready to give a great performance... the rest is not in our control.""
  With her energetic number, Loop, Bonnici aims to have viewers ""on the edge of their seats with excitement"" as she opens the second-semi final on Thursday night in Sweden's Malmö Arena.
 She hopes to land one of the 10 spots in Saturday's final that are up for grabs among the 16 countries competing. Spain, France and Italy automatically qualify.
  The last time Malta made it to the Eurovision final was in 2021 when Destiny Chukunyere sailed through the semi-final with her song  Je Me Casse. Since then, both Emma Muscat and The Busker failed to make it through. 
 According to the odds aggregator eurovisionworld, Bonnici is at the very bottom of the list of 37 countries competing in Eurovision. Bonnici has less than 1% chance of winning the competition, bookmakers say.
 The Gozitan singer is undaunted, however, and has been buoyed by meeting the other contestants since she arrived in Malmö last week and from taking part in two dress rehearsals.
 ""I have received a lot of positive feedback, especially after the rehearsals,"" she said.
 ""Following the second rehearsal, a 30-second snippet of my performance was aired and the reaction was amazing. I am looking forward and very prepared to hit the stage again on the night to open the show."" 
  It's hard to not be impressed watching Bonnici embody her song title by looping through the air blindfolded, as she is supported by her dancers, who are also blindfolded. It's also hard to believe that she is a shy character. 
 “My parents used to call me the ‘singer of the fireplace or the mirror’ because I never wanted to sing in front of the public as I was so shy,” she said. “I was dancing by the age of three, but singing only at home, as I was too shy to be on stage or with a group of other singers or dancers.”
  At the age of 10, she began to attend a choir group and the teacher, Miriam Christine Borg, encouraged her to start singing on an individual level. 
 As she attended more solo singing lessons, her confidence grew, and by the age of nine she started to contest in small Gozitan singing festivals, often leaving as the winner. 
 In 2009, at the age of 11, she competed in the Malta Junior Eurovision Song Contest for the first time with ‘The Mambo Song’. The following year, she had the opportunity to join Malta’s representative, Nicole Azzopardi, at the 2010 Junior Eurovision Song Contest, as a dancer. 
 While Sarah is over 2,000km away from Malta, her fans are kept up-to-date through her social media channels.
 But she doesn't find it easy. 
 “To be quite honest, I always struggled with social media, and I still do,” she said. 
 Describing it as her “biggest struggle” Sarah said she makes a great effort to have a strong online presence, and it shows. As the countdown to the semi-finals creeps up, Sarah posts videos and stories on her Instagram every day and opens up to her fans about how she feels about her performance. 
 “It’s not easy, I have to always be online, always post and be present, which stresses me out sometimes. And at the same time, I try not to read too much of the comments, as I believe certain people just write comments without thinking and I do not want to get influenced by certain hate comments.
 “Unless comments are constructive, and I can learn from them, those are important to me.”
  Reflecting on her experience at the Malta Eurovision Song Contest, Sarah said it took her a while to accept that she won the national competition. 
 “I was never one of the favourites, I knew that. I would say I was one of the top five, but not the favourite one to win. But when the music video came out, people started to message me,"" she recalls
 She believes she and her team offer something different to what previous contestants offered in previous years, and that her performance, full of lifts, stunts and singing, caught the attention of the public.
 Growing up, Sarah recalls how she started to sing and dance from “day one”, and it’s easy to understand why once she began to describe her family. 
 “My mum can sing and play the guitar, my dad plays the piano, my uncle plays the guitar and sings, and another uncle plays the bass,” she said. 
 “We are a super musical family,” she says with a smile, recalling fond memories of her and her cousins putting together shows for the family to enjoy. 
  She recalls how all her family supported her journey to become a singer, even when she decided to quit her job as an accountant to take on singing full-time, but one person’s role stood out from the rest. 
 “My grandma, she recently passed away, I think she was always my biggest inspiration, my number one fan and the person who pushed me the most,” she recalled of her grandmother, Georgia Zammit, who died in March.
 “I grew up with her, she raised me. I used to do everything with her, from sundried tomatoes, cooking, and visiting the elderly,” she recalled. “She was such a positive person. She always pushed me to never give up on my dream.”
 “I’m dedicating all this to her. The saddest thing about her passing is that she won’t see me in Malmö, but she saw me perform in Malta. She was the first person I called when I won, and she was so happy.”
 Ten countries qualified from the first semi-final on Tuesday. They are Serbia, Portugal, Slovenia, Ukraine, Lithuania, Finland, Cyprus, Croatia, Ireland and Luxembourg.

Clinton and Tamika win Love Island Malta Season 2,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/clinton-tamika-win-love-island-malta-season-2.1094709,07-01-2024,005400.png,"Clinton King and Tamika Ross were on Sunday crowned winners of the second season of Love Island Malta, walking away with a €20,000 prize.
 Following six weeks in the villa, full of gossip, drama, and couples falling in and out of relationships, the fate of the winners was left to the audience, with voting open between Friday and Sunday evening. A total of 45,000 votes were submitted.
 The finale, aired live on TVM, showcased the remaining four couples, Matthias Ablett and Henrika Galea, Ylenia Grech and Kyonne Gravina, Selwyn Grech and Miriam Muscat, and Clinton and Tamika.
 Shortly after the couple was announced as the winners, they were presented with two envelopes − one containing €20,000 and the other empty − they were asked to choose one at random.
  Tamika chose the envelope containing the cash and had the choice to keep the money to herself or split it with Clinton, which she did. 
 The couple won 48% of the public vote. 
 Clinton, 24, was one of the 10 original contestants who entered the villa six weeks ago while Tamika, 19, joined the villa earlier in June, during the “Casa Twist”, when the male contestants met a new group of Islanders, to test their loyalty and stir up the dynamics.
 Tamika had previously shared her struggles with mental health as a young teenager and her story of surviving a self-harm attempt.
  A day after the episode aired, the contestants began wearing green wristbands with the slogan ‘Mental Health Matters’ and carrying the national mental health helpline 1579.
 They wore the wristbands throughout the remainder of the series.
 Runners-up were couple Matthias and Henrika, followed by Ylenia and Kyonne in third place, and Selwyn and Miriam in fourth place.
 Love Island Malta, a local iteration of the UK-led reality franchise, follows single contestants, better known as “islanders”, as they competed for the prize money by coupling up and surviving public vote eliminations.
 During their stay, cameras and microphones all over the villa picked up everything the islanders said and did.
 As new contestants were brought in, others were eliminated if they failed to recouple or couple up with new contestants. 
 Love Island Malta has opened applications for the third season of the TV dating show to be broadcast in May 2025.

Award-winning play on Malta’s abortion ban comes home,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/awardwinning-play-malta-abortion-ban-comes-home.1098768,30-09-2024,"005257.png,005258.png","An award-winning and critically acclaimed play focusing on Malta’s strict abortion ban will be performed in Valletta next year.
 Written and performed by Davinia Hamilton and Marta Vella, the play, Blanket Ban, explores the stories of Maltese women impacted by the strict abortion laws.
 In 2022, the play, produced by Chalkline Theatre, won the UK Untapped Award and received critical acclaim at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, one of the largest arts festivals in Europe. 
 Now, the London-based Maltese actors are excited to perform the show at Spazju Kreattiv in March 2025.
 “This feels like a full-circle moment,” Vella said.
 “While we have been so fortunate to share this work about our home country with British audiences, it’s Maltese audiences that need to see the show the most.”
 For three years, the two artists spent countless hours conducting dozens of interviews with women who anonymously contributed their own experiences of abortion healthcare in Malta. 
 “We are honoured to give a voice to those women who trusted us with their stories and I already get emotional at the thought that some of them will be sitting anonymously in the audience, watching.”
 Hamilton said Blanket Ban opened up a space for people to talk about their own experiences with abortion without the fear of being judged or talked down to and hopes Malta will be no exception.
 “Because abortion is a highly politicised issue, especially in Malta, women’s voices often get drowned out in the noise,” Hamilton said. 
 Malta is the only EU state that prohibits abortion in all situations, except when a woman’s life is at risk and under strict conditions. 
 While the actors feel the amendment introduced only last year is a step in the right direction, it is not enough. 
 “I think that when people are moralising about abortion, women become dehumanised,” Hamilton said. 
 “They are not people, they’re ideological containers, cyphers in some hypothetical fantasy. But women are real, and they deserve political freedom, and they deserve the right to decide what happens to their bodies.”
 Hamilton said she hopes the Maltese audience who go to watch the show will be open to listening to the stories they present, in all their “messiness and humanity”.
 “Shutting a door to conversation isn’t productive or helpful,” she said.
  Vella explained how the script for Blanket Ban never reaches a final draft, but is revised as the situation about abortion rights in Malta and around the world constantly changes.
 Last year, Blanket Ban had a month-long run in May at the Southwark Playhouse in London.
 “For this version of the show, we updated the script to reflect the changes in the year since we had last performed it. Blanket Ban is a docu-play, meaning it changes whenever the situation does.”
 The duo describe winning the Untapped Award and performing sold-out shows as a “dream come true”.
 “The experience of making and performing Blanket Ban has taught me a lot, about my creative process, about collaboration and also about my activism,” Hamilton said.
 One thing she did not expect was the number of women who would speak to the duo after watching the play because they felt the need to share their stories. 
 “We held space for many people. Maltese audiences who travelled to watch us, Americans devastated in the wake of the reversal of Roe vs Wade, and British people who didn’t realise how precarious the situation was in their own country.
 ""This phenomenon confirmed to me how necessary it was to create this space where people could talk about their own experiences with abortion, somewhere they wouldn’t be judged or talked down to.”

These are the winners of the 2024 National Book Prize,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/these-winners-2024-national-book-prize.1098380,21-09-2024,005295.png,"Immanuel Mifsud took home the prize for best poetry when National Book Prizes for 2024 were doled out on Friday night.
 Mifsud’s Għażiż Ġismi, published by Klabb Kotba Maltin, beat titles by Maria Grech Ganado and Adrian Grima to the prize.
 It was a relatively quiet evening for Maltese fiction writers, with no nominees for best novel and prize assessors deciding not to award the best short story prize to either of the two nominated finalists, Trevor Zahra and Alfred Sant.
 There were no longlisted titles for the best drama prize.
 Adjudicators said they decided not to shortlist titles for best novel as the overall literary quality fell short of the expectations for a national award.
 No prize was awarded for the short story prize because both shortlisted titles fell short of the minimum score of 90 marks, they said.
 Warren Bartolo’s translation from the ancient Greek of Saffo, Il-Frammenti ta’ Saffo, won the prize for best translated work.
 Paul P. Borg won the prize for best literary non-fiction for his book shedding new light on poet Rużar Briffa, Fejjaqtni Int: Rużar Briffa – u Jien. 
 Judge, writer and Times of Malta contributor Giovanni Bonello won a lifetime achievement award, while Ryan Falzon was named the best emergent writer of the year.
 Winning titles were selected from a shortlist of 61 titles, published in the preceding year, across 12 competitive categories. In all, 49 books were shortlisted in the various prize categories, and 27 books for children and young adults were shortlisted in the six Terramaxka Prize categories.
 Adjudicators were full of praise for shortlisted contenders in Terramaxka categories, which focus on the best books for children and young adults.
 They praised the books for their engaging themes, contemporary illustrations, and the creative way authors and illustrators addressed new and important topics for young readers. The overall high standard of entries reflected the growing quality of children’s literature, they said.
 Claire Azzopardi’s Madame Ortensja Paskwalina De Rohan, illustrated by Moira Scicluna Zahra, won the prize for best original work for children up to age 7.
 Leanne Ellul’s Il-Każ tal-Kappell Ikkalibrat, illustrated by Marisa Attard, won the prize for children aged 8-12. 
 Claire Azzopardi was also a winner in the young adult literature category. She and co-author Glen Calleja took home the prize for  Iż-Żmien Kurjuż taż-Żgħożija. 
 Winners (see full list below) were announced at a ceremony held at the Maritime Museum in Vittoriosa.
 The National Book Prize is presented annually by the National Book Council (NBC), with winning titles chosen by an independent board of adjudicators.
 NBC executive chairperson Mark Camilleri emphasised the importance of collaboration between authors, editors, publishers, and the Council. He also announced the launch of a Foreign Rights Catalogue and the Malta Book Centre.
 Education Minister Clifton Grima emphasised the importance of literary excellence as a reflection of a nation’s intellectual development. He encouraged more Maltese writers to create works in the Maltese language, and commended the NBC for its work to promote Maltese literature both locally and internationally.

Sliema benches pay tribute to victims of domestic violence,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/sliema-benches-pay-tribute-victims-domestic-violence.1093099,28-05-2024,"005497.png,005498.png,005499.png,005500.png","Public benches along Sliema’s popular promenade have been transformed into eye-catching and colourful memorials dedicated to women who were killed.
 The promenade above Sliema’s Independence Garden is now home to 35 vibrant benches, each one unique in artistic expression and colours.
 Spray-painted in different shades of blue, one bench depicts a woman with flowers in her hair and holding a dove, with the words ‘Her light shines’ written on the side. Another, in different tones of red reads ‘Violence solves nothing’.
  Another bench has the words  ‘Their memory shines’ painted, along with images of cats, which could be interpreted as a tribute to murder victim Paulina Dembska, the Polish student and cat lover killed in the same area in 2022.
 The Memorial Benches – Faces of Resilience project is an initiative by the Eastern Regional Council, in collaboration with the Sliema local council and the Gender-Based Violence and Domestic Violence Commission.
 Fourteen artists left their mark on the benches along Tower Road, each with their style to raise awareness of domestic violence.
  Anthony Chircop, the president of the Eastern Regional Council, said the council holds the title of Region of Culture 2024 and the initiative is a significant part of this year’s cultural calendar.
 “We wanted to create awareness of the support and assistance available for those suffering from domestic violence,” Chircop told Times of Malta.
 That is when the idea came about to provide workshops, guided by artist James Micallef Grimaud, where artists and community members could come together to paint and prime the benches and create a space that inspires reflection and awareness.
  Micallef Grimaud said the project is not only a means to commemorate the lives of the women lost but also to spark conversations about violence and resilience in the community.
  The artists who participated are Jack Stewart, Kristina Znakina Andonova, Saima Murtaza, Yuexin Kong, Hun Sun, Andrea Farrugia, John Schembri, Jarek Nalewajk, Aurora
 Invonne Mario, Matas Statulevicius, Jackie Fritz, Marilouis Guy, Sophia Guy and Rhys John Meredith.
 They were selected through an open call for applications back in March.
 Small plaques with QR codes will be placed on the side of all the benches, providing information on support services available for domestic violence victims.
 Chircop admitted that, while he has received positive feedback on the initiative, he has heard comments questioning if such an initiative is necessary.
 “There have been some people who said we are exaggerating and highlighting something that is not as serious as we are making it to be,” he said.
 “People say these are only a few isolated cases. Even if so, that is one too many.”
 The Malta Women’s Lobby praised the Sliema council and the Eastern Regional Council for the impactful initiative to raise awareness about violence against women through art.
 It also encouraged other local councils and regional authorities to consider similar projects to raise awareness on such pressing issues.
 The initiative is also a soft launch to the upcoming Sliema Arts Festival, to be held between July 19 and 21.

'Oriġinali Bħali changed it all'- Hooligan on early days of Maltese rap,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/watch-originali-bhali-changed-everything-hooligan-early-days.1096840,20-08-2024,"005746.png,005747.png","Twenty years ago, Hooligan was among Malta’s best-known names.
 “After concerts, fans would crowd around my car trying to get a picture or an autograph. It was so crazy that our cars would often get damaged,” the man behind the moniker, Johnston Farrugia, reminisces.
 Known by many as Hooligan, Farrugia exploded to stardom in the early noughties with Malta’s first popular rap album in Maltese: Oriġinali Bħali.
 “Not many people thought rapping in Maltese would catch on and few people believed in me,” he said.
  Farrugia thinks the album was so successful because Maltese language rap was something new and original.
 “There were rappers in Malta but they sang in English,” he said.
 Hooligan released his debut album in February 2003 but his singles had already made such an impact that the Paceville venue holding the launch was too small to host all the people who turned up.
 “I ended up going outside after the performance and rapping with no microphone. I wanted to perform for everyone who had come for the concert but couldn’t get inside.”
 After another performance at the Farsons Beer Festival, Farrugia could not leave as fans had surrounded the backstage area.
  “They came backstage, threw away the barriers and I had to lock myself in a container and wait for the police to escort me out,” he recalled.
 “At least, I had beer flowing for the 20 minutes I waited.”
 Despite the chaos, Farrugia is grateful for that time.
 “Without fans, you are nothing. What can you do without them? Sing in the shower by yourself?”
 Hooligan’s name really took off after a guest performance in the Malta Eurovision Contest when he sang the album’s title track: Oriġinali Bħali.
  “After that, I started receiving non-stop calls from music shops to give them more CDs... they were selling like pastizzi,” Farrugia, who was 23 when the album came out, said.
 He said many thousands were officially sold but many pirated copies were also traded.
 “I used to get so many calls from the police station after they found pirated copies at village markets (monti),” Farrugia said.
  The album was among the most sold of 2003 and was number one in the music charts sourced by Exotique music store.
 “When I started, some artists used to laugh at the idea of rapping in Maltese but now they are doing exactly that,” Farrugia said.
 Twenty-one years later, there is a strong community of Maltese language rappers, with artists like Kapitlu 13, Owen Leuellen and  Il-Lapes among others, he said.
 Farrugia still performs but, if you go to see him, there will be one song you won’t hear. Oriġinali Bħali is the one song that he no longer performs.
 The lyrics about his bleached hair and baggy clothes no longer ring true.
 “I put everything that made me who I was into that song,” Farrugia said, but the track no longer describes who he is today.

  It began with high-octane energy as Sheeran belted out his first track Castle on the Hill. 
 After giving a lesson on his trademark loop pedal, he took the crowd on a whirlwind of hits from his Mathematics series of albums. 
  Describing himself as their “vocal coach”, the singer-songwriter got the crowd harmonising for anthems like Give Me Love. 
 In-between tracks he talked about his music career from turning up to pubs in England where “no-one cared” to “travelling the world”.
 Encouraging everyone to hold their phones aloft for his global hit A-Team, he confessed he thought the song that made him famous would be a one-hit wonder. 
 Involving the crowd in many of his songs, he also brought on his band for classics like Lego House and introduced violinist Alicia Enstrom for hit  Galway Girl.
 There was an emotional moment when he spoke of the death of his best friend in 2022. 
 “It only hit me when I put dirt on his grave that he was not coming home,"" he said before revealing the tragedy inspired his track Eyes Closed.
 One of the highlights was a medley of songs like River,  Beautiful People and  I Don’t Care on which he has famously collaborated with other stars. Another crowd pleaser was  Thinking Out Loud, which he introduced as “the song your grandmother knows”.
 The latter half of the concert was a lullaby of gentler songs like Happier, Photograph, Perfect and  Afterglow.
 
 Describing the country as a “lovely place”, he switched outfits to a Malta football shirt before the stomping Bad Habits encore.
 “It’s been a wonderful gig,” he said. The huge crowd no doubt agreed.
 The run-up to the concert was dominated by concerns about traffic and parking arrangements but there were no reports of any major complaints or mishaps before the concert at Ta' Qali.

No Panini stickers for the Euros at Anastasi... but there's an alternative,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/no-panini-stickers-euros-anastasi-alternative.1093877,14-06-2024,006501.png,"For the first time since the 1980s, football sticker collectors will not be able to buy Panini stickers for the European championships at Valletta's Anastasi store because UEFA has decided to partner with another company.
 Since the 1970s, Panini has produced sticker albums for popular international tournaments, making it a staple in football sticker collecting. However, this year’s Euros will see a change, as the American-owned competitor Topps has taken over as the official UEFA producer for the 2024 and 2028 Euros stickers.
 “They are an American brand and this is the Euros, after all, so I doubt whether Topps will succeed. Nonetheless, I wish them luck,” said Dominic Anastasi, the owner of the Anastasi Panini store, the sole distributor of Panini stickers in Malta since 1970.
 Anastasi remains confident that his store will not be affected by this decision by UEFA, citing two reasons.
 First, he said that the World Cup, for which Panini produces the stickers, is far more popular than the Euros.
 Second, sales for the Euros always dip after the schools close for the summer because children will have fewer opportunities to exchange them. Schools will close by the end of the month, while the Euros last until July 15.
 When asked if Anastasi would ever sell the Topps stickers and album, he said: “No. My store is called Panini, I can’t do that. After 54 years in business with them, it is a matter of respect.”
 Anastasi explained that Panini has launched a separate series of stickers and an accompanying album called World Class 2024. The collection features all eight nations that have won the FIFA World Cup: Brazil, Germany, Italy, Argentina, France, Uruguay, England and Spain.
 Panini still has the advantage of owning the rights of certain teams. As a result, Panini still retains the right to feature some big names, such as Marcus Rashford, Kylian Mbappé and Marc-André ter Stegen, who will not be featured in the Topps album.
 Malta’s distributor for Topps is Miller Distributions Malta.
 The price of the Panini sticker pack and the Topps sticker pack are both €1. Yet, the Panini album is €3.50 as opposed to the Topps album, which is €2.99. Panini’s World Class 2024 has 387 sticker slots, while Topps has 728 slots.
 Anastasi also noted that the decision has affected the tradition of exchanging stickers in front of his store.
 “This decision by UEFA broke the chain of people meeting in front of the store. Some still do but most people have gone online for this cup.”
 He wholeheartedly believes that, once the World Cup comes around, we can expect to see people trading stickers outside his store again, just as they have done for decades.

‘Dream’ or ‘insult’? Creatives respond to new culture hub,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/dream-insult-creatives-respond-new-culture-hub.1093097,21-06-2024,"007019.png,007020.png,007021.png,007022.png,007023.png,007024.png,007025.png,007026.png,007027.png","A recently announced multimillion-euro cultural hub in Marsa has been met with enthusiasm by the carnival community and mixed reactions by those in the arts community.
 Carnival’s artistic director called the planned hub a “dream” for carnival enthusiasts and said it would lead to even bigger carnivals in the future.
 But some of those Times of Malta spoke to were less flattering of the project, with one figure calling it “political propaganda”, an accusation flatly refuted by the head of the entity overseeing the project.
 Meanwhile, others from the dance, theatre and music world took a more measured approach, stressing that, while the project had potential, it was important to plan and manage it in the right way and not allow it to become politicised.
 The Planning Authority (PA) recently green-lit the development of a massive arts and culture hub in Marsa.
 The 77,200-square-metre project, spearheaded by Festivals Malta, is a revision of the ‘Malta Carnival Experience’ approved by the PA in 2016, now expanded to include facilities for dancers, musicians and other performing artists.
 In all, the project promises to deliver dance rehearsal studios, rehearsal space for 18 rock bands, a 914-seat outdoor theatre and a 380-indoor theatre, a performing arts museum, a 5D cinema, an audiovisual centre and a café in addition to 30 interactive workshops, 22 carnival float workshops and eight carnival costume workshops.
   Contacted about the development, carnival artistic director Jason Busuttil said the planned hub was a “dream” for carnival enthusiasts and would lead to bigger and better carnivals in the future.
 “Every party says in their manifesto there’ll be a carnival village – and now we’re going to have one,” he said.
 Stressing carnival associations had been “involved throughout” the process, Busuttil said the location of the site had been chosen due to its size and its proximity to Valletta.
 “Carnival is even bigger now than it was 10 years ago, so this will be suitable for all carnival companies,” he said, describing the reaction to the news from carnival enthusiasts as “great”.
 Asked if he was confident the project would go ahead after several failed attempts in the past, Busuttil seemed confident.
 “This project will happen for sure and carnival will be even bigger in the future.”
  Theatre director and Culture Venture founder Toni Attard said “any kind of infrastructure for the arts should be welcomed”, stressing space was now at a premium.
 Describing the hub as a “wonderful opportunity” and “definitely needed”, the director warned it was important to consult those in the industry when taking on such a large project, however, and not allow it to become politicised.
 “Everyone can benefit from this but we need to get industry players round the table and make sure these spaces are useful and available in a fair and equitable way,” he said, adding it was also important to think beyond the hub.
 “If inviting audiences there, we need transport infrastructure, for example,” he said, adding it was important to spell out whether the project was meant to benefit tourists or the local scene.
  Echoing Attard’s words, sociologist and metal musician Albert Bell said it was “important that people in the know be consulted”.
 “While we need architects to evaluate the building, we need musicians to give input on the rehearsal spaces and venues,” he said.
 Musician and Brikkuni frontman Mario Vella said he wasn’t convinced centralising rehearsal facilities in one hub was the best way of solving the issue.
   “I feel the best way of addressing this problem would be to create fully equipped rehearsal spaces dispersed around the island. Subsidised spaces that could be rented by the hour on any day by anyone,” he said.
 Emphasising the importance of such spaces being open to all, Vella warned that, should the authorities directly allocate spaces to specific artists, it could “risk turning the whole endeavour into an exercise in nepotism”.
  When contacted, the head of the country’s national dance company said it was important to find out how the promised dance facilities were going to be used and by whom.
 “The issue with cultural centres like this is they can be very ambiguous,” said ŻfinMalta artistic director Paolo Mangiola.
 “The first question is: who will use this? Are these dance studios designed to cultivate local talent? Will there be residency programmes,” he asked, stressing the importance of nurturing local dance artists.
 Commenting on so many artforms being under one roof, he said he was a “bit concerned” by the idea if done without a “clear vision”, emphasising “they all need their own space”.
 Asked if he had been consulted on the project, Mangiola said he hadn’t, adding he had “no idea what’s going on”.
  Meanwhile, theatre director and former Spazju Kreattiv boss Chris Gatt called the announcement of the new hub “a gimmick”.
 Slamming the announcement as “pre-election propaganda”, Gatt said “nobody knew about it” before it was announced.
 “It’s insulting to the artistic community; on the one hand, they say there’s no money [for the sector] and, then, they announce this,” he said, adding he was unconvinced by the project’s leadership.
 “What the hell are Festivals Malta doing managing this,” said Gatt, questioning the wisdom of placing an outdoor theatre close to an abattoir located nearby in the area.
  Responding to the concerns, Festivals Malta CEO Francis Agius downplayed fears of a lack of industry consultation, saying there “definitely” had been.
 “We had meetings with carnival associations and float builders, MEIA [Malta Entertainment Industry and Arts Association], musicians, dancers and Teatru Malta... naturally, some people felt left out,” he said.
 When contacted, MEIA president Maria Galea said the project had only been discussed briefly in a meeting with the authorities where other topics were also discussed.
 
 She said the MEIA stressed the need for “proper consultation” with the sector, adding none of the latest plans, presentations or strategy for the proposed hub were ever presented to the organisation or the creative community.
  Asked why Festivals Malta had assumed leadership of such a large infrastructure project, Agius replied that carnival, rock bands and dance companies now fell under the remit of the organisation.
 Quizzed on the appropriateness of the site chosen for the hub, he asked what was wrong with it, adding Festivals Malta had carried out studies showing how the project would enhance the area, including the old part of the nearby abattoir – which, he said, would be restored.
 Responding to accusations the announcement had been made for political gain, Agius called the idea “laughable”, stressing the application for the hub had been sent a month earlier and had been planned for around a year.
 “It’s not an election gimmick,” he said.

Ed Sheeran in Ta' Qali: A step by step traffic guide,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/ed-sheeran-ta-qali-a-step-step-traffic-guide.1094420,25-06-2024,"006858.png,006859.png","More than 35,000 fans are expected to watch the British pop icon Ed Sheeran at the Ta’Qali picnic area on Wednesday.
 Thousands are expected to fly to Malta for the concert to watch the multi-grammy artist, best known for major hits like Shape of You, and  Castle on The Hill, yet there has been backlash over the decision to ban  private cars and  public transport from entering the Ta’Qali venue, with organisers providing a subsidised €10 return bus service at seven shuttle pick-up points across Malta. 
 Still not sure how to get to the Ta’ Qali venue? 
 Here’s a step-by-step guide for how to get to the concert by any means of transport- whether private car, public bus or cycling. The information has been provided by organisers greatt and NnG promotions.
  The main entrance for Standing A, Standing B, Seated X and Seated Z ticket holders is from the MFCC North Gate, by the Ta’Qali outdoor gym.
 Yes. Those ticket holders have a separate entrance, which is located on the side facing the National Park and should have received guidance via email.
 Specific parking arrangements have been organised for these ticket holders. 
 On-site officials will assist attendees with reduced mobility for drop-offs and pick-ups close to the entrance. It is important to present your blue badge for drop-offs. Safe pick-up points for after the event are minutes away from the main entrance and attendees are asked to follow guidance from officials on site.
 Yes. The pick-up & drop-off point is just outside the main entrance. 
 It is the same point for fans who will be dropped off/ picked up by private group transport,  coaches or  cars.
 It’s important to note that private vehicles will not be allowed to enter the entrance area.
 For those who are brave enough to drive to the venue, it is important to note that several roads will be closed on the day.
 This is where the above map comes in handy.
 Coming from the direction of Mosta, Triq Buqana will be accessible, and cars can drive into  Triq Il-Kbira. From there, they can follow traffic signs to the road leading to the entrance. 
 The road facing the picnic area will be closed off to traffic and will only be open for pedestrian access.
 Cars may exit the area via Triq Buqana.
 Triq Hemsija and the side roads leading to Ta’Qali will be closed.
 Coming from Attard, drivers can access Triq Durumblat and along  Triq San Ġakbu.
 Triq Vjal L-Istadium Nazzjonali will also be open to traffic.
 Looking at the map, a visual ring road around the venue has been created to ease the flow of traffic.
 Yes, but parking is limited. Parking areas are located next to the dog park, on the side of the main entrance, and along Triq Vjal L-Istadium Nazzjonali.
 If fans do plan on travelling by car, organisers encourage carpooling or alternative transportation due to the heavy income and outgoing traffic envisaged in the area.
 The service is on a first-come, first-served basis and a ticket is required.
 The shuttle buses will depart from the pick-up points before the event at 5.30 pm and after the event at 11.45 pm and organisers urge fans to be at the pick-up points 10 minutes before the scheduled departure time. 
 The shuttle service point is located behind the Millennium Stand.
 It is going to be a busy night for cab drivers. 
 All 'Y' plate cars have a designated area at the farmer's market parking. 
 No other zones will be accepted for cab pick-ups and drop-offs.
 Yes, but public buses are being diverted away from the concert. 
 A Malta Public Transport spokesperson previously told Times of Malta: “Due to the traffic management measures in place for the Ed Sheeran concert at Ta’ Qali on June 26, buses are being diverted to pass through the Central Link and stop on bus stops ‘Qali 1’, ‘Qali 2’ and ‘Qali 3’ – about a 30-minute walk.”  
 Don’t want to use the shuttle bus and are worried about parking hassle?
 Cycling advocacy NGO Rota is organising a bicycle bus from Valletta to the Ta’ Qali concert. 
 A bicycle bus is when a group of people cycle together and is considered a safer way of experimenting with cycling on busy-traffic congested roads. 
 The group will be meeting at 5.30 pm near the Triton Fountain and ride through Ħamrun, Santa Venera, Birkirkara, Attard and Ta’ Qali.
 Rota has posted the expected times for those who wish to join them at different points.
  A return bicycle bus after the concert will also be organised.
 Social media was flooded with ticketholders expressing their irritation at the traffic situation.
 “Jesus it’s going to be a nightmare,” one individual commented on social media. 
 “I guess it’s a blessing we never win Eurovision.”
 Another called out the organisers' decision as “shameful”.
  “All about the money in their pocket. Is there anything organised for those who are not able to walk for a long way,” the person asked.
 Another furious ticket holder, Angela Rogers, shared her frustrations with Times of Malta, questioning why the public could not park their cars in the numerous parking spots found in Ta’Qali.
 Odette Vella, director of Information at the Consumer Office of the Malta Competition and Consumer Affairs Authority (MCCAA) said it has initiated discussions with organisers regarding the last-minute chances to access arrangements. 
 Vella was speaking on RTK103 on Wednesday.
 Speaking to Times of Malta on Tuesday, Tourism Minister Clayton Bartolo did not agree with the backlash.
 ""This could be a chance as a country to make a shift when it comes to our transport,"" Bartolo said on Tuesday. 
  He was speaking after a brief walk-around at the concert site with organisers. 
 ""If everyone complains about traffic, but then expects to arrive at the venue by car, I believe this is a chance how we as a country can work together and everyone is responsible.""
 He said previous events have had similar traffic management plans.

Finalists for the 2024 National Book Prize and Terramaxka Prize announced,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/finalists-for-the-2024-national-book-prize-terramaxka-prize-announced.1097298,27-08-2024,007022.png,"The National Book Council announced the 49 finalists for the 2024 National Book Prize and Terramaxka Prize Tuesday. 
 This is the 47th edition of the National Book Prize, the highest literary prize assigned to authors, editors, translators, publishers and illustrators of books published in Malta in 2023.
 There are 12 categories, ranging from the best short stories to historiographic research, to the best children’s literature works.
 This year, no novels were shortlisted for the National Book Prize and the council received no entries for the Drama category.
 The winners in each category of the National Book Prize and the Terramaxka Prize will be announced during an award-giving ceremony on 20 September 2024. 
 Winning books will enjoy an adequate period of promotion, and a suitable showcase at the upcoming edition of the Malta Book Festival 2024 on 6-10 November. 
 The finalists that made it to the shortlist have been unanimously selected by an independent panel of adjudicators according to a set of established criteria.
 Twenty-two books have been shortlisted across the six National Book Prize categories, and 27 books for children and young adults have been shortlisted in the six Terramaxka Prize categories.
 The titles were published by 10 different publishers and authored by 27 different authors and translators. 
 Nine different illustrators contributed with their illustrations in books shortlisted in the Terramaxka Prize categories. As per regulations, the adjudicators were asked to select a maximum of five entries for each shortlisted category. 
 The categories of the National Book Prize for adults are Novels, Short Stories, Poetry, Drama, Non-Fiction, Translation, Research and Historiographic Research.
 No novels were shortlisted for the National Book Prize and no entries were submitted in the Drama category.
 The six categories of the Terramaxka Prize are:
 Picture books for children (ages 0–7), Children’s Literature (ages 8–12) and Young Adult Literature, as well as Picture books translated into Maltese (ages 0-7), Children’s Literature translated into Maltese (ages 8-12), and Young Adult Literature in Maltese Translation. 
 The adjudication process for the 2024 National Book Prize was launched in February 2024 with the publication of the longlist. By 2 April 2024, publishers and authors had submitted a total of 173 longlisted and eligible books to be considered for the current edition of the National Book Prize.
 The adjudication panel for the National Book Prize decided not to shortlist any titles in the Novels category in this year’s competition.
 ""This choice reflects a commitment to maintaining the highest literary standards and ensuring that the integrity of the prize is preserved. The panel found that, while many submissions demonstrated thorough research, the overall literary quality fell short of the expectations for a national award,"" the statement read.
 The decision was made after careful deliberation, with the panel agreeing that the focus remains on raising the bar for what constitutes exceptional literary work in Malta. In light of their comments, the panel suggested exploring opportunities to support authors through initiatives such as masterclasses, which could help bridge the gap between popular writing and literary excellence.
 Adjudicators highlighted the quality of research books, spread out across a wide range of publishers and boasting diverse themes.
 The poetry category was strong enough to warrant lively debate among adjudicators ahead of the final selection — speaking to the variety of interesting voices among the shortlisted entries — while the translation category featured works with significant cultural relevance and impressive efforts in translation. In the Terramaxka categories, the shortlisted books stood out for their engaging illustrations and well-crafted narratives. 
 As per regulations, only one prize will be awarded per category, and prizes will only be given in categories where the shortlisted titles meet a high standard of literary, cultural, or academic merit, with a minimum score of 90 marks.
 The prize money awarded in each National Book Prize category, including the special prizes, is €4,000. The only exception is the prize money for the translation categories of the Terramaxka Prize, which is €2,000. The publisher of each winning book will also receive an additional prize of €1,000 per winning book. 
 All of the National Book Prize shortlisted books are available in local bookstores and online shops, and will be available at the upcoming 2024 Malta Book Festival (6–10 November) to be held at the Malta Fairs & Conventions Centre (MFCC), Ta’ Qali.

President's appeal to film sector: Be transparent and accountable to public,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/president-appeal-the-film-industry.1094720,07-01-2024,"007053.png,007054.png","The President has urged the Film Commission and the Film Commissioner to respect the principles of accountability and good governance in order to foster the public’s trust in their operations.
 Myriam Spiteri Debono made the appeal on Sunday during the second Mediterrane Film Festival. The first edition was dogged by claims of lavish spending and a lack of transparency over how taxpayer’s money was used.
 There was also harsh criticism in 2022 over spending on the Malta Film Awards where British comedian David Walliams was paid €120,000 to host the event. That figure only became known after a freedom of information request.
 
 ""To foster the public’s trust in its operations, the commission and the commissioner have to keep in mind and respect the principles of accountability and good governance,"" the president said.
 ""Accountability and good governance, not least transparency, have to inspire decision-making. These principles should be at the basis of all operations, year in year out.""
 Spiteri Debono observed that according to the Budget, Malta would be spending €39.8 million on the film industry this year. A total of €3m will be used for the upgrading of film facilities, and €35m for incentives.
 
 ""I emphasise that this is the people’s money. Accountability and transparency cannot be underestimated. These values, together with the diffusion of information, are the basis for fostering and nurturing the people’s trust in the film industry,"" she said.  
 Earlier, the President briefly went over the history of the film industry in Malta and said everyone agreed that the development of a stable and sustainable film sector was beneficial for the country.
 But several challenges needed to be overcome, one of the most essential was sustained promotion. 
 The sector needed to overcome the perception that filmmaking did not provide a year-long occupation. Promotion of the industry was also of primary importance if the film industry was to develop into one of the pillars of the Maltese economy.  
  The Mediterrane Film Festival, now in its second year, was therefore a business development tool. 
 The President noted that whereas in 2017 around 300 local workers used to work in the film industry sporadically, that number had since gone up to 1,000, most of them working throughout the year, from one production to the next.
 ""This is laudable, but one must always keep in mind that the film industry must necessarily operate within a framework which fosters the public’s trust in the industry,"" the president said.

"Love Islanders' boxing match cancelled as fighters, organisers blame each other",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/love-islanders-boxing-match-cancelled-last-minute-humiliating-demands.1101782,29-11-2024,007517.png,"Updated 5.40pm with Bulletproof statement
 A boxing match between ex-Love Islanders Dale Mallia and Kyonne Gravina has been cancelled at the last minute due to unresolved contractual issues.
 Mallia and Gravina, also known as Bello and Kuġin respectively, announced the cancellation on Friday, citing last-minute changes to their contract.
 The nature of those last-minute changes remains a matter of dispute. While the two fighters say organisers Bulletproof Culture wanted to introduce ""humiliating"" post-match conditions, organisers say the fighters made ""unrealistic"" and last-minute financial demands.  
  Gravina said that the last-minute changes would ""involve us doing humiliating things in front of the audience”.
 Among these were shaving their heads, live laser tattoo removal, and getting each other's names tattooed as a condition of losing.
 Mallia added: “Some of the things they wanted us to do in front of people are ridiculous”.
 The fighters accused Bulletproof Culture of exploiting them for content.
 “They used us just for content,” Mallia said, with Gravina adding: “Just for them to gain views"". 
 The dispute escalated on Thursday when the pair sought legal advice following repeated amendments to the match conditions.
 The pair said that after they signed an agreement to engage in a match, organisers failed to put their own signatures to the terms and then proceeded to introduce various changes “unilaterally”. 
 “We focused more on the training than the contract,” admitted the fighters, who on Thursday said they hoped the matter would be resolved before the fight. 
 They expressed regret for disappointing fans who had purchased tickets, many of whom have since asked about refunds. Others, however, commended the pair for standing their ground.
 Organisers, however, say the allegations being made by Gravina and Mallia are untrue. The real reason the fight was cancelled had to do with money, they said. 
 In a statement on Friday afternoon, organisers said: 
 ""All the allegations being made by Gravina and Mallia are rejected as completely unfounded and false.
 ""In particular, it is not correct that the agreement with Gravina and Mallia failed due to lack of commitment from Bulletproof Culture. Unfortunately, both Gravina and Mallia had financial expectations which were unrealistic and not feasible in the circumstances. This also taking into account the fact that interest generated by the potential involvement of the pair did not meet expectations.
  ""We have nonetheless engaged with the involved parties and their legal representatives to address the concerns raised in good faith. Both Gravina and Mallia significantly raised their demands at the last minute, and a decision was taken not to entertain such requests.
 ""The fight between Gravina and Mallia was going to be just an exhibition fight within the main event. Therefore this fight was negligible in the highly anticipated event which will feature various respected and professional athletes.
 ""Furthermore, in relation to the comments made on alleged humiliating acts, Bulletproof Culture categorically rejects any suggestion that it has engaged in any degrading behaviour. This runs counter to our core values of respect and integrity and we have so far endeavoured to give a platform to promising individuals. The comments made in this regard are therefore extremely defamatory and Bulletproof Culture shall be taking all the appropriate action to safeguard its rights.""
 The Love Islanders' fight was part of the so-called ""biggest fighting event on the island,"" set to take place on Friday evening at Ta’ Qali.
 Despite the cancellation of Mallia and Gravina's bout, the event will feature 10 other matches.
 A spokesperson for Bulletproof Culture told Times of Malta: “They had a golden opportunity, but they missed their chance”.
 They said the cancelled bout was ""negligible"" when compared to the full event. 
 Fans and ticket-holders are now awaiting further updates, including whether refunds will be issued for Mallia and Gravina's cancelled match.

Concertgoers look back in anger at ‘extortionate’ Gallagher bar prices,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/concertgoers-look-back-anger-extortionate-gallagher-bar-prices.1098507,25-09-2024,007608.png,"People at a Liam Gallagher concert on Sunday night were left with a bitter taste in their mouth, saying they were bled dry by the prices for drinks during the show by concert organisers.
 As Gallagher thrilled crowds at the newly unveiled Ta’ Qali concert area, the event’s bar prices left many wondering if it was worth the aggravation.
 As has become customary in many concerts and large events, the concert adopted a credit system, where attendees were asked to buy a wristband to act as a digital wallet throughout the event.
 The wristband could then be topped up and used to buy drinks, with a minimum top-up of €25 credit.
 But, despite the widespread praise for the show and the event’s organisation, several people have taken to social media to express their dismay at the price of the drinks on offer.
 A pint of Stella Artois on draft, reportedly Gallagher’s tipple of choice, set visitors back a staggering €11, with a half-pint going for €9.
 Heineken was €1 less, with the cheapest beer on offer, a small can of Bavaria, being sold at €6.
 The bar’s price list shows that other drinks were no cheaper. A glass of wine was priced at €8, spirits with mixers going for €9, and the more cosmopolitan gin and tequila drinkers dishing out as much as €14 for their drinks.
 Non-alcoholic drinks were somewhat cheaper, although still well above market prices at €5 for a soft drink and €3.50 for a small bottle of water.
 To rub salt into the wound, punters say, they were charged a €2.50 “activation fee” when topping up their wristband for the first time during the event, effectively leaving them with €22.50 credit.
 Moreover, the bar’s price list shows that they were to be charged an additional €1 for a “refundable” cup but organisers say that this additional charge was never actually implemented.
 Several concertgoers who spoke to Times of Malta expressed their dismay at this system, saying they were puzzled to find that they only had 50 cents credit left on their account, despite only having bought two drinks.
 Others took to social media, describing the prices as “extortionate” and “a joke”, accusing organisers of exploiting the captive audience to boost their earnings. Others described the system as “a racket”, and an example of “greed”.
 The organisers’ website says that this cashless system was adopted to cut down on queueing time and hassle (“Don’t look for money every time you want to buy something,” the website says).
 The organisers say that concertgoers should top up “at least” €100 on their first top-up, to have “more time to enjoy the event”.
 They also assure concertgoers that they can apply for a refund for any unspent funds, but only as long as they have at least €5 unspent credit in their account and apply for a payout by tomorrow.
 Speaking to Times of Malta a spokesperson for the concert’s organiser, 356entertainment, defended the bar’s pricing scheme, saying that this was necessary to make the event feasible.
 While bar prices were higher than average, the spokesperson admitted, this was offset by ticket prices which were kept deliberately low, at €60 a pop for Sunday’s concert.
 “This was an intimate four-day festival to a crowd of 5,000 people which involved massive expenses and considerable financial risk on our part,” the spokesperson said, pointing to how tickets for the Oasis reunion tour are selling for 10 times the price of last weekend’s concert.
 “We overcharge on drinks to put the money back into the highest possible quality production, not to pocket it,” the spokesperson said. “Our events follow the highest standards of quality and safety but this involves a big expense.”
  The spokesperson argued that the company had to choose between charging higher entry prices or higher prices for drinks to make ends meet, ultimately opting for the latter.
 “The drinks were priced above average but they were at typical concert prices. Pricing was agreed upon in conjunction with our international partners, and we also gave out free water at medical tents and at the front of house.”
 The spokesperson said that concertgoers could have avoided the €2.50 activation fee by carrying out their first top-up online, before the show, as explained in an information pack sent to anyone who bought a ticket.
 As for the €5 refund cutoff, the spokesperson argued that this was necessary to cover bank charges and administrative expenses.

"Broadway is coming to Malta, and its performers say they can't wait",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/broadway-coming-malta-performers-say-cant-wait.1096797,17-08-2024,"007619.png,007620.png,007621.png","For Broadway actors and singers Matthew James Thomas and Keri René Fuller, performing in Malta next month is more than just another gig. 
 “What we will be creating is something completely unique and it will be happening for the first time in Malta. I’m so excited for it,” said Thomas.
 He was speaking ahead of next month’s Defying Gravity concert at the Mediterranean Conference Centre, featuring a selection of music by Grammy, Academy and Tony award-winning composer Stephen Schwartz.
 It will be Schwartz’s debut appearance in the country and the first time his Broadway music has been arranged for orchestra and comes just two months before the release of a Hollywood adaptation of his award-winning musical Wicked.
 Thomas and Fuller will be joined onstage by local stars Joseph Calleja, Ira Losco and Destiny and fellow Broadway performer Michael McCorry Rose, accompanied by the Malta Philharmonic Orchestra.
 “For a minute, we didn’t think we’d be lucky enough to pull this off. Everybody’s schedules are crazy... they’re all superstars,” said Thomas.
 The British-born performer found early roles in cult films About a Boy and  Billy Elliot and is now based in New York full-time, where he starred in the 2013 Broadway revival of Schwartz’s  Pippin musical. 
 And while his career has taken him to venues across the world, the MCC offers something special: “Broadway is amazing but when you walk into that unbelievable, medieval-looking theatre you can feel it [the atmosphere] already... We’re so excited.”   
  Thomas’s relationship with Malta began a decade ago after his parents purchased a holiday home in Gozo, a choice that would pave the way for next month’s concert – the idea for which he came up with around five years ago.
 “I was waiting for an early morning flight and that’s when I decided I had to do something here... by that time, I had seen a lot of performances in Malta and had really got a sense for the intense amount of musical talent here. And it all just fell into place.”
 Stressing it was rare for Schwartz to make live appearances, he said the award-winning composer, arranger and lyricist had been enthusiastic about the idea of bringing his music to Malta, however. 
  “I sent a very impromptu email to Stephen asking if he wanted to do a concert in Malta and he emailed me back almost immediately saying yes,” he said, adding plans for the concert had to be put on hold after the outbreak of COVID-19 shortly afterwards, however. 
 And further challenges lay ahead. 
 “Finding the artists we thought would be great for the show, the availability of the MPO, raising money – and putting a lot of our own money into it to get it moving – finding the right venue and figuring out the right size audience for something like this... it’s difficult.”
 But he believes the difficulties will be worth it, stressing that, being able to hear Schwartz’s music performed live by a philharmonic orchestra, opens a “whole new world of opportunities”.
  Fellow performer Fuller added it had been a challenge deciding which repertoire to include in next month’s performance, stressing Schwartz’s catalogue includes “hit after hit... even this concert doesn’t include all of his amazing songs”.
 In addition to his more than five decades of work on Broadway productions, Schwartz has also penned music and lyrics for animated blockbusters The Prince of Egypt,  Enchanted,  The Hunchback of Notre Dame and  Pocahontas.
 Asked about working with the well-known Maltese performers taking part, Thomas called them “brilliant” and said the cast were having fun rehearsing together. 
 “Everyone’s got such a great sense of humour and they’re so enthusiastic and supportive…. they’re the best.”
 The pair also plan to run a series of masterclasses in September and believe the time is ripe with cultural activities seemingly on the rise in Malta. 
 Fuller said that while researching the local scene they discovered “so many music schools and dance studios, with more springing up”, stressing it was important to foster creativity in the next generation of performers. 
 Do the pair have any advice for young performers in Malta? 
 “Keep doing it [performing] as much as you can, everywhere and all the time... in front of your friends and family and even other places where you’re less comfortable,” said Thomas, while warning against relying on platforms like Instagram as the only place to perform. “It’s not the practice of being in a live space with an audience and acting hasn’t actually changed; your ability to communicate has to come through.”
 Last month, a leading Hollywood casting director told Times of Malta she was “not at all” aware of any Maltese films, something the two Broadway actors think should be addressed.
 Describing the award-winning Maltese film Luzzu as “amazing”, Thomas said it was a shame that audiences “don’t know Maltese stories”, stressing the country should “not just be a place for people to film because it looks like somewhere else”.
 “There’s so much history in this country and I just want to see more of it,” he said, adding the pair had seen some “unbelievable independent films... and most of them haven’t come from the [United] States”.
 Fuller agrees: “This is a culture that is deserving of being celebrated... there are very deep roots here but they could be tapped more.”

How the death of a friend spawned an artistic piece,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/how-death-friend-spawned-artistic-piece.1094359,29-06-2024,"007805.png,007806.png","When guitarist and artist Andrew Schembri passed away in June 2023, many of his close friends were left in a state of shock. His artist friend Evan Demicoli was shaken.
 After allowing himself time to take in the loss of his friend, Demicoli began a constructive grieving process that led him to create his debut artwork, Dmugħ.
 The artwork focuses on loss, love and hope, and takes an intimate look at parents who have lost their children.
 Dmugħ (tears) zooms in on the relationships of Isabelle Bonnici and her sons, both named Jean Paul, Catherine Schembri and her son Andrew, and Darrin Zammit Lupi and his daughter Rebecca.
 The artwork forms part of the exhibition Shifting Contexts held at Spazju Kreattiv, which is curated by Trevor Borg and explores the theme of water.
 Demicoli said the reason he titled the artwork Dmugħ was not only because of the theme of the exhibition but also because he was inspired to create the piece while he was crying.
 Demicoli and the guitarist knew each other since they were both children.
 “We grew up together in Żurrieq and began our creative processes together. When he passed away it was a huge shock to the system and I felt compelled to dig deeper within myself.”
 Demicoli said once he knew what he wanted to create he reached out to Schembri’s mother, Catherine. He knew he did not just want to focus on Andrew for the piece and wanted to make it a more holistic journey of loss.
  That triggered him to contact Isabelle Bonnici who he was already assisting in her fight for justice after her son Jean Paul Sofia was killed in a construction collapse. Finally, he reached out to Darrin Zammit Lupi, who lost his daughter Rebecca in January 2021, aged 15.
 The work invites the viewer to reflect on the past, the present and the future. The viewer engages with the past by means of portraits of Jean Paul, Andrew and Rebecca.
 The viewer is then encouraged to engage with the present by means of sitting and watching powerful and vulnerable video testimonies of the parents.
 In the emotionally charged videos, the parents share intimate details of how they remember their children as well as how they have managed to keep going since their children’s passing.
 With tears in his eyes, Zammit Lupi shares how, if given the chance to see his daughter again, he would give her “the most bone-crushing hug imaginable”.
 Bonnici opened up on why she still feels she is a mother even after both her sons passed away. And Schembri explains how every day she still feels and sees Andrew’s light.
 The artwork tackles the question of the future by means of a Tamarix bonsai tree. While other plants falter and wither in the presence of saltwater, the Tamarix stands resilient, distinguishing itself as a survivor.
 Zammit Lupi said: “I wanted to participate in this as a way to continue to share the story of my daughter.”
 The artwork forms part of the exhibition Shifting Contexts at Spazju Kreattiv which is showing until June 30. Entrance is free.

"Maltese film ‘Uwijja’ attracts over 37,000 online viewers",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/maltese-film-uwijja-attracts-37000-online-viewers.1096358,08-10-2024,007824.png,"The Maltese film Uwijja attracted 37,000 international viewers after it was made available on popular international streaming websites in the beginning of 2023.
 Uwijja follows the tale of John (Kim Camenzuli), who is balancing school, work and his social life, and touches upon the dangers of drink driving.
 Directed by Keith Albert Tedesco, the film was screened locally in 2022 and was made available on numerous streaming channels such as Amazon Prime, Canal VOD, iTunes, Google, iNDEMAND and Vudu. It was seen by 37,000 viewers between 2023 and this June. Available on GO, the film has also gained popularity among local viewers.
 It had an average of 20,000 views per month last year, plus an additional 6,000 views every time it was broadcast, which happened six times in 2023.
 “Having a quarter of a million people watch such a small film is a big deal to me,” Tedesco said.
 “Initially, I was surprised and I am relieved that a €20k film did well. The €20k went a long way and I didn’t have to break the bank or spend unnecessary and exuberant amounts of taxpayers’ money to do something for our film culture and society.”
 
 Uwijja will be screened at the Gozo Film Festival on August 24.
 Following Uwijja, Tedesco dived into his third production, a mini-series ‒  The Home Straight ‒ about a retired Maltese athlete with a club foot who comes out of retirement and, against all odds, becomes one of Europe’s top 400 sprinters. The script was inspired by the childhood experiences of the lead actress, Sarah Naudi, who grew up with a club foot.
  Tedesco had launched a crowdfunding campaign to start working on the new production, which is at the post-production stage.
 “The Home Straight has been a most eye-opening experience as I haven’t filmed in Malta for some time and the climate and attitude towards local film-making has changed for the worse,” he said. “It’s more expensive now and there is less heart.”
 He said he struggled to find cast and crew who were willing to make themselves available for filming or to retain crew, who would prefer to work for a big name studio instead.
 “It was a lot of begging and, in the end, I was heartbroken. Thank God, I was surrounded by a few film lovers like Fabrizio Fenech and Sarah Naudi, who helped me cross the finish line.”
 But the experience also had its positive moments. Tedesco had teamed up with Athletics Malta and had a few strong athletes feature in the film playing themselves.
 “It was humbling, amazing and rewarding to have such a dedicated representation of this side of Malta give their all for the film,” he said.
 “It was beyond amazing. Their lives and passions are something to be celebrated, and spending just a few days with them was enough for me to feel like I’ve come up on top, even if it was the most challenging project I’ve ever had to do.”

Winners of the 2024 National Book Prize announced - The Malta Independent ,independent,https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2024-09-21/local-news/Winners-of-the-2024-National-Book-Prize-announced-6736264287,21-09-2024,000036.png,"
                
        

         The winners of the 2024 National Book Prize - for books published in 2023 -  were announced on Friday evening during a private ceremony held at the Maritime Museum in Birgu. The National Book Prize is presented annually by the National Book Council, with winning titles chosen by an independent board of adjudicators in line with a rigorous selection process.
 In his opening address, the National Book Council (NBC) Executive Chairperson Mark Camilleri highlighted the achievements of Maltese literature in 2023 and the continued efforts to raise local publishing standards to international levels. He emphasised the importance of collaboration between authors, editors, publishers, and the Council in enhancing the quality of Maltese literature. Camilleri also announced ongoing initiatives, including the launch of a Foreign Rights Catalogue and the Malta Book Centre, while reaffirming the Council's commitment to fostering local talent and promoting Maltese books on the global stage. He concluded by congratulating the winners and finalists for their contributions to Maltese literature.  The Minister for Education, Sport, Youth, Research and Innovation Clifton Grima emphasized the importance of literary excellence as a reflection of a nation's intellectual development. He highlighted that strong literature is a product of thoughtful writing and contributes to the advancement of society. The Minister encouraged more Maltese writers to create works in the Maltese language, aiming to elevate the status of the national language through a rich literary tradition. He commended the efforts of the NBC in promoting Maltese literature both locally and internationally, emphasising their role in ensuring that the nation remains dedicated to books and the written word. Grima concluded by congratulating all finalists, with special recognition for the winners celebrated at the event.
 The winning titles were selected from a shortlist of 61 titles, published in the preceding year, across 12 competitive categories: 49 books have been shortlisted across six National Book Prize categories, and 27 books for children and young adults have been shortlisted in the six Terramaxka Prize categories. As per regulations, the adjudicators were asked to select a maximum of five entries for each shortlisted category.
 Additionally, while two finalists were shortlisted in the Short Stories in Maltese and English category, ultimately no prize was awarded for this category as both titles fell short of the minimum score of 90 marks.
 The Terramaxka Prize this year celebrated several children's books for their outstanding quality in both content and production. The adjudicators praised the books for their engaging themes, contemporary illustrations, and the creative way authors and illustrators addressed new and important topics for young readers. The winning titles stood out for their ability to capture the imagination of children, with visual storytelling that enhanced the reading experience and made complex subjects accessible to a younger audience. The overall high standard of entries reflected the growing quality of children's literature in these categories.
 Two special prizes were also bestowed during the ceremony. The prestigious Lifetime Achievement Award was conferred to Giovanni Bonello.
 The award for Best Emergent Author was given to Ryan Falzon.
 The National Book Council would like to thank the members of the adjudication board of the 2024 National Book Prize and Terramaxka: Ruth Ancilleri, Robert Attard, Nicole Bugeja, Roderick Mallia, Omar 'N' Shea, Maria Theuma, Mario Thomas Vassallo, Sherise Zammit and William Zammit.

Relief at PBS as CEO is shown the door,theshiftnews,https://theshiftnews.com/2024/09/14/relief-at-pbs-as-ceo-is-shown-the-door/,14-09-2024,000041.png,"Aqra 
 News of the departure of PBS Executive Chairman Mark Sammut was celebrated by staff at the state broadcaster, as they were informed he would not be returning to his office after his long summer break in Florida.
 Multiple PBS employees told The Shift that many took a short break to celebrate the ‘good news’ as soon as the first reports started appearing on social media.
 Describing Sammut as “a dictator”, worse than those who ran PBS at the time of Xandir Malta in the 80s, they recounted Sammut’s reign of insults and intimidation, which led to some 30 veteran and experienced employees leaving the station during the past two years.
 “I have never experienced such an arrogant man,” a veteran technician told The Shift, recounting how Sammut once called him “dog’s shit” in front of his colleagues.
 Others recounted how the chairman, handpicked by Prime Minister Robert Abela, ordered his employees to call him Mr Chairman.
 He treated women disrespectfully and sent several employees home, leaving them nothing to do but still paid fully through PBS funds.
 “We have never seen some of the employees in the past two years, as the chairman told them not to report to their office anymore. Yet they remained on the payroll,” a senior manager said.
 A former adviser to former EU Commissioner John Dalli, Mark Sammut switched to Labour as soon as disgraced former prime minister Joseph Muscat became prime minister.
 Through a number of direct orders, his private IT companies started to receive government contracts, particularly from the health ministry. At the same time, he was appointed to various boards, including Transport Malta.
 Soon after Robert Abela became prime minister, Castille selected Sammut to run PBS, even though he had never stepped inside a TV studio and had no experience in broadcasting.
 Meanwhile, the government significantly increased its subsidies to PBS, reaching some €6 million annually. Still, this was not enough.
 According to the latest published accounts for 2023, PBS declared a loss of some €40,000. The previous year, PBS recorded a loss of over €1.5 million.
 A financial controller recruited by Sammut to try to put things in order left after six months. Sammut promoted a DJ to act as a financial controller instead.
 According to employees, clashes between Sammut and senior staff members were the order of the day.
 One spiralled publicly. Sammut clashed with Norma Saliba, the head of news, and ordered her relocation outside the company. Saliba was given a new position with a financial package of over €73,000 annually at the Centre for the Maltese Language, which was essentially created for her.
 At the time, Robert Abela had sided with Sammut, dumping Saliba.
 PBS sources said Sammut’s end started during the electoral campaign for the MEP elections when several staunch labour employees began sending messages to the prime minister that they would not be voting, citing Sammut as the reason.
 Some even put their voting document on social media to drive the message home.
 The Office of the Prime Minister took the hint soon after Abela’s unexpected result at the polls.
 The Shift has been informed that Abela asked Culture Minister Owen Bonnici to find a new PBS CEO. Bonnici didn’t deliver.
 Last week, an OPM official contacted Sammut, telling him not to return to his office and that his contract would come to an abrupt end this month.
 Sammut received the OPM’s go-ahead to renew his contract for another three years as recently as last March.
 So far, it is not known whether Sammut will also be paid a golden handshake to leave without a new dispute.
 Minister Owen Bonnici confirmed that Sammut will no longer be at PBS and that a search for a new CEO is ongoing.
 In recent years, PBS has been reduced to a government propaganda station, with lucrative contracts paid to friendly producers and journalists.

 When reporting on the government’s new appointment of Joseph Cuschieri as the new CEO of Project Green, state broadcaster TVM omitted any details relating to the fact he was found guilty of breaching Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA) rules while leading it until 2020.
 Cuschieri was handed the new government role by Environment Minister Miriam Dalli. While PBS reported he was the previous CEO of the MFSA and the Malta Gaming Authority, they did not mention his forced resignation and the various scandals on his watch.
 The Shift was informed that instructions to omit this information were issued to the newsroom from the Office of the Prime Minister. The broadcaster stuck to the official government press release and put the story in the “other news” section of the site.
 Last December, The Shift revealed how Dalli, a close friend of Cuschieri, asked Abela to appoint him as CEO of Project Green as Steve Ellul was expected to resign to make way for his European elections bid on the Labour Party ticket.
 Initially, Abela resisted Dalli’s demands, arguing that Cuschieri was not an ideal candidate for the post due to his track record in regulatory roles and his association with Yorgen Fenech, the man accused of masterminding the assassination of Daphne Caruana Galizia.
 Abela reportedly changed his mind, fearing a backlash in the wake of support for disgraced former prime minister Joseph Muscat among Labour Party supporters.
 After several controversial years of leading the MGA and the MFSA with little respect for recruitment and  procurement rules, Cuschieri was forced to resign after he went on a trip to Las Vegas with Edwina Licari – one of his recruits at the MFSA – paid for by Yorgen Fenech.
 An independent inquiry by former Chief Justice Joe Azzopardi (now standards commissioner) and lawyer (now judge) Mark Simiana  found that Cuschieri breached a number of rules and ethics.
 Many stories on his conduct later came to light, including the tens of thousands of euros in sponsorships and self-promotion he dished out spent without authorisation and how he was asked to repay thousands in extra remuneration he self-authorised for attending board meetings, which he was not entitled to.
 Cuschieri was also found to have breached all rules in recruiting his friend Edwina Licari, putting her on a €120,000 permanent salary as a general consul while  touring the world with her on government business.
 Miriam Dalli’s special relationship with Cuschieri goes back many years when he gave her a job at communications company Vodafone (now Epic) when she was still a Labour TV reporter.
 Just a few months ago, Dalli also gave a job to Cuschieri’s 23-year-old daughter, Katrina as a consultant shortly after she graduated and returned to Malta from London.

13th edition of Valletta Baroque Festival launched - The Malta Independent ,independent,https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2024-11-14/local-news/13th-edition-of-Valletta-Baroque-Festival-launched-6736265723,14-11-2024,000060.png,"
                
        

         The 13th edition of the Valletta Baroque Festival has been launched and will be taking place between the 9th and 25th of January 2025, the Minister for National Heritage Owen Bonnici said on Thursday.
 Bonnici stated that the Valletta Baroque Festival is of great importance for the country, both because it helps to preserve and promote Maltese cultural and artistic heritage, as well as because it brings together artists of international calibre to exhibit their best talent in Malta. He continued that this festival gives new life to many historical Maltese sites, and creates an environment where music and architecture come together to offer a unique cultural experience for local and foreign audiences.   He added that through this festival, Festivals Malta is not only succeeding in the cultural field but also economically by attracting tourists to Malta in this season. He also thanked the workers of Festivals Malta for their commitment in the preparations for this edition of the festival.
  “The Valletta Baroque Festival is an important step for us to continue strengthening the international recognition of Malta as a destination of quality culture and art,” Bonnici commented.
 The Chairman of Festivals Malta, Aaron Zahra, said that Festivals Malta is fully committed to promoting the country’s cultural heritage while also providing a platform for local and international artists. He continued that the festival is a perfect example of this commitment, which he said allows the talent of the musicians to be shown along with the wonder places that are an integral part of Malta’s heritage.
 Festivals Malta CEO Frans Agius said that Festivals Malta is proud to see Maltese artists on the main stage of international festivals like the Valletta Baroque Festival. He said that this year, Maltese violinist Carmine Lauri will be at the festival together with the Malta Philharmonic Orchestra under the direction of Michael Laus. He added that there will be the participation of Charlie Siem, the Abos Project & Consort under the direction of Bruno Brocorpio. He said that there will also be the Valletta Baroque Ensemble under the direction of Steven Devine.
 The Ministry for National Heritage said that this year’s festival will have a spectacular range of presentations by distinguished artists and ensembles under the artistic direction of Kenneth Zammit Tabona, which it added will be taking place in some of Malta's most majestic venues. 
 Zammit Tabona said that the year 2025 marks the tricentenary of Alessandro Scarlatti's death and therefore the festival will open with his oratorio La Giuditta.

PL presidency: Alex vs Norma is Joseph vs Robert,theshiftnews,https://theshiftnews.com/2024/08/28/pl-presidency-alex-vs-norma-is-joseph-vs-robert/,28-08-2024,"000071.png,000072.png","Another critical test challenging Prime Minister Robert Abela’s hold on the Labour Party is emerging through the latest contest surrounding the party’s presidency.
 While historically, the role does not carry the weight of its nomenclature, occupied by the likes of Manuel Cuschieri and Ramona Attard during the past few years, the ‘battle’ for Labour’s delegates is considered by party insiders as another test for Abela’s popularity and hold over its rank and file.
 According to PL sources, Alex Sciberras, a Labour militant who stopped his activism when disgraced former leader Joseph Muscat was forced to resign, is a proxy for Muscat’s faction.
 On the other hand, Norma Saliba, until a few months ago the Head of PBS News, is Prime Minister Robert Abela’s choice.
 Insiders said that while Abela wanted and found a candidate to deflate Sciberras’s challenge, it is very unclear who the winner will be. While Sciberras is considered “superior quality” to Saliba, the latter has the leader’s full backing and endorsement.
 The son of the late Judge Philip Sciberras, himself a former MP in the Mintoff era, Alex Sciberras started his activism at a young age, inside Labour’s youth movement and later as an elected Labour mayor of Msida.
 Once Labour swept to power in 2013, Sciberras made the most out of his relationship with the then-newly elected prime minister, raking in tens of thousands from many jobs handed to him by the Muscat administration.
 Considered one of Muscat’s kitchen cabinet members, Alex was closest to the disgraced former Chief of Staff Keith Schembri and former minister Konrad Mizzi.
 Alex Sciberras was singled out by the NAO for his go-between role in the controversial multi-million sale of the former ITS land in St Julian’s, playing a role which, according to the investigation, lacked transparency and accountability.
 His proximity to Muscat, Schembri and Mizzi catapulted him into many well-remunerated roles.
 Among the directorships handed to him were those on the boards of Air Malta, Enemed, Petromal, Malta Aviation Services Ltd., and One Productions—the company responsible for Labour’s TV station.
 He was also a full-time advisor to Muscat, with an office at Castille. Projects Malta, the government agency involved in all the shady deals conducted by the Muscat administration, gave him other paid briefs.
 Following Muscat’s political demise, Sciberras put his weight behind Chris Fearne, which led to his eventual sidelining by Robert Abela.
 Still, apart from starting a new role as a senior partner at LRS, a firm specialising in selling Maltese citizenship and residency, he was kept on the gravy train through consultancy roles at the Health, Agriculture and EU Funds Ministries.
 Norma Saliba is Abela’s candidate in the upcoming contest and is considered a much lighter weight than Sciberras.
 The daughter of another veteran Labour stalwart, Mario Saliba, a Labour councillor and long-time sports journalist, Saliba has always maintained close connections within the Party, even when she was Head of News of the supposedly impartial public broadcasting.
 Her former marriage to Manuel Micallef, a GWU man and, at the time, Labour TV’s Head of News, pushed her into closer proximity with Labour insiders. She then  propelled herself to Head of News at the state broadcaster on Robert Abela’s direct instructions.
 However, after falling out with PBS Chairman Mark Sammut, Abela dropped her as her open war with the state broadcaster’s chairman became public.
 A position was then created for by Culture Minister Owen Bonnici making her Head of the National Centre for the Maltese Language, an agency that was created to give her the role.
 As compensation for her ousting from her senior PBS position, Saliba was given a financial package of €73,000.
 At the same time, Saliba was kept on the books of the state broadcaster as a fallback position.

 RTK103 has retained and consolidated its position as one of the top radio stations, with a significant increase in its audience, according to the latest survey commissioned by the Broadcasting Authority. The station practically doubled its audience when compared to the same survey released by the BA last summer. According to the survey, conducted by M. Fsadni and Associates on behalf of the Broadcasting Authority between 21 and 27 July, found that two-thirds of Maltese residents are radio listeners (66.5%), with this finding observed across all age cohorts. RTK103 retained its spot as the sixth most-followed radio station. Popular programme such as Għal Kulħadd with Christine Delicata and Andrew Azzopardi on 103 remained the most popular discussion shows during the week and on Saturdays respectively. Tkun ‘l haw Għaddi with Mark Azzopardi was also popular on Sunday mornings. Respondents said they mostly listened to the radio between 7am and 7.30am, ostensibly while stuck in traffic on the way to work. RTK103 was mentioned as the third most-preferred station for local news by those who said that their preferred source for obtaining news was the radio.  Meanwhile, Newsbook Malta has ranked as the fourth most preferred local news portal for audiovisual content, following Times of Malta, LovinMalta, and MaltaToday. It is also the second most preferred bilingual news site for local news after the national broadcaster, TVM. Television remained the preferred source for local news by 48% of all Maltese residents. 27% prefer online news portals as their preferred source for local news. Worthy of mention is that a 9% increase was registered on the previous audience survey in March 2024 where online new portals as the preferred source for local news stood at 18%. Interestingly, 16% prefer Facebook as their preferred source for local news.",Matthew Xuereb,Media

 A man was on Friday handed a suspended sentence after he rammed his car into a Magħtab residence gate on Wednesday.
 Michael Camilleri, 41, from Qormi was charged with wilful damage to third-party property, insults and threats beyond the limits of provocation, causing fear of violence, and negligent, reckless and dangerous driving. He was also charged with misuse of electronic equipment.
 Camilleri registered an admission to all the charges.
 The court warned him of the consequences of his guilty plea but the accused confirmed his admission.
 Prosecuting inspector Joseph Mallia told the court that police officers at the Naxxar police station were alerted to an incident on Triq St Klara on Wednesday evening.
 It transpired that the driver of a Mercedes car had rammed the vehicle into the gate of a farmhouse. Two shots rang out and the car backed away before more shots were fired.
 When asked by the court about the source of those shots, Mallia said that investigations were still ongoing but the shots ""were not fired by Camilleri"".
 Camilleri was arrested at 2am when he turned himself in at the Qormi police station. He cooperated all along, leading the police to the site at Baħar iċ-Ċagħaq where his black car was parked.
 The car bore visible gunshot damage: ""The front was riddled with gunshots,"" said the inspector.
 While Camilleri named two other people who were allegedly involved in the shooting, court was told investigations were still ongoing.
 Camilleri's arrest was not contested by his defence team, headed by lawyers Franco Debono and Jose' Herrera. 
 When making submissions on punishment, Herrera argued that although the incident appeared to be ""the greatest ever"" the charges were rather minimal and the damage was not excessive. 
 Debono stressed the importance of reform of the accused and restitution of damages. A suspended sentence would serve as deterrent too, he argued.
 Parte civile lawyer Magri pointed out that although the charges were minimal and the argument appeared to be a storm in a teacup, the incident was still fresh. A restraining order would be appropriate.
 After confirming his admission, the court condemned Camilleri to a one-year jail term suspended for three years, a €3,000 fine and a three-month driving ban.
 He was issued a restraining order not to approach the two men and three female relatives who were at the farmhouse at the time of the incident. He also had to reimburse €500 for the damage caused to their property.
 He was warned not to approach the alleged victims - two of whom, father and son - were also likely to face separate charges over the incident.
 Lawyers Jose Herrera, Franco Debono, Martina Herrera and Matthew Xuereb were defence counsel.
 Lawyers Arthur Azzopardi and Jacob Magri appeared parte civile.
 Inspector Joseph Mallia prosecuted.
 Magistrate Jean Paul Grech presided over the case.

Repubblika lashes Broadcasting Authority for its Lowell decision,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/repubblika-lashes-broadcasting-authority-lowell-decision.1097190,24-08-2024,003119.png,"The Broadcasting Authority “cannot be neutral when caught between fascism and democracy,” Repubblika said on Saturday as it condemned the regulator’s decision to fine RTK103.
 “Democracy should allow room for divergent perspectives, except for those like Norman Lowell’s, which do not respect others’ right to life,” Repubblika said.
 The rule of law NGO was reacting to controversy sparked by a BA decision fine RTK103 for not granting Lowell, a far-right firebrand who leads the Imperium Ewropa party, airtime.
 It was the second time that the BA fined the radio station over its refusal to give space to Lowell. RTK103 has said it will be appealing the decision, noting that Lowell was convicted of inciting racial hatred in 2013.
 The BA, on the other hand, has said that it is obliged to apply the law and that stations covering political issues and public policy must respect impartiality provisions.
 PEN Malta and the Institute of Maltese Journalists both criticised the BA decision, saying it was nonsensical.
 On Friday, the regulator hit back at critics.
 ""Those reporting and criticising did not read the law in the context of the decision and didn’t read the decision in its entirety,"" the regulator said.
  But Repubblika said it did not agree with the BA’s perspective.
 “Norman Lowell and his party promote anti-democratic politics based on hatred, robbing people of their human rights and the fascist fantasy of a “European empire”, the NGO said.
 “There should be no room for politics that destroy democracy,” it said, noting that as a constitutional body, the Broadcasting Authority was duty-bound to defend that law.
 “The Broadcasting Authority cannot remain neutral when caught between fascism and democracy, let alone fine those who are doing their job by refuting fascism,” it said.
 The NGO offered its solidarity to RTK103 radio host Andrew Azzopardi and his colleagues.

Freedom of information requests in Malta need ‘urgent reform’ - EU study,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/freedom-information-requests-malta-need-urgent-reform-eu-study.1094592,28-06-2024,003299.png,"Maltese authorities should process freedom of information requests (FOIs) quickly and transparently and be held accountable if they fail to do so, according to a Europe-wide study.
 In a report measuring the health of the media landscape in Europe, the authors said there was an “urgent” need to bring the way FOI requests are handled in Malta in line with international best practice.
 “Freedom of information requests need to be addressed in a timely and transparent manner – when authorities fail to do so, they should be held accountable,” says the Monitoring Media Pluralism in the Digital Era Report published by the Centre for Media Pluralism and Media Freedom.
 In April, the government refused a Times of Malta FOI request about an investigation into  alleged negligence at Mater Dei Hospital that left a baby needing a leg amputation abroad.
 And in March, Public Broadcasting Services (PBS) denied a request for a breakdown of the costs of the Malta Eurovision song contest, a year after the Malta Film Commission declined to release the cost of the Malta Film  Awards.
 Authorities have in the past refused to share information about migrant arrivals and a report confirming the state-owned energy company Enemalta knew it was paying triple the original price to buy shares in a  Montenegro wind farm project.
 “Access to information remains a pressing concern in Malta, and not only for government-critical media,” the report said.
 The difficulty in accessing information on matters of public interest, such as public spending, for the purposes of this report is a testament to the culture of secrecy and lack of transparency, it said.
 Rating the right to information in the country as being at “high risk”, the report said it was more at risk than last year, highlighting “the general tendency of the government to sideline and ignore critical media"".
 Citing a letter sent to Prime Minister Robert Abela last year where Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights Dunja Mijatović criticised Malta’s ""unwarranted secrecy within state institutions"", the report said authorities’ refusal to release information wasted journalists’ time by reducing the news value of the information.
 The Media Pluralism Monitor 2024 report also called for PBS to move out of state control and for party political broadcasters to “no longer enjoy the position whereby they get privileged access to information.”
 The introduction of “sanctions” for companies failing to submit audited accounts to the Malta Business Registry and enhanced independence of TV and radio regulator the Broadcast Authority were also called for.
 Social media 
 The European University Institute also flagged politicians’ use of social media, which they said made it “easy” for them to “sideline” journalists and the mainstream media.
 Noting that the government had a “leading position” as a buyer of advertising on Facebook, the report said the layout of social media content made it difficult for viewers to distinguish it from news content.
 Zoning in on Robert Abela’s use of social media, the report said his Facebook page frequently publishes sponsored posts from press conferences, edited to the politician’s liking,” the reach of which it said was ""further amplified by prolific pro-government groups.”
 It noted that mainstream media felt “compelled” to use platforms like Facebook because of their popularity in the country, “despite very limited and diminishing returns”.
 The report rated the viability of the media in Malta as being at “high risk” and riskier than last year, pointing to the use of social media as a major factor.
 Media improvements
 Calling the representation of minorities and gender equality in the media “dire”, the report highlighted “issues of gender imbalance, low visibility of minorities, and limited access to people with disabilities”.
 Rating the profession, its standards and protects as being at “medium risk”, the report noted that “many voices” in the industry called for more protections for independent journalism.
 It said “public warnings” should be issued to media organisations that fail to observe “fairness and transparency” about its choice of experts and how they represent minorities.
 Overall, the health of the media in Malta was rated as being at ""average risk"", with a score of 37% risk (a higher percentage denotes higher risk).
 Denmark scored the highest (13%) closely followed by Germany (16%), while Turkey came in bottom at 75% and was rated as being at ""high-risk"" in four out of the five main categories.

'Wake up and protect journalists': Maltese media urges PM on Press Freedom Day,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/wake-protect-journalists-maltese-media-urges-pm-press-freedom-day.1091856,21-06-2024,006327.png,"Journalists on Friday called on the government ""to wake up from its slumber"" and implement laws that protect the press.
 ""Stop procrastinating on the effective implementation of laws to protect journalists,"" the Institute of Maltese Journalists said on World Press Freedom Day.
 The government, the IĠM said, has sat on the promised media law reform for almost a year.
 ""It has been so long that the promised white paper has almost turned yellow,"" the institute said, adding that the new law must create an environment that allows journalists to carry out their duty and serve democracy - ""something the country desperately needs"".
 The IĠM said it found it ""baffling"" that the government continued to delay issuing the White Paper following the recommendations made by its own committee of experts to create stronger laws protecting journalists, including from abusive legal action, also known as SLAPPS.
 In October of last year, the government said it would issue a White Paper after the Prime Minister tabled the final report drawn up by a committee of media experts.
 That report had been concluded and handed to Robert Abela in July. It was drawn by an eight-person committee appointed by the government in 2022 to assess local laws and advise on how they could be improved.
 The setting up of a committee of experts was one of the recommendations made by a public inquiry into the murder of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, who was killed in 2017.
 The government's promise of a White Paper followed the controversial unveiling of three bills which it had said were based on the committee’s feedback it received from the committee in 2022.
 On Friday, the IĠM also said it looked like recognising the media as the fourth pillar of democracy will ""remain a dream, despite being one of the pledges in the Labour Party’s electoral manifesto"".
 Just last month, newly appointed president Myriam Spiteri Debono also warned that a lot still needs to be done in the implementation of the recommendations made by the public inquiry into the assassination of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, especially when it comes to  media reforms.
 
 ""I am particularly referring to those reforms concerning the media. I emphasise that the media, together with the three organs of the State, is the fourth pillar of democracy,"" she had said.
 The IĠM urged the government to ""stop procrastinating and recognise the media’s function as vital for a healthy democracy and entrench it in the enforceable parts of the country’s constitution"".
 In its statement, the IĠM also lambasted an ""inept Freedom of Information Act"" that was weak and ""severely abused"" by public authorities and warned that media outlets were facing ""considerable financial difficulties"".
 On its part, the IĠM is working towards setting up a media council that would strengthen the current self-regulatory structure.
 It is also in the final stages of being officially enrolled as the first-ever journalists’ trade union in Malta, giving it and its members a stronger legal standing.
 An AGM at the end of this month will conclude this process.
 ""On days like today, where the important role journalists play in healthy democracies is recognised, journalists must stand united in the face of adversity.
 ""In collaboration with civil society and democracy campaigners, the IĠM  will continue fighting for a stronger media landscape which will, in turn, lead to stronger journalism and a stronger democracy.""

Film commissioner’s cashback rules sideline local crews and spending,theshiftnews,https://theshiftnews.com/2023/08/26/film-commissioners-cashback-rules-sideline-local-crews-and-spending/,26-08-2023,"000248.png,000249.png","The Malta Film Commission’s 40% cash rebate scheme for film productions covers expenses that are in excess of funds already spent in our country, contrary to what Film Commissioner Johann Grech said in a video posted on social media on Friday.
 The official list of qualifying expenditures for the film rebate scheme includes cash back on air travel expenses, crews’ salaries irrespective of nationality, equipment, including that which is sourced outside of Malta, and other ancillary spending outside of Malta.
 The rebate’s rules have been recently expanded as part of an exercise to render Malta more attractive to large foreign film productions.
 In the video addressed to local film crew and film production companies, Grech said “insensitive” critics were “attacking the stability of the film industry” calling it “an attack on our country”.
 Last Sunday, The Times reported how €47 million of taxpayer funds have been committed to the  Gladiator sequel as part of the 40% cash rebate scheme. Freedom of Information requests from The Shift asking for cost breakdowns of the estimated expenditure were rejected by the Film Commission.
 The list of expenses qualifying for a rebate was expanded from last year. It now includes cast and crew salaries and expenses for crew members “irrespective of their nationality”, further disincentivising the employment of local professionals.
 The scheme also allows rebates on expenditure on local accommodation, which film industry sources told The Shift, “Are the only real and clear winners from the scheme.” It boosts occupancy at hotels and other tourist accommodation – the bread and butter of  Clayton Bartolo’s Tourism Ministry, of which the Film Commission forms part.
 Expenditure on air travel and equipment rentals and services from any European Economic Area or UK country are also eligible for rebates.
 Part of the eligibility criteria outlined for the rebate scheme is for foreign production companies to engage locally-registered production service companies to act as coordinators.
 Sources in the film industry have told The Shift that it is now common practice for foreign production companies to set up companies in Malta staffed by foreign personnel to fulfil the requirement of being a local service company – sidestepping any positive effects the scheme might have for locals.
 Examples include South African company DO Productions, which registered a subsidiary in Malta in November 2021. Its website praises updates to the rebate scheme, allowing third-country nationals to be employed as crew on productions. Previous iterations of the scheme limited eligible crew to European Economic Area and British citizens.
 Sources also highlighted an issue in which foreign production houses apply for funding under Creative Malta, a separate fund intended solely for local productions. Examples include British filmmaker Matt Hookings, who produced Prizefighter but has now set up Camelot Media Ltd in Malta since June 2022 and has been made a beneficiary of the scheme’s funds.
 The filmmakers who spoke to The Shift also raised questions about productions such as Gladiator 2’s entitlement to the full 40% of the cash rebate, given part of the rebate is contingent on the “maximisation of local resources” which the sources said is “incredibly difficult to pin down considering the multiple hundreds of crew working on these productions” and with qualification decisions being “non-transparent”.
 They insists that expansion of the film rebate scheme to its current form “favours foreign productions and crew”, in a “vanity exercise” for Grech that often ends up sidelining locals.
