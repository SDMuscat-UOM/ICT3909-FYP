Vitals' auditor acted as ‘professional money launderer’: Hospitals investigation,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/vitals-auditor-acted-professional-money-launderer-hospitals.1093060,27-05-2024,000206.png,"An auditor who gave a clean bill of health to Vitals Global Healthcare is suspected to have acted as a “professional money launderer”.
 Accountant and auditor Chris Spiteri is at the centre of a web of companies set up by “secret” Vitals owner Shaukat Ali and his family members.
 An investigation into the hospitals deal established that Spiteri facilitated the Alis in setting up several companies directly involved in the healthcare concession.
 
 Many of these companies are suspected to have subsequently been used to siphon off public money into private hands.
 Investigators concluded Spiteri was privy to the “relatively enormous value of funds and additional benefits extracted by the Ali family” from the deal. These included lucrative consultancy contracts, employment contracts, luxury cars, travel and IT supply deals.
 They further allege that Spiteri was complicit in helping key players like Ali conceal the extent of their interests in the hospitals deal.
 
 He also used his client account to be used as a funnel for suspicious transactions, including for a medical cannabis firm suspected to be linked to former OPM chief of staff Keith Schembri.
 Spiteri was also aware that Ali had been actively involved in business in Libya, and Ali’s second wife had acted as personal secretary to Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi, investigators said.
 Ali denies wrongdoing and has downplayed his Libya links to Times of Malta.
 Investigators further allege that Spiteri accepted a €50,000 bonus from Steward to audit Vitals’ accounts and give the company a clean bill of health.
 This was done to ensure a smooth takeover of Vitals by Steward. Investigators said the bonus was offered to him via Ali’s son Asad.
 The bonus was “secretly built-in” to Spiteri’s audit fee and spread across the audit engagement fees for five companies.
 
 In accepting the bonus, Spiteri “set aside his professional ethics” and undermined the validity of the audit.
 Spiteri is facing a raft of charges, including forming part of a criminal association with Schembri, ex-prime minister Joseph Muscat and ex-health minister Konrad Mizzi. 
 In May, Spiteri took to Facebook to protest his innocence.
 Spiteri said he has never even met the ex-prime minister “in person”, let alone facilitated trading in influence.
 Spiteri said during the course of his audits of Steward, “I have never known that any criminal association exists”.
 “No bribery or money laundering have also ever come to my knowledge during all this time. I have been accused of facilitating trading in influence for Joseph Muscat, Konrad Mizzi and Keith Schembri – the truth is that I have never even met these individuals in person, let alone facilitating anything,” Spiteri said.

No bail for man accused of setting fire to former partner’s car in dispute over access to child,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/129681/man_remanded_in_custody_after_setting_fire_to_his_former_partners_car_in_dispute_over_access_to_their_child,11-06-2024,000210.png,"The police have charged a man from Naxxar with arson, after he allegedly set fire to his ex-partner’s car in connection with a dispute over access to their child.
 Police inspectors Jeffrey Scicluna and Mario Xiberras, assisted by Prosecutor Joseph Camilleri Azarov from the Office of the Attorney General, charged 35-year-old John Joseph Debono with arson, criminal damage, offences against public order and littering in connection with the 3am fire that engulfed the vehicle in Sqaq il-Kubrit, Hamrun on June 6.
  Debono was also accused of driving without a licence and six other traffic offences, as well as aggravated harassment of the woman, causing her to fear he would be violent towards her, misuse of electronic telecommunications equipment and misuse of telecommunications equipment. He was also charged with breaching bail and recidivism.
 Inspector Xiberras testified that a warrant for Debono’s arrest had been issued following a joint investigation involving the district police and the Arson department. Debono, who was already known to the police, had been recognised from CCTV footage from the time and place where the car was set alight.
 The defendant, who said he works as an upholsterer, pleaded not guilty to the charges.
 Defence lawyer Roberto Spiteri requested bail, asking the inspector whether the injured party was in any way related to the man in the dock.
 There was, replied the inspector. The injured party had previously been in a relationship with Debono and was the mother of his child. The defendant had sent the woman an email in May, accusing her of withholding access to the child, ominously ending it “now we’ll see.”
 He had also sent multiple TikTok messages to the woman, continuing even after the arson attack.
 The defence lawyer suggested that the case against his client was based on documentary evidence, which had already been collected, but Xiberras pointed out that the victim and her father, the owner of the car, were yet to testify. He confirmed that there were no eyewitnesses.
 Camilleri Azarov pointed out that if the man were to be released from arrest, there was a risk of tampering with evidence and other offences being committed. He requested the court issue a protection order for the woman.
 The police had arrived at the defendant on the basis of footage and messages on social media which are already preserved. The risk that normally leads to bail being withheld - tampering with or destroying evidence - doesn’t apply in this case.
 The lawyer conceded that the man had a criminal record but said that it could not be used to prove intent, especially when his last conviction dated back years.
 He added that the defendant also had other children, a 13-year-old boy from another mother who had “completely abandoned her son.” “If bail is denied, the only parent taking care of him is going to be behind bars,” submitted the lawyer.
 Bail was, however, denied at this stage. The court upheld a request for a protection order in favour of the woman and her family.  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police
Man breached protection order by allegedly anonymously calling former partner’s phone to speak to son,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/129680/man_breached_protection_order_by_anonymously_calling_his_former_partners_phone_to_speak_to_son_,11-06-2024,000211.png,"A man was remanded in custody on Tuesday, accused of breaching a protection order by calling his estranged partner’s phone to speak to his infant son, only to be reported to the police after he used a mild derogative to refer to her.
 Inspector Christian Cauchi charged the 39-year-old builder from Birkirkara with misuse of electronic telecommunications equipment, exceeding the limits of provocation in insulting the woman, breaching a protection order imposed in April and recidivism.
  He told magistrate Yana Micallef Stafrace that the police Domestic Violence Unit received a report at 9:15pm on June 9, from the man’s ex-partner, who is also the mother of his child.
 The couple are in the midst of ongoing family court proceedings, in connection with which a protection order had been issued. 
 Inspector Cauchi explained that the defendant had tried to call the woman a number of times on Facebook messenger, writing that he wanted to speak to her about their son.
 When she failed to answer the calls and messages, the man had phoned her up, using an unknown phone number.
 When the woman answered the call and realised it was the defendant, she had handed the phone to her 3-year-old son, who put the call on loudspeaker. The man told the boy “Aw qalbi, ħsibta mhux ha twiegeb dik il-minfuħa ommok (Hi my love, I thought your pompous mother wasn’t going to pick up the phone),” the court was told.
 Lawyer Lennox Vella, assisting the man as defence counsel, pointed out to the court that his client had been speaking to his son, but the issue most troubling to the magistrate was that the phone belonged to the mother and that the call appeared to be a breach of the protection order.
  
 A not guilty plea was entered, and bail was requested. “There are ongoing proceedings before the Family Court,” explained the lawyer. “A father must be able to speak to his son and the existence of a protection order does not impede this. Family proceedings should not be used as a weapon.”
 The lawyer argued that when the woman had wanted to travel abroad, she had found no problem in leaving the boy with his father.
 But the court said the protection order was “very clear,” in that he cannot initiate communication with her.“Whatever the situation, it’s her discretion. No communication. Nothing, zero, zilch.”
 “How else can he speak to his three-year-old son?” asked the lawyer. The magistrate said that it was not clear at this stage who was baiting whom, but the law was clear on the matter on communication.
 Vella submitted that the defendant is a gainfully employed builder, with no substance or alcohol abuse problems and satisfied all the legal requirements for bail. “He has clients waiting for his work. We know what she is going to testify, that she heard him say “dik il-minfuha ommok.”
 “She reported him to the police for saying half a word, can you imagine what she’d do if he approached her? She’d go straight to the Domestic Violence Unit,” argued the lawyer.
 The prosecution pointed out that the man had a criminal record that was five pages long.
 The court denied bail at this stage.  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police

Bodycam footage of Ħamrun assault on police officers played in court,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/131602/bodycam_footage_of_amrun_assault_on_police_officers_played_in_court,07-10-2024,000221.png,"Five individuals, including two restaurant owners, returned to court on Monday, as their compilation of evidence over an assault on police officers during a brawl in Ħamrun continued before Magistrate Monica Vella.
 The accused, four men and one woman, all Maltese nationals, are all pleading not guilty to charges, which included assaulting the officers and causing bodily harm. They had been denied bail upon arraignment after concerns about evidence tampering were raised.
  The defendants accused were identified as 46-year-old restaurant owner Elton Anthony Borg, 44-year-old Kurt Borg, also a restaurant owner, both from Ħamrun; 42-year-old Erica Borg, a housewife from Msida; 23-year-old Redeimen Aquilina from Ħamrun; and 33-year-old Christian Mansueto from Siġġiewi. During their arraignment two weeks ago before Magistrate Joseph Gatt, all five defendants pleaded not guilty and requested bail, which was refused at that stagecontested by the prosecution.
 Inspector Elisia Scicluna testified during Monday’s hearing and recalled the entire ordeal as it unfolded. The defence lawyers kept challenging her, resulting in her testimony lasting more than three hours.
 The altercation began when two officers approached a group that included the accused while issuing parking fines on Triq il-Kbira, San Ġużepp, in Ħamrun. According to Inspector Scicluna, the defendants were ""agitated and arrogant"" when confronted by the police. 
 She testified that Elton Borg grabbed one of the officers by the hand, and when ordered to stop, he stepped on the officer’s foot. When police attempted to separate the individuals, both Kurt and Elton Borg resisted violently, prompting the officers to try to arrest them to control the situation.
 The situation escalated quickly as more individuals arrived at the scene, with the crowd becoming increasingly hostile towards the officers. Police used a taser and pepper spray to regain control while ordering the crowd to disperse.
 Defence lawyer Franco Debono questioned the validity of the arrest and the way the defendants were treated by the police. He argued that the accused had not been properly informed of their rights at the time of their arrest, suggesting a potential procedural irregularity. The defence also requested that the court declare the arrest illegal due to this alleged failure to respect the defendants' rights.
 Footage from a police bodycam was played presented in court, showing the initial altercation and the events that followed. During the cross-examination, Debono questioned the timing of the activation of the police bodycam and the language used by officers during the confrontation. At one point, the footage captured a police officer making a derogatory comment (“Kemm int avukat tajjeb ostja”) towards Elton Borg, with Debono arguing that such language could have escalated tensions unnecessarily.
 Despite defence objections, the court proceeded with the case, noting that evidence had been presented in accordance with legal procedures. The defence requested the court to investigate the officers' conduct further, especially regarding whether appropriate arrest procedures and behaviour standards were maintained.
 The prosecution stood by the validity of the arrests, arguing that, quoting Blackstone, all appropriate procedures had been followed. They stated that while the behaviour of certain individuals involved in law enforcement could be scrutinised, this did not justify the defendants’ violent response against the officers, as they stated that words or phrases can never justify violence as a response.
 The case is ongoing.
 Elton and Kurt Borg were assisted by lawyers Matthew Xuereb and Alex Scerri Herrera; Erica Borg, 42, was assisted by Arthur Azzopardi and Jacob Magri; Redeimen Aquilina was assisted by lawyer Mario Mifsud and Nicholas Mifsud; Christian Mansueto was assisted by lawyers Franco Debono and Charles Mercieca.

 Police inspectors Antonello Magri, Kurt Farrugia, and Keith Rizzo, assisted by prosecutor Brendan Hewer, arraigned 46-year-old Stephen Urry before magistrate Marseanne Farrugia on Wednesday.
  Inspector Farrugia told the court that while investigating a theft from a car in Paola, the police had obtained footage which showed the car being broken into.
 That footage had also been circulated by third parties on social media, he said. When a third party informed the police that a man wearing the same outfit as the person on the video was currently in Triq il-Gdida, Paola, officers had immediately gone to speak to him.
 The officers confirmed that the man, Urry, was indeed wearing the same clothes as the person in the footage and took him in for questioning. It emerged from the investigation that the same suspect had likely been involved in other aggravated thefts of wallets, keys, sunglasses, electronics, and cash over the past three months, in Paola, Fgura, and Tarxien.
 Urry, who told the court he was homeless, claimed to have been boarded out on mental health grounds when asked what he did for a living.
 He pleaded not guilty to four counts of aggravated theft and criminal damage, as well as a charge of recidivism and breaching bail.

 Swiss companies Accutor AG, Spring Healthcare Services AG and their legal representatives, Wasay Attaoul Bhatti, 39, Kamal Sharma, 38, Lujo Mikulicic, 39, Tyrone Robert Kirkwood Greenshields, Hamid Chaudry, Ahmed Ibtesam, were meant to be charged with aiding and abetting the bribery of former Prime Minister Joseph Muscat while he was in Office, as well as his Chief of Staff Keith Schembri and Minister Konrad Mizzi. 
  A number of other charges relating to money laundering, criminal conspiracy, and aiding and abetting Muscat, Mizzi, Schembri, Shaukat Ali, Asad Shaukat Ali, Wajid Shaukat Ali and Ram Tumuluri to commit the crime of trading in influence were also filed.
 Only Bhatti and the companies he represents: Accutor and Spring Healthcare Services appeared in court before magistrate Leonard Caurana today; however. 
 The prosecution explained that they had been unable to serve the summons on the other defendants. 
 Sri Ram Tumuluri was supposed to be amongst the defendants being charged today, but had also proved difficult to serve with a summons, the court was told. Similar explanations were given with regards to the absence of Tamal Sharma and Tyrone Greenshields 
 Sharma had been mentioned in the magisterial inquiry as having heard a third party say that Muscat was being paid millions every year for the concession of the three public hospitals to Vitals Global Healthcare.
 Bhatti, Accutor and Spring Healthcare entered not guilty pleas to the charges against them.
 The prosecutors alleged that Bhatti had helped facilitate the payments of bribes to Muscat, Mizzi and Schembri, and that he had assisted Shaukat Ali and Sri Ram Tumuluri in their negotiations.
 Prosecutors requested a €9 million freezing order over Bhatti’s assets.
 Italian businessman Giusepe Domizio Musarella, 59, was also arraigned in court today, accused of money laundering, fraud and making false declarations to a public authority. Prosecutors say he purchased a Cyclotron through Mtrace, a company that had just been set up, and which was subsequently sold to Vitals.
 Musarella pleaded not guilty, his lawyers arguing that he was a legitimate businessman who had been dragged into the sordid deal. Lawyers Shazoo Ghaznavi and Jessica Formosa assisted Wasay Attaoul Bhatti. Lawyer Veronique Dalli appeared for Musarella.

Massage therapist gives court harrowing account of her rape at the hands of a client,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/130999/massage_therapist_gives_court_harrowing_account_of_her_rape_at_the_hands_of_a_client,02-09-2024,000274.png,"A Thai massage therapist gave a court a harrowing account of her brutal sexual assault and rape at the hands of a male client, who hit her in the head and knocked her to the floor, before tying her up and raping her.
 Magistrate Kevan Azzopardi heard the testimony of one of three alleged victims of Harona Conateh, who was arraigned last month. 
  The 32-year-old Gambian man stands charged with three counts of rape, targeting employees at three different massage parlours in Sliema and Birkirkara in June and July. 
 The names of the alleged victims are being withheld from publication, in line with a court order to that effect.
 First to testify was a court expert who was appointed by the inquiring magistrate to download and analyse CCTV footage from several places.
 CCTV footage from some cameras in the area had already been overwritten, he said, but one of the cameras from which footage was successfully extracted, clearly shows a person entering the premises at 2:30pm June 22, wearing a bright coloured hat “that was probably yellow”, bermuda jeans and striped shirt. A person with the exact same outfit is then captured on camera leaving the premises at 2:40pm.
 Victim testifies
 One of the man’s three alleged victims, a Thai woman, testified on Monday, telling the court that a tall, black man had gone to the massage parlour where she had been working on 3 July and rang the doorbell.
 He was wearing a dark-coloured polo shirt with a print, a yellow beanie hat and bermuda shorts, she said, confirming that it had been the first time that she had seen the man.
 When she answered the door, he had asked whether he could have a massage. The witness had replied that she had another client appointment at 5:00pm and which only left had a 30 minute slot for him. “He spoke English with a strong accent and was using gestures to communicate,” said the witness. 
 Prosecutor Angele Vella asked the witness what services she had offered the man. “Massage,” replied the woman, adding that after she had handed him a brochure listing the various types of massage on offer after telling him the price. The man had pointed to a 90-minute massage, and it had to be explained to him that this was not possible as the masseuse only had half an hour. She said she could offer a 30-minute Thai back and shoulders massage with oil. “He said Ok. 30 minutes ok,”  and then handed over the amount in cash. 
 But things started to go south then, inside the massage room, the man had asked her to “massage his nipples”, she recalled. When she declined, he reacted violently, knocking her glasses off her head, grabbing her by the wrist and throwing her to the floor, where he then proceeded to sexually assault her with his hand, ignoring her screams, kicks and pleas for mercy.
 She said that the man had then tied her hands together with a rope. Realising that the man was too strong for her to resist, she said she had attempted to buy some time by telling him that if he untied her, she would give him what he wanted.
 The woman was untied and allowed to stand up for some air, before the man once again told her to touch his chest. She tried to change the subject, asking him about his family in the hope of eliciting a sympathetic response. 
 But the ruse didn’t work. The man suddenly pushed her face down on the ground and raped her, she said. When he was finished, he walked to the door, telling her, “next time don’t do this to me.”
 The court was told that the woman had suffered bruises and injuries to her ribs. A gynaecological examination confirmed that the woman had also suffered internal vaginal injuries.
 She said that she was suffering from depression as a result of the incident.
 The witness described her aggressor as wearing a dark t-shirt and a yellow hat, a description that matched the CCTV expert’s observations.
 The sitting was adjourned to 17 September at 2:00pm.

Association explains why wheelchair-using teen is not allowed on handball team,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/association-explains-wheelchairbound-teen-now-allowed-handball-team.1101648,27-11-2024,000351.png,"The Malta Handball Association insisted Wednesday that a wheelchair-bound teenager has been barred from playing for a local team because participation in such a full contact sport would put him in clear danger.
 The Association was replying to a judicial letter where the parents of 16-year old Thomas Mifsud last week claimed discrimination.
 Mifsud, an athlete with spina bifida, had started training at a handball club alongside his friends and sought a spot as reserve goalkeeper on the team. But he was subsequently informed that he could not be registered as a player in the league since he used a wheelchair.
 
 After bringing the matter to public attention, Thomas’s parents filed a judicial protest against the MHA and its committee members arguing that their son was being discriminated against and that his wheelchair did not pose any health or safety risks.
 His condition was well-accepted by his teammates, they said.
 The MHA rebutted the claims by the teen’s parents and insisted that handball was a “full contact sport” which exposed players to risk of injury.
 The rules of the game precluded and prohibited the use of any “hard objects,” during play precisely to reduce such risk of grievous injuries.
 Wheelchair use could trigger serious injuries not only for the wheelchair user but also for fellow players.
 The International Handball Federation, which laid down the rules of the sport on a global level, shared the same view, argued the MHA.
 A wheelchair was considered to be “a dangerous object” by the international regulatory body which had in fact observed that “using a wheelchair in indoor handball violates the IHF Regulations on Protective Equipment and Accessories and by association the IHF rules for indoor handball.”
 That meant that the parents’ claim that wheelchair use was permissible during the competitive sport was “totally incorrect,” said the MHA.
 Also contrary to what Mifsud’s parents claimed, there was close contact between outfield players and the goalkeeper during a match. That meant that a wheelchair-bound goalkeeper placed all other players at risk of injury.
 The association also noted that it recently got to know through media reports that the teen also had a medical condition known as “brittle bone disease.”
 Players with such a condition would be putting themselves in 'clear and manifest danger' were they to engage in full contact sport as they could be easily injured through a fall, contact with another player or even if hit by a ball.
 The association said such personal danger was “not acceptable” to it since it was responsible for athletes’ safety.
 The fact that this health issue had not been disclosed to the association further aggravated the problem, said the MHA.
 The association called upon the parents to desist from any further frivolous action, warning that they would be held responsible for damages if they persisted.
 Lawyers Stefano Filletti and Maurice Meli signed the judicial letter.

 Paul Borg, of Ħaż-Żebbuġ, was convicted by a jury of attempting to kill Mario Grech in 2020, and of causing him grievous bodily harm in an earlier incident which took place a year before.

 The jury reached an 8-1 vote on the charge of attempted murder and returned a guilty verdict on every charge other than that of causing wilful damage to third-party property.

 Sentencing will take place on Thursday following submissions by lawyers on the appropriate punishment to be handed down.

 During proceedings, the Court heard how, four years ago, the accused spotted Grech working on a property belonging to Grech’s son, and subsequently threw two brick tiles towards his direction.

 It was confirmed by expert testimony that the force of the impact would have killed Mario Grech had he not swiftly avoided the bricks.

Courts order suspension of industrial action at law courts,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/courts-order-suspension-industrial-action-law-courts.1101671,28-11-2024,000369.png,"Industrial action at the law courts was stopped - at least temporarily - on the strength of a warrant of prohibitory injunction that forced trade unions to cease directives. 
 The suspension was announced in a Facebook post issued by the Court Services Agency that runs the law courts.
 On Tuesday, several magistrates and judges had to postpone court sittings as court registrars, messengers and other staff did not carry out key tasks as part of industrial action.
 The industrial action left some judges and magistrates without a court registrar - the person who assists with several tasks, including the registration of sitting minutes. Court staff was also instructed not to record sittings.
  The industrial action was ordered by two trade unions that are fighting for recognition of staff at the law courts ahead of the lapse of the current collective agreement at the end of the year.
 The dispute revolves around a decision taken by the Department for Industrial and Employment Relations that informed the GWU that its request for representation cannot be upheld, as the deadline for such requests had lapsed.
 According to trade union law, recognition cannot be sought within three months before the elapse of a collective agreement.
 But Kevin Camilleri, GWU deputy general secretary, said that the union had first filed for recognition in October 2023.
 The directives the GWU ordered include not replacing employees on vacation or sick leave and prohibiting assistant registrars from sending replacements.
 The UĦM has issued similar instructions to its members.
 The Court Services Agency filed a request asking the court to issue a warrant or prohibitory injunction to stop the industrial action. The request was temporarily upheld.
 The unions have 10 days to reply and a final decision will be taken within 30 days.
 Meanwhile, Camilleri said the GWU reserved the right to take further legal action to ensure its rights – and those of the workers – were safeguarded.

 Anthony Attard, a 47-year-old Siggiewi resident, was escorted to court following police investigations which resulted in several arrests concerning suspects linked to false lease agreements enabling third-country nationals to acquire Maltese residence permits.
 Prosecuting inspector Karl Roberts explained how letterboxes were fixed to residences so that collection letters linked to those permits could be posted at those addresses.
 Information gathered in the course of the investigation led police to Attard who was targeted by an arrest warrant.
 On Thursday, he was charged with making false declarations in a public document for personal gains, document fraud, assisting third-country nationals to enter Malta in breach of immigration laws as well as false statements in breach of immigration laws.
 The accused pleaded guilty.
 He confirmed his admission after being warned by the court that he faced a possible jail term or fine.
 The hearing was temporarily suspended to allow the accused time to consult his lawyer.
 When making submissions on punishment the prosecution pointed out that the accused had cooperated. He acted as an accomplice when fixing letterboxes in Msida and Santa Venera.

Ex-MITA employee used personal E-ID to submit false documents for permit applications,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/130626/nepalese_man_reveals_4000_payment_for_fake_maltese_work_permit,07-08-2024,000389.png,"A man from Nepal has testified to having paid €4,000 in order to apply for a work permit in Malta on the basis of a fake employment contract that was allegedly forged by a former government IT agency employee.
 The compilation of evidence against Andre D’Amato from Mosta, an ICT professional and company director who was formerly employed by government IT agency MITA, continued before magistrate Leonard Caruana on Wednesday.  D’Amato is accused of human trafficking, money laundering, computer misuse, forgery of official documents, using forged documents, fraud, and making false declarations to public authorities.
  Between 2018 and May this year, when the crimes are alleged to have taken place, D’Amato had been employed by MITA.  He was appointed as Malta’s non-resident ambassador to Cuba last year.
 Testifying today was Magar Dil Bahadur from Nepal. He told the court that before travelling to Malta he had sent €4,000 to a Malta-resident Nepalese friend of his in order to obtain a Maltese work permit.
 The prosecution is claiming that the friend then passed the money on to D’Amato in order for him to apply for the work permit, apparently on behalf of his clients, amongst them a San Gwann-based company named KSL.
 But the director of the company cited as Bahadur’s employer on a contract that was submitted with the work permit application had testified in an earlier sitting, telling the court that he had never heard of Bahadur and that the contract  had been forged, together with his signature, on a letterhead featuring the company’s logo, which had apparently been downloaded from its official website.
 KSL’s director had smelled a rat when Bahadur, whom he had never seen before, appeared one day at the company offices asking him to sign a form to confirm a change in Bahadur’s employer.
 Bahadur told the court that when he had gone to the company’s offices, he was informed that KSL had not filed the original application for Bahadur’s work permit, and that the documents and signatures had been faked.
 KSL’s director had then filed a police report, informing the authorities that the application had been filed without the company’s knowledge, using forged documents.
 Police investigators found that the fake contracts had been submitted to the government agency Identita’ as part of Bahadur’s residence application. It had emerged during the investigation that the application had been filed online using D’Amato’s e-ID, the user’s identity having also been confirmed through 2-factor authentication.
 Bahadur confirmed in court that he had not worked for KSL, adding that when he had gone to the company’s office in San Gwann, he was told that the documents he was asking them to sign were not genuine.
 Cross-examined by Franco Debono, who is assisting D’Amato together with lawyer Alfred Abela, the witness said he had never met the accused and didn’t know him. “I just spoke over the phone once. When I went to KSL once, the police arrested me.”
 Abela made submissions on the prosecution’s request for a full download of the data on D’Amato’s electronic devices, arguing that he had objected to a full download at the first sitting. “If the charges relate to these particular people it is purely a fishing expedition to download everything,” said the lawyer.
 “In order to investigate or carry out a search on a person, I need to have reasonable suspicion. More so before downloading all this man’s data in the hope of maybe finding something. It is not in keeping with the spirit of the law.”
 Debono argued that there was “a lack of control over the environment in which the extractions are performed, how and where the extracted data is stored and so on.”
 Private conversations with third parties unrelated to this issue should not end up in evidence, argued the lawyer.
 The prosecution rebutted the argument, as the defence would have the opportunity to put these questions to the expert who performs the extractions on witness stand, but could not do so pre-emptively.
 Debono suggested that the IT experts involved “were not accredited” to do so and cited a case where the court had ordered that the entire extraction process be documented on video, but Inspector Roberts was having none of it.
 “In the past, it used to be the police’s Cybercrime Unit that would carry out extractions. After this practice was challenged, today that duty is carried out by court-appointed experts. Are we now saying that this is also wrong? We might as well stop carrying out extractions then.”
 Magistrate Leonard Caruana announced that he will issue a decree on the matter from chambers, before adjourning the case to September.

Birkirkara council in fresh legal action against 'eyesore' telecom cables,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/birkirkara-council-fresh-legal-action-eyesore-telecom-cables.1097275,27-08-2024,"000394.png,000395.png,000396.png","The Birkirkara local council has again sounded the alarm on the dangers posed by overhanging telecom cables despite its legal warnings last year. 
 In fresh filings, the council has said it is ""disillusioned"" by a lack of action from the authorities, despite it filing two judicial letters against Enemalta and Epic. 
 The issue revolves around the installation of overhead fibre optic cables in the locality by communications company Epic which are not only an eyesore but are also posing a danger to the public.
 Rather than invest in underground installation, as other service providers have done, Epic has been attaching these cables to electricity poles belonging to Enemalta, some of which are old and rusty.
  Cabinets housing cable-splitting devices are also affixed to the facades of private residences, triggering constant reports by residents about the inconvenience as well as damage caused to their property.
 The issue prompted the local council to take legal action.
 Last August, the council filed two judicial letters in court against Epic and Enemalta, calling for immediate remedial action to eliminate the danger by shifting its installation underground.
 
 The council reserved its right to seek further legal action whilst holding the service provider and Enemalta responsible for damages. All relative authorities, including the Energy Minister, were served notice of those judicial acts.  
 But one year down the line, the problem persists.
 This week, the local council filed a judicial protest in the First Hall, Civil Court against Epic and Enemalta, this time also roping in Malta Communications Authority.
 While overhead installation continues, concerned residents continue to lodge complaints at the council offices saying that contractors carrying out the works refuse to install the infrastructure underground.
 These contractors insist that they are bound by “strict and short timelines” and must carry out the works “as quickly as possible.”
  In May 2017, then-Prime Minister Joseph Muscat had announced a pilot project in Birkirkara aimed at removing the unsightly cables and investing instead in underground installation.
 That project never materialized.
 And the matter is not only one of aesthetics. Since cables are being attached to electricity poles which are old and rusty, the situation poses serious risks.
 The council listed various streets, including several located in the Old Church, Infetti and Fleur de Lys areas, where cables were attached to poles of dubious load-bearing capacity.
 The council did not know whether Enemalta and the relative ministry were carrying out inspections to determine whether such poles were sufficiently sound and secure to bear all that infrastructure.
 
 The competent and regulatory authorities have taken “no corrective and investigative action” in spite of the its legal warnings last year, said the “disillusioned” council.
 Its calls for necessary remedial works to avert any lurking danger and to invest in underground infrastructure appear to have gone unheeded.
 “Nothing has been done,” said the council repeating its warnings whilst holding Epic, Enemalta and MCA responsible for damages suffered by residents.
 The council also issued notification of the judicial protest to Energy Minister Miriam Dalli.
 Lawyer Richard Sladden signed the act.

 Ivorian national Mouhamadou Dosso, 32, who holds an Italian identity card, was escorted to court on Friday to face multiple terrorism-related charges.
 The man was arrested in the very early hours of Thursday morning following weeks of surveillance and analysis of intelligence surrounding the property on Triq Giovanni Barbara.
 The raid stemmed from information received by the police anti-terrorism unit. 
 Officers surrounded two adjacent properties where in the subsequent search they seized electronic devices. 
 Examination of those devices allegedly yielded data linked to the dissemination of extremist material. 
 Facebook Messenger chats involving the suspect appeared to indicate that Dosso was encouraging third parties to travel to France to carry out suicide bomb attacks. 
 Upon arraignment, he pleaded not guilty to various terrorist offences, including knowingly instigating terrorist acts and participating in an organisation to promote some political object by the use or display of physical force. 
 His legal aid lawyer, Victor Bugeja, did not request bail at the arraignment stage and the court, presided over by Magistrate Noel Bartolo, remanded the defendant in custody.

Maltese hacker’s extradition case reheard after legal amendment,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/132363/maltese_hackers_extradition_case_reheard_after_legal_amendment,19-11-2024,000416.png,"Daniel Meli, 27, has been remanded in custody after being charged with selling hacking tools and training criminals in their use, with US authorities seeking his extradition.

 After initially consenting to extradition, he had appealed, claiming he was not of sound mind. A newly amended law prompted a rehearing, which resulted in Meli being remanded in custody.

                     He was arrested in Malta on 7 February 2024 for allegedly selling and training criminals in the use of Warzone, a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) software that bypasses security systems and remotely accesses computers without the victims’ knowledge.

 In February 2022, Meli had sold a RAT for $180 in Bitcoin to an FBI online covert employee from Georgia. From then onwards, the FBI tracked his operations, one of several in a global anti-cybercrime investigation that spread as far as Australia.

 The charges Meli would face in the US are conspiracy, obtaining unauthorised access to protected computers to obtain information, illegally selling an interception device, and illegally advertising an interception device, each provide for a sentence of up to five years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of $250,000, or twice the gross gain or loss, whichever is greater. 

 The charge of causing unauthorised damage to protected computers provides for a sentence of up to 10 years in prison, three years of supervised release, and a fine of $250,000, or twice the gross gain or loss, whichever is greater.

 After a legal amendment approved unanimously by parliament allowing lawyers for Meli to appeal proceedings despite him first consenting to the extradition. Meli’s case  was to be reheard in the lower courts.

 On 19 November 2024, Lawyer Franco Debono, part of the defence counsel, stated that the accused has ties within the community, and referenced to accused’s mother and father who were present in Court. Debono dismissed fears over the tampering of evidence.

 The prosecution mentioned how the acts that the accused committed carry hefty penalties. At this state, the prosecution objected to the accused’s bail.

 Lawyer Arthur Azzopardi counter-argued disagreed with the prosecution, asking, “Where are the fears of the tampering of evidence?” He further mentioned the ties Meli has with the community.

 The Court, presided by Magistrate Leonard Caruana, declined the defence’s request for the release of Meli from his arrest, and thus Meli was remanded in custody.

Degiorgio brothers refuse to answer questions in case against Yorgen Fenech,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/degiorgio-brothers-refuse-answer-questions-case-yorgen-fenech.1092961,24-05-2024,000421.png,"George and Alfred Degiorgio on Friday refused to answer questions about Daphne Caruana Galizia’s murder, saying the questions came years too late.
 The self-admitted hitmen are serving 40-year jail sentences for having placed and detonated the bomb that killed the journalist in 2017. A third hitman,  Vince Muscat, is serving a 15-year sentence after turning state witness.
 Since they pleaded guilty in 2022, the Degiorgio brothers have unsuccessfully sought to  reverse that decision, saying they were forced to admit to the crime after  their lawyer quit the case weeks before it went to trial.
 When they appeared in court on Friday, they made it clear they would only answer questions about Fenech. 
 The Degiorgios were testifying in the compilation of evidence against Yorgen Fenech, who is alleged to have masterminded the assassination. He is pleading not guilty.
 George and then Alfred told the court they would only answer questions about Fenech, despite the court’s instructions for them to testify about Caruana Galizia’s murder more broadly.  
 At the end of an otherwise non-eventful court session, George Degiorgio angrily told the court that if the prosecution had been interested in the answers seven years ago, “that man [Yorgen Fenech] would likely not be here today!”
 His brother Alfred told the court that he could still incriminate himself if he answered questions about the murder, “because there are things which did not emerge in the investigation. And they can charge me with those matters related to this murder,” he said.
 Both men insisted they had never heard of Fenech before he was arraigned and charged with complicity in Caruana Galizia’s murder in late 2019.
 A pardon given to Melvin Theuma was “based on lies”, he said. But when asked to explain why, the witness would give no further information.
 Theuma has admitted to serving as the middleman between Fenech and the Degiorgio brothers.
 Alfred Degiorgio refused to answer prosecutors’ questions and the magistrate ended his testimony by decreeing that he was to be re-arrested and charged with disobeying a court order.
 His brother’s testimony went a similar way.
 George Degiorgio reacted angrily to questions by lead prosecutor Keith Arnaud, saying Arnaud – who served as the case’s lead investigator – should have asked him those questions years ago, under interrogation.
 “The inspector [Arnaud] was duty bound to put all these questions to me during my interrogation. But no! That interrogation lasted only a quarter of an hour,” Degiorgio ranted.
 “They [investigators] had no interest in knowing where the bomb came from. Nothing! Had they been interested, I think that that man would not be here today,” George said heatedly, gesturing towards Fenech in the dock.
 Magistrate Montebello warned the witness that he was to answer questions. He did not, and the magistrate subsequently ordered his re-arrest and arraignment within 48 hours.
 Meanwhile, Fenech’s case continues in June.
 AG lawyers Anthony Vella, Godwin Cini and Danika Vella prosecuted together with Assistant Commissioner Keith Arnaud and Inspector Kurt Zahra.
 Lawyers Charles Mercieca and Marion Camilleri were defence counsel.
 Lawyer Jason Azzopardi appeared parte civile.
 Within hours of the court's order, the two brothers were charged before the duty magistrate with refusing to testify. 
 Prosecuting inspector Wayne Camilleri gave a brief overview of the events leading up to the brothers' arraignment. 
 This was the second time they were facing identical charges over the murder case. 
 ""Only the date is different,"" said the prosecutor. 
 But the defence immediately pointed out that this time they were contesting the validity of the arrest. 
 The Degiorgios began to testify but the way the prosecution was putting questions could lead to self-incrimination. 
 ""The court itself pointed out that questions were leading or suggestive,"" said defence lawyer Noel Bianco. 
 Quoting the article of law allegedly breached, defence lawyer Leslie Cuschieri argued that the witnesses did begin to testify, unlike the previous occasion. 
 Moreover, how could they be re-arrested over the same charge when they were already previously charged, argued the lawyer. 
 However, after hearing submissions Magistrate Abigail Critien declared that the arrest was valid. 
 The accused pleaded not guilty and were remanded in custody.

"Almost 10,300 domestic violence charges issued in 31 months",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/almost-10300-domestic-violence-charges-issued-31-months.1097024,27-08-2024,000427.png,"The Police Gender-Based and Domestic Violence Unit issued close to 10,300 charges over the past 31 months, police commissioner Angelo Gafà told a joint session of the social affairs and family affairs parliamentary committees.
 The committees discussed domestic violence and the improvements that can be made to prevent femicides and crimes against women.
 Gafa’ said that reports filed by victims have been increasing year on year since 2020.  (2020: +24 per cent;  2021: +6 per cent;  2022: +5 per cent; 2023: +13 per cent)
 By the end of July 2024, reports had increased by another 12 per cent.
 Commissioner Gafà said that over the past seven months, 63 per cent of the domestic violence reports involved partners residing in the south of Malta.
 While in 2019, a quarter of the lodged reports involved psychological harm, over the past 18 months these had increased to three-fourths.
 Since changes to laws concerning domestic violence were enacted in 2023, 10 persons in intimate relationship have checked whether their partners have a history of domestic abuse.
 The right to check upon the history of partners, meant to safeguard potential victims, was introduced last year as parliament approved the Domestic Violence Prevention Bill.
 Gafà said that since its inception in October 2022, the GBDVU’s complement had increased by 200 per cent, from 20 to 60 police officers, all working on parallel shifts from the Santa Luċija hub and the Police Headquarters in Floriana.   
 Gafà said that these developments, including the application of a preliminary triage system to assess the risk for the victims, had reduced waiting time by half.
 He said that a domestic violence hub that was supposed to open in Mtarfa by the end of this year, is now set to open by June 2025.
 The joint-committee session was held eleven days after Nicolette Ghirxi became the latest femicide victim in Malta.
 While MPs were precluded from referring to specific high-profile domestic violence cases, police commissioner Gafà addressed criticism levelled at the force following Nicolette Ghirxi’s femicide.
 Ghirxi was stabbed to death by her former partner Edward Johnston.  The murder took place in the victim’s apartment in Swatar on Sunday 18th August.
 Later that night Johnston was shot by police following a three-hour standoff in St Julians after he pointed a weapon that later turned out to be a replica gun.
 Ghirxi had filed harassment reports in April 2024 after receiving messages from her former partner while he was abroad.  
 Johnston returned to Malta a few days before murdering his former partner.
 Gafà said that the Schengen system presents a number of challenges to law enforcement agencies because travellers can go in and out of member states at will with little chance of detection.
 The police commissioner called upon the judiciary to adopt a uniform approach and insist upon the victims to testify against their perpetrators.
 Gafà also confirmed that recordings of domestic violence incidents are admissable in court.During the joint-committee session, MPs raised issues mentioned by retired judge Geoffrey Valenzia into the femicide of Bernice Cassar.
 The inquiry had concluded that the state system failed Cassar because of a lack of resources and a heavy caseload.
 Police Commissioner Gafà said that the police corps had implemented 100 per cent of the recommendations in the Valenzia report bar the opening of the Mtarfa hub.
 On her part, Samantha Pace Gasan, Commissioner for Gender-Based Violence and Domestic Violence, said that 70 per cent of the recommendations have been implemented.
 Pace Gasan described risk assessments as a tool to prioritise victims that are considered high-risk.  
 While encouraging victims of domestic violence to take risk assessments, Pace Gasan said that women have a right to refuse it.
 This was mirrored in statements by FSWS CEO Alfred Grixti and his team who gave an overview of their work.  
 At the start of the session members of parliament observed a minute’s silence in honour of all femicide victims.

Jason Azzopardi guilty of libel over HSBC heist claims about Carmelo Abela,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/131466/jason_azzopardi_guilty_of_libel_over_hsbc_heist_claims_about_carmelo_abela,30-09-2024,000436.png,"Updated at 11:47am with judgment details
 A court ordered Lawyer Jason Azzopardi to pay €7,000 in libel damages over his Facebook statement about former minister Carmelo Abela, in which Azzopardi had accused Abela of providing assistance to the robbers who had carried out the 2010 HSBC heist.
  The court condemned the irresponsible way in which the defendant proceeded, stating that instead of reporting to the competent authorities and exercising the expected diligence before publishing a specific imputation of fact regarding the complicity of the plaintiff in a major crime, he published his opinion regarding why he believed he was right to come to that conclusion.
 Although the statements were made with a rhetorical tone, and the defendant did not use the express words that Carmelo Abela was guilty of complicity in the crime of the HSBC bank hold-up, the inference generated in a manifest way from the publication, when read in its entirety, and which was easily understood by the ordinary reader without any stretch of the imagination, was that the accomplice to whom the imputed statements referred was none other than Carmelo Abela.
 The euphemistic and suggestive tone used by Azzopardi in his statements did not reduce anything from the defamatory imputation that arose from the defendant's statements regarding the plaintiff's complicity in the hold-up crime.
 Contrary to what was submitted by the defendant in the submissions note, the fact that the plaintiff did not take legal steps of any kind against George Degiorgio and/or Alfred Degiorgio in connection with the public statements they made regarding the involvement of persons, including the plaintiff himself, in the crime of the hold-up, and the fact that he did not deny their statements, did not mean that the impugned publication was not defamatory and did not reduce in any way the inference of serious damage to his reputation, caused by the publication.
 This was also stated because, from the evidence before the court, it appeared that the statements made by the Degiorgio brothers, where the plaintiff was expressly mentioned by name, were made after the defendant's publication on 9 April 2021, which was the subject of this action.
 Above all, Azzopardi did not dispute that the impugned statements referred to the plaintiff and did not deny that the plaintiff was identified as the person who in the same publication was said to have been an accomplice in the hold-up crime by, among other things, providing the agent with means to be used in the commission of the crime. His defense was based almost exclusively on justifying his view that the plaintiff was involved in the said crime.
 It was the view of the court that the defendant failed to satisfy the requirement indicated in the Media and Defamation Act by failing to indicate, even in general, the basis of his statement that the plaintiff was the accomplice who helped the thieves in the commission of the crime by providing means, including fake keys, and was going to be compensated for this complicity. Consequently, the defense could not succeed.
 The court reaffirmed that the right to freedom of expression could never be interpreted as giving protection to those who publish imputations capable of, or effectively destroying, an individual's reputation without making sure that there was a concrete and objectively recoverable factual basis for those imputations. In conclusion, the court was of the opinion that it should liquidate the sum of seven thousand euros (€7,000) as moral damages.
 Azzopardi made the allegation in a Facebook status he posted, which was a reaction to disparaging comments made by Abela on Azzopardi over an ethics investigation concerning the minister.
 “I am no saint... but better not to have been an accomplice in the HSBC hold-up,” Azzopardi said.
 Azzopardi claimed that Abela was promised €300,000 from the loot, accusing Abela of having been an accomplice of the HSBC heist’s mastermind by passing on internal footage of the HSBC headquarters and assisting them in accessing the building. Abela denied the claims.
 Abela had repeatedly denied the allegations which were first mooted by Vincent Muscat “Il-Koħħu”, who had claimed that a sitting minister had been an accomplice in the hold up. He also claimed that Carmelo Abela and Chris Cardona had “given instructions in order for the heist at HSBC’s Head Office to go ahead.”
 Shortly after, Abela had filed the defamation lawsuit, demanding that Nationalist MP Jason Azzopardi answer for his claims.
 In reaction to the court verdict, Abela uploaded a snippet of the court judgement to Facebook, and said “justice was served today”.
  Prime Minister Robert Abela also reacted to the verdict, saying there is no room for mudslinging in Maltese society.  
  Meanwhile, Jason Azzopardi said that he will appeal the court verdict and is ready to take the case to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.
  “The truth is immutable and immanent. The whole truth must come out,” he wrote.
 Lawyer Pawlu Lia assisted Abela, while Azzopardi was represented by Lawyer Zammit Maempel. The case was presided over by Magistrate Rachel Montebello.  ",Jordan Pace ,court_and_police

 Steve Frendo, 36, was charged with aggravated theft and wilful damage to his parents’ property. 
 The prosecution explained that on Sunday, St Julian’s police received a report about a suspected robbery. They were told that someone had entered a Pembroke residence between 1pm and 7pm and €30,000 in cash went missing from a safe. 
 There appeared to be no signs of break in. Only the safe was broken into. 
 The alleged victims, the defendant’s parents, suspected their son, claiming that he had robbed them before.
 They also told police that he was currently jobless. 
 It resulted to the police that, Frendo had earlier called relatives to check if his parents were at home.
 Mobile location data and CCTV footage showed that Frendo was at Pembroke around the time of the robbery and he was seen leaving his parents’ residence on the footage.
 He was arrested at his partner’s residence in Gzira. A vest and shoes matching those on the CCTV were found during in the search. No cash was found, however, other than some €1000, possibly part of the stolen amount. 
 Frendo pleaded not guilty to aggravated theft and wilful damage to third party property. 
 His lawyers, Matthew Xuereb and Alex Scerri Herrera, requested bail and expressed doubts on the parents’ version of events. 
 Police Inspector Joseph Mercieca said that the money had apparently been handed to the defendant’s parents by his ex for safekeeping.  They were helping to raise his son and that money was meant for that purpose.
 The defence doubted the existence of those funds, arguing that the third party who stepped in between the defendant and his parents, may have “inflated the amount.” 
 Magistrate Leonard Caruana, turned down the request for bail since the main civilian witnesses are still to testify.
 The court deemed that the defendant could not offer the necessary guarantees in terms of law.

"PM cancelled Dubai visit when tipped off about Joseph Muscat residence raid, Azzopardi tells court",maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/131659/pm_cancelled_dubai_visit_when_tipped_off_about_joseph_muscat_residence_raid_azzopardi_tells_court__,09-10-2024,000488.png,"Prime Minister Robert Abela had cancelled his attendance at an expo in Dubai in January 2022 and flown back to Malta after being tipped off about the police’s plans to raid Joseph Muscat’s house.
 This claim was made from the witness stand by lawyer Jason Azzopardi, who was testifying in the constitutional case filed by Joseph Muscat against the State Advocate and the Attorney General, in which he is claiming breaches to a number of his fundamental human rights. Azzopardi was the lawyer who had signed, on behalf of Repubblika, the application which triggered the magisterial inquiry.
  Azzopardi also strongly rejected the allegation that he had tipped off Muscat about the plans to raid his house and offices, at the order of the inquiring magistrate.
 Press tipped off on Muscat raid by OPM – Jason Azzopardi
 The witness went on to say that it was the press who had been unofficially tipped off by the Office of the Prime Minister.
 He backed up the first claim by pointing to the fact that Abela had, in fact, returned to Malta from Strasbourg immediately that day, instead of travelling onwards to an event in Dubai as planned, he said. “This is all in the public domain,” Azzopardi added.
 “It was an outrageous lie for them to say that I had leaked the information about the searches in advance, because you’d have to be a simpleton to believe that… Robert Abela, the Prime Minister, lied to the public to incite anger against me,” said the witness. “I know that Robert Abela was aware and was made aware in advance of the date that Muscat’s house would be searched. A person had come to speak to me at my office, very worried, because the Commissioner of Police had told him so.”
 “I did not tell anyone about this, not even Repubblika or [Robert] Aquilina. I contacted [the court expert] because I did not have any means through which to contact the magistrate. I never spoke to her, for obvious reasons. But such a leak could not be allowed,” he said.
 Vince Galea interrupted, telling the court that the witness was supposed to answer questions. “What is he doing then?” replied the judge, initially overruling Galea’s objection.
 But when Azzopardi asked the court for permission to exhibit a news story published in January 2022, the lawyer interrupted again, arguing that a witness could not exhibit documents at the stage when the plaintiff was still asking him questions.
 The judge upheld that objection and told Azzopardi not to exhibit them for now.
 Asked by Galea as to how he knew the identity of the expert involved, the witness replied that after 30 years working in court it was reasonable to know who formed part of the small pool of court experts.
 “We were in the middle of a sitting of the compilation of evidence against the Degiorgio brothers for the murder of Daphne Caurana Galzia. They had called the expert to testify but he was not available and the court was told that he was unable to attend because he was engaged in another inquiry, that relating to the hospitals deal,” Azzopardi replied.
 When probed about the possibility of him having communicated with the expert before then, Azzopardi replied that “as far as this inquiry is concerned, it was the first time,” that he had spoken to him.
 Gouder asked the lawyer whether he had seen the inquiry before it was published by MaltaToday. “Absolutely not,” was Azzopardi’s categorical reply. “I never had visibility of it until the inquiry was made public by the press.”
 “But I am led to believe that the OPM had been given access to the inquiry which had been passed on to it by the Attorney General... I was not privy to it,” he added.
 He said a person employed at the OPM told him the Prime Minister had received a copy of the inquiry and this fact had also been made public by the Opposition.
 “My point is that the OPM should never have had a copy of this inquiry. Never.”
 Azzopardi rubbished the suggestion of impropriety on the part of magistrate Gabriella Vella. “Every lawyer who works here who knows the integrity and professionalism of the magistrate in question, I was confident that [the inquiry] would be carried out correctly.”
 Lawyer Vince Galea, who is assisting Muscat together with lawyer Charlon Gouder, pointed out that the individuals which Repubblika had indicated in their application were Chris Cardona, Edward Scicluna and Konrad Mizzi. “Joseph Muscat was not indicated,” said the lawyer.
 Once started, magisterial inquiries take on a life of their own, casting a wide net, replied the witness. “When filing an application for an inquiry you must have information that satisfies the requirements emerging from the law. At the time, there was information which had been published by Daphne Caruana Galizia, as well as The Shift News and the Times of Malta, which could reassure the court that there were sufficient grounds to justify an inquiry.”
 Azzopardi said that he had based the court application on news articles and investigative pieces which had been published in the months leading up to the application being filed. “Everything that, in my opinion, any magistrate worth his or her salt would want to know, I included,” he said.
 Azzopardi did not know identities of Vitals inquiry experts
 In reply to a question from Muscat’s lawyers, the witness said that he had not known the names or identities of the experts who had assisted in the inquiry and neither had he spoken to the inquiring magistrate’s staff. When he needed to correspond with the inquiry, he would do so in writing through the deputy he said.
 “Did you speak to the police?” asked Galea. “I would not speak to the police and I didn’t need to because the inquiry belongs to the magistrate, not the police,” shot back Azzopardi.
 Gouder asked Azzopardi about several cryptic Facebook posts which the Repubblika lawyer had published in April 2022, March, May, October 2023 and January and May 2024.
 “Thanks to investigative journalists at the Times, The Shift News and MaltaToday, and also foreign newspapers, new details were emerging… I used my right to freedom of expression and drew my conclusions from them,” Jason Azzopardi replied. “I am not infallible, but to say that I knowingly or through malice, published something which I knew not to be false, is not true “
 Gouder asked the lawyer about one particular post of his, published on 16 March 2023, which he said, appeared to indicate that Azzopardi was privy to certain aspects of the inquiry.
 “It would be reckless of me to say that I remember what was in my mind at the time [but]… I was morally convinced that the inquiry had sufficient reasons… to find wrongdoing.
 Gouder repeated his question about why four years after filing the application, Azzopardi had also started to mention Joseph Muscat in connection with the inquiry.
 “You are correct to point this out,” Azzopardi replied. “The reason is very simple: The post is from May 2023. In early November 2021… Robert Aquilina had held a press conference outside the Police HQ to announce that, on behalf of Repubblika, I had filed a report to the inquiring magistrate following a story carried by the Times of Malta about the consultancy fees - around €60,000 - which Joseph Muscat had received from Spring X Media and Accutor.
 When asked by Muscat’s lawyers as to why he had not gone to the inquiring magistrate on that occasion, Azzopardi explained that he had filed notes in the inquiry in his personal capacity, as well as filing the report on behalf of his client and repeated that he had not been exempted from professional secrecy.
 When probed about his apparent knowledge of an NAO report about the hospitals concession, prior to its publication, Azzopardi pointed to his 25 year career in Parliament, explaining that he still had long-standing relationships with people there.
 “You don’t need to be Sherlock Holmes to understand that the biggest fraud in this country’s history could not be carried out by just four people,” Azzopardi said in reply to a question from Gouder about his mention of ‘others’ as also potentially facing charges before the inquiry was concluded. “It was such a massive fraud that even people outside the country were involved.”
 Gouder also showed Azzopardi a press release by the NAO about part 3 of the report on the VGH concession, published in April 2023.
 “The probability is that when I said talk to me next month is that although I was no longer an MP… after just under 25 years in parliament, I would have known there are a number of reports in the pipeline. This information would have been provided to me by trusted individuals working in parliament. What is important
 Azzopardi refuses to reveal sources
 Azzopardi refused to comply with Gouder’s request to identify the individuals who had spoken to him. He explained that sometimes he would receive information volunteered by persons occupying State and official positions in his capacity as a lawyer, and was bound by professional secrecy towards them.
 The judge decreed that professional secrecy should be given a wide interpretation and was not necessarily limited to the case which it had been disclosed for. “Besides, the emphasis of the law is on the client’s consent. A lawyer bound by professional secrecy cannot even reveal whether or not a person is his client,” said the judge. “For this reason, it remains in the witness’ discretion to decide whether he is bound by professional secrecy and not reply to the questions.”
 The court asked Azzopardi whether he wished to reply. He declined.
 Cross-examined briefly by State Advocate lawyer James D’Agostino, Azzopardi denied having any direct communication with magistrate Gabriella Vella, or the Prime MInister for that matter, and confirmed that he had based his assertions on information that had been provided to him by others.
 The case continues.  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police
Murderer has sentence reduced from 42 years to 35 years,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/132711/murderer_has_sentence_reduced_from_42_years_to_35_years,10-12-2024,000519.png,"Elliot Paul Busuttil, who had been sentenced to a 42-year prison term and fined €70,000 after pleading guilty to the murder of Mario Farrugia and the attempted murder of Emil Vassilev Marinov, has had his prison time reduced by 7 years.

 Busuttil had initially been sentenced to a prison term of 42 years, notwithstanding an agreement between the prosecution and defence to recommend a 35-year term. Indeed, Madame Justice Consuelo Scerri Herrera noted that she was not bound by such a plea deal and could impose a lengthier sentence.

                     However, following an appeal, the Court of Appeal ordered the revision of the sentence.

 The prosecution and defence reaffirmed that Busuttil would plead guilty once more, as envisaged by the original agreement. Busuttil was subsequently sentenced to a 35-year imprisonment term.

 Additionally, Busuttil was found guilty of breaching conditions handed down on two separate occasions. This led to the confiscation of €5,000 and the forfeiture of two personal guarantees, each worth €10,000.

 Busuttil was also prohibited from approaching Marinov for a year.

 The case was presided over by Judge Neville Camilleri.

 Busuttil was represented by lawyers Edward Gatt and Shaun Zammit.

"Sicilian man sentenced in Italy for organised crime, cocaine trafficking, arrested in Malta",maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/129236/sicilian_man_arrested_in_malta_after_italian_authorities_issue_arrest_warrant,17-05-2024,000533.png,"A Sicilian man, wanted by the Italian authorities in connection with an investigation into organised crime and cocaine trafficking has appeared in court following his arrest in Malta.
 Gianluca Caruso, 32, had been living in Malta for seven years before his arrest and arraignment in court, Magistrate Joseph Gatt was told on Friday.
 The slightly-built defendant was accompanied in court by his partner, with whom, the court was told, he is expecting a child.
 Inspector Roderick Spiteri explained that the police had arrested Caruso at his workplace yesterday afternoon, on the strength of a European Arrest Warrant issued in his name by a court in Catania, Sicily.
  Exhibiting copies of the relevant documentation to the court, the inspector said that the Maltese Police Force’s forensics department had confirmed that the man’s fingerprints matched those of the requested person, which had been sent with the EAW.
 In 2020, Caruso had been convicted in absentia of offences relating to trafficking cocaine and marijuana, as well as forming part of a criminal organisation, for which he was sentenced to imprisonment for seven years and two months by the Catania Court of Appeal.
 After deducting the time spent in pre-trial custody, Caruso would be required to serve the remaining 6 years and 9 months in prison if returned to Sicily.
 According to Italian media reports, Caruso had turned himself in five years ago at the Vincenzo Bellini airport in Catania, during a law enforcement operation dubbed “Tricolore”  which had dismantled two drug dealing centres in the San Berillo Nuovo district of Catania  and led to some 40 arrests on suspicion of drug trafficking and dealing, charges which were deemed aggravated because they had been aimed at facilitating the Cappello-Bonaccorsi mafia family.
 He is understood to have subsequently travelled to Malta while on bail and is now requested by the Italian authorities in order to serve his sentence.
 Inspector Spiteri told the court that he had arrested Caruso after the police received an alert through the pan-European Schengen Information System (SIS) alert, a system which informs national police forces across the EU when a wanted person is believed to be in their country.
 The SIS alert had been sent after an European Arrest Warrant was issued requesting the man’s return to Sicily to serve a prison sentence.
 Defence lawyer Charles Mercieca argued that at the time of Caruso’s arrest, the police did not have a copy of the sentence upon which the EAW had been based which, he said, rendered the arrest illegal.
 The EAW stated that Caruso was wanted to serve a prison sentence, replied the inspector, adding that the police had been in constant communication with their overseas counterparts before arresting the man.
 Mercieca argued that Caruso’s sentence was not final, as the police did not have copies of a judgement conclusively confirming it, that would have been issued by the Italian court of third instance - the Court of Cassation.
 Lawyer Jacob Magri, added that without seeing the Cassation judgement, the defence could now know what Caruso was being requested for.
 Mercieca cited European case law, which established that a national arrest warrant or evidence of the sentence had to be exhibited in EAW cases.
 The applicable Framework Decision laid down criteria for enforceability of EAWs: evidence of a judgement or enforceable judicial decision, said the lawyer. “Decisions about the execution of the European arrest warrant must be subject to sufficient controls, which means that a judicial authority of the Member State where the requested person has been arrested will have to take the decision on his or her surrender.”
 Mercieca argued that from the inspector’s testimony, it emerged that the EAW and the arrest of Caruso were carried out on the basis of a judgement from the italian courts and a certificate issued by the Attorney General.
 “Nowhere does any enforceable sentence emerge from the documentation exhibited by the police and therefore one of the elements upon which the arrest was based is absent,” argued the lawyer.
 Evidence of an enforceable judgement, an arrest warrant in the requesting country or any other enforceable judicial decision having the same effect is a requisite for an arrest, said the lawyers.  In order to be executable an EAW requires an enforceable judgement imposing the punishment of imprisonment.
 Inspector Spiteri argued that the arrest had been made on the strength of a Schengen Information System alert, together with the EAW and a certificate issued by the Attorney General. The judgement that Caruso was being requested to return and serve could be requested by the magistrate as supplementary information, he said.
 After retiring to chambers to deliberate, the magistrate abstained from deciding about the validity of the arrest, as this would entail an examination of the merits of the case, which was not the function of his court today, adding that the defence could still raise its arguments before the court that would be deciding the case on the merits, by asking it to request any supplementary information necessary.
 The court then proceeded to ask Caruso whether he confirmed the details stated in the EAW were correct, which the man in the dock confirmed. He did not consent to his return to Sicily.
 The court expressed its concern at the absence of a representative from the AG in these proceedings, while stressing that this in no way was to be interpreted as a criticism of inspector Spiteri.
 Caruso was remanded in custody until the case continued before another magistrate in the coming days.  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police
Man accused of stealing motorcycle intended to return it after his car was repaired,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/131000/man_accused_of_stealing_motorcycle_intended_to_return_it_after_his_car_was_repaired,02-09-2024,000547.png,"A man accused of stealing a motorcycle had intended to return it after his own car was repaired, a court was told on Monday.
 This emerged as handyman Leon Lee Zammit, 24, from Mosta was arraigned under arrest before magistrate Nadia Helena Vella. Police inspector Jeffrey Scicluna and prosecutor Brendan Hewer charged Zammit with the aggravated theft of a motorcycle from Tarxien on 28 August, as well as breaching bail conditions he had been handed last December,  a probation order from 2022 and a suspended sentence from February last year. Zammit was also accused of recidivism.
  Inspector Scicluna explained that the Major Crimes Unit had been tasked with investigating the theft of a Kymco motorcycle that had been reported stolen from Tarxien. A tall, thin man was identified as the thief from CCTV footage.
 Zammit had spoken to officers who were conducting a routine patrol about an unrelated issue. During that conversation, the officers noticed that the registration plate on his motorcycle appeared to have been tampered with. After radioing the number plate to their command station, the officers received confirmation that the vehicle was stolen.
 During his subsequent arrest, Zammit was also noticed to be wearing the same outfit that he had worn while stealing the motorcycle.
 Zammit explained to the police that he had stolen the bike because his car was damaged and he still had to go out to work to feed his family. Inspector Scicluna added that Zammit told the police that he had intended to return the bike once he no longer needed it. 
 Lawyer Rachel Tua, defence counsel to Zammit, told the court that the defendant wished to plead not guilty. Bail was also requested.
 Prosecutor Brendan Hewer objected to bail, pointing out that the defendant was being charged with breaching bail, probation as well as a suspended sentence. “He has shown the value he gives to the chances that our courts have given him,” said the prosecutor, adding that the defendant knew at least one of the prosecution’s witnesses.
 “I’m sorry, but the facts are what they are. We can never be assured [that he will comply with his bail conditions] in this situation,” Hewer told the court.
 In her counter-arguments, Tua pointed out that the stolen item was already in the police’s possession, “so witnesses or no witnesses this cannot change, and neither can the CCTV footage.” 
  The court, however, in view of the charges and circumstances surrounding the case, ruled that the defendant was not sufficiently trustworthy to merit being granted bail and ordered that he be remanded in custody.  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police

Two teenagers were charged with having sex with an underage person: each other,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/two-teenagers-charged-sex-underage-person.1094118,20-06-2024,000552.png,"Jake* had just turned 16 when he received a phone call informing him he was wanted at the police headquarters to be questioned about a crime he committed. When he eventually got there, clueless and accompanied by his suspicious father, he was told he was in trouble – for having sex when he was 15, with a girl who was one year younger than him.
 “I did not know I did something wrong. In fact, I could not think of a reason why the police would want to speak to me,” says Jake, now 17, sitting at the office of his lawyer accompanied by his father.
 A few days earlier, Jake and his ex-girlfriend, Jenny* were cleared of having sex with an underage person: each other. They were cleared after they chose not to testify against each other.
 Magistrate Abigail Critien, who presided over their case in the Juvenile Court, suggested considering lowering the age of consent from 16 to 14.
 If not, she said, the legislator should, at least, consider decriminalisation in cases where both underage minors of approximately the same age and same degree of maturity engage in consensual sex.
 Her calls were echoed by child ambassadors who agreed that Malta needs ‘Romeo and Juliet’ laws that decriminalise underage, consensual sex between close-in-age teens.
 Children’s Commissioner Antoinette Vassallo, the National Youth Council and the president of the Eurochild network, Marie-Louise Coleiro Preca agreed that dropping the age of consent from 16 to 14 is not the solution. They also agreed on the need to improve sex education in schools.
 Jake was 15 when he started dating Jenny who was a year younger than him at school. They went out for a few weeks during which time the couple had consensual sex. They eventually broke up. Jake turned 16 and, about two months later, he received the call from the police.
 “I was at work when they called. They told me I had to go to the police headquarters whenever I could. They did not tell me why. I imagined I was in a lot of trouble but could not think why. I knew I had done nothing wrong. So I called my father and told him what happened. He picked me up from work and we went to the headquarters,” Jake recounts.
 His dad explains that he was very worried at the time: “I got a big fright. I told him that if he did anything wrong he could tell me. He insisted he did not. He knew he did nothing wrong but I did not.”
 The father took his son to the headquarters in Floriana and braced himself.
 When they got there, police officers were “very nice”.
 “Then they asked me if I knew the girl,” Jake recalled. They told him that he had committed a crime by having sex with someone under 16.
 Jake adds that he did not know, till today, how the police got involved and believes something must have forced Jenny to speak out about having sex.
 He said that Jenny did not have a baby from their relationship, as was previously reported.
 When the father realised what this was all about, he could not believe it.
 “I told the police officer they should arrest all young people from the dawn of time. Once there was no rape and there was no age difference, they did nothing wrong in my eyes. These were two kids,” he said.
 Meanwhile, Jake could not believe this was happening. “Many of my friends my age have children and never ended up in court. It was also embarrassing that I had to talk about the subject with my parents,” he said.
 Jake and Jenny ended up in the Juvenile Court charged with having sex with an underage person.
 “In court, I was terrified. I was scared I’d be found guilty,” he said. The two appeared in court on two occasions. The second time was when the magistrate handed down judgment.
 “There were other young people present in the court room when she read out the judgment. I was worried as there were two of my friends there and I felt embarrassed,” he said, adding that he had no idea what was happening and only realised he was acquitted when the lawyer, David Gatt, explained it after the sitting was over.
 “It was a huge relief… It’s not fair that someone like me ends up in court,” he said agreeing that the law should be amended.
 His father agreed: “The law is there but it certainly is not enforced and people are certainly not aware of this.”
 The National Youth Council has spoken about the need for a comprehensive and intersectional sexual education programme to replace the current outdated one – the guidelines for which have not been updated since 2013.
 It has also spoken about the urgent need to update Malta’s sexual health policy.
 The outdated 2010 policy was originally meant to be released in 2021 but was sent back to the drawing board because the research it was based on was found to be years out of date. Its revision was further delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The health ministry said it will be launched for consultation by the end of 2024.

Driver conditionally discharged over ‘unfortunate incident’ that killed his wife,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/driver-conditionally-discharged-unfortunate-incident-killed-wife.1097294,28-08-2024,000588.png,"An elderly driver accused of accidentally killing his wife while reversing his van in Buskett seven years ago was conditionally discharged on appeal since the victim had evidently contributed to the “truly unfortunate incident”.
 The now-78-year-old widower, whose name was subject to a publication ban, was spared the €2,000 fine inflicted as punishment by the first court, which had concluded that when reversing his Toyota van he had done so at excessive speed.
 That risky manoeuvre cost the life of his elderly wife who was meant to be assisting him by looking out for oncoming traffic while he reversed the vehicle out of a parking space under some trees onto Triq l-Imnarja in the limits of Dingli.
 That August 4 afternoon at around 4.45 pm, husband and wife were heading to their fields when the fatal accident occurred.
 The road outside the couple’s home was busier than usual because traffic was being diverted through it on account of road closures in the vicinity.
 So, while manoeuvring his van with its high tailgate onto the road, the defendant asked his wife to keep a lookout for oncoming traffic.
 That was when calamity struck.
 The defendant later told a court expert that he suddenly heard a noise and, when he stepped out of the van, saw his wife lying on the ground.
 She was rushed to hospital by ambulance where she succumbed to her injuries two hours later.
 A forensic pathologist confirmed that she suffered “multiple injuries following blunt trauma” and “contusion of the lungs”.
 The driver was found guilty of involuntary homicide and was fined €2,000 by the magistrates’ court which took note of his age and frail health as well as the unfortunate circumstances of the accident.
 Upon appeal, the defendant’s lawyers argued that the first court had wrongly assessed the evidence and also requested a reconsideration of the punishment.
 When delivering judgment, the court of criminal appeal, presided over by Madam Justice Natasha Galea Sciberras, confirmed that the position of the victim at the time of impact was never proved.
 She was rushed to hospital before court experts got to the scene of the accident.
 However, the defendant’s own statement showed that he knew that his wife was “somewhere” behind the van, even though the high tailgate blocked his rearview and he could not see her through the side mirrors.
 That was why he should have kept a proper lookout.
 He obeyed the Highway Code by seeking someone’s assistance while reversing his van but failed to pay attention to make sure that there were no obstacles or persons behind the vehicle, in this case, his own wife.
 This was not a “sudden emergency”, such as when a pedestrian suddenly steps onto the path of traffic.
 In this case, the appellant knew that his wife was keeping a lookout for oncoming traffic because he had asked her to.
 While confirming the driver’s negligence, the court, however, did not agree with the magistrate’s decision that the defendant had been driving “at a certain velocity” when attempting the risky manoeuvre.
 Nowhere did the case records prove that he had been driving at excessive speed.
 On the contrary, the court-appointed traffic expert had confirmed the total absence of tyre marks or other scratches on the road surface.
 Moreover, the expert had explained that the distance covered when reversing was short and the surface was rough.
 When all was considered, the court concluded that the appellant was not careful and did not check his surroundings, thus knocking down his wife who suffered fractured ribs and injuries to her right shoulder.
 “This was truly an unfortunate incident which was foreseeable and could have been avoided although it was not foreseen by the appellant,” observed the judge.
 However, although the first court could legally and reasonably find the defendant guilty, the court of appeal observed that there was a “strong [degree] of contributory negligence by the victim”.
 She stood right behind the van although she knew that her husband was about to reverse. She could easily have looked out for traffic by standing to the side, observed Madam Justice Galea Sciberras.
 Contrary to the first court’s conclusion, “it was clearly evident” that the victim contributed to the accident that cost her life.
 Such contributory negligence was to be reflected in the punishment which, though within legal parameters, left room for variation.
 Whilst declaring the appellant guilty of involuntary homicide, the court cancelled the €2,000 fine and conditionally discharged him for one year.
 The court confirmed the three-month driving ban and payment of court expenses amounting to €1,183.70.
 His remorse over the death of his wife was “sufficient punishment which [the appellant] would bear for life and which was doubtlessly greater than any punishment that could be inflicted by a court,” said the judge.
 Lawyers Franco Debono, Silvio Brincat and Marion Camilleri were defence counsel.

 18-year-old Iain Alekxander Turnball, a bartender from Qawra, and Jamie Nicholas Jameson Magro, also 18 and a bartender from Mosta, were arrested shortly after the owner of the Naxxar property reported the burglary at 3:00 am on Tuesday morning.
 He told police that two suspects, captured on CCTV footage, had entered his home.
 Some vehicles parked in the area were also vandalized.
 Minutes after that report, police received a tip-off about two suspicious-looking persons wielding a sharp instrument in Triq il-Port Ruman, St Paul’s Bay.
 The suspects were arrested.
 Police found a machete, an axe and jewellery in their possession. The valuables were stolen from the Naxxar house minutes before.
 A car driven by the suspects had also been stolen from the property some days earlier.
 On Wednesday afternoon the teens were jointly charged with driving the car without the owner’s consent, as well as without a licence and insurance cover.
 They were also charged with aggravated theft and wilful damage to third party property, as well as carrying a sharp or pointed instrument without a police licence.
 They both registered an admission which they confirmed after being given sufficient time to reconsider.
 The court, presided over by magistrate Elaine Rizzo, upheld the defence’s request for a pre-sentencing report.
 Pending sentencing, the defence requested bail.
 That request was upheld on condition of not approaching the prosecution witnesses, signing the bail book daily, under a curfew between 10:00 pm and 7:00 am, against a deposit of €300 and a personal guarantee of €1000 each.
 Lawyer Arthur Azzopardi, assisting Jameson Magro, pointed out that the stolen items had been retrieved by the police before the arraignment.
 The court also issued a protection order in favour of the victims.

Events promoter who assaulted policeman gets nine months in jail,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/nine-months-jail-party-organiser-damaged-cars-assaulted-policeman.1098540,25-09-2024,000619.png,"A drunken young man who went on a wrecking spree on a Paceville street, jumping on cars and injuring a policeman, was jailed for nine months on Wednesday.
 The case happened in the early hours of August 16 when Spaniard Jon Vila Jauregui, 21, damaged five cars that were parked on Triq is-Sur Fons. He also slightly injured a police officer as he violently resisted arrest.
 Jauregui was accused of causing wilful damage to third-party property, insulting, threatening and slightly injuring a police sergeant, violently resisting arrest and being drunk in public.
 He pleaded guilty.
 When delivering judgment, Magistrate Donatella Frendo Dimech said that the facts of the case fell squarely within the relative provisions of the Criminal Code.
 When meting out punishment, she noted the accused’s early guilty plea, his cooperation with investigators and his criminal record.
 Jauregui had come to Malta to work as an events promoter but chose to damage third-party property simply for the fun of it and because he wanted to, the magistrate said.
 He had admitted that on the day of the incident, he had been drinking heavily, but this was no excuse to exonerate an adult from the consequences of his own actions.
 The court, she said, wanted to send out a clear message that it would not tolerate violence against police officers or members of the forces of order.
 Although the punishment was to take into account the defendant’s early admission, it also had to reflect the gravity of his actions.
 He had attacked those “who risk their life to safeguard society by enforcing laws which society itself created to protect itself against criminals like the accused.”
 “There is no place for the law of the jungle in Malta,” said the court.
 Those who were not willing to behave properly, in a civilized manner, must face justice. Anti-social persons had no place in society and whoever thought himself above the law would be put in place by the law itself.
 The court condemned the youth to a nine-month effective jail term and a fine of €5,000 which, if not paid, would be converted to imprisonment.
 He was also ordered to reimburse the victims for the damages caused which totalled over €3,000 and to pay €484.80 in court expert expenses.
 Inspector Roderick Attard prosecuted.

Man jailed for setting fire to ex's car after glut of threatening messages,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/man-set-fire-ex-car-threatened-jailed-ordered-pay-127k.1098269,19-09-2024,000624.png,"A man who set fire to his former partner’s car and threatened the woman and her mother with ""greater disaster” has been jailed for seven years.
 Omar Djelassi, a 27-year-old Cospicua resident, was the prime suspect in an arson attack on a Fiat Punto in the early hours of December 16, 2020. on Victory Street, Senglea.
 
 The flames also damaged a Kia Picanto parked in front of the Fiat and extended to the façade of a nearby residence. 
 A man who lived in that residence later described the “ball of fire” outside his residence and the dark plume of smoke that swept through his home, forcing him to seek refuge on the roof. 
 He was rescued by firefighters. 
 Djelassi - who had been in a relationship with the daughter of the woman who drove the Fiat and was the father of her minor child - was charged with having wilfully set fire to the car and caused damage to the second car and the house.
 He was also charged with committing the alleged crimes during a suspended sentence and while on bail over separate proceedings. 
 He pleaded not guilty. 
 Court hears how investigators tracked down a series of Facebook messages sent to the defendant’s ex and her mother a few days after the arson.
 Those messages - sent over two days in January 2021 from different Facebook profiles, made reference to the fire.
 The sender of the messages, hiding behind profiles named Haha Huhu and  Jane Cassar, knew the mother and daughter very well, having intimate knowledge of their movements and also the fact that the mother had acquired a new car after her previous one was reduced to a total loss in the December fire. 
 That Fiat Punto was registered in the name of the Djelassi’s ex but was used by her mother. 
 “Tonight you’re going to get a bigger fright than your mother because you’re going to end up homeless,” read one message, adding: “I feel better now that your mum’s car caught fire haha"".
 “And by the way, your mum’s new car is nice. If you think I’m bluffing go on and do so. But just as we burnt the other one we’ll burn this one,"" he added. 
 They included threats like ""today we're creating a bigger disaster than the one with the car"",  ""tonight start looking for another home for your daughter because she's going to end up without a facade"", ""take heed and get out of there because I'm going to make a big scene once the girl is not there""  and ""even if it's parked in front of cameras no problem"".
 Those messages were linked to an IP address registered at Djelassi’s family home. 
 When delivering judgment, the court, presided over by Magistrate Rachel Montebello, deemed those messages “a very strong” piece of evidence that the accused was materially involved in the crime. 
 The sender stated “repeatedly” and with no hesitation that he was the one who started the fire and threatened to repeat his act, targeting the new car and his ex’s house. 
 CCTV footage from the crime scene further corroborated that evidence. 
 Geolocation data also showed that Djelassi’s mobile phone was very active on the night of the arson and was in the area of the fire. 
 When all was considered, the court was “abundantly satisfied” that Djelassi was actively involved.
 An arson expert confirmed that the fire had not been an accidental one. 
 The second car was also damaged and the nearby façade and house were all blackened. The timber balcony was destroyed. 
 The court declared the accused guilty and condemned him to a five-year effective jail term.
 
 A previous two-year suspended sentence was also to be brought into effect. 
 He was ordered to reimburse €8,300 in total to all the victims and to cover expert expenses amounting to €4,474.
 The court also issued a restraining order and treatment order for three years.
 Inspectors Mario Xiberras, Jeffrey Scicluna Briffa and Darren Buhagiar prosecuted.

Man sentenced to 19 months’ imprisonment for stealing ladder and breaching bail conditions,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/132382/man_sentenced_to_19_months_imprisonment_for_stealing_ladder_and_breaching_bail_conditions,20-11-2024,000625.png,"A man was sentenced to 19 months’ imprisonment for stealing a ladder and simultaneously breaching bail conditions.

 The accused, 38-year-old Michael Spiteri from Zabbar, admitted that he committed the theft in order to obtain money to fuel his drug addiction.

 The man was accused of stealing a ladder that was tied on top of a van on 30 October 2024 between 3am and 6am. He was also accused of breaching bail conditions imposed on him in a previous case, and recidivism.

 He immediately admitted to the charges brought against him in court and admitted to the fact that he had committed the theft in order to get money for drugs.

 The Court, presided by Magistrate Leonard Caruana, noted whilst this was not the accused’s first brush with the law and that an effective sentence of imprisonment would be ideal in such circumstances, it simultaneously stated that said the sentence should remain close to the minimum, and this even in view of the fact that the theft was committed owing to the accused’s drug problem.

 The Court thus sentenced Spiteri to a 19-month effective prison sentence and ordered him to follow a drug rehabilitation program whilst imprisoned. Spiteri was also ordered to pay €185 to the owner of the ladder, with a further €50 to be confiscated from a personal guarantee he had been bound to in a separate case.

 Ryan Debono, an office worker from Qawra, was arraigned before Magistrate Ann Marie Thake.
 Police Inspector Warren Galea told the court that on April 20 the police got a call from a woman who said that Debono had tried to sell her drugs while she was at a beach club in St Paul’s Bay.
 Police quickly went to the club. The woman met them at the door and pointed out the accused to them.
 The police conducted a search on his person and found a stash of green pills which were later confirmed as being ecstasy. A sachet of cocaine had also been found.
 Debono pleaded not guilty to charges of trafficking and aggravated possession of ecstasy and cocaine less than 100m away from a place frequented by young people.
 The prosecution objected to a request for bail.
 Defence lawyer Amadeus Cachia pointed out that the accused had proven himself trustworthy enough to abide by police bail and was even allowed to travel overseas during this period.
 The court upheld the request for bail against a deposit of €1,000 and a personal guarantee of €9,000. The accused was also ordered to sign the bail book twice a week, observe a curfew and be supervised by a probation officer.

 At the start of today’s sitting, 50-year-old Chang Rajii was asked to enter a fresh plea in view of an amendment to the charges against him. He reiterated his plea of not guilty and his defence lawyer, Ilona Schembri, exempted the court from having to hear the witnesses who had testified so far, all over again.
 First to testify on Monday was a police sergeant from the Community Policing Department, who told the court that on August 3, he had been informed about a fraud report filed against Chang Rajii by a representative of B Hotel for failing to pay for his seven-month stay there.
 When asked to settle the €8,560 bill, Chang Rajii had presented a non-cashable cheque for around €1,000 less than the amount due, the sergeant said.
  The court also heard the testimony of Jesmond Debono, B-Hotel’s General Manager today.
 The witness explained that the defendant had been a guest there, beginning in December 2021 and had extended his stay several times, offering different methods of payment. “Eventually he left the hotel with a pending balance of over eight thousand euros,” Debono told the court.
 The initial Booking had been made through online platform Expedia and had been paid for, but Chang Rajii had subsequently extended his stay, and had failed to pay his hotel bill from February to August.

 Debono described how the defendant had claimed to be making arrangements for the payment of €957 through a foreign bank account in March, explaining his first non-payment to the witness and his assistant as being the result of delays due to bank formalities.
 The hotel had initially given the Chilean the benefit of the doubt, but the doubt kept on mounting, together with his unpaid hotel bills, while Chang Rajii came up with a string of excuses for his card payments being refused, at one point allegedly claiming to have encountered problems with his HSBC account. 
 In June 2022, he told Debono that Barclays Bank had authorised a transfer that day. No bank transfer materialised, however. “He left us there till midnight waiting for the transfer,” Debono said.
 The hotel management were chasing the defendant for the money, sending reminders on a daily basis, with Chang Rajii staying at the hotel all the while.
 Eventually he had handed over a cheque for €7,000 from a JP Morgan account as security for his debt. The hotel didn’t try to cash that cheque, Debono said.
 The following month, in July 2022, Chang Rajii gave them details of a BOV account from which he would settle the outstanding amount which by then was over €7,000. When contacted by the hotel, BOV denied such a transaction had been made.
 The following day Chang Rajii had claimed that his funds had been transferred from a JP Morgan account in the US to a JP Morgan account in the UK.
 Then he proposed that the hotel try to obtain payment through Expedia, but that also turned out to be a dead end. “On 20 July 2022, at almost midnight, he confirmed to us that his card had been upgraded with a €25,000 limit. At that point his bill was €8,200,” the witness said.
 The case was adjourned to June, with the magistrate informing the prosecution that the 30-day period for it rule on whether there was a prima facie case for trial on indictment starts today.

 P.O.G. Limited and Petralux Limited had filed for damages against several government departments and entities including the Qormi local council after a storm struck Malta between 15 and 17 September 2003.
 Their properties included the Drugshop Dispensary and adjacent clinics at Triq Spiteri Fremond on De La Cruz Avenue in Qormi.
 The storm had caused severe flooding in several locations resulting in an overflow of sewage and significant damage to the claimants' property. 
 The court held that the government and its public entities had failed in their duty of care, particularly in the upkeep of the Qormi stormwater channel.
 It also said that those in positions of authority must be held accountable for their actions or inactions. 
 Both companies accused the defendants of failing in their duty to ensure that such incidents would not occur and sought a declaration of liability for the damages suffered.
 During oral pleadings, the plaintiffs' lawyers stressed the need for accountability and highlighted that the term itself lacks a direct Maltese translation.
 The defendants argued that the flooding was caused by unprecedented natural forces, constituting a force majeure. 
 
 The courts found that the flooding, exacerbated by outdated infrastructure and poor water management, caused significant damage to the plaintiffs' properties.
 They also established that negligence and infrastructure mismanagement were key contributors. 
 The companies were initially assigned 25% of the responsibility for failing to mitigate risks associated with operating in a flood-prone area. 
 On appeal, the courts acknowledged that the businesses had operated within their legal rights and that the damages were solely the result of systemic failures.
 The courts said that civil administration was to be held accountable for its responsibilities towards the upkeep of the Qormi stormwater channel and other similar areas throughout Malta and Gozo.
 The ruling apportioned the damages among several defendants. 
 The Directorate of Public Works and the Directorate of Construction and Maintenance were held 60% responsible.
 The Malta Resources Authority was assigned 25% liability, while Transport Malta was held accountable for 15%.
 The Qormi local council, initially found partly responsible, was absolved on appeal.
 The court was presided over by judges Giannino Caruana Demajo, Anthony Ellul and Robert G. Mangion.

Angelo Gafa's term as police commissioner renewed for four more years,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/angelo-gafa-term-police-commissioner-renewed-four-years.1094679,29-06-2024,000716.png,"Updated 8.00 pm
 Angelo Gafa's term as police commissioner has been renewed for another four years, the home affairs ministry said on Saturday. 
 Gafa was the first police chief not to be directly appointed by the prime minister when he assumed the role in 2020. He was made commissioner following an open call from the Public Service Commission. 
 This time around, Gafa only needed the approval of the Public Service Commission for his contract to be renewed. 
 In a statement, the home affairs ministry praised Gafa's first four years.
 ""In the last years and months, the police corps revamped its systems to become closer to citizens,"" the ministry said.
 The ministry cited the introduction of community police, the victim support unit and the gender-based and domestic violence unit as examples of Gafa's work. 
 The ministry added that people trust the police: ""Every public opinion survey in the last years, on a local and European level, always showed that the Maltese people trust the (police) corps and its officials.""
 
 The police has also improved its governance and managed to agree on a new collective agreement for its officers, the ministry said. 
 Gafa's renewal comes despite the Nationalist Party's opposition. 
 Opposition leader Bernard Grech said on Saturday that the country deserves a commissioner who does not favour anyone and not an official who believes he should defend the interests of the Labour Party. 
  In a Facebook post, Grech said the PN would keep insisting it needs a police commissioner who has support from two-thirds of parliament.
 Robert Aquilina, of Repubblika, said a number of police officerstold him that Angelo Gafa does not represent the values of the police. 
 The officers who spoke to the rule of law NGO's honorary president consider the renewal of Gafa's contract as an insult to the police corps and the Maltese people, Aqulina said.
 ""Because of Angelo Gafa's leadership style, the police are demoralised and demotivated,"" Aquilina said. 
 Repubblika has been a constant critic of Gafa, even accusing the police chief of becoming the ""biggest obstacle to justice"".

‘Are you ready? Because I am’: Johnston's last words as he pointed gun at police,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/are-ready-because-i-am.1096706,14-08-2024,"000734.png,000735.png,000736.png","The final words of the man who confessed to murder before he was shot dead by police on Monday have been revealed from bodycam footage.
 Edward William Johnston held a replica gun to his head, then turned it to point at police before uttering his last words: “Are you ready? Because I am.”
 Officers shot the 50-year-old Irish man three times, believing his gesture and words were a clear warning that he was about to open fire on them, according to sources close to the investigation.
 
 The 3am shooting ended a three-hour stand-off during which police engaged in futile negotiations with Johnston.
 The body of his ex-partner, Nicolette Ghirxi, whom he had harassed for months, had been found an hour earlier in her Birkirkara apartment. She had been stabbed to death and two knives were found nearby. 
 Times of Malta was able to confirm, through sources close to the investigation, that the entire interaction between Johnston and the police was caught on body camera footage, which is now part of the investigation into the case that rocked the country this week.
 It later turned out Johnston had been carrying a replica Beretta pistol. 
 “In that moment, in pitch black darkness, police couldn’t have possibly known that his gun couldn’t shoot and considering that they had just been informed he had really killed a woman that night, they had every reason to interpret those words as a direct threat on their life,” one source said.
 Other details of Johnston’s movements on the night of the murder are slowly becoming clear. 
 While it has not been revealed how he got access to Ghirxi’s apartment on Triq Maestro Giuseppe Busuttil or how long he was there before the stabbing took place, he left late on Sunday night for the Hilton Hotel in St Julian’s.
  Sources close to the investigation say that he entered the resort at around 11.30pm and asked for a drink at the hotel’s Vista Lobby Lounge, which overlooks the sea. 
 The bartender told Johnston the bar was closed but that they would check with colleagues, before briefly leaving the bar to speak with staff.
 When the bartender returned, Johnston pulled out the gun which later turned out to be a replica, telling the bartender: “Get me a beer or I’ll shoot you.”
 Johnston left the hotel shortly afterwards – possibly by jumping down to the ground from a nearby roof – and police were called.
 The details of Johnston’s exact movements and interactions with hotel employees are still being investigated by police, and hotel staff declined to comment when Times of Malta visited the premises on Tuesday.
 On Monday police commissioner Angelo Gafa said officers first found Johnston on the rocks behind the hotel and when they approached him he jumped into the sea and at one point, directed the gun at his head.
 At that point the police did not know the gun was a replica, and three hours of negotiations during which a medical team and a professional police negotiator were roped in on site were not enough to persuade him to put down his gun and surrender to the police.
 Johnston died at Mater Dei Hospital, shortly after the shooting.
 
 One source speculated that in that moment, Johnston may have wanted to die in the hands of the police in what is known in the forensic world as ‘suicide by cop’.
 “When he said those words and pointed the gun at the police he knew he was provoking them to shoot him, because that is what police do when faced with a threat like that, all the while knowing he had nothing to fire back with,” the source said. The law says a police officer can fire their gun only as a last resort and in “exceptional circumstances”, and when it is “inevitable to preserve the life of a police officer or others, or to avert an imminent danger of widespread violence.”
  Internal police guidelines also say officers can only fire their gun when they have a “reasonable belief” that their target “poses an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury to the officer or to another person.” 
 It is believed this was not Johnston’s first stand-off with police.
 The victim’s family told Times of Malta that he had boasted to her about being involved in a previous bomb threat in Glasgow.
 The man in the Glasgow incident, also called Edward Johnston and of the same age, was jailed over a restaurant bomb threat in 2012 and was almost shot by police in Liverpool a week earlier after pointing a replica gun at them. In both cases he challenged police to shoot him.
 Times of Malta understands the Maltese authorities are still trying to confirm at this stage if the man they shot while he pointed a fake weapon at them is the same person.
 
 Johnston had been harassing his ex-partner for months after their almost two-year relationship broke down.
 She first reported him to police in April but told officers she did not believe her life was at risk.
 Over the next months she made further reports, including of fake profiles he was suspected of setting up to make slanderous allegations about her sex life.

"Cocaine sex parties with prostitutes bought officials' silence over 18,000 fraudulently issued ID cards: lawyer",maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/130543/cocaine_sex_parties_with_prostitutes_kept_identita_officials_quiet_over_fraudulently_issued_id_cards_lawyer_,02-08-2024,000742.png,"A police inspector was transferred to another department while planning to arraign top political officials on charges of masterminding a racket at Identità, lawyer Jason Azzopardi has claimed in a sworn application on Friday.  
 The racket allegedly saw the issuing of an estimated 18,000 Maltese ID cards to third country nationals on the basis of fake documentation and false declarations.
  It is just one of several explosive claims laid out in the urgent 59-page sworn application requesting a magisterial inquiry, that was filed earlier this week by lawyer Jason Azzopardi in his personal capacity.
 Former Identità official Maria Spiteri and her boyfriend, car dealer and alleged fraudster, Bernard Attard, were named and identified to the police by several Egyptian men who were arrested and questioned by the police after they were caught using the IDs to apply for residence permits.
 In a July sitting in the case against Moustafa Ata Moussa Darwish, one of the Egyptian men accused of falsely claiming to be married to a British woman so as to obtain a residency permit in Malta, two Identità officials had given conflicting testimony when asked about whether the man’s file was available, leading Magistrate Kevan Azzopardi to order a police investigation.
 An English woman who was supposedly married to the accused had also testified in those proceedings. She described how an official from Identity Malta, as the agency was known then, had called her in 2022 to inquire whether she had sponsored a family member to obtain a residence permit. The woman told the court that she had nothing to do with any Egyptian men and denied ever being married to the accused.
 The application states that Spiteri had conspired with Attard to let the third country nationals in to Identity Malta office through a side door after closing time, in order to photograph them for their new ID cards, which were issued in under 30 days - a far cry from the standard three to four month wait.
 The couple are already the subjects of ongoing criminal proceedings for fraud, in which they are accused of tricking a Latvian man into paying Attard to purchase a property, with Spiteri impersonating a Lands Department official. A civil court had condemned Attard to pay €696,210 to the victim in that case in 2020.
 Last March Attard was also charged with using a metal bar to beat up a man who had gone to Attard’s residence, allegedly carrying pepper spray, to confront Attard for deceiving him in an agreement to buy a car.
 The application states that thousands of fake certificates, mostly marriage certificates documenting fictitious marriages abroad between third-country nationals, the majority of them hailing from Egypt or Libya, and UK nationals at a time when the UK was still an EU member state, were used to apply for ID cards.
 Azzopardi goes on to allege that these documents, which had been falsified for the purpose of applying for Maltese ID “appear to have already been destroyed by the Identity Malta employees involved in this racket.”
 It was for this reason that the Immigration Section of the Malta Police Force had to request confirmation of the purported marriages, Azzopardi said, adding that as far as he was aware, the requested information had not been received to date.
  
 Bernard Attard “mentioned by Colombian organiser of cocaine and prostitute parties”
 Azzopardi goes on to declare under oath that he had been entrusted with information by an individual, on condition of anonymity, describing several debauched parties allegedly “organised by a Colombian woman named Rosario” at a villa in Wardija, an apartment in Mellieha and another apartment in St. Julians.
 “Members of Parliament from both sides of the House, Government Ministers, doctors, lawyers, employees and Government officials would attend these parties,” declared the lawyer, adding that ‘Rosario’ would boast of the ease with which she would obtain work permits for the prostitutes she employed “thanks to her corrupt contacts at Identity Malta together with officials from the Government of Malta who would be paid large sums of money to help her in return for being allowed to attend these parties for free.”
 “Bernard Attard’s is one of the names that Rosario had mentioned to him several times,” alleged the lawyer, requesting an urgent magisterial inquiry aimed at preserving the relevant evidence.
  
 Identità responds to allegations
 In response to the allegations, Identità stated that it takes all allegations and reports seriously, noting that it had strengthened its internal compliance structures and is fully cooperating with the police.
 The agency stressed its committment to launch the necessary internal investigations. Identità reminded that it had previously launched an internal investigation which has since been passed onto the police.
 Identità stated that it does not tolerate any form of abuse, and that it will continue to cooperate with the police.  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police
Man acquitted of defiling his former girlfriend’s nieces after testimony puts their claim in doubt,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/129929/man_acquitted_of_defiling_his_former_girlfriends_nieces_after_testimony_puts_their_claim_in_doubt_,26-06-2024,000756.png,"A court has acquitted a man of defiling his girlfriend’s nieces after their testimony put their claim in serious doubt.
 The man had been accused of defiling minors who had entrusted to his care, from 2009 to 2012 and participating in sexual activity with the children, who at the time were just four and five-years-old respectively.
  The two girls had been 17 and 16 years of age when they testified before Magistrate Claire Stafrace Zammit, telling the court that the alleged abuse by the defendant - who had been their aunt’s boyfriend at the time - would take place at their grandmother’s house in Marsa, where they would be dropped off after school before being collected by their father.
 At the Marsa house, they said, the defendant would show the girls pornographic movies and encourage them to perform sex acts for his gratification, which they had detailed in court.
 Afterwards, he would buy their silence with chocolates and read them stories, claimed the girls.
 The elder child told the court that she had developed an anxiety disorder as a result.
 But the girls’ accounts raised questions for magistrate Claire Stafrace Zammit. “Although the defendant is accused of ugly and serious crimes, this court is not morally and legally convinced of the truthfulness of their story.”
 The defendant had chosen to exercise his right not to testify in court, but the magistrate also had the opportunity to examine the statement he gave to the police in which he had said he was fed up living in the house due to the noisy children and the lack of privacy. The magistrate had also visited the house in person in order to verify claims about the property that had been raised by the defence.
 The room in which the girls claimed that the abusive acts had taken place offered no privacy, lacking even a door, and was in the middle of a corridor often used by the house’s occupants. “These alleged acts would also take place, according to the children, while their grandfather, grandmother, mother and sometimes also an aunt would be present in the single-floor house.”
 Court-appointed experts had also expressed doubts about the children’s claims and which they suspected to be false.
 The court said that although no suspicion arose from the testimonies of the girls themselves, when their accounts were analysed together with the place and context in which the alleged acts took place, the claims took on a different dynamic.
 Magistrate Stafrace Zammit said it was unlikely that the acts would have gone unnoticed in a living space that was occupied by several people.
 Another aspect which worried the court was that none of the evidence showed that there had been any emotional impact on the children. “No sign of distress was detected by the designated experts nor any symptom of psychosis with delusions. From the testimony of the minor's mother, it emerged that she was never startled by anything that the minors could have been experiencing and even at school they continued to go on normally. That all the witnesses from the side of the Victims Support did not encounter any problem in their emotions either except for the one who had problems related to anxiety and panic attacks [which had emerged] after she had spoken out, but not before.”
 The double entendre alleged to have been used by the man to describe his desired sex act was more likely to be a term used by the, now older, girls in their present peer group.
 All these factors led the Court to state that it was not morally convinced that the events described by the girls had actually taken place in the manner they described.
 “The Court must clarify that once it is not aware of where this story had originated from, it cannot incriminate any of the protagonists, however if it is the case that this was a story invented by the minors, it cannot condemn them, but can only hope that their parents and the people who are looking after their mental health, [also] take care of their well-being.”

 MaltaToday understands that action can be expected to be taken against several individuals and companies, which probably includes former prime minister Joseph Muscat, his former chief of staff Keith Schembri, and former health minister Konrad Mizzi.
 A money laundering investigation may lead to the freezing of assets.
  Magistrate Gabriella Vella, who was investigating the sale of three public hospitals to Vitals Global Healthcare, concluded her report and passed it on to the Attorney General last week.
 The inquiry was initiated in 2019 on Repubblika’s initiative.
 Joseph Muscat had tried to remove the magistrate from the inquiry, insisting she had a conflict because her relatives were publicly critical of him. He also complained of constant leaks from the inquiry and decried the magistrate’s refusal to let him testify before her.
 In January 2022, as part of the inquiry, police officers searched Muscat’s Burmarrad home and ceased several electronic devices.
 Muscat told reporters today that he had no doubt he will be charged as he adopted a defiant tone. He insisted he did nothing wrong and would fight the charges tooth and nail.

"Lawyers for Fearne, Scicluna and others try but fail to have magistrate recused",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/fearne-scicluna-others-back-court-vitals-charges.1094050,18-06-2024,000793.png,"Updated 4pm
 A magistrate on Monday turned down a request to recuse himself from hearing the case against Chris Fearne, Edward Scicluna and 12 others and ordered that the case proceed immediately. 
 Magistrate Leonard Caruana rebuffed the request, filed collectively by lawyers representing the defendants, saying it had no basis in law. 
 The decision came midway through a court session characterised by rumblings of discontent from the defence benches - and revelations that the evidence to be presented against defendants totals a staggering 250,000 pages.
 Defence lawyers made it a point to note that they have not yet received copies of that evidence, even though they have been given less than two weeks to present their objections to the prima facie evidence presented against their clients.   
 It was that court-mandated timeline which prompted defence lawyers to make the recusal request. 
 The magistrate decreed that the defendants' 30-day time limit to contest prima facie evidence began when they were first arraigned on May 29.
 Defence lawyers said that decision caught them by surprise and meant they only had 11 days to comb through voluminous evidence against their clients. So far, defendants have only received a copy of conclusions of the magisterial inquiry into the Vitals case. Work to provide them with copies of appendices attached to that inquiry remains ongoing. 
 Lawyers argued that the 30-day limit should begin on Monday, as the magistrate had originally annulled that May 29 court hearing. 
 The magistrate cancelled that arraignment after lawyers for one of the defendants, legal firm DF Advocates, argued that no individual had been notified of charges as its representative.
 But the magistrate subsequently changed course and on Friday upheld a request by prosecutors to revoke that initial decree.
 That decision prompted a storm of criticism from defence lawyers, who also took issue with the magistrate limiting submissions to one lawyer per defendant to ""avoid repetition"". 
 Each accused had a right to make submissions, they argued. 
 As complaints mounted, the defence collectively demanded that the magistrate recuse himself, arguing that their clients’ right to a fair trial was being denied.
 Prosecutors immediately objected to the recusal request, saying the request had no legal basis and that the outcome of a decree was no reason to demand a recusal. 
 Following a 90-minute deliberation, the magistrate turned down the recusal request, saying it was not well-founded. His decree was met with total silence by the defence. 
 The court heard that work was underway to make evidence presented in 78 boxes of documentation available to defendants.
 As of Monday morning, documents in all but three of the 78 boxes had been scanned, court registrar Franklin Calleja testified.
 In all, there are 250,000 pages to be scanned.
 Police superintendent Rennie Stivala testified that he was present for various searches and testimonies given as part of the Vitals magisterial inquiry led by magistrate Gabriella Vella.
 Stivala served that function until April 2021. Up to that date, none of those questioned were being treated as suspects in the case, he said.
 All throughout, Stivala emphasised that the process was led by the magistrate and that he was simply tasked with assisting the process.
 Tax commissioner Joseph Caruana also testified in Monday’s session. He told the court that he granted authorisation for criminal action against one of the accused, Deborah Ann Chappell, and did so on the same day that the request from the police commissioner reached him, May 2.
 The case will resume on Friday, June 21, when the court will hear submissions regarding freezing orders against the accused and also decide on a request filed by the prosecution to forbid defendants from speaking publicly about the case.
 Fearne, a Labour MP and former deputy prime minister and Scicluna, who is Central Bank Governor and a former finance minister, stand accused of fraud and other crimes related to that hospitals privatisation deal.
 That deal, signed during Fearne and Scicluna's time in office as part of a Joseph Muscat-led government, was annulled by a civil court last year after it found evidence of fraud within it. 
 Their initial arraignment, held late last month, turned into an 11-hour court sitting punctuated with multiple procedural objections by defence lawyers. At the end of it all, Magistrate Leonard Caruana  annulled the entire thing.
 The case was due to resume last week but was deferred after prosecutors filed a legal request to revoke that decision to annul the initial sitting.
 Apart from Fearne and Scicluna, other defendants include former permanent secretaries Alfred Camilleri and Joseph Rapa, current permanent secretary Ronald Mizzi, members of the adjudication committee that assigned the contract to Vitals - James Camenzuli, Manuel Castagna, and Robert Borg -  financial controller Kenneth Deguara, and five lawyers: Deborah Anne Chappell, Kevin Deguara, Jean Carl Farrugia, Bradley Gatt and Aron Mifsud Bonnici. 
 Another group of defendants that includes former prime minister Joseph Muscat, Keith Schembri and Konrad Mizzi are being charged separately. They face more serious allegations of bribery and corruption, among other crimes. 
 A third case sees consultant Assad Ali facing criminal charges. Ali is the son of Shaukat Ali, the man suspected of being  the secret shareholder who made the most money out of the hospitals deal.

 The 73-year-old Pakistani businessman, who told the court that he worked as a freelance consultant, appeared voluntarily in court on Wednesday, where he was arraigned by summons. He pleaded not guilty to charges of money laundering, trading in influence, misappropriation, promotion and active participation in a criminal organisation and corruption.
  He was charged together with Mount Everest General Trading LLC, Mount Everest FZ LLC, STE Health Co, Mount Everest Investments Limited, VGH Europe AG - today Accutor Consulting AG, Mount Everest General Trading FZ LLC, Global Assets Holdings Limited  At the start of today's arraignment before magistrate Rachel Montebello, prosecutor Rebekah Spiteri requested an amendment to the charges, together with a separation of proceedings.
 The first set of defendants would be today’s case against Ali, Mount Everest FZ LLC, and Global Assets Holdings Ltd.. Ali also represented those companies, she explained.
 The second set of charges would be against Mount Everest General Trading LLC, STE Health and VGH Europe AG. No individuals were being charged in the second batch, noted the court.“We are not yet sure who represents those companies,” explained the prosecutor. 
 The defence did not object to the request, which was upheld by the court, which noted that the changes did not affect the merits of the charges and were not being opposed by the defence.
 The prosecution also requested a number of seizures and freezing orders, the first of which against Shaukat Ali Chaudry was for the sum of €30 million. 
 €9 million were requested to be frozen from the assets of VGH Europe AG, €100 million from Mount Everest Investments Limited, €100,000 from STE Health Co, €340,000 from D Global Assets Holdings Limited, €5 million each from Mount Everest FZ LLC and Mount Everest General Trading LLC.
 Asked how he wished to plead, the defendant made an open palm gesture and said “I’m not guilty, so I’m pleading not guilty.” Ghaznavi entered not guilty pleas on behalf of the companies.
 FCID Inspector Wayne Rodney Borg took the witness stand.
 He was assigned to assist Mag Gabriella Vella in the Vitals Steward inquiry. “My role was always to assist her by summoning all the necessary persons who needed to testify in such inquiry.”
 MaltaToday had reported that Ali, along with former OPM chief of staff Keith Schembri, were central to the multi-million fraudulent hospitals concession. Investigators believed that Shaukat Ali’s family was rewarded with huge consultancy fees when Steward was to take over Vitals as concessionaires of the hospital – as much as €480,000.
 The payments to Shaukat Ali were made two weeks before Steward Healthcare International – the international arm that took over the concession – signed a memorandum of understanding with the government to take over the hospitals concession.
 Just yesterday, a magistrate ruled that Shaukat Ali’s son, Shaukat Asad Ali can stand trial, after ruling that there is sufficient evidence to commit him to trial on indictment.
 When the case resumed after noon, the court issued a decree upholding the request for a seizing and freezing order on Shaukat Ali Chaudry, Global Assets and Mount Everest and his Parveen.
 The court instructed that the orders be communicated to all financial institutions as well as be published in the government gazette. Wasay Bhatti pleads not guilty
 Wasay Attaoul Bhatti, an Indian-born lawyer based in Switzerland, faced arraignment in a separate courtroom.
 Representing both himself and two Swiss companies, Accutor AG and Spring Healthcare Services AG, Bhatti is accused of being instrumental in the alleged misuse of these entities as conduits for a political slush fund by the hospital concessionaires.
 In court, Bhatti denied all allegations, pleading ""not guilty"" before Magistrate Leonard Caruana. Prosecutors said Bhatti played a key role in facilitating bribery payments to prominent political figures, including former Prime Minister Joseph Muscat, former Minister Konrad Mizzi, and former OPM Chief of Staff Keith Schembri.
 Additionally, Bhatti is alleged to have supported Shaukat Ali and his suspected Vitals frontman, Sri Ram Tumuluri, in trading influence.
 Tumuluri remains at large, with prosecutors revealing that attempts to serve him with a court summons have been unsuccessful. In light of the charges, prosecutors have sought a substantial €9 million freezing order on Bhatti's assets, a move contested by his defense team, comprising Shazoo Ghaznavi, Jessica Formosa, Alex Scerri Herrera, and Jeanine Depasquale.

Vitals inquiry expert’s qualifications probed by defence in freezing orders hearing,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/131197/court_stops_defence_lawyer_from_probing_vitals_inquiry_experts_qualifications,13-09-2024,000856.png,"The court hearing challenges to the freezing orders issued on the back of the Vitals Global Healthcare fraud case today stopped defence lawyer Franco Debono from probing one of the court-appointed experts about her qualifications for the role.
 Debono challenged the witness, forensic accountant Miroslava Milenović, while she was being cross-examined as to how she had quantified the alleged amounts of money that had been laundered in the VGH and Steward deal.
  Milenović told the court that she had a first degree in an unrelated field: geophysics, and subsequently a Masters degree in political science, financing of terrorism and money laundering. That was in 1984, she said.
 Milenović then spent 20 years working with PwC as an accountant and as a certified fraud specialist, as well as director of that firm. She had also worked with the United States’ Department of Justice as a fraud investigator for many years.
 The judge stopped the lawyer’s pointed line of questioned towards the witness. “This is not the place where you can contest the expert’s  qualifications. I don’t want to hear anymore.”
 The judge proceeded to dictate a note in the acts of the proceedings herself, recording that the court felt that for the purposes of this application – which was to challenge the freezing orders – the expert had already explained her qualifications and was therefore rejecting the defence’s request to continue with this line of questioning.
 Debono shifted his questions to asking Milenović about her work with PwC, in Serbia, but was shut down by the court. “PwC assisted with the [Vitals Global Healthcare] investigation. She used to be a consultant there,” the lawyer said.
 Madame Justice Grima asked Milenović whether she had been aware of the firm’s involvement in the inquiry. “I had searched at the very beginning but saw nothing significant,” replied the expert witness.
 “So you’re telling us that your involvement with the firm is not significant?” asked the lawyer. Milenović pointed to two specific paragraphs in her report which dealt with PwC and explained that she had not found the firm’s involvement significant at that stage.
 The court stopped Debono from probing the witness further, remarking that “the law doesn’t even contemplate you cross-examining the witness, which the court is allowing in the circumstances, but attacking the qualifications of the expert is a stretch too far. Even if I were to conclude that she is not qualified, I would still proceed on the basis of what I have before me,” remarked the judge.
 “How she was appointed in the inquiry was irrelevant,” said the judge. “Admissibility of expert evidence is a subject that must be tackled at a later stage, before the court that will be deciding that issue.”
 Franco Debono grills witness
 Debono asked Milenović to identify other instances in her report which mention the defendant Kevin Deguara
 The court pointed out that Deguara did not feature in the application before it, except as a representative of DF Advocates. The witness confirmed there was no direct mention of Deguara in her report.
 Deguara was indirectly mentioned due to his connection with DF Advocates, acting as TCSP and professional intermediary. 
 At that point Debono’s agitation increased, accusing the witness of trying to obscure the truth and insult the defence’s intelligence.
 Milenović said a lot of different entities had been involved, with several related emails and communications in which Kevin Deguara had received or sent.
 The judge asked Milenović whether she was aware of the distinction between DF Advocates and DF Consulting. That was not the expert’s focus, she replied. “My focus was more on the role of the different advocates, consultants – legal and financial – who gave assistance to this scheme being structured.”
 “I didn’t indicate amounts in my reports related to either Deguara or Farrugia. With regards to DF Advocates, the only involvement [I saw] was in structuring and participation, helping..in that respect.”
 When asked whether Kenneth Deguara had been mentioned in her report, she replied that he hadn’t mentioned him.
 Asked whether the law firm had received funds from the government or whether they were just an instrument used to move money between the key players, Milenović replied: “In my report more the role of the helpers. I didn’t establish the links of the payments to DF Advocates… I didn’t mention any money flows to DF Advocates. It was involved in structuring.”
 After the cross-examination ended and the video link to Milenović was disconnected, Debono complained that she had been evasive in her testimony. “She named Kevin Deguara as one of the key players and not one word on his involvement. This is unacceptable.”
 Lawyer Stefano Filletti suggested that even if Milenović’s report was expunged from the proceedings challenging the freezing order, this would not affect the case deciding the defendants’ guilt or otherwise. “We have a person without a warrant, wIth a degree in geophysics and a certificate from somewhere in America, telling us about a professional issue. The FATF is relevant, but only to Malta as a State, which must then translate its directives into law,” submitted the lawyer.
 The court repeated that issues of admissibility of evidence and the competence or otherwise of experts could not be raised at this stage of the proceedings. 
 Judge Grima explained to the defence that if she decided to expunge the report because she wasn’t convinced of the expertise of the person who drew it up, the defence would “surely then raise the matter in the case [deciding guilt or innocence] and call it ‘a fact that had been declared by the court in other proceedings’”, said the judge. “When a court discards evidence it must give a reason for doing so.”
 Expert witness unavailable
 Earlier, at the start of the hearing, forensic accountant Jeremy Harbinson, expected to testify in the Vitals Global Healthcare fraud case, could not be reached when the court attempted to establish a video call in today’s sitting. It is understood that Harbinson had not replied to the court’s request to testify. 
 Harbinson had previously sent a representative of his firm to testify in his stead, when he was called to testify in a related case that is challenging the €20 million freezing orders issued against the Pakistani businessman  Shaukat Ali Chaudry and his wife Aasia Parveen Shaukat.
 Instead, forensic accountant Miroslava Milenović, appointed to assist the inquiry, was cross-examined by defendant Deborah Chappell’s lawyer Joseph Mizzi about a €40 million freezing order against his client. 
 The defendants in the VGH case are all challenging the scale of the freezing orders imposed against them, calling the court-appointed experts to testify as to how they quantified the alleged theft  in the VGH procurement.
 Milenović is a forensic accountant certified by regulatory bodies in both the US and UK bodies for the past 20 years.
 Replying to Mizzi as to how she had quantified the €5 million allegedly paid to defendant company Technoline as laundered monies, Milenović – testifying by video call – ran a search in her report for the words ‘5 million’, ‘Technoline’ and ‘Deborah Chappell’, yet yielded no results.
 Madame Justice Edwina Grima, presiding over the proceedings, explained that this was one of the amounts specified in the inquiry as being linked to Chappell. “I think it was not one of the conclusions of my report,” replied the witness.
 Milenović said her conclusion mentioned the key players in the VGH scheme, and that this scheme was not possible to be carried out without the help of others, “whom I mentioned.” Chappell’s name was one of them, Milenović said. “In this respect… I mentioned these people as professional helpers, corporate service providers, and in that respect I mentioned Deborah Chappell.”
 When suggested that Chappell was actually VGH’s in-house counsel, and therefore falling outside the remit of the Prevention of Money Laundering Regulations, Milenović said she was a TCSP (Trust or Company Service Provider), as described by the FATF.
 Mizzi pointed out the obligations of a TCSP were different to those of an in-house counsel.
 The court was told Milenović’s report stated that money had flowed from Steward Healthcare LLC and later that it originated from the government of Malta. “The money transferred by Steward or Accutor came from only one source, and that was the government of Malta,” replied the witness.
 Mizzi suggested that €2.5 million had originated from the US company, pointing to a letter in the inquiry which stated that Accutor AG had received €4 million from Steward between 2018 and 2019. “Could the money have not actually come from Malta but from the United States?” asked the lawyer.
 “I don’t think so,” Milenović replied. “The money came from the government of Malta… maybe some other money came from Accutor. Looking at the money flows, I said that it was likely that Accutor had paid the money which it had received from the government to Deborah Chappell.” This emerged from bank records, she added.
 She added that the government had paid VGH and then Steward, who paid Steward LLC’s parent company, who then sent the money to Accutor AG in Switzerland. “There were also transfers from Steward Malta to Steward LLC, as well as between Steward and the government.”
 Milenović explained that these payments emerged from bank statements from Switzerland.
 Who are the defendants and what are they accused of?
 The former Minister for Health Chris Fearne and the former Minister for the Economy Edward Scicluna are charged alongside Ronald Mizzi, Alfred Camilleri, and Joseph Rapa, and lawyers Kenneth Degurara, Kevin Deguara, Jean Carl Farrugia, Deborah Anne Chappell, Bradley Gatt, Aron Mifsud Bonnici, James Camenzuli, Emmanuel Castagna and Robert Borg, as well as DF Advocates, accused of defrauding the Government of Malta. 
 Fearne, Scicluna, Mizzi, Camilleri, Rapa and Chappell are additionally accused of misappropriation to the detriment of the Government of Malta. Mizzi, Camilleri and Rapa alone are accused of committing a crime which they had been duty bound to prevent.
 Chappell is also being charged with money laundering, in her personal capacity, together with Kenneth Deguara personally and in his role as Chief Financial Officer of DF Advocates, Kevin Deguara and Jean Carl Farrugia in their personal capacities and as representatives of DF Advocates.
 Mifsud Bonnici, Castagna, Chappell, Kevin Deguara and Farrugia are further accused of, in their personal capacity and as representatives of DF Advocates, having actively participated in a criminal organisation of over 10 people between 2013 and 2023.
 More charges, relating to conspiracy to commit a crime punishable by imprisonment are being faced by Chappell, Mifsud Bonnici, Deguara, Farrugia and DF Advocates. Chappell and Deguara also being accused of falsifying financial documents to cover up for a crime, as well as falsifying VAT records.

"Attorney General 'sabotaging' Joseph Muscat prosecution, NGO alleges",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/attorney-general-sabotaging-joseph-muscat-prosecution-ngo-alleges.1092273,05-10-2024,000892.png,"Attorney General Victoria Buttigieg is ""sabotaging"" the prosecution against Joseph Muscat, Repubblika said on Friday.
 In a judicial protest, the rule of law NGO claimed Buttigieg was not even trying to hide her efforts to help the ex-prime minister, by offering him ""privileged"" access to the findings of the hospitals inquiry. 
 Repubblika, in a judicial protested authored by lawyer Jason Azzopardi, lamented that its own efforts to gain access to the inquiry, which it instigated in 2019, have been twice rejected. 
 Muscat is among a raft of people set to face money-laundering and corruption charges linked to the hospitals deal. 
 Repubblika accused the Attorney General of ""ordering"" the State Advocate not to appeal a recent court decision granting Muscat access to the parts of the inquiry where he is mentioned. 
 On Thursday, Judge Giovanni Grixti ordered the Attorney General to present every document in the inquiry’s records about the former prime minister. 
 Repubblika said the Attorney General had agreed to hand over the documents to Muscat before the four-day window to appeal Grixti's decision had even elapsed. 
 The NGO said the Attorney General deposited ""every single page and document"" in which Muscat is mentioned, including ""documented proof about his money-laundering"". 
 Muscat vehemently denies any wrongdoing. 
 Repubblika said that while the Attorney General wanted Muscat to have the advantage of ""privileged"" access, its own demands for the inquiry findings had been refused. 
 The NGO said the inquiry's findings are of national interest, and should be published immediately. 
 Repubblika warned it would be holding Buttigieg personally responsible for going out of her way to ""help criminals"", instead of upholding her oath of office. 
 The fallout from the inquiry continued on Friday, with deputy prime minister Chris Fearne announcing his resignation. 
 Fearne, a former health minister, is set to face fraud charges in connection with the deal.

Joseph Muscat to be charged with bribery and criminal association,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/joseph-muscat-charged-bribery-criminal-association.1092078,21-06-2024,"000895.png,000896.png,000897.png","Updated 6pm
 Malta's former prime minister Joseph Muscat, his chief-of-staff Keith Schembri, ex-minister Konrad Mizzi, and 19 other individuals and companies will be charged with money laundering, corruption, bribery and a host of other serious crimes, Times of Malta can confirm.
 It is the first time in Maltese political history that a former prime minister will be made to answer for criminal charges in court. 
 The charges revolve around a deal to privatise three state hospitals that was negotiated and managed by Muscat's government. That deal was annulled by a court last year. 
 Muscat, Mizzi and Schembri stand accused of money laundering, bribery, trading in influence and a long list of other charges, including setting up a criminal association.
 If found guilty, the trio face jail sentences of up to 18 years and fines of up to €2.5 million. 
 
 Prosecutors allege that they received bribes from David Meli, a lawyer who represented hospitals concessionaires Steward Health Care and who is also among those charged. 
 Brian Tonna and  Karl Cini of Nexia BT are alleged to have helped Muscat, Mizzi and Schembri commit those crimes. 
 Schembri is separately charged with having sought personal advantages that he was not entitled to, and of having made unlawful or excessive claims. 
 Emails produced by Steward in their appeal last year revealed how the former OPM chief of staff played a key, albeit hidden, role in the negotiation process.
 That role is further confirmed by criminal charges filed against him, which allege Schembri took a private interest in an adjudication or contract, resulting in fraud to the detriment of government. 
 Prosecutors from the Attorney General's office have filed criminal charges against him in both in his personal capacity as well as a representative of three companies: Kasco Engineering, FSV Ltd and Sciacca Grill.   
 Sciacca Grill owner Noel Zammit told Times of Malta that Schembri has nothing to do with his business.  
 Other figures facing charges for major crimes include Steward's auditor Christopher Spiteri, its IT manager  Clarence John Conger-Thompson, lawyer  Jonathan Vella,  medical equipment supplier  Ivan Vassallo and his business partner  Mario Victor Gatt, businessman  Pierre Sladden, former Progress Press director  Adrian Hillman and Mtrace Ltd CEO  Brian Bondin.
 Spiteri served as auditor for Vitals Global Healthcare, the company which was originally awarded the lucrative hospitals deal. Prosecutors allege that he filed false declarations and took false oaths, divulged confidential material and under-declared income made by Vitals investors such as Shaukat Ali Chaudary and others.  
 Vella represented Vitals' parent company Bluestone Investments and is also accused of having formed part of a criminal association, making false declarations and use of false documents, among other things. 
 Vassallo faces multiple, similar charges in both a personal capacity and as a representative of Technoline, Eurabytes Ltd and Gateway Solutions Ltd. The same goes for his business partner Gatt. 
 Sladden and Hillman face charges in their personal capacities, while Bondin faces charges in both his personal capacity and as Mtrace director. 
 Muscat quickly reacted to details of the criminal charges. 
 ""If they weren't so serious, they'd be funny,"" he said of the charges. ""I am going to relish destroying each and every one of these charges and proving how they are built on fantasy and lies.""
  Muscat said the criminal charges alleged that he ""took €30 million.""
 That is a reference to a section of the legal document, related to prosecutors' asset freezing requests, which lists a monetary sum alongside the name of each accused person. 
 Prosecutors requested a freezing order of €30 million against Muscat, Schembri, Mizzi and four others - Spiteri, Vella, Hillman and Sladden. That is the maximum amount that will be frozen for each of those cited, and does not necessarily reflect the amount of assets identified for each of them. 
 On Monday, Prime Minister Robert Abela shot down suggestions that Muscat or any other individual had pocketed €30 million through the fraud.
 The single-largest freezing order targets Steward lawyer Meli and is of €32 million. 
 Other freezing orders have been filed against Tonna and Cini (€20 million),  Bondin, (€12 million), Vassallo (€11 million), Gatt (€7 million) and Conger-Thompson (€1 million). 
 Prosecutors have also filed charges against a number of companies owned by individuals cited for criminal prosecution.
 They include Kasco Engineering, FSV Ltd, Sciacca Grill Ltd, Mtrace Ltd, Technoline Ltd, Eurybates Ltd, Nexia BT, Gateway Solutions and Taomac Ltd. 
 
 While the group of 23 stand accused of major crimes, they are not the only ones to stand accused of criminal acts in relation to the hospitals deal. 
 A second group of indictees will see deputy prime minister Chris Fearne, Central Bank governor (and former minister) Edward Scicluna and a host of former government permanent secretaries and lawyers face  charges of fraud. 
  That group includes top civil servants Alfred Camilleri, Joseph Rapa and Ronald Mizzi, as well as lawyers who represented the government, Steward and Vitals. 
 Camilleri was the finance ministry's permanent secretary for over a decade. Rapa fulfilled that role within the health ministry while Mizzi was the top civil servant under Konrad Mizzi. 
 Times of Malta can also confirm that Magistrate Rachel Montebello has been assigned to preside over their cases.
 Montebello, who specialises in money laundering cases, was assigned the high-profile cases on Tuesday morning and is expected to set arraignment dates and notify the people facing charges later this week.
 Criminal charges were filed in court on Monday afternoon and leaked on Tuesday. 
 Muscat, who will be defended in the case by a legal team made up of Vincent Galea, Charlon Gouder, Ishmael Psaila and Etienne Borg Ferranti, has described the charges as a ""personal vendetta"" and an ""abomination"". 
 Mizzi and Schembri have not commented on the case. They are both expected to be represented by lawyers Edward Gatt and Mark Vassallo. 
 The criminal charges are based on the findings of a magisterial inquiry that was concluded late last month. 
 That inquiry remains secret and it is therefore still unclear on what basis each of the respective charges has been filed.

'We will not accept this' Law students slam PM's criticism of judiciary,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/we-accept-this-law-students-slam-pm-criticising-judiciary.1092086,21-06-2024,"000901.png,000902.png,000903.png,000904.png,000905.png,000906.png","The Prime Minister has a responsibility not to pit the judiciary against the public with his statements, law students said in a demonstration outside the law courts on Tuesday. 
 Robert Abela’s statements clearly indicate that the government believes the judiciary institution is against the people, Għaqda Studenti tal-Liġi (GħSL) president Andrew Drago said. 
  He was addressing a crowd of students, politicians, and activists who protested outside the law courts in Valletta over attacks on the judiciary in the wake of the publication of the Vitals magisterial inquiry report.
 Several students, mainly hailing from the law course, and others turned up on Tuesday evening to express their anger at Abela’s statements and to show their solidarity with the judiciary.
 Many held placards reading “No one is above the law” and “Students for justice”.
  Several politicians also showed up in support, including PN leader Bernard Grech, PN MEP David Casa, and PN MP Eve Borg Bonello, who is also a law student.
 Independent MEP candidate Arnold Cassola and Robert Aquilina, a member of rule of law group Repubblika, were all in attendance.
 On Monday Abela held a press conference to confirm that prosecutors have filed  criminal charges against his predecessor Joseph Muscat and others.
 His comments earned him rebuke from NGOs, who said that his comments were 'authoritarian' and a 'threat to democracy', particularly those directed at  Magistrate Gabriella Vella, who oversaw the magisterial inquiry into the sale of the hospitals to Vitals.
 Earlier on Tuesday, Times of Malta confirmed Muscat, his chief-of-staff Keith Schembri, ex-minister Konrad Mizzi, and 19 other individuals and companies will be  charged with money laundering, corruption and bribery and other serious crimes. 
  Speaking outside the law courts, beside a large picture of Daphne Caruana Galizia, Drago said when Abela is speaking during a press conference, he is not speaking as a lawyer or for himself, but as a representative of the government. 
 “The position the Prime Minister adopted yesterday was clear, that these institutions (law courts) are working against the public,” he said. 
 “We, as GħSL, will not accept this. If Abela does not trust the magistrate, why does he not go to the Commission for the Administration of Justice? We know why because his reasons for undermining the inquiring magistrate are unreasonable and not based on anything apart from political gain.”
 He called on the students to not allow the government to touch the courts. 
 “We believe too much in the rule of law and we students will not allow you to touch this institution,” Drago ended his speech.
 “My appeal to the government is that you need to realise you are the state and you need to defend us, not political partisan.”
  Student and GħSL vice president Laura Chetcuti Dimech slammed Abela’s comments and attacks on the judiciary, especially after his thesis reflects on judicial interference. 
 “A judge must be free from political or other pressures,” Chetcuti Dimech read, quoting Abela’s 2002 Maltese LL.D thesis titled ‘Judicial Accountability and Impeachment”.
  “If you want to read it, this thesis was written by Robert Abela,” she said, as the crowd erupted in claps and cheers. 
 Abela has repeatedly argued that, by law, Vella should have concluded her inquiry within 60 days and that the four-year period it took her to complete work on the Vitals one was “exaggerated”. 
 But Chetcuti Dimech said that inquiries take longer to conclude due to the other works a magistrate must follow, and due to the limited pool of court experts available, meaning the compilation of reports is delayed. 
 The protest was also addressed by KSU president Luke Bonanno, GħSL policy officer Michael Spiteri and Kunsill Nazzjonali taż-Żghażagħ national officer Sarah Xuereb.

"Department of contracts was not involved in the Vitals Concession, former Director General confirms",maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/132408/department_of_contracts_was_not_involved_in_the_vitals_concession_former_director_general_confirms,22-11-2024,000919.png,"Former Director General of the Department of Contracts, Anthony Cachia, confirmed that the department was not involved in the Vitals concession since, at the time, the department would not involve itself in public service concession.

 Criminal proceedings against former deputy prime minister Chris Fearne, former minister Edward Scicluna and others resumed on Friday morning before the Court presided over by Magistrate Leonard Caruana.

                     The sitting began with lead prosecutor Francesco Refalo informing the Court that Samuel Sittlington, a forensic expert involved in the inquiry, was not able to testify under cross-examination in person, but was ready to do so via video-conferencing. Magistrate Caruana offered the defence lawyers the choice of making oral submissions on the matter during the same sitting or written submissions within one week.

 Following a short suspension of the sitting, defence lawyer Stephen Tonna Lowell informed the Court that a written response, in due time, would be preferable. This was the collective sentiment of the defence lawyers.

 The first witness to take the stand was financial controller Bernice Bugeja, who informed the Court that she was asked to present invoices of payments to experts. She informed the Court that whilst certain invoices related to the case at hand, several others, around 40% off-hand, pertained to unrelated magisterial inquiries. These could not be divulged.

 The Court ruled that only those relevant, ‘easily presentable’ invoices be presented.

 Deputy Registrar Marbeck Spiteri also took the stand, presenting the proceedings of the civil case filed by Adrian Delia against the government, leading to the recission of the contract by the Civil Court.

 At this juncture, defence lawyer Tonna Lowell argued that the prosecution should explain the probatory relevance of these proceedings. Whilst prosecution lawyer Refalo said that the evidence was being presented for the sake of completeness, the defence lawyers collectively objected, arguing that said evidence lacks probatory value and that the defendants were not involved in the civil proceedings.

 Defence lawyer Franco Galea pointed out that should the prosecution decide to rest on such proof, it must indicate against which defendants such proof is to be used.

 The Court accepted the admissibility of the proceedings.

 Former DoC director testifies

 During his testimony, former director general of the Department of Contracts Anthony Cachia told the Court that in 2016, relevant laws were introduced regarding the regulation of public service concessions.

 Prior to this date, the department of contracts did not involve itself in such concessions.

 The Court heard that during a meeting in 2015 attended by Cachia and others, the hospital concession was deemed to qualify as a public service concession, with the result that Projects Malta, rather than the department, involved itself in the management of the tender process.

 Roderick Livori, a Planning Authority unit manager, presented information on the invoices and payments associated with the Vitals applications. Of these, the majority involved payments made by, or on behalf of, Ram Tumuluri.

 Following his testimony, several witnesses on behalf of a number of banks including Bank of Valletta, APS, HSBC, BNF, Sparkasse Bank, and Lidion Bank, took the stand and submitted documents relating to the accused and their respective bank account statements.

 The case was adjourned to 17 January 2025, at 9.30am, making this the last sitting for the year.     ",Thomas Cilia ,court_and_police

 The warning by the Institute of Financial Services Practitioners, Malta Institute of Accountants, Malta Institute of Taxation and the Society of Trusts and Estate Practitioners follows scorn heaped by Robert Abela and Joseph Muscat on a magistrate and her inquiry into the Vitals' hospitals deal.
 That magisterial inquiry triggered criminal charges against top political figures including Muscat, his chief of staff Keith Schembri, former health minister Konrad Mizzi, deputy prime minister Chris Fearne and central bank governor Edward Scicluna.
 Abela repeatedly claimed the magistrate purposely delayed the conclusions, that the inquiry was biased and that sections of the judiciary were part of an ""establishment"" that was out to destroy the Labour Party.
 His comments earned him rebuke from NGOs,  law students,  employers and  President Myriam Spiteri Debono among others.
 On Friday the financial services bodies said such statements and actions undermined the independence and proper functioning of the country’s democratic institutions and also the public’s confidence in the judiciary.
 “Attacks on the rule of law, members of the judiciary, or the judicial process itself are unacceptable in a democratic society,"" they said, warning of ""untold repercussions that could have a severe, detrimental and lasting effect on the social well-being and stability of Malta"".
 Like the Chamber of SMEs, they also sounded the alarm about irreparable damage to the island's reputation in the eyes of current and future investors, economic operators, practitioners in the financial services industry and assessors.
 The financial services bodies said the judiciary deserved the highest respect and should be allowed to function with “complete serenity”.  
 “Any doubts should be addressed through the proper institutional channels that exist in a democratic country like Malta, such as the Commission for the Administration of Justice and certainly not via the media or political platforms,” they said.
 The four financial services professional associations said their sector had been painstakingly built over 35 years, was a major contributor to Malta’s economy and a large employer.
 “Any damage to our reputation as a stable, robust, and serious financial centre will negatively affect the country as a whole,” they said as they called on the authorities to act responsibly while upholding the principles of the rule of law, good governance and full respect for the country’s judiciary and the constitution.
 The Malta Union of Bank Employees separately denounced the attacks, calling for “a strict hands-off the law courts and the judiciary” and urging for “unconditional prudence and caution”.
 The union also condemned anyone instigating people to take to the streets at such sensitive times as it can only cause harm. 
 The PN has called a public protest linked to the Vitals hospitals scandal on Monday.
 The union of bank employees said that “anything short of good governance will seriously jeopardize our nation’s credibility and stability, posing serious potential risk to the country’s current and future wellbeing"".
 When asked about its position on Central Bank governor Edward Scicluna, the union told Times of Malta he should either suspend himself or resign.
 This also applies to anyone mentioned in the charges who holds public office, it said.

Court throws out second request to declare Lilu King arrest invalid,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/132065/court_throws_out_second_request_to_declare_lilu_king_arrest_invalid,31-10-2024,000932.png,"A court has rejected a second request by Lilu King’s defence lawyers to declare his arrest invalid.

 In a decree issued on Thursday, Magistrate Gabriella Vella declared that the arrest of Mohamed Ali Ahmed Elmushraty, also known as Lilu King, was valid. This was the second attempt by his defence team to have his arrest declared invalid.

                     Lilu King is being charged with causing light injuries and breaching court-imposed conditions. The court heard last week that the incident arose from a misunderstanding in Arabic between Elmushraty and the victim. 

 Following the submission of medical certificates by the prosecution, the charge sheet was amended to reflect the injuries as grievous rather than light, with authorisation from Magistrate Kevan Azzopardi.

 Lawyer José Herrera argued that Elmushraty’s arrest was “totally illegal,” stating that a person may only be detained either by court order or due to an illegal arrest, not as part of judicial processes. 

 Lawyer Franco Debono added that Elmushraty was arrested based on bail conditions, though proceedings are yet to begin. Lawyer Jose Herrera reiterated that Elmushraty is neither accused nor charged, further emphasising the invalidity of Elmushraty’s arrest

 Inspector Eman Hayman stated that an expert had confirmed the injuries as “grievous”. He explained that the case proceeded under an arrest warrant, issued through a court application. He added that the Court, on 19 October 2024, was informed that the reason for Elmushraty’s arrest was not only due to the injuries but also for allegedly breaching bail conditions.

 Franco Debono concluded the defence’s statements saying that while the proceedings on the ‘light injury’ charge have ended, the proceedings on ‘grevious injury’ still need to begin.

 Debono informed the magistrate that he would be filing an application of habeas corpus, an action to examine the legality of a person’s detention under arrest. “Do what you have to do,” replied the magistrate.

 Lawyer Jose Herrera, Franco Debono, Martina Herrera, and Adriana Zammit were defence counsel.

Six years jail for DJ who raped 19-year-old language student,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/six-years-jail-dj-raped-19year-old-language-student.1093929,14-06-2024,000947.png,"A DJ who persuaded a 19-year-old English language student to go to his apartment where he raped her, ignoring her lack of consent, was condemned to a six-year effective jail term. 
 The rape took place on a Saturday night in October 2021 when Henry Alonso Cano Rojas, a then-32-year-old Columbian national working as a DJ at a Paceville club, asked the victim to go with him at around 3am. He did not say where he was going.
 The teen had spent the evening dancing and drinking with her friends at the club where they went every day during their stay in Malta. 
 She had approached the DJ, asking him to play some songs and danced with her friend close to the DJ stand. 
 At closing time, the teens lingered inside for a while, waiting for the crowd of clubbers to exit the premises. 
 Then, as the young woman and her friends stepped outside, the DJ grabbed her hand and told her to go with him. 
 “I don’t want to go with you. I have to stay with my friends. I cannot come,” the victim complained. 
 But the accused insisted.
 He momentarily let her go when she signalled to a female friend in Dutch that she needed help. 
 Her friend intervened and manoeuvred the victim away from the man whose attitude “annoyed” the subject of his attention. However, since her friends were around, she felt safe.
 As soon as her friend left her side to buy a pizza, the man grabbed her hand and pulled her to an apartment block nearby. 
 He asked her to help carry his bag of musical equipment upstairs and she accepted, never suspecting what she had let herself in for. She later rued that ""decision”.
 He told her to place his bag inside the bedroom and though reluctant, she stepped inside.
 That was when he shut the door and told her to have a look at the view from his bedroom balcony. 
 “Ok, nice, but I really need to leave right now,” the victim said. 
 As she turned to leave, he began to kiss her and pushed her onto the bed. 
 All her efforts to stop his unwelcome advances were futile. 
 Gripped by panic, she “just froze”.
 When recounting her ordeal she explained that “the only thing [she] could do was looking up to the ceiling like a lifeless body”.
 She just did not know “what to do anymore”. She managed to break free and stop the sexual act abruptly when the phone in her bag, lying on her chest, rang. 
 It was one of her friends calling to check on her. 
 The only thing she could say when she caught up with her friends outside the accused’s apartment block was “rape” in Dutch. 
 The next day the accused texted her, saying he was “sorry about last night”.
 He said he was “really drunk” and did not “remember anything”.
 She eventually filed a police report after confiding in her parents. Her father immediately caught a flight to Malta and went with her to the police. 
 The DJ was charged with rape and holding the alleged victim against her will. 
 He pleaded not guilty and opted to testify in the proceedings.
 The man said he had met the victim six or seven times over a span of three weeks.
 He had played her songs and they had danced together. 
 Her attitude made him feel that there was “something special between them” and he insisted that the sex was consensual. 
 When delivering judgment, the court, presided over by magistrate Rachel Montebello, observed that two conflicting versions of events did not necessarily mean that the accused was to be acquitted.
 In this case, after delving into the testimonies and all other evidence put forward, the court concluded that the victim’s version was more credible. 
 There were certain inconsistencies in the accused’s version.
 DNA evidence supported the victim’s version when saying that the sudden ringing of her phone had forced the accused to stop abruptly and get off her. 
 CCTV footage also showed him holding her hand as he led her to his apartment and friends’ testimonies corroborated the victim’s version. 
 There was nothing strange about the fact that the victim went back to the club after the incident, the court said. 
 She had frequented the place with her circle of friends while visiting the island as a language student.
 When all was considered, there was no room for equivocation that the victim was not consenting to any intimacy, let alone to sex, and the accused could not have failed to understand that. 
 The court also observed that if a party withdrew consent at any stage, even midway through the sexual act, making this clear to the other party and the latter persisted, then he was still guilty of rape.
 When all was considered, the court pronounced a conviction, condemning the accused to a six-year effective jail term and ordering his name to be included in the sex offenders’ register once judgment was final.

"Hospitals inquiry concluded, 78 boxes of evidence passed on to Attorney General",maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/128926/hospitals_inquiry_concluded_370_boxes_of_evidence_passed_on_to_attorney_general,30-04-2024,000950.png,"The magisterial inquiry into the sale of three public hospitals to Vitals Global Healthcare is complete and has been delivered to the Attorney General.
 This emerged in court on Tuesday from the testimony of the Registrar of the Criminal Courts Franklin Calleja.
 “The inquiry was concluded and closed last Thursday; it went to the AG on 25 April,” Calleja told Mr Justice Giovanni Grixti.
 The day coincided with the day when the nominations for European and local elections opened. Nominations closed on Monday at 7pm.
 Calleja was testifying in the case instituted by former prime minister Joseph Muscat to remove the inquiring magistrate.
 Asked by Muscat’s lawyer Vince Galea to explain the mechanics of the process, the registrar said the procès-verbal, after being exhibited in the registry, is sent together with all exhibits to the AG. Calleja said 78 boxes of evidence had been sent together with the inquiry.
 So far, no information about the outcome of the inquiry has emerged, but the hostile stance adopted by Prime Minister Robert Abela last Sunday suggests an unfavourable outcome for his party.
 Abela accused the judiciary of “political terrorism”, a statement repeated by Muscat to reporters as he entered the law courts on Tuesday morning.

 In court on Tuesday, Galea asked Mr. Justice Grixti to order the exhibition of the inquiry file in these proceedings, asking the judge to bear in mind “that the AG was also a party in this case.” The law gives the AG discretion to refuse him access to the inquiry, he added. “She hasn’t said that so far,” the judge shot back.
 Muscat had not received the initial report of a crime and had not been indicated in it, Galea said . This, together with the fact that the Magistrate had refused to Muscat's request that she recuse herself, all imbued Muscat with juridical interest in the inquiry, argued Galea, telling the court that unless the request was upheld, there would be a likelihood of a breach of fundamental rights.
 The Constitution and ECHR both empowered the court to take action when a breach of fundamental rights is likely, he said. “So we cannot just wait for the court to decide and then order him to be returned to the position he was before the breach of rights took place.”
 The lawyer also claimed inequality of arms. “I am currently in a position where I will have to make suppositions before the court while another party to the case, the AG, has a document in her possession which allows her to counter us without showing her hand…How can I prove details in the inquiry record without having seen it, but the other side has?”
 Lawyer James D’Agostino, representing the State Advocate, replied that the law establishes a procedure in the law which gives the AG discretion to decide whether or not to grant a party’s request for access to the inquiry. It also set up a procedure for redress if the party felt aggrieved by that decision. Although the court had wide ranging powers, it still had to stay within the parameters established by the law, he said. 
 But Muscat’s lawyer asked that the disgraced former Prime Minister be returned to the position he had been in before the inquiry’s conclusion - which would necessitate the replacement of the inquiring magistrate and the inquiry starting afresh.
 “If the court is convinced that there was a breach of rights, it must put the complainant in the position he had been in before the breach took place. You have to change the inquiring magistrate. You might say ‘what’s done is done,’ but…the court can take you back to any stage of the proceedings.”
 He repeated that Muscat had not been mentioned in the initial report about the crime, but the Judge deftly replied that Muscat had simply become a person of interest in the inquiry at a late stage. 
 “The AG has powers and duties established by law, which is equal for all,” submitted the State Advocate, accusing Muscat’s lawyers of trying to “pull the rug” from beneath the court..“We cannot deviate from the law. From his arguments I understand that the applicant is expecting us to ignore the law, and is also questioning the authority of the court in Strasbourg.”
 “If we were to act differently to the norms established by the European Court of Human Rights, then some local lawyer will pipe up and say we are breaching his fundamental rights. So it is wise that our courts follow legal doctrines established by Strasbourg.” 
 The conditions specified in the interim measure were clear and specific, D’Agostino said. “We cannot go beyond them, or we are risking affecting the case on the merits.”
 The court, having heard the lengthy technical submissions on the requests for both requests, adjourned the proceedings to May 9, when it will issue its decree on the requests.

Court expert Sam Sittlington asks to testify remotely in Vitals case,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/court-expert-sam-sittlington-testify-remotely-vitals-case.1101385,22-11-2024,000956.png,"Court expert Sam Sittlington is asking to testify remotely in the Vitals case, as a court heard on Friday that he cannot appear in person.
 The case against former Deputy Prime Minister Chris Fearne, former Finance Minister Edward Scicluna, and others charged with ""lesser crimes"" connected to the hospital deal scandal continued with Magistrate Leonard Caruana presiding. During the hearing, experts presented invoices, bank statements, and court judgments.
 Lead prosecutor Francesco Refalo informed the court that Sittlington, a forensic expert who worked on the Vitals inquiry, would not be available for in-person cross-examination. Instead, he requested to testify via video conferencing. The court acknowledged the request, and submissions on the matter will be made in writing.
 Sittlington is among 26 forensic analysts and experts whose involvement is being contested by the defendants. He has faced pressure from the defence team, which accused him of  leveraging his role as a court expert to secure a lucrative position as a police consultant.
 The accused include former Health Minister Chris Fearne, Central Bank Governor Edward Scicluna, and several others, including: Ronald Mizzi, 41, permanent secretary; Alfred Camilleri, 64, former permanent secretary; Joseph Rapa, 57, public official; Kenneth Deguara, 44, employee; Kevin Deguara, 47, lawyer; Jean Carl Farrugia, 48, lawyer; Deborah Anne Chappell, 37, lawyer; Bradley Gatt, 43, lawyer; Aron Mifsud Bonnici, 50, lawyer; James Camenzuli, 53, engineer; Manuel Castagna, 50, accountant; and Robert Borg, 50, auditor.
 This group includes lawyers, civil servants, and members of the adjudication committee that awarded the lucrative contract to run three state hospitals—St Luke’s Hospital, Karin Grech Hospital, and Gozo General Hospital—to Vitals Global Healthcare in 2015. Steward Healthcare assumed control of the concession in 2018.
 All defendants have pleaded not guilty to charges including fraud, misappropriation, and fraudulent gain related to the hospital deal. Unlike the first group of individuals charged in connection with the scandal, this group does not face accusations of bribery or trading in influence.
 Malta’s political sphere has been shaken since the conclusion of the Vitals inquiry in May, which led to charges against former Prime Minister Joseph Muscat and his associates for more serious crimes.
 During the session, financial controller Bernice Bugeja testified that she was tasked with examining box files of invoices. Her role involved identifying who was paid, how much, and for what, and whether payment criteria had been met. She noted that some invoices related to this case, while others pertained to unrelated magisterial inquiries. The court ruled that only relevant invoices be presented, while the others would undergo further analysis.
 Deputy registrar Marbeck Spiteri submitted court judgments from a case filed by Adrian Delia against the government of Malta. These judgments led to the annulment of the hospital privatisation deal. An appeals court confirmed the annulment, citing ""collusion between Steward and senior government officials or its agencies,"" in contrast to the initial judgment, which had attributed the fraud solely to Steward. Defence lawyers argued that these judgments were not admissible as evidence in this case.
 Anthony Cachia, former director general of the Contracts Department, testified about a meeting on March 25, 2015, with permanent secretary Ronald Mizzi and representatives from Projects Malta to discuss the hospital concession's technicalities. He explained that Malta’s accession to the EU highlighted a lack of regulation for public service concessions, leading the country to introduce relevant laws in 2016.
 During the 2015 meeting, Cachia and others determined that the hospital concession met the definition of a public service concession. Consequently, Projects Malta, rather than the Contracts Department, was tasked with managing the tender process.
 The case will continue on January 17 and 21.

Zabbar man admits to damaging car in feud with father of female 'friend',maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/131137/zabbar_man_admits_to_damaging_car_in_feud_with_father_of_female_friend,10-09-2024,000977.png,"A man from Zabbar has admitted to damaging a car belonging to the father of a female ‘friend’ of his.
 Before magistrate Caroline Farrugia Frendo on Tuesday, inspector Antonello Magri charged 58-year-old Fabian Mifsud with criminal damage, carrying a knife in public without a police permit and breaching the peace.
 Inspector Magri told the court that officers from the Zabbar police station were dispatched to deal with a report of an argument, in which a knife and metal bar had been used.
 They found Mifsud, in a highly agitated state, at the scene. The victim had told the police that he had argued with Mifsud, who then pulled a knife on him. After the victim fled, Mifsud had then proceeded to smash the windows of the victim’s car with a metal rod.
 A video of the incident is doing the rounds on social media.
 Mifsud pleaded guilty to the charges.
 His defence lawyer, Franco Debono, explained that the man had been “friendly” with the victim’s daughter - some 20 years his junior, and that the victim would “go and bother him about it.”
 “He keeps sending the police to my house,” piped up the defendant.
 The incident “was provoked by the victim’s attitude,” said the lawyer, stressing the early guilty plea in his submissions on punishment, adding that the defendant was prepared to pay for the damages.
 “The issue is that when the relationship with the daughter is not in a happy place, the man starts calling her up,” said inspector Magri.
 He echoed Debono’s suggestion of a suspended sentence, and requested a suspended sentence, as well as a restraining order in favour of the parte civile’s family.
 Finding him guilty as charged, the court sentenced Mifsud to imprisonment for six months, which were suspended for one year and ordered the man to pay €980 for the damage he had caused, within six months.
 A restraining order in favour of the victim and his wife was also issued.

Man admits to violent grocery store robbery,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/130791/man_admits_to_violent_grocery_store_robbery,19-08-2024,000982.png,"A man has been jailed and sent to rehab after he admitted to carrying out a violent robbery at a Gzira grocery store on Saturday, allegedly to finance his €7,000 monthly cocaine habit.
 Police inspector Darryl Farr, assisted by prosecutor Clive Aquilina arraigned Wyatt Zammit before magistrate Yana Micallef Stafrace on Monday.
  Zammit, 37, from Santa Lucija was charged with theft aggravated by violence, value and time, Zammit was also accused of illegally detaining the shop’s female cashier and causing her to fear that she would be subjected to violence. 
 He was further accused of breaching bail conditions that were imposed in July this year when he had been arraigned on unrelated charges.
 It is understood that the police had received a phone call from the shop in Gzira at around 9pm on 17 August, reporting that a hold-up had just taken place at the shop in question.
 The police, together with inspector Farr had gone to the scene and collected CCTV footage, from which it emerged that the suspect, who did not attempt to conceal his identity, might be Zammit. He was then arrested on Sunday.
 Sources said that after allowing a previous shopper to leave, Zammit had walked around the counter and pushed the cashier against a wall, before proceeding to help himself to the contents of the till. No weapons are believed to have been used during the robbery. Zammit was arrested on Sunday and, during a search carried out at his girlfriend’s house, the police found the clothes similar to those worn by the suspect during the robbery.
 The motive behind the robbery is believed to be the financing of Zammit’s consumption of cocaine, on which the MaltaToday is told, but is not in a position to confirm, he is spending around €7,000 every month.
 Before the sitting began, the parties were allowed to approach the bench, where they discussed the case with the magistrate for several minutes.
 After the representatives of the parties returned to their places in the courtroom, Zammit, who told the court that he was unemployed, pleaded guilty to the charges.
 In view of his admission of guilt, the court proceeded to impose a sentence of imprisonment for two years, and ordered to pay a €500 fine. The court confiscated €2,500 that he had provided as bail security in addition to the fine. Zammit was placed under a three-year treatment order and ordered to return the €436 he had stolen within six months. A three-year protection order was issued in favour of the cashier or her boss.
 “You cannot approach or talk to these people,” warned the court. “If you need to do so, speak to your lawyer or to the police inspector.”
 Prosecutor Clive Aquilina prosecuted together with police inspector Darryl Farr, while lawyer Ilona Schembri assisted Zammit as legal aid counsel.  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police
"Family gets €21,600 compensation following bus crash which left house in ‘danger of collapsing’",maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/132407/family_gets_21600_compensation_following_bus_crash_which_left_house_in_danger_of_collapsing,22-11-2024,000985.png,"The Court on Thursday ordered Malta Public Transport and one of its drivers to pay a family €21,600 in compensation after a bus crash damaging their house forced them to rent out an alternative residence.

 The crash, which took place on 23 January 2019 in Zabbar Road, Paola, caused significant damage to the family’s house, so much so that it was left in ‘danger of collapsing’. This forced the plaintiff and his family to leave the premises so that the necessary repairs could be made.

                     The Court, presided over by Justice Toni Abela recognised that there had been an admission of responsibility on the part of the defendants, noting that the case was limited merely to the amount of compensation to be granted, upon which the parties were in disagreement.

 During the proceedings it was revealed that the house in question was subsequently sold, with the new owners continuing the necessary repairs.

 The Court noted that the amount of compensation to be determined had to refer solely to the period leading up until the transfer of the property, and considered the rent payments made by the plaintiff and his family.

 The company and driver were ultimately ordered to pay €21,600 in compensation.     ",Thomas Cilia ,court_and_police
Complaints of payment disruptions following probe into Blackcatcard issuer,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/complaints-payment-disruptions-following-probe-card-issuer.1094364,26-06-2024,"000988.png,000989.png,000990.png","Customers of a payment card issued by a financial entity in Gżira that was searched by police in connection with alleged money laundering say they have been unable to access their funds for several months.
 A number of Blackcatcard customers told Times of Malta they have been unable to make bank transfers using the SEPA network – a system for transferring funds between European bank accounts – since at least February.
 The card is issued by Papaya Ltd, a company that hit the headlines, also in February, after it emerged the firm was the focal point of a large-scale investigation into an alleged “Russian-Eurasian criminal network”.
 Papaya Ltd insists SEPA services are available, with a “significant fraction” of Blackcatcard customers able to make such transfers.
  In February, Times of Malta revealed police had carried out searches of the financial entity as part of an international investigation into alleged money laundering.
  In a statement at the time, the company said the investigation reported in the media – which it said focused on some of its clients and not the company – did “not affect Papaya’s business”, stressing its operations were continuing as normal.
 But, according to its customers, this is not the case; Blackcatcard account holders say they have been unable to make Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) for months.
 They also say they have been left without an International Bank Account Number (IBAN), leaving them unable to transfer money to other bank accounts using alternative methods.
 Blackcatcard customers who spoke to Times of Malta on condition of anonymity said they have been unable to withdraw funds since around the time of the investigation, with one saying he had “no way to get it [the funds] back; SEPA is impossible now.”
 Another customer said he is a business customer of Blackcatcard, and the lack of bank transfer functionality had left his company “unable to transfer money, pay online with card or withdraw from an ATM [cash machine],” adding he had been waiting almost 40 days for the delivery of a new card from the company.
 “Our company has a pretty big sum on the account, I am very nervous already. Nothing is working properly in this institution over the last months.”
 
 He and others said they had been told by Papaya it had recently partnered with UK-based company Tompay to restore SEPA payments and was rolling out IBANs to customers “in batches”.
 But despite the promise, they have still not received an IBAN.
 “We were assured more than a month ago by phone from Papaya we will be in the first batch in connecting to new IBANs, but still nothing. Hours spent on [customer support] chat, but in vain,” the customer said.
 One corporate service provider said his client had been attempting “incessantly” to retrieve his funds and had also been left without an IBAN number after being promised one “weeks ago”.
 Blasting Papaya and Blackcatcard for “tarnishing Malta’s reputation,” he said the shareholders of his client’s company were becoming concerned over the lack of clarity.
  Meanwhile, a look at the company’s support channel on Telegram – which one customer said had recently been closed to new comments – reveals a host of ongoing complaints about the issue stretching back to February.
 Responding to questions, Papaya said it had onboarded a SEPA provider in January to provide customers with SEPA Instant transfers, with the new provider’s “embedment into the Blackcatcard ecosystem up and running as planned”.
 SEPA Instant is a quicker way of making SEPA payments introduced across the bloc in March following the adoption of a European Council regulation in February.
 It said that while a “significant fraction” of its customers were able to “enjoy their SEPA services as usual”, the company was rolling out the feature “in batches” due to the number of customers needing to be reconnected to the system.
 “The exact timeline for the complete restoration of SEPA functionality for every single client is hard to pin down... But rest assured, we are tirelessly working to speed up the process and to ensure that every client is reconnected to SEPA as swiftly as possible,” it said.
 The company said it was “not aware of the clients’ personas you are mentioning in your inquiry”, stressing its clients had “unrestricted access to their funds all the time”.
 It added that Papaya “has not ever had any accusations against its operations, ownership, management, or employees” and that it maintained a “strong working relationship” with Maltese and European authorities.
 The company reiterated that the investigation reported in the media did “not impact the functionality of the organisation or its services in any way” and said it had “no intentions of withdrawing from the Blackcatcard ecosystem”.
 When contacted, Tompay told Times of Malta it did “not comment on our relationships with clients, partners, service provi­ders, and financial institutions”.

"Judge calls on authorities to reconsider withdrawal of humanitarian protection from Ukrainian mother, daughter",maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/131356/judge_calls_on_authorities_to_reconsider_withdrawal_of_human_protection_from_ukrainian_mother_daughter_,24-09-2024,000997.png,"A judge has called upon the authorities to reconsider the decision to withdraw humanitarian protection from a Ukrainian mother and daughter that was originally granted in 2016, in a decision which however, rejected their claim that their fundamental rights had been breached by it.
 Oksana Volodymyrivna Solopko and Aryna Tsovma had filed constitutional proceedings against the International Protection Agency (IPA), the Minister responsible, as well as the State Advocate in December 2021, arguing that the agency’s decision to revoke their Temporary Humanitarian Protection (THP) was null because they were not given an opportunity to make submissions before it was taken.
  The plaintiffs argued that Malta’s Procedural Standards for Granting and Withdrawing International Protection Regulations, which was meant to implement the corresponding EU directive, did not implement the right to an effective remedy before a court or tribunal as is specified in the directive.
 They argued that in terms of the directive, any decision to withdraw a person’s international protection must be preceded by a written notice, informing that person that their protection was being reconsidered.
 It also obliged the Member State to ensure that the person under protection be given an opportunity to explain why they believe their protection should continue, either in writing or through an individual interview.
 In addition, any decision by the competent authority to revoke THP must be made in written form and include a declaration of the factual and legal reasons behind it, as well as information on how to contest it.
 They pointed out that Malta’s International Protection Act specifically precludes the possibility of doing so, stating that “no appeal shall lie from a decision by the International Protection Agency to revoke, end or not renew temporary humanitarian protection.”
 This, the plaintiffs argued, ran contrary to the fundamental legal principles of hearing both parties and of not having an arbiter decide a case in which he is also a party. They asked the court to declare that this provision of the law breached their human rights, order the reinstatement of their THP status, as well as to provide a means for them to appeal the IPA decision.
 The defendants: the IPA, the Minister responsible and the State Advocate, rebutted the claims, pointing out that the Ukrainian plaintiffs had applied for international protection in March 2016. Temporary protection had been granted the following month in order for them to be able to safely return to Ukraine or be accepted by another safe country.
 This temporary protection had been granted on the basis of internal policy, argued the defendants. In 2017, the IPA had concluded that there was no basis for their claim for international protection, because the persecution they were alleging did not correspond with the accepted definition of persecution under the Geneva Convention. Neither was there a reason to believe that their return to Ukraine would result in a serious risk of serious harm under Maltese law, they said.
 However, in view of documented improvement in the child’s asthma due to Malta’s climate, the agency had granted THP to the mother and daughter with the intention that their documentation be updated on an annual basis.
 This was the state of play until August 2021, when the agency, after consulting with the applicants’ Medical Country of Origin Information, discovered that the medicine that was being used to treat the child’s asthma was available in Ukraine’s capital city, Kyiv.  The reply adds that many places in Ukraine had good air quality, “in particular Kharkiv and Donetsk,” where the mother and daughter had previously resided.
 These factors had led the agency to conclude that the applicants could safely return to Ukraine, and on September 3, 2021 it revoked their THP on the basis that they no longer qualified it.
 The defendants argued that the right to a fair hearing did not apply because neither the agency, nor the tribunal were there to determine rights, civil obligations or criminal charges.
 In his judgement in this case, Mr. Justice Toni Abela made reference to a number of previous court decisions, both at the local and at European level, concluding amongst other things, that the right to appeal in civil matters was not the same right to appeal in the criminal law sphere. “That which is guaranteed outside the area of criminal law is the respect for the procedural safeguards to a fair hearing (the objective test) and of the integrity of the judge himself, [who should be] ideal and free of every partiality and prejudice (the subjective test).”
 “...Even the Convention allows the right to appeal as a right protected by article 6 which deals only with appeals from criminal cases and not civil ones,” said the judge.
 Quoting from a Constitutional Court decision in a similar case, he wrote:
 “In essence, the Constitutional Court observed that ‘ the entire process - both before the Agency as well as before the Tribunal - is handled as a process that it not about the determination of civil rights or obligations or criminal charges, and therefore is not subject to article 39 of the Constitution or article 6 of the Convention [which enshrine the right to a fair hearing]. 
 “Essentially, the plaintiff’s argument is based on the assertion that ‘applications for asylum status are dealt with as a civil right.’ and that the proceedings before the Tribunal are ‘procedures against her,’ which is not the case.”
 But while dismissing the woman’s case and claims on these grounds, the judge said he was “rather concerned about the fact that if the applicants are to be sent back, they would have to return to Ukraine.” Judge Abela also noted that the two places specified by the Medical Country of Origin Information as having ideal air quality were Kharkiv and Donestsk, which are currently war zones.
 “For this reason, this Court appeals to the defendants to reconsider their decision in the light of these wartime circumstances.”  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police
Gozitan-Australian billionaire Adrian Portelli faces nine charges over alleged unlawful lottery,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/132641/_gozitanaustralian_billionaire_adrian_portelli_faces_nine_charges_over_alleged_unlawful_lottery,06-12-2024,001001.png,"Gozitan-Australian ‘Lambo Guy’ Adrian Portelli is facing nine charges in South Australia of assisting in the conduct of an unlawful lottery.

 His company, Xclusive Tech Pty Ltd, which operates under the name LMCT+, is facing 10 charges for conducting or assisting in the conduct of an unlawful lottery.

                     Portelli is an Australian entrepreneur of Gozitan heritage, and recently made headlines after visiting the Maltese islands with his supercar McLaren P1. Back in April 2023, he also made headlines for buying Melbourne’s most expensive apartment – a double-storey penthouse worth €23.2 million.

 In 2018, Portelli founded LMCT+, a promotions and giveaway. The company conducts regular giveaways, with members getting entry into the draw for a monthly subscription fee.

 Last year, reports emerged that he was being investigated by Australian gambling regulators over allegations it breached gambling laws.

 His company offers members subscriptions to a “rewards club”. They also then get entries to win cars and properties.

 The model is known as a trade promotion lottery. Under South Australian law, any trade promotion lotteries with prizes exceeding $5,000 need a licence to operate and entries must be free of charge.

 Participants may have to purchase goods or services to enter, but they cannot charge more than the normal price for those goods or services.

 South Australia’s Consumer and Business Services (CBS) had investigated, and was now taking Portelli and his company to court. According to court documents, the incidents occurred between 29 January 2023 and 16 May 2024.

 The charges against Xclusive Tech (trading as LMCT+) included conducting/assisting in the conduct of an unlawful lottery through a subscription that gave entries to a lottery.

 “The major prize for the lottery was a property situated in Gisborne in the state of Victoria as seen on the Australian television show The Block, or a cash prize of $3,000,000,” court documents said. Giving away the prize “involved an element of chance” but the defendant “did not hold a licence to conduct the lottery in South Australia”.

 Two other Block properties, one valued at about $2.9m and the other not given a value were offered as prizes, with cash prizes of $2.5m and $2m respectively offered as alternatives. Another property on the Gold Coast valued at $1.3m was also a major prize.

 Other prizes mentioned included a “Devil Yellow HSV VZ” car, a “Toyota LandCruiser 79 series” car with a “barcrusher 670c” valued at $228,000, other cars, and cash prizes of $250,000 and $500,000.

 The charges against Portelli were for assisting in the conduct of a unlawful lotteries.

 Each charge for conducting, or assisting in conducting an unlawful lottery carries a maximum penalty of $10,000.

 The hearing is listed for the Adelaide magistrates court on 15 January 2025.     ",Karl Azzopardi ,court_and_police
Teen barred from handball because of his wheelchair takes association to court,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/teen-barred-handball-wheelchair-takes-association-court.1101378,22-11-2024,000756.png,"The parents of a 16-year-old boy with spina bifida have filed a judicial protest on his behalf against the Malta Handball Association (MHA), accusing it of discrimination after their son was barred from serving as a reserve player on a local handball team.
 Last month, Times of Malta reported that  Thomas Mifsud, a teenage athlete and wheelchair user, had started training at a handball club alongside his friends.
 Thomas, who described himself as an avid swimmer and a dedicated gym-goer, said he performed well during handball tryouts. His efforts earned him a spot as a reserve goalkeeper on the team.
 However, this progress was halted when it became clear that Thomas used a wheelchair. He was subsequently informed that he could not be registered as a player in the league.
 Thomas’s parents, Nicolette and Samuel Mifsud, have filed a judicial protest against the entire committee of the MHA, including Daniel Tabone, Joseph Aquilina, Adam Sule Soares, Vanessa Cutajar Mifsud, David Ruch, Guy Bischoff, and Warren Farrugia.
 The protest states that Thomas’s participation in handball training allowed him to play a sport with peers who do not have disabilities. His parents argued that his wheelchair did not pose any health or safety risks during training and was well-accepted by his teammates.
 “When the other children adjusted and began playing with Thomas just as they would with any other teammate, the training sessions went smoothly, and Thomas was enjoying the sport he loves,” the protest stated.
 Thomas’s coach selected him to serve as a substitute goalkeeper for the first under-19 league game on October 20. The team began the registration process with the MHA in line with the sport's rules.
 Less than 24 hours after submitting Thomas’s registration form, the team was informed that he could not be registered as a player because he used a wheelchair.
 According to the Mifsuds, this was the first time they heard of the MHA raising safety concerns about Thomas’s wheelchair. They claim the association only cited these concerns in media responses after the issue became public.
 The protest insists that no recognised handball rules explicitly prohibit wheelchair users from playing the sport.
 “The MHA is using these rules to justify the discrimination it is fostering by refusing to register Thomas Mifsud as a substitute goalkeeper,” the Mifsuds said in their protest.
 They also argued that Thomas’s wheelchair is specifically designed for sports and does not pose a safety risk to him or other players.
 As a goalkeeper, Thomas only occupies an 18-square-metre area, which is restricted to other players under the sport’s rules.
 The protest further noted that no complaints or concerns were raised by other parents or players.
 As a result of the decision, Thomas could not play on October 20, nor could he sit with his teammates or wear the team jersey. Instead, he was told to sit in the wheelchair-accessible spectator area, separated from his friends. Thomas chose not to attend the game.
 The Mifsuds claim the MHA’s decision violates the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the association's own safeguarding policy.
 “This decision creates a barrier for Thomas to continue practising the only sport he can play with his friends,” the parents stated.
 The Mifsuds revealed they had previously sent a legal letter to the MHA, but the issue remains unresolved.
 They have vowed to hold the MHA legally accountable unless the decision is reversed and Thomas is allowed to register as a player.
 The judicial protest was signed by lawyers Eve Borg Costanzi, Stephen Thake, and Robert Dingli.
 In previous comments to Times of Malta, the MHA maintained that it has done its utmost to include Thomas but that it must abide by the rules put in place to maintain the safety of other players. 
 At the time, they said that the Mifsuds had misinterpreted the rules of the game and while they don't specifically preclude wheelchairs, they do ban the presence of hard objects that could endanger players.

Jason Azzopardi accuses top LESA officials of transferring traffic fines onto unsuspecting tourists,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/130950/jason_azzopardi_accuses_top_lesa_officials_of_transferring_traffic_fines_onto_unsuspecting_tourists,30-08-2024,"000772.png,000773.png,000774.png","An urgent magisterial inquiry has been requested into an alleged multimillion euro racket involving top LESA officials, which fraudulently transferred penalty points incurred by Maltese drivers onto tourist rental cars.
 This involved diverting “millions of euros” in fines extracted from rental customers' deposits, into the pockets of private car rental companies, instead of the public purse.
 This and other explosive allegations emerge from a court application filed this morning by lawyer Jason Azzopardi.
 The application states that drivers who received speeding or other driving fines would approach LESA CEO Svetlick Flores and senior LESA customer care official Neville Camilleri - also a Rahal Gdid local councillor elected on a Labour Party ticket - who would use a software “backdoor” to access the LESA computer database undetected.
  From here, they would remove the contravention records and associated licence points from the “client” drivers and transfer them on to tourist rental vehicles, whose drivers would be none the wiser. 
 As the tourists’ driving licences are not Maltese, none of the licence penalty points would have any effect on them after they leave the islands.
 The racket has ingeniously created a win-win situation for all involved, bar LESA, reads the application. “The Maltese person’s licence penalty points and fine are forgiven, and his driving licence is saved. The car hire company pockets the fine deducted from the tourist’s credit card and the tourist…leaves [with no penalty points].”
 Azzopardi’s application outlines how the alleged scheme works:
 “1. The tourist goes to the car hire office, decides what car he wants and signs a contract for a period of time at an agreed price.
 2. The tourist also signs a document, declaring in advance, that if he receives a ticket for an offence which puts points on his licence, he accepts that those points would be transferred to him. “But In truth nothing will be transferred and the points will be deleted because a tourist has a foreign licence that isn’t in the Maltese driving licence database.”
 3. The tourist then pays for the rental in advance upon taking delivery of the car
 4. When taking payment for the rental, the car hire company also makes a €350 pre-authorisation on the credit card to cover future traffic fines or insurance excesses that may arise. The pre authorization is money blocked on the tourist's credit card.
 5. If a tourist commits a ticketable offence, regardless of whether they are still in Malta or not, the tourist will receive a copy of the ticket and can pay it directly on the LESA website. But the majority of tourists simply leave the matter in the hands of the car hire company, who should pay the fine on their behalf.
 6. Before the fine is paid, a declaration is sent to LESA, asking to transfer the penalty points on to the tourist.
 When dropping off a rental car, in a hurry not to miss their flights home, tourists would not question a €60 charge to their credit card for a traffic violation, much less return to Malta to contest it. 
 “In an ingenious and perfidious manner, but with almost pathological malice, this racket used common sense and organised evil, aided by an intentional lack of audit and forensic verification, in order for the public treasury to lose millions, while the corrupt line their pockets.”
 Although the scheme described was the most frequently used, Azzopardi said that there was also a second method, in which the tourist’s signature is copied from the rental contract, which LESA has a right to request, and forged on the Licence Penalty Points declaration.
 In the application, Azzopardi said that he has a number of witnesses willing to testify in the inquiry about the fact that many car rental companies are well aware of this racket which, he says, is widely used by Labour Party delegates.
 “The person making this denunciation knows that Prime Minister Robert Abela and Minister Byron Camilleri also have visibility over this racket and granted it tacit impunity to continue and entrench itself.”
 He alleged that while campaigning for last May’s local council elections, Neville Camilleri would tell people in the Rahal Gdid square to speak to anyone they know who had pending fines or licence points and recommend that they speak to him “so I can get them forgiven”.
 When such individuals would go to his LESA office, Camilleri “with the blessing, complicity and help of Svetlick Flores,” would use the backdoor access to the LESA computer system and transfer the licence points away from the Maltese person who had reached out to him, and on to a tourist “who had the misfortune of renting a car in their name, in Malta”.
 The lawyer estimated that hundreds of people had been directed by Labour Party customer care to Neville Camilleri over the last three years, for this purpose.
 Azzopardi also declared under oath that his sources include LESA insiders, who are also Labour supporters “who could not bear the filth that is emerging anymore,” as well as private car rental companies and others who bound him under professional secrecy not to reveal their identities. Some had insisted on meeting Azzopardi “at a remote and abandoned place”, so great was their fear of being identified, he said.
 In 2022 and 2023, Walid Ouhida, the owner of WT Global, whose fleet of around 360 vehicles makes it Malta’s largest cab supplier, was identified as one of the largest beneficiaries of the racket. The court application states that hundreds of penalty points were transferred away from the cab drivers he employed, on to unsuspecting tourists.
 The application calls for a magisterial inquiry to establish whether the crimes of criminal conspiracy, participation in a criminal organisation, making false declarations to a public authority, trading in influence by public officials, and money laundering specifically by Flores and Camilleri.
 Azzopardi said that although he had been collecting the information provided by several individuals since November 2023, an inquiry had to be urgently appointed to preserve the evidence. The lawyer claimed that three different sources inside LESA had informed him that a process of deleting the false database entries made by Camilleri was already underway, after Flores got wind of the leak about the racket. 
 “Just yesterday, an order was issued to the effect that every LESA employee had to sign a declaration that they had no ‘conflicts of interest’, which effectively intends to stop any employee at LESA from speaking about or revealing the web of corruption inside LESA.”
 That order emerges from an email sent yesterday by Marita Bianco, a Senior Officer and Administrator at LESA to all heads of departments at the agency. The email states that the Home Affairs Ministry was ordering them to sign the declaration. “Of all the years since LESA was set up, these declarations were ordered to be signed urgently yesterday.”
 The 61-page application requests several avenues of inquiry, in addition to the traffic fine scam. Among the suspected offences that the inquiring magistrate is asked to collect evidence about are bribery and trading in influence by Flores and Camilleri, who Azzopardi claims, had received a cut of the fraudulent fines as well as gifts and other benefits from the car rental companies involved. 
  Another offence alleged in the application is abuse of office. Azzopardi names two individuals as being employed as full time LESA officials: Mauro Bianco, whose LinkedIn profile lists as a secretariat officer at the Home Affairs Ministry, and Community Officer Anthony Tabone, together with Home Affairs Minister Byron Camilleri’s niece, Gail Mizzi - “who is supposedly employed at LESA as a summer worker but is spending [the summer] working at the Ministry for Home Affairs,” had not turned up for work at the LESA offices for months - twelve months, in Tabone and Bianco’s case -  Azzopardi said, “appearing there only once a month to hand over their timesheet in order to be paid.”
 The application requests an urgent magisterial inquiry be held in order to preserve the evidence. It cites previous court rulings which had upheld requests for what is becoming an increasingly long list of corruption-related inquiries in Malta; amongst them inquiries into the fraudulent sale of three public hospitals to Vitals Global Healthcare, Identity Malta selling Maltese ID cards to foreign nationals on the basis of forged certificates, alleged payments of kickbacks for selling Maltese citizenship to Russian nationals and the 17 Black inquiry into secret offshore companies allegedly set up to launder kickbacks.

Two remanded in custody for 146kg cocaine bust at Freeport,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/132283/two_remanded_in_custody_for_146kg_cocaine_bust_at_freeport_,14-11-2024,"000786.png,000787.png","Two men have been remanded in custody after they were arraigned and charged in connection to a significant cocaine seizure earlier this week.

 Darren Dimech, 46, and Roderick Camilleri, 44, both denied charges of drug trafficking and criminal association.

 The pair were among four arrested in a police operation in the Freeport which resulted in a 146kg drug bust.

 The accused did not request bail at this stage.

 In the short arraignment, no details emerged about what led to the arrests.

                         In a statement on Wednesday, the police said that on Tuesday afternoon led to them stopping a trailer that was just about to leave the port. After searching the vehicle, 105kg of cocaine were found hidden behind the driver’s and passenger’s seat.

 The container itself contained another 41kg of cocaine.

 The police said that the shipment came from Guayaquil in Equador, and unlike other shipments of this scale, the cocaine was meant to supply the local market.

Mile End bomb suspect to be examined by psychiatrists ahead of possible insanity plea,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/129787/mile_end_bomb_suspect_to_be_examined_by_psychiatrists_ahead_of_possible_insanity_plea,18-06-2024,000803.png,"The man accused of planting a homemade explosive device outside the Labour Party Headquarters last month is to be assessed by psychiatrists ahead of a possible insanity plea.
 18-year-old David Brincat from Santa Venera wore a blank facial expression as he sat in the dock as the compilation of evidence against him began earlier today. 
  He had been charged with a list of offences relating to terrorism and the illicit manufacture of explosives last month, following a police investigation into the discovery of an explosive device placed in a dustbin outside the Labour Party building, which traced it back to Brincat. 
 Police reportedly found TATP - a volatile homemade explosive that has been used in terrorist attacks overseas- inside the garage where Brincat was residing.
 It is understood that the police investigation also revealed that Brincat had plans to produce and plant more explosive devices with specific targets in mind.
 When the compilation of evidence against Brincat continued on Tuesday, before Magistrate Kevan Azzopardi, lawyer Nicholas Mifsud, joint defence counsel with lawyers Mario Mifsud and Lara Attard, asked the court to order a psychiatric evaluation of the defendant before the compilation of evidence proceeded any further. 
 The lawyer pointed out that since his arraignment, Brincat had been held in preventive custody at the Forensic Unit of Mount Carmel Hospital.
 Prosecuting police inspector Wayne Camilleri told the court that he had exhibited certificates indicating that Brincat had been fit for interrogation and fit for trial, but the defence said it was arguing that Brincat was insane at the time that he allegedly committed the offence.
 Magistrate Azzopardi silently read the certificate declaring Brincat fit for trial.
 Prosecutor Kaylie Bonnett asked the court, in view of the fact that the defence of insanity was being raised, to appoint a panel of three experts to examine Brincat. 
 The court was initially reluctant to do so before hearing inspector Camilleri testify about the investigation, because the relevant period of time in which the defendant was claiming to be insane had to first be established.
 Police Inspector Lydon Zammit explained that the period the police were looking at was in the 12 months preceding the incident, although “ideological discussions” go back further. 
 The court upheld the request and tasked three psychiatrists to establish whether Brincat was legally insane when he allegedly committed the crimes he is charged with.
 The panel of experts were ordered to assess the defendant and draw up a report on their findings as soon as possible.
 The case was adjourned to July for this purpose.  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police

Wednesday's 11-hour Vitals court sitting annulled over 'defective notification',timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/chris-fearne-edward-scicluna-sitting-annulled-defective-notification.1093202,30-05-2024,000851.png,"A marathon sitting during which former deputy prime minister Chris Fearne and Central Bank Governor Edward Scicluna pleaded not guilty to fraud has been annulled after one of those charged was not properly notified of the charges.
 The 11-hour session on Wednesday kick-started court proceedings against the two former ministers, three permanent secretaries and nine officials charged with fraud and other crimes allegedly linking them to the now-annulled hospitals privatisation deal. 
 As the hearing entered its tenth hour at the stage when all those charged finally registered their personal details and not guilty plea, lawyers defending DF Advocates - the last 'non-natural person' on the list - pointed out that that name was actually “just a trade name”.
 Additionally, the company number attributed to it on the charge sheet belonged to another juridical entity - DF Corporate Advisory Limited - in respect of which charges had been withdrawn earlier this month because that company did not exist at the time of the alleged crimes. 
 Faced with the defence’s arguments, prosecuting lawyers from the Attorney General’s office first insisted that DF Advocates was a body corporate duly represented at the sitting by three officials, namely Kenneth Deguara, chief financial officer, and lawyers Kevin Deguara and Jean Carl Farrugia, each of whom had been duly notified. 
 The prosecution insisted that charges against the entity would not be withdrawn as funds from criminal activity had allegedly flowed through that entity.
 “Whether a trade name or anything else, someone must answer,” argued AG lawyer Francesco Refalo.
 The defence then asked who from DF Advocates was to represent the entity in court and whether that person had been duly served notice.
 But the prosecution could produce no notice of service of summons in respect of DF Advocates.
 The defence pounced on that information, asking the court to “minute that”.
 “A juridical person is facing criminal charges and a freezing order but is not present in court. If it were a natural person not present, the proceedings could not continue,” insisted lawyer Charles Mercieca. 
 As the legal wrangling continued, the defence urged the prosecution to be “practical” and withdraw charges against DF Advocates as an entity. 
 After the umpteenth suspension of the sitting to allow the prosecution time to get its act in order, the session resumed. 
 But lawyer Giannella de Marco had an unexpected piece of news. 
 The Chamber of Advocates had issued a directive specifically in relation to the ongoing case, whereby it directed the lawyers not to continue assisting their respective clients beyond 10pm. 
 The directive was issued in light of the fact that the session had been ongoing since 11am and with no end in sight, the lawyers could not perform their duties to the best of their abilities. 
 With seconds to go to the 10pm deadline, presiding Magistrate Leonard Caruana asked the lawyers to bear with the court “for just 30 minutes so as to close the chapter about the notices of summons”. 
 Then the court delivered its final decree for the day. 
 Having seen the relative documents and after hearing the parties’ submissions, the court held that DF Advocates had not been duly notified.
 Its officials were notified in their personal capacity. 
 Consequently, the case was deferred to June “with all the legal consequences”, said the magistrate. 
 “The legal consequences are what they are,” remarked lawyer Franco Debono. 
 “The legal consequences are a nullity,” added de Marco. “Let’s state facts as they are.” 
 That meant that Wednesday's sitting was annulled, putting all those charged back to the starting point when the case resumes next month, with the prosecution having to effect the necessary changes to the charge sheet.
 “I would expect the prosecution to have told the court that DF Advocates was not notified at 11am. You chose to press charges.
 ""Now it’s for you to decide what to do. Had you told the court first thing this morning, all would have been home with their families by now,"" Magistrate Caruana said, addressing the prosecution as the eventful session ended.

"No government, Opposition or NGO can ask me to resign: Edward Scicluna",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/no-government-opposition-ngo-ask-resign-edward-scicluna.1093158,29-05-2024,000864.png,"Edward Scicluna on Wednesday said neither the government, nor the Opposition, or an NGO, could ask for his resignation. 
 The Central Bank Governor was speaking to journalists outside court before facing criminal charges over the Vitals hospitals deal.
 His position at the Central Bank has been questioned ever since a magisterial inquiry into the hospitals deal was concluded and it emerged he was among those facing charges in connection with the scandal.
 Robert Abela has since insisted he will not sack Scicluna, who is also a board member of the Malta Financial Services Authority.     
 Together with former health minister Chris Fearne, Sciclina is among 14 officials facing charges in court on Wednesday. On Tuesday, another 14 individuals and nine companies - including former PM Joseph Muscat - were charged during a historic court hearing.
  In his first comments since the conclusion of the inquiry, he pinned responsibility for his future as Central Bank Governor on the European Central Bank and its statutes.
 ""There is a big difference between a governor and a minister. A minister's position is the prerogative of the prime minister, while the role of governor is governed by the EU treaty and European Central Bank statutes,"" Scicluna said. 
 ""There are strict conditions so that there is no interference from the government, the Opposition or NGOs about the resignation.""
 His tenure was at the discretion of the council of governors of the European Central Bank and could be challenged in front of the European Court of Justice, he added, skirting questions on whether he personally thought he should resign.
 As Malta's Central Bank governor, Scicluna sits on the ECB Board of Governors. He is not the only member of that prestigious body to be in legal trouble: his Slovakian counterpart, Peter Kazimir, is currently fighting corruption charges.
 His ECB boss, Christine Lagarde, is similarly compromised. Lagarde was convicted of negligence in the misuse of public funds during her time as minister in her native France. 
 Scicluna served as Malta’s Finance Minister between 2013 and 2020, when he resigned as a minister and MP to assume the role of Central Bank governor.
 The €4 billion, 30-year deal to privatise three state hospitals that has landed his former boss Joseph Muscat and colleagues Konrad Mizzi and Keith Schembri in court was signed during his time in government.
 A magisterial inquiry into the deal noted that he was generally kept in the dark about the concession and had little communication with Mizzi, the minister primarily responsible for the deal.
 It appears Scicluna was also not informed that his top civil servant, Alfred Camilleri, sat on the board of the entity tasked with awarding the “fraudulent” deal to Vitals, Projects Malta.
 The atmosphere outside the Valletta law courts on Wednesday morning was a far cry from the previous day’s mayhem.
 While hundreds of people showed up to voice their support for Muscat [who faces the graver charges of bribery and corruption], few, if any Labour supporters could be seen in the square on Wednesday.
 Instead, Great Siege Square appeared to be back to its daily routine, with henna tattoo and costume jewellery vendors at their stalls and a tourist train that tours Valletta making its way past the law courts.

Bail denied for man accused of raping and kidnapping Colombian victim,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/129599/bail_denied_for_man_25_who_raped_colombian_victim_and_kidnapping_her_,06-06-2024,000891.png,"A police investigator has told a court how a Maltese man allegedly lured his ex-girlfriend to his house with the promise of a job, only for her to be raped instead.
 25-year-old Stefmar Hatherly from Floriana, appeared under arrest before magistrate Giannella Camilleri Busuttil on Thursday, to face related charges.
  Police Inspector Omar Zammit explained to the court how, at around 3pm on June 4, a Colombian woman reported to the police that she had gone to her ex-boyfriend’s house, “because he was going to find her a job.”
 But the man drove her to a deserted area instead. When the woman escaped, the defendant managed to apprehend and then rape her.
 He then drove her to his home in Floriana, where the woman was locked up. She managed to escape later in the afternoon and went to the police station to file a report.
 Hatherly later went, of his own volition, to the police jeadquarters in Floriana, allegedly to ask where the woman was, and was taken into custody.
 Hatherly stands charged with ten offences in all, including rape, committing a non-consensual act of a sexual nature, offending public morals in a public place and recidivism. He was also accused of having detained the alleged victim against her will at a flat in Floriana on June 4 and illegally arresting her.
 Four additional charges dealing with a separate assault, which allegedly occurred at a flat in Sliema on May 20, where Hatherly is accused of causing the woman to fear he would use violence against her, attacking her, threatening both her and another man, as well as breaching the peace, were also pressed.
 Together with the charges, prosecuting lawyers Jurgen Dalli and Cynthia Tomasuolo from the Office of the Attorney General, assisting Police Inspectors Wayne Buhagiar and Omar Zammit, also requested the court to issue the orders it saw fit in order to ensure the safety of the alleged victims.
 Defence lawyer Matthew Xuereb, appearing for Hatherly together with lawyers Jose Herrera and Sandro Camilleri, said the defence had only recently been made aware that the victim had released a statement to the police and to the inquiring magistrate in the course of the inquiry.
 The lawyers requested the immediate disclosure of these statements in order to prepare its questions for the woman. Xuereb told the court he “intended to confront her with several truths, such as the fact that she had sent very erotic messages to the defendant asking to meet him.”
 Inspector Zammit did not object, saying it was only possible because the woman had given her sworn testimony on video, as otherwise the parties would have had to wait for the inquiry to be concluded.
 No ban on publishing defendant’s name
 Xuereb asked the court to impose a ban on the publication of the names of the defendant and alleged victim, “in order not to get relatives, especially his daughter who is a minor and completely extraneous to this case, involved.”
 The lawyer suggested that the victim had been in a months-long relationship with the defendant.
 The AG’s lawyer Jurgen Dalli said the prosecution agreed with respect to the victim, but reminded the court that the law spoke of publication bans “in order to protect the victim from secondary victimisation, and not the defendant.” He argued that there were no reasons to hide the name of the defendant.
 Xuereb argued that a balance must be struck between open access justice which is an important aspect of democracy and the rights of the defendant.
 The court denied the request, imposing a media ban only on publishing the victim’s name.
 Lawyer Jose Herrera then requested the defendant be released on bail, arguiing that the court could prohibit the defendant from contacting the alleged victim, as well as issue a temporary protection order. Additionally, the man was raising a six-year-old daughter, who would end up suffering the most, he said.
 Dalli countered that there were other eyewitnesses – two victims were named in the charge sheet, he pointed out, arguing that this risk had not been eliminated.
 The accused’s criminal record already featured three previous convictions, Dalli pointed out, saying this led the prosecution to doubt the extent to which the man would adhere to any potential bail conditions.
 Furthermore, the prosecutor said, the daughter resided with her mother. “This ‘excuse’ about the daughter is not appreciated when dealing with such a delicate issue,” he said. “The defendant knows the victim and the witnesses live with her so he knows them too. This is why the prosecution is insisting that the risk of tampering with evidence is real,” Dalli concluded.
 The court denied bail in view of the early stage of proceedings, as well as Hatherly’s previous convictions for crimes against another ex-girlfriend of his.
 A protection order was issued in favour of the victims, prohibiting Hatherly from approaching, contacting or following them, or loitering around their homes or workplaces.  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police

Agius, a former driver of parliamentary secretary Andy Ellul, is subject to a freezing order and thus cannot withdraw money with the corollary that another lawyer cannot be engaged at this stage.

 Agius had previously applied for whistleblower status and expressed willingness to testify in ongoing police investigations.

 Agius, who is also a former canvasser to Grixti, had previously called for a magisterial inquiry to investigate the social benefits fraud racket. He further offered, if granted whistleblower status, to reveal information regarding criminal activity he claims to have participated in.

 Chris and Lucienne Meli urged MPs to reconvene parliament earlier in case court proceedings are scheduled to conclude before October, when the House meets again after the summer recess.
  They said they are overwhelmed by the two parties’ quick response to their plea and are extremely grateful for their unanimous support to amend the law.
 But they argued the law, which, as it stands, does not allow extradition decisions to be appealed, could force the court to refuse their plea to reverse extradition, essentially forcing their son to leave Malta for the US.
 The parents said, that by parliament meeting sooner, MPs could amend the law before the court delivers its verdict, preventing the extradition.
 The 28-year-old Maltese man is wanted in the US to face charges of selling hacking equipment on the dark web. He was arraigned in February and initially consented to the extradition but later retracted his consent after hiring new lawyers who argued that the magistrates’ court had not verified whether he was medically fit and capable of understanding his decision.
  The law, however, does not allow for such decisions to be reversed, which is why Meli’s parents took to the media to urge the government to intervene to allow their son to stand trial in Malta.
 Within days, the government and the opposition agreed they should change the law and the government is drafting a bill that would allow Meli – and other people in his situation in the future – to contest extradition.
 The proposed law, according to sources, would allow a wanted person “adequate time” to reflect before deciding whether to accept being extradited to face trial in a foreign country, thus ensuring they make a well-informed decision not made under duress or when they are mentally unfit.
 For Meli to avail of such changes, however, parliament would have to pass the new legislation before the constitutional court makes a final decision in his case.
 “We’re concerned over his well-being in the US,” his mother said.
 “He would be alone, away from his family and we wouldn’t be able to visit him. And we’re also concerned about medication. It’s given to him free here but not there.”
  The parents recalled the day – this February 7 – when they went home to find the police searching every room in the house.
 The couple stared in shock and bewilderment as the police took every laptop, tablet and gadget they found in every room and arrested their son, who has not returned home from prison since.
 “At first, it seemed our son would be prosecuted by Malta’s police but, the next day, they told us charges had changed and he was now wanted by the US and that we must appear urgently before a magistrate to confirm whether he will accept extradition,” the mother said.
 They said they had to take that life-changing decision in 15 minutes, before appearing before the magistrate. And they accepted, only to later realise it was a huge mistake.
  The couple explained they were initially told that if their son cooperated with the FBI, he would be looking at a maximum of five years in prison if found guilty, which could even go down to three years with good conduct.
 That would not be so bad, they thought, until later they discovered that he was actually facing five years for every charge and there was more than one charge, meaning that, if found guilty of all charges, he could be spending some 40 years in prison.
 But that was not the only reason the Meli family are fighting to reverse the extradition decision. They say they could not have possibly made a well-informed decision in 15 minutes and under such immense pressure.
 “We were shocked as much as our son,” the mother said.
 “At that moment, when we were expected to make the decision, he turned to me like a lamb and said: ‘What should I do, pà?’ We didn’t know what to do and we needed more information,” his father added.
 “There was another thing. He takes medication to treat anxiety and arthritis and he wasn’t yet given the medication that day before court, so not only was he under immense pressure but he had also not taken his medication.”
 The parents said they have been inundated with overwhelming support since they took their case to the media, mostly from people who believe Maltese citizens should be tried in Malta, especially if the alleged crime was committed in Malta.
 “We received messages from people who don’t even know us but offered a helping hand,” the father said.
 “We miss Daniel a lot. We speak to him and he’s always thinking about the dog. He fears she might forget about him,” his mother said.
 “There are a lot of question marks on his future.”

"Man denied bail, pleads not guilty to rape of ex-partner's daughter",maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/130851/man_denied_bail_pleads_not_guilty_to_rape_of_expartners_daughter,23-08-2024,000907.png,"A 39-year-old man from Swieqi was remanded in custody after pleading not guilty to charges of rape and sexual corruption allegedly committed on his ex-partner’s teenage daughter.
 The man was arraigned before Magistrate Victor Axiak on Friday morning by Inspector Wayne Buhagiar, who together with prosecutors Cynthia Tomasuolo and Jennifer Polidano, charged the man with the repeated rape of a minor, participating in sexual activity with a minor, detaining her against her will, subjecting her to sexual acts of a non-consensual nature, corrupting a minor, harassing her and causing her to fear that he would be violent towards her.
  Inspector Buhagiar told the court that the girl, today aged 15, had reported the defendant, who is her mother’s ex-partner, to the Vice Squad, alleging that he had been molesting her since 2016, with the abuse progressing to rape. 
 Gynaecologists, appointed to assist the magisterial inquiry that had subsequently been appointed, had confirmed that the girl’s hymen was not intact, added the inspector. The girl had given a detailed account of the alleged abuse to the inquiring magistrate, before whom both her parents had also testified.
 The defendant had been arrested some time ago but was later released on police bail.
 Asked how he pleaded, the accused man replied “I did nothing. I’m not guilty, me.”
 Defence lawyers Michaela and Mattea Giglio requested bail, to which the defence objected due to the nature of the charges and the fact that the alleged victim and her family had not yet given evidence in these proceedings.
 Giglio pointed out that they had already testified before the inquiry, which had started in January, and insisted that her client had been on police bail since then and had not breached the conditions of his release. 
 “Had he truly spoken to the victim or her family, the inspector would have arrested him,” argued the lawyer.
 Lawyer Jacob Magri, appearing as parte civile, told the court that his client had informed him today that the man had been repeatedly attempting to communicate with the mother, through “incessant WhatsApp messages.”
 The court, after hearing the parties submissions on the bail request, moved to reject it, citing “what appears to be a real risk of tampering with the evidence,” ordering that the man be remanded in custody.
 It also issued a protection order in favour of the parents. Court warned him not to approach or contact both the parents and their daughter.

Jury clears hunter in attempted murder trial,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/joseph-scicluna-found-notguilty-attempted-murder-dingli-field.1095983,28-07-2024,000909.png,"A man has been cleared in a trial by jury of attempted murder following a violent scuffle with a fellow hunter whom he blamed for the final shooting.
 After five hours of deliberation, the jurors returned a 'not guilty' verdict of eight votes against one on the ground of attempted murder. 
 The accused, Joseph Scicluna, and members of his family were in tears when the jurors returned their verdict. 
 He was found guilty of having acted in excess of legitimate self defence through fear or fright.
 After the verdict was delivered a technical issue arose about the sentence. The matter is to be tackled on Sunday. 
 As for the other two grounds concerning the possession of a weapon during the alleged crime and possessing a firearm without the police permit, the jury pronounced him not guilty. 
 Scicluna insisted, when testifying at the trial on Thursday, that he managed to grab Mark Farrugia’s hunting shotgun just as the other man made a beeline for it after the weapon fell from the victim’s grip during the scuffle. 
 Farrugia, who testified on Wednesday, insisted the accused had suddenly hit him with a thick wooden rod as the pair chatted about birds and the weather in the very early hours of that October 31 morning in 2018. 
 A scuffle ensued on the sloping surface of the field in the area of ‘Ta’ Dnat’ at San Gakbu, Dingli shortly after 5.30am. 
 When testifying for the first time at the trial by jury, Scicluna gave a very different version of the incident. 
 He claimed that Farrugia had burst into a verbal attack, swearing and insulting him when he calmly told him not to shoot low when hunting to avoid damaging Scicluna’s drip irrigation pipes. 
 Scicluna also claimed that he had reserved a quiet word of warning for Farrugia, telling him “leave my son in peace. He has enough problems.” 
 That quiet warning had triggered Farrugia’s violent outburst and the physical clash that followed, insisted the accused. 
 He said he hit Farrugia with the thick rod because the younger man grabbed him first. 
 He pushed Farrugia away after allegedly being punched three times on the eyes and while still dazed by the blows, he saw the alleged victim sprint “with all his might” towards the firearm on the ground. 
 “I’m done. He’s going to shoot me,” Scicluna said he thought in that brief moment before he managed to grab the shotgun first and fired a shot. 
 However, his alleged victim denied that version, insisting under cross examination that the two hunters had “never, never” spoken about Scicluna’s son.
  While chatting about the weather and the gallina, Scicluna had pointed out something in a nearby almond tree.
 When Farrugia turned to look in that direction, Scicluna had dealt him a blow on the head with the marlogg, the thick handle of the accused’s hoe. 
 The victim suffered grievous injuries after being shot with his own hunting weapon and was subsequently admitted to Mater Dei Hospital in critical condition. His aggressor was accused of attempted murder, grievous bodily harm, possession of a firearm during the commission of the crime and possessing a weapon without the relative police permit. 
 He protested his innocence throughout the proceedings. 
 The prosecution pointed out that the accused had originally denied being at the crime scene that day. He had even blamed his cat and an accidental brush with a lemon tree for his visible injuries. 
 However, when testifying at the trial, Scicluna explained that since he had never been through a similar experience, he was “scared” and “traumatized” when summoned by the Rabat police. 
 Scicluna claimed that he only gave the true version when he engaged his present lawyer and insisted that what he told the jurors was “the truth.” 
 Madam Justice Consuelo Scerri Herrera presided over the trial. AG lawyers Kevin Valletta and Kaylie Bonnet prosecuted.
 Lawyers Arthur Azzopardi and Jacob Magri were defence counsel. Lawyers Edward Gatt and Shaun Zammit appeared parte civile.

Four-year prison sentence for pair who stole handbag containing a hearing aid processor,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/132411/fouryear_prison_sentence_for_pair_who_stole_handbag_containing_a_hearing_aid_processor,22-11-2024,000928.png,"Depty Naval and Davinder Singh were both found guilty of stealing a handbag from a 72-year-old woman containing a cochlear implant processor worth nearly €10,000 and were subsequently sentenced to four years imprisonment. 

 The pair faced various accusations including aggravated theft, use of false identities to deceive the victim as well as fraudulent gain, with Naval separately being accused of breaching bail conditions. 

                     The Court, presided over by Magistrate Gabriella Vella, noted that the prosecution successfully proved that, on 2 January 2023, shortly after midnight, the defendants had stolen the woman’s handbag at Triq it-Turisti in St. Paul’s Bay, and shortly after attempted to use credit cards which were also held in that bag. It was further recalled that the theft of the processor caused great difficulty to the victim who faced difficulties with hearing. 

 The men were consequently found guilty of aggravated theft, but not of the other charges. Naval was also found guilty of breaching court orders. 

 The Court considered the nature of the crime of which the defendants were convicted as well as the age of the victim. It was also noted that the defendants never, even when asked about what had been done with the handbag in an attempt to retrieve the processor, showed remorse for their actions. 

 The Court consequently sentenced both defendants to a four-year effective prison sentence. The pair were furthermore ordered to pay the sum of €4,145 in court expenses.     ",Thomas Cilia ,court_and_police
Fines for bringing excess cash into Malta declared unconstitutional,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/penalty-cash-control-law-breaches-declared-unconstitutional.1094391,24-06-2024,000933.png,"A regulation imposing a 55% penalty whenever a traveller is caught carrying over €10,000 in cash has been declared unconstitutional since it “reduces the judicial process to a mechanical exercise.”
 The declaration was made by the Constitutional Court when handing down judgment in a breach of rights case instituted by Igaale Ali Muuse, who was arrested at Malta Airport three years ago after being found in possession of €165,548 in cash.
 That August day Muuse was about to board a flight to Istanbul when a customs sniffer dog alerted officials to the cash inside his suitcase already stored in the aircraft’s hold.
 Muuse had declared that he had no cash over the €10,000 allowed in terms of law.
 The day after that discovery, Muuse was arraigned and charged with breaching Cash Control Regulations by failing to declare the substantial amount of excess cash.
 He pleaded not guilty.
 Proceedings continued and when the prosecution wrapped up evidence, the accused changed his plea. In August 2022, he registered an admission, confirming his position after being given time to reconsider.
 The Magistrates’ Court sentenced him to a fine totalling €85,601.
 That sum represented a 55% penalty on the amount in excess of €10,000, plus an additional €50 fine.
 Muuse appealed that judgment and requested a constitutional reference, challenging the current regulations which resulted in disproportionate punishment, legal arbitrariness and a lack of judicial discretion.
 The First Hall, Civil Court in its constitutional jurisdiction threw out the applicant’s claim, stating that Muuse had suffered no breach of rights.
 Muuse appealed and the matter landed before the Constitutional Court.
 On Monday, Chief Justice Mark Chetcuti together with Justices Giannino Caruana Demajo and Anthony Ellul, upheld Muuse’s claims, declaring that Regulation 3(5)(b) of the subsidiary legislation on cash control presented a “disproportionate interference” in the applicant’s right to peaceful enjoyment of his private property.
 Citing EU caselaw, the court observed that these cash control measures stemmed from EU directives aimed at setting up a system of controls to prevent money laundering and financing of terrorism throughout the EU.
 However the EU left it to each member state to introduce a penalty that was “effective, proportionate and dissuasive.”
 Malta had originally introduced a 25% penalty on the full amount of cash plus confiscation of any amount exceeding the €10,000 statutory limit.
 The law was amended in 2020 so that nowadays there is a mandatory 55% penalty on the excess plus a €50 fine.
 But when the accused is carrying more than €30,000, the excess sum is deposited by police with the Tax Commissioner for a maximum term of 90 days.
 Meanwhile police investigate the source of funds and if any criminal activity is suspected, further criminal action is taken against the accused.
 In Muuse’s case, the competent authorities had enough time to investigate but no further action was taken, observed the judges.
 The State Advocate argued that cash control regulations were purposely formulated to avoid arbitrariness. Anyone caught with excess cash would know exactly what punishment he faced.
 However the court did not agree with that argument.
 Such a penalty was undoubtedly harsh when considering that this applied independently whenever a passenger travelling through the airport failed to declare extra cash.
 It was meant to serve as a deterrent and punishment.
 The accused could still face further criminal action if the cash was linked to some criminal activity.
 Whilst voicing doubt about the source of Muuse’s money, the court said that the regulation “reduced the judicial process to a mechanical exercise” and totally did away with the court’s role of applying its discretion to the facts of the case.
 Each case presented different circumstances and punishment should be meted out accordingly.
 The court thus declared that the regulation interfered in a disproportionate manner with the applicant’s fundamental property rights.
 A copy of the judgment is to be sent to the Court of Criminal Appeal and also to the Speaker in Parliament.

"Remove ban on psychiatrist’s name, domestic violence commission urges court",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/remove-ban-psychiatrist-name-domestic-violence-commission-urges-court.1092928,24-05-2024,000935.png,"The Commission on Gender-Based Violence and Domestic Violence has called on the court to reconsider the ban imposed on the publication of the name of a psychiatrist charged with domestic violence.
 Earlier this month, a psychiatrist was arraigned by summons before magistrate Lara Lanfranco charged with domestic violence and harassment of his ex-partner.
 The exact charges the psychiatrist is facing remain unknown, as journalists were ordered out of the courtroom by the magistrate before the sitting could begin.
 ""I'm not comfortable with journalists being present for domestic violence cases,"" the magistrate said, addressing both reporters and the prosecution, before ordering the media out of the courtroom.
 In a statement on Friday, the commission said that while it understood and respected the presumption that a person is innocent until found guilty, due to the nature of his profession, the accused continued to meet several clients, including women and children, who are in vulnerable situations, possibly due to domestic violence and violence based on gender.
 It said that while the ban on the publication of his name was imposed to protect the victims, the court should also consider the common good of society in such situations.
 “Anonymity in these circumstances can lead to a lack of trust in these professionals who are much needed in our country. Other professionals should not be cast under an ugly shadow because of an accusation against an individual,” the commission said.
 It also criticised the court for not allowing journalists to report on a case that is of substantial importance to society.
 “The Commission on Gender-Based Violence and Domestic Violence stresses the importance of victims of violence continuing to turn to professional services. The Commission calls on clients of any professional service to report any kind of harassment or abuse to the concerned entities,” it said.

Chris Cardona to testify in proceedings against Joseph Muscat,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/chris-cardona-testify-proceedings-joseph-muscat.1096170,08-01-2024,000949.png,"Former minister Chris Cardona, who signed the memorandum of understanding with Vitals Global Healthcare in 2014, is expected to testify in Joseph Muscat’s money laundering case linked to the now-annulled corrupt deal.
 Cardona’s name was mentioned among a list of witnesses requested by the Attorney General when the former prime minister, his former chief of staff Keith Schembri and former minister Konrad Mizzi and all other defendants were back in court on Thursday.
 Today’s hearing followed in the wake of last month’s session wherein the court declared that there was sufficient prima facie evidence for all defendants, except one, to stand trial on indictment.
 That sitting had ended with a discharge in respect of Sciacca Grill Ltd, a restaurant-owning company with past ties to Schembri.
 Lawyers Franco Debono and David Bonello successfully argued that the prosecution failed to produce a shred of evidence to substantiate its allegations.
 Magistrate Rachel Montebello subsequently decreed that even if Sciacca Grill had benefited from contracts linked to the hospitals’ concession, no proof was put forward linking it to Schembri or any criminal activity.
 When the case resumed today against the other defendants, the court mapped out the ground to be covered over the next sittings scheduled throughout this time window which ends on August 24, when the case file is sent back to the Attorney General’s office.
 Running through the list of witnesses requested by the prosecution, the magistrate mentioned Malta Enterprise, Jobsplus, INDIS, Projects Malta, the clerk of the House of Representatives and the Auditor General.
 Other witnesses were related to the steering committee as well as the evaluation and negotiation committees involved in the process leading up to the granting of the concession to VGH.
 Cardona, as the then-minister who signed the original MoU, was also on the prosecution’s list.
 Another session is expected to be reserved for forensic accounting experts who were involved in the magisterial inquiry leading up to criminal action over the controversial deal.
 The experts are expected to testify in court since they might have to present documents and will most likely face cross-examination by the defendants' lawyers.
 Today’s hearing was relatively brief.
 Most of it was taken up by a long line of local bank representatives, twenty in all, who were summoned to testify about banking relations, if any, with two of the defendants, namely Kasco Engineering Company Ltd and MTrace Ltd.
 Almost all of them confirmed that the bank never had any form of business with the two companies.
 “We have never had and do not have any accounts,” “no banking relationship now or in the past,” said each of the witnesses, presenting written confirmation of the search results.
 The last two witnesses representing Bank of Valletta and HSBC Bank Malta Ltd were the only ones who had some evidence to offer.
 Bank of Valletta presented banking statements relating to Mtrace, a former client.
 As for Kasco Engineering, the company held five accounts. Details and bank statements as well as information about the closure of any accounts and up-to-date information in respect of the others were presented in court.
 MTrace had no relationship, past or present, with HSBC.
 Kasco Engineering had five accounts between 2004 and 2011, all of which have since been closed. A box file of documents was presented to that effect.

Son foils attempt to rob dementia patient after seeing incident on CCTV,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/son-foils-attempt-rob-dementia-patient-seeing-incident-cctv.1101337,21-11-2024,000954.png,"A man foiled an attempt to rob his elderly mother when he saw an unfamiliar person in her house on CCTV, a court heard on Thursday.
 The accused, a trans woman identified in court as Renald Falzon, was arraigned in front of Magistrate Astrid May Grima accused of attempted theft.
 Police Inspector Sarah Kathleen Zerafa Zerafa told the court that a police report had come in in which a man had gone to the police to inform them that he had just stopped someone from trying to rob his mother.
 The woman, who is close to 90 years old and suffers from dementia, lived in the apartment right beneath her son and he became aware that something was amiss when he heard the sound of someone else entering the home.
 The man checked the CCTV camera he had installed in his mother’s home and saw that there was a person who looked like they were trying to evade his mother while she had her back turned.
 He intervened and the woman left the premises.
 Police said that the man had given them the footage and they were able to corroborate his version of events, as the CCTV showed that the accused had pretended to drop something on the floor next to a cupboard, bent down and stealthily opened the cupboard on her way up.
 The footage then showed the accused taking a bag out of the cupboard and then placing it into her own bag.
 Police were also able to identify Falzon from the footage and sought an arrest warrant before arresting her.
 Falzon, 49, told the court that she does not work as she receives psychiatric treatment.
 She pleaded not guilty to the charges.
 The prosecution objected to a request for bail, saying that civilian witnesses still need to testify.
 The defence argued that the court could impose sufficient conditions on the accused to prevent her from approaching witnesses.
 He added that since the incident in question was captured on CCTV, there was no material risk that this evidence could be tampered with.
 The court denied the bail request, saying it was not convinced that the accused was capable of sticking to court orders.
 Falzon was remanded in custody.

 45-year-old Alexia Cross Micallef, 45, who told the court that she was currently homeless and out of a job, pleaded not guilty to nearly three dozen charges during her arraignment on Monday.
 Senior police inspector Clayton Camilleri and police inspector Joseph Mallia charged the woman with 32 offences in total, 31 of them relating to fraud and misappropriation. The one charge unrelated to fraud, dealt with misuse of telecommunications equipment. 
  Explaining what had led to the arrest, Inspector Mallia told magistrate Jean Paul Grech that the police had received a number of reports against Cross Micallef, which had led to the issuing of a warrant for her arrest. When police officers had not found her at her registered address, she was placed on the wanted list.
 Cross Micallef was arrested at the Rabat police station yesterday, apparently having gone there after finding out that someone had filed a police report about her. When she gave her details to the police, it was noted that her name had already been flagged on the police database and she was immediately arrested.
 Camilleri said that the police had received around 25 reports about the woman, all of them being filed within a span of just a few days. On some of those days, the police had received multiple reports about her, added the inspector.
 The victims had all told the police that Cross Micallef would offer to rent a property to them, which they would subsequently find did not actually belong to her, was already occupied and was not on the rental market. She would collect deposits and disappear, the court was told.
 This is not Cross Micallef’s first brush with the law. She had been sentenced to seven years behind bars upon her conviction for an identical scam in 2017.
 Inspector Mallia told the court that the total amount defrauded was €24,000, of which around €6,000 had already been returned to the victims by the fraudster. “Whenever she would hear that a tenant had reported her to the police, she would give the deposit back to them,” explained the police inspector.
 The defence asked the court to impose a ban on the publication of the woman’s name, arguing that it was very recognisable and that her daughter was being negatively affected by her reputation. 
 The court, however, rejected the request, noting that it did not have any legal basis.
 Bail was not requested at this stage. The court ordered that the woman be remanded in custody.

 Making submissions on punishment, defence lawyer Nicholas Mifsud asked the court to consider a punishment below the minimum in the form of a suspended sentence, pointing out that Mahamoud would still be precluded from entering Malta for three years in that case. “Even if he were to try after those years pass, returning to Malta will not be a walk in the park,” said the lawyer, pointing out that both the defendant and the victim appeared to have been on holiday in Malta and would be unlikely to ever meet again.
 The court upheld the request, noting that although the crime committed was a serious one, when compared to the action performed by the defendant, the minimum punishment he would be liable to was very high.
 After also taking his early admission of guilt into account, the court sentenced the man to imprisonment for two years, suspended for four years. A protection order was also issued in favour of the victim.
 The magistrate also ordered Mahamoud’s immediate deportation to his country of origin.  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police

 He was further charged with harassment, causing her to fear violence and wilfully breaching the public peace. 
 The assault allegedly took place in the couple's Birkirkara home on Wednesday. 
 On Thursday morning the woman went for an errand at a nearby pet shop and later stopped at a bar to buy cigarettes.
 People at the shop and at the bar noticed her facial injuries and alerted the police. 
 Officers went to the bar and the woman was taken to hospital by ambulance while her partner was arrested. 
 Upon arraignment on Friday, the 35-year-old pleaded not guilty. 
 His lawyer Martin Fenech rebutted the allegations, saying that the alleged victim had injured herself in a fall. ""It was her fault,"" he said.
 A request for bail was objected to by the prosecution because the victim was still to testify. They said there was great fear of tampering with evidence, while the nature of the offences was serious. 
 In light of those submissions, the court, presided over by Magistrate Leonard Caruana, turned down the request for bail and upheld a request for a protection order in favour of the victim. 
 The court also upheld a request for a ban on the victim's name to avoid re-victimisation.

Man remanded in custody for allegedly slashing ex-partner's tyres,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/132485/man_remanded_in_custody_for_allegedly_slashing_expartners_tyres,27-11-2024,001022.png,"A man has been remanded in custody after allegedly slashing his ex-partner’s car tyres in breach of a protection order. The Court denied his request for release, citing concerns over his trustworthiness and the need for further witness testimony.

 Inspector Antonello Magri presented the case to the Court, outlining the events as reported by the victim.

                     The woman, who had a protection order in her favor, approached the Police’s Domestic Violence Unit to report her ex-partner. She claimed that on the morning of 11 October 2024, she discovered two slashed tyres on her car as she was heading to work. She suspected her ex-partner was responsible.

 Around the same time, the woman’s son saw the accused driving near the area at the time. The son said he saw a knife on the passenger seat of the man’s car. When the son attempted to approach him, the accused drove away.

 On 14 October, police learned that the accused was undergoing treatment for a drinking problem at Mount Carmel Hospital. Following his release from the hospital, a warrant was issued for his arrest.

 In Court, the accused pleaded not guilty and requested bail. The prosecution opposed the request, arguing that the accused had already breached the protection order and posed a risk to the ongoing investigation. They emphasized the need for additional witnesses to testify.

 The defence countered, stating that the accused and the victim do not reside together, reducing the likelihood of evidence tampering. The defence also requested that the accused be sent back to Mount Carmel Hospital for further treatment.

 Magistrate Elaine Rizzo rejected the bail request, ordering that the accused remain in custody. She instructed the prosecution to expedite the process of calling witnesses to testify.

 The accused is represented by lawyer Roberto Spiteri, while Inspector Antonello Magri is leading the prosecution. The case remains ongoing.     ",Jordan Pace ,court_and_police

Man conditionally discharged after threatening his former girlfriend,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/man-conditionally-discharged-threatening-former-girlfriend.1098136,15-09-2024,001069.png,"A man was conditionally discharged on Sunday after admitting to threatening and insulting his former girlfriend.
 The accused, a 34-year-old Bulgarian national living in St Julian’s, was accused of threatening and insulting his former partner after she filed a police report about him.
 Prosecuting Inspector Sherona Buhagiar said that while the woman had presented a recording of the threats, the same recording also showed the woman herself threatening and insulting the accused.
 The court was also presented with a risk assessment report in which the woman was found to be in “extreme danger”.
 Defense lawyer Jose Herrera appealed to the court to consider a conditional discharge, as the offense was relatively minor and considered a contravention and not a crime.
 However, although the prosecution agreed it would be content with a conditional discharge, Magistrate Victor Axiaq questioned whether this would be appropriate given the outcome of the risk assessment.
 Buhagiar said that while that may be so, the police investigation only received a summary of the assessment which does not include questions and answers provided by the victim.
 In this case, the investigation had come to a different conclusion.
 When asked to explain the discrepancy between the police investigation and the risk assessment’s conclusions, Buhagiar said it was how the Police Commissioner has instructed cases to move forward.
 At that point defense lawyer Franco Debono interjected and approached the bench to discuss the case in private.
 The case continued shortly after and the man was conditionally discharged following an admission of guilt. A protection order was also granted in favour of the victim.

Policeman to face retrial over alleged rape of colleague,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/policeman-face-retrial-alleged-rape-colleague.1092821,22-05-2024,001087.png,"A policeman is to face a fresh trial for allegedly raping a female colleague at Msida police station.
 The 34-year-old police constable was cleared of rape in March last year but found guilty of harassing a second woman, a teenage recruit. 
 The Attorney General had appealed the verdict and asked the court to overturn a decision by the judge presiding over the trial, who ruled as inadmissible a statement in which the accused confessed to raping his colleague.  
 The policeman, who cannot be named by court order, had been sentenced to one year in prison suspended for two years. 
 On Wednesday, the appeals court, presided by Chief Justice Mark Chetcuti, Mr Justice Giovanni Grixti and Madam Justice Edwina Grima, quashed the verdict and declared that the accused must undergo trial again and the statement is to be included in evidence. 
 The alleged victim testified during the first trial that the accused raped her at the Msida police station when they were both on duty in February 2018 and again the following month. 
 Another colleague, a 19-year-old recruit, told the court she had been sexually harassed by the officer, including once inside a police car while out on night duty and another time while waiting outside the law courts in Valletta. 
 During the trial, prosecutors told the judge that both women had been left traumatised by the abuse committed by someone who was duty-bound to prevent crime.
 The presiding judge, Consuelo Scerri Herrera, likened the Msida police station to a “brothel” but said that the lax and permissive behaviour there did not necessarily mean there was criminal wrongdoing.
 She said that the alleged rape victim’s version was not credible and cleared the officer of all charges in her regard. A detailed analysis of her account showed inconsistencies and it was “more likely” that the sex was consensual.
 The judge said that normally rape victims would try to do everything to avoid their aggressor but in this case the woman changed her shift to be at Msida, sat in front of him at a meal, and did not file for transfer after the alleged attack.
 Her comments were criticised by women rights and victims support groups who likened it to victim-shaming and said there was no ""normal way"" for a victim to behave after sexual abuse. 
 The judge ruled that the defendant had overstepped the mark when it came to his behaviour towards the second woman.
 The inadmissibility or otherwise of the incriminating statement by the accused in 2018 had been intensely debated during the court proceedings. 
 Defence lawyers had argued that the confession was not legally valid because of a change in the law concerning how an arrested person should be cautioned.
 When the law was amended in November 2016 to introduce the right to legal assistance during interrogation, the caution was also changed.
 The interrogation of the officer took place in March 2018 and lawyers argued that the caution read out and typed “in the smallest ever font size” on the statement was not in line with the 2016 amendment.
 It included the inference rule – which no longer applied – namely that whatever the accused omitted to state could lead to inferences against him.  
 While the pre-2016 caution was to the effect that an inference of guilt could be drawn by a court if the suspect availed himself of legal assistance prior to interrogation, the law was changed to the complete opposite after 2016. The new rule stated that no inference of guilt could be drawn and this, the defence claimed, was no technicality but a radical overhaul of the previous position, having enormous implications on the suspect’s legal rights.
 The prosecution had  insisted that while it was not being contested that the caution was an outdated one, this did not change the contents of the statement.

Joseph Muscat challenges €30 million freezing order in court,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/129927/joseph_muscat_challenges_30_million_freezing_order_in_court,26-06-2024,001089.png,"A lawyer representing disgraced former Prime Minister Joseph Muscat has contested the €30 million freezing order imposed on him, arguing that the amount frozen should be based on the €60,000 mentioned in the inquiry.
 The asset freeze was imposed during criminal proceedings in connection with the Vitals Global Healthcare scandal.
 In a sitting held earlier today before madam justice Edwina Grima, Muscat’s counsel demanded that the prosecution provide clear evidence for the higher figure.
  Muscat's lawyer, Ishmael Psaila, pointed out that earlier this week, a similar situation with Sciacca Grill had resulted in the lifting of the freezing order against that company. In that case, Magistrate Rachel Montebello had ruled that there was insufficient evidence to justify the charges against it, leading to the company being discharged.
 The lawyer argued that the same standard should apply to Muscat's case.
 Additionally, lawyer Stefano Filletti representing Adrian Hillman, who is facing charges of fraud and money laundering, argued that there was no documentary evidence against him and that Hillman had been targeted based on his association with Keith Schembri.  Lawyers Edward Gatt, Mark Vassallo and Shaun Zammit, who are assisting Keith Schembri, Konrad Mizzi, and the companies FSV and Kasco Engineering echoed this argument, stating that the magisterial inquiry was “based on assumptions” and lacked concrete evidence.
 The defence called for a reassessment of the evidence, urging the Court to revoke the freezing orders should the prosecution fail to substantiate the amounts and accusations.
 Schembri and Mizzi raise Constitutional issue over freezing orders
 Lawyer Edward Gatt, who together with lawyers Mark Vassallo and Sean Zammit, is representing Keith Schembri and Konrad Mizzi, did not request a revocation but rather, sought a constitutional reference, asking the courts to examine the laws that currently regulate freezing orders. The lawyers said this was needed because as they stand, they could lead to breaches of the right to a fair hearing.
 Gatt said that proceedings about this issue had become “frustrating and tedious” and were becoming an obstacle to  justice. The Criminal Court upheld the request and referred the issue to the Constitutional Court for a ruling.

Enough evidence to indict nine persons accused of trafficking Colombian sex workers,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/131024/enough_evidence_to_indict_nine_persons_accused_of_trafficking_colombian_sex_workers,04-09-2024,001122.png,"A court has declared that it had seen sufficient evidence to merit the indictment of nine individuals accused of trafficking women from Colombia to Malta to work in the sex trade.
 Magistrate Donatella Frendo Dimech declared that there was sufficient prima facie evidence to indict Luke Farrugia, Clint D’Amato, Denzil Farrugia, Alexandra Suhov Procora, Nicolae Efimov, Kane Vassallo, Luca Emanuele Corito, Dylan McKay and Gordon Cassar, when the compilation of evidence against them continued on Wednesday morning.
  All nine are charged with money laundering, promoting or setting up a criminal organisation, forcing individuals over 21 years of age into prostitution, holding persons against their will in a brothel as bonded debtors, knowingly living off the earnings of prostitution and running a brothel.
 Prosecuting police inspector John Spiteri was cross-examined during the sitting, answering defence lawyers’ questions about the individual defendants' involvement in the criminal organisation.
 Inspector Spiteri confirmed that Kane Vasssallo, was not involved in the transportation of the women into Malta, but said Vassallo had been aware of impending arrivals of new women from Colombia to work in the sex trade.
 This was documented in Whatsapp messages, in which Vassallo referred to the women as ‘new stock.’
 READ ALSO:  Trafficked sex workers saw over 2,000 clients in three months, court hears
 Asked about Luca Corito, inspector Spiteri said that Corito has contacted one of the victims only once, after Denzil Farrugia had been unable to do so.
 Future witnesses would explain how Corito had been aware that he was sending one of the women to provide sexual services to clients outside the usual premises, said the inspector, adding that a 21-year-old man had been paid €400 for this task.
 In reply to questions about Gordon Cassar, the inspector replied that the police investigation revealed that Cassar had received a total of €75,000 in his Revolut bank account, in less than two years.
 Additionally, it was observed that the money was being credited to the account during the night, he said. This, together with the fact that the deposits were being made €55 at a time, led the investigators to believe that the payments were being made after every 30-minute paid sexual encounter.
 Two defendants are granted bail It is believed that the prosecution intends to bring around 50 witnesses in total against the defendants. These include a photographer who had taken promotional photos of the women, a representative from a travel agency, as well as some of the brothel’s male clients. 
 In a decree handed down in the afternoon, the court denied bail to all but two of the defendants: Corito and Pocora. Corito was released from arrest, secured by a €8000 deposit and a €12,000 personal guarantee, also being ordered to sign a bail book daily. Pocora, too, was ordered to sign a bail book three times a week. She was required to deposit €5,000 and provide a €15,000 personal guarantee. Both were also ordered to observe a curfew.

 Lawyers for the Caruana Galizia family and the defence clashed over fairness in court proceedings, with allegations of a court decree breach through public commentary adding further tension to the case.

                     Expert Martin Bajada, who was requested by the parte civile in a previous sitting to redact any material from Daphne Caruana Galizia’s emails which can identify her sources and compile a report, was called on to testify. 

 A lawyer representing the Attorney General asked Bajada where he has arrived so far in the compilation of his report, to which Bajada responded, “I would like to remind the Court that there are around 23,000 pages in this report. So far I have completed around 75% of it.”

 He said he will be ready in January “but not before”, as Caruana Galizia had been very active in her latter days.

 Jason Azzopardi, a parte civile lawyer, remarked that the family of the late Daphne Caruana Galizia would like to express its thoughts over the right of a fair trial considering the current state that the case is in, and the amount of time that has elapsed since proceedings began.

 Azzopardi continued, “I would like the Court to know that the parte civile’s family has this thought, that they too have the right of a fair trial.”

 Considering this, the prosecution requested the Court whether Martin Bajada could present the work that he has completed so far, to which the Court ordered that Bajada to present part of the report he has completed so far.

 Defence Lawyer Charles Mercieca stated that, “it is good that we come here and talk about the right of a fair trial, but this needs to cover both that which happens inside and outside of Court”. Mercieca explained that Manuel Delia had been releasing weekly podcasts every Wednesday, which, according to Mercieca, breached a Court decree.

 On 19 September 2024, Judge Edwina Grima ruled that reporting of the Daphne Caruana Galizia murder case and Yorgen Fenech’s alleged involvement should be limited to court proceedings, and ordered news site ‘NEWZ.MT’ to remove Manuel Delia’s video blog Civil society activist Manuel Delia had filed a constitutional case in bid to challenge the Criminal Court’s ban on ‘writings, declarations or public discussions’ about the murder of Daphne Caruana Galizia.

 He said his client, Yorgen Fenech, could not receive a fair trail “in an atmosphere of podcasts.”

 Following this, Manuel Delia had filed a constitutional case in a bid to challenge judge Edwina Grima’s ban on “writings, declarations or public discussions” about the murder of Daphne Caruana Galizia.

 Will Joseph Muscat end up arrested and taken to court?
 We do not know yet, but the controversial and hotly debated inquiry into the Vitals deal is done and has been sent to the Attorney General.
 And as the country waits to see whether Muscat or anyone else will be criminally charged over the deal, the former prime minister has made it clear that he will fight it to the bitter end.
  Muscat, who has spent the past year battling the inquiry, called a press conference on Tuesday afternoon to tell reporters this was a personal “vendetta” and accused the magistrate leading it, Gabriella Vella, of waging war against himself and the Labour Party.
 These are six key takeaways from his statement and his answers to reporters' questions.
 Although he has not seen any part of the inquiry and insists he does not know what it contains, he is convinced it is only a matter of time before he is arraigned.
 Seeing some of his harshest critics celebrate the inquiry conclusion on social media has led him to suspect that they somehow know he will be charged, he said.
 Muscat's reasoning is that if the inquiry acquitted him - as was the case with the Egrant inquiry - they would not be celebrating it.
  ""I'm assuming I'm going to be charged with something,"" Muscat said. ""Bring it on. I am bracing myself for it and I will fight it to win it.""
 ""I am serene because I know what I did and didn't do, and I have no doubt time will prove me right and I have no problem with being fairly scrutinised. If there is justice in this country, I will be acquitted.""
 He said that he and his family are preparing to be dragged through another few years of hell until they are proven right. 
 Muscat said he has heard nothing from the police yet. 
 He was also asked whether he thinks he will go to prison. He said he did not know, but that he would be free ""if justice exists"". 
 Muscat also squeezed in a line that would please Labourites: Labour's forefathers were prepared to go to hell, not just prison, for what they believed in, he said. 
 He was clearly drawing a comparison with the Catholic Church's battle against the party in the 1960s, when people were told that they would literally go to hell if they supported Labour or voted for it.
  Even if Muscat is to be criminally charged, we are not expecting the police to hunt him down and drag him to the courthouse in handcuffs, Hollywood-style.
 That is not necessary. Rather, if he is charged it will likely be through a court summons. But his charges would be criminal nonetheless.
 Muscat could not have made it clearer that he wants people to see this case as a repetition of the Egrant saga.
 In that case, Muscat and his wife were linked to a secret Panama company named in the Panama Papers. A magisterial inquiry found no evidence to justify that and concluded some witnesses lied and some signatures presented were forged.  
 Muscat drew comparisons between this case and that one in the very first sentence of his press conference, saying the inquiry was also coincidentally concluded on the seventh anniversary of the Egrant inquiry.
 He also made sure people understood this battle would not simply cause hardship to him as a politician, but also to his wife and children. The injustice was not only being levelled at him, but also at his family, he said. 
 He said that just like with Egrant, he and his family would be innocently dragged for a few years through a battle that they must fight to clear their name, only to be proven right and liberated at the very end.
  Only this time, he said, he would not let it go until he makes sure whoever spread the lie is held responsible.
 ""Even though I was proven right about Egrant, there were no consequences to the people who spread the lie,"" he said.
 ""It will be different this time. I will keep fighting - even as an old man with a walking stick if need be - so that the people behind this vendetta answer to their actions.""
 Despite Labour having held onto historic, unprecedented power and popularity for 11 years, Muscat continues to push the line that he and the Labour Party are the underdogs.
 Certain institutions are still hijacked by ""the PN establishment"", he said repeatedly, and they do work... they work against Labourites.
 ""I don't expect to be treated as if I were above the law, but I also don't expect to be crushed by the law, simply because some Nationalists were not happy that I brought them several election losses,"" he said.
  He also reiterated the timing of the inquiry conclusion was nasty and intended to harm him and the Labour Party.
  ""It so happened that my house was raided just weeks before the general election [in 2022] and now this inquiry was concluded weeks before the EU parliament elections,"" he noted. 
 ""There's no doubt about the political timing.""
 Back in 2012, when he was still Opposition leader, Muscat had sacked his deputy leader (and now-Speaker) Anġlu Farrugia after he called a magistrate partisan. Now it is Muscat who is attacking the judiciary.
 Asked by Times of Malta why it is fine now but was unacceptable then, Muscat recanted on his 2012 decision.
 “I probably moved too fast,” Muscat said. “I now understand where Anġlu was coming from.”
  Just before he walked out of the room, Muscat thanked journalists for covering the press conference and hinted there might be more developments soon. 
 ""I thank you very much. In the coming days, if need be, I will be contacting you again,"" he said.

Gozo murder suspect gets bail after three years in custody,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/gozo-murder-suspect-gets-bail-three-years-custody.1093878,13-06-2024,001235.png,"A man accused of committing a murder in Gozo in 2018 has been granted bail after spending just over three years in preventive custody and will now await his turn to face trial by jury.
 Aleksandr Stojanovic, a 45-year-old Serbian national who lives in Safi, is pleading not guilty to having murdered an Egyptian man who was shot twice six years ago.
 Father of two Walid Salah Abdel Motaleb Mohammed was found dead in a remote field in Għarb on January 22, 2018.
 The victim was found lying on the ground with two shotgun wounds, one on the left side of the neck and the other in the centre of his chest. The murder weapon was never found.
 The police said investigators had established that the accused was with the victim just hours before.
 The compilation of evidence against Stojanovic was concluded and the bill of indictment was issued by the attorney general in November 2022.
 Defence counsel filed several requests for bail but all were turned down, mainly because the courts deemed Stojanovic untrustworthy. The accused had fled from Serbia where he was wanted to serve a term of imprisonment of three-and-a-half years.
 Madam Justice Audrey Demicoli was told this week the attorney general was objecting to the granting of bail.
 However, after taking into consideration the stage at which the proceedings had reached as well as all the circumstances of the case, the court granted Stojanovic bail against a €20,000 deposit and a €40,000 personal guarantee.
 The judge also ordered him to appear for the proceedings when told, not to speak to any of the witnesses and sign the bail book daily. He cannot leave Malta and must be at home between 9pm and 7 the following morning.
 Lawyers Franco Debono, José Herrera and Adreana Zammit were defence counsel.
 Police investigations reached dead end in the period between when the body was found and May 2021 when there was a breakthrough and the accused arrested after the police had identified two important witnesses who corroborated CCTV footage from cameras in Għasri and other CCTV cameras spread around Gozo, including those at the ferry terminal in Mġarr.
 The police also managed to trace the car believed to have been used in the murder and questioned its new owners.
 Stojanovic won compensation last November when a court found that his right to a fair hearing had been breached as he ended up in more than 30 days of legal limbo, unable to challenge his state of arrest while his case changed hands from one judge to another due to abstentions.
 His lawyers argued that the fact that the law did not allow the habeas corpus remedy (a state of illegal arrest) to those issued with a bill of indictment, breached the accused’s right to a fair hearing.
 Their argument was upheld with a judge calling upon the legislator to effect the necessary amendments.

 Pakistani-born Fakhra Shaukat Ali, 68, and her son Wajid Shaukat Ali, 38 were charged with money laundering, trading in influence, fraud, bribery and corruption. 
 
 Prosecutors allege the family profited illegally from the hospitals deal, using Ali-controlled companies Mount Everest FZ LLC and Global Assets Holdings to do so.
 Last month Magistrate Rachel Montebello ruled there was enough prima facie grounds to commit Shaukat Ali Chaudhry and his current wife Shaukat Aasia Parveen to trial on indictment on similar charges.  
 During Thursday's arraignment, prosecuting Inspector Wayne Rodney Borg said that he was roped into the Vitals concession magisterial inquiry in 2022. He summoned witnesses indicated by inquiring magistrate Gabriella Vella. 
  He was one of the team who signed and issued the charges based on the conclusions of the inquiry.
 There was no parallel investigation by the police and both mother and son were not spoken to by the police. 
 Questioned by defence lawyer Shazoo Ghaznavi, the inspector said that the magisterial inquiry indicated the amounts to be subject to a seize and freeze order in respect of each of the persons charged. 
  The amounts requested by the Attorney General were slightly more.
 After hearing submissions by the parties, Magistrate Rachel Montebello upheld a freezing order for €20 million each to ensure that the defendants' funds were not dissipated and any court order may be executed.
 The court also observed that the prosecution’s request was based on the inquiry which contained voluminous evidence referring to millions of euros allegedly misappropriated from public funds for the accused's own personal gains. 
 The details also allegedly pointed at the defendants’ involvement in these crimes and the amounts allegedly involved.
 The prosecution informed the court that it had no further evidence for prima facie purposes, and the court declared that there was enough prima facie evidence for the defendants to stand trial on indictment.
 The court also upheld a request by the prosecution, prohibiting the defendants from publishing declarations or comments about evidence or testimonies produced in the case, or sharing any material records in any manner. 
 The defendants, who said they normally and habitually lived in Malta, were ordered to file a note in the court registry when they travel abroad. 
 They were told to indicate the destination and length of stay whilst making sure that they do not go abroad when there were court sittings. 
 And to make sure that they abided by these conditions, the court bound mother and son under a personal guarantee of €30,000 each. 
 The case continues next month.

"Jailed for sexually abusing partner’s daughter, claimed he was 'joking'",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/jailed-sexually-abusing-partner-daughter-claimed-joking.1100412,11-01-2024,001282.png,"A man who sexually abused his partner's underage daughter, touching her intimately and later shrugging it off as a “joke”, was sentenced to almost four-and-a-half years in prison.
 The case surfaced in April 2022 when a woman and her two young daughters turned up at the police depot to file a report about the mother’s abusive partner, a 42-year-old taxi driver.
 Following the umpteenth abusive episode, the mother and daughters finally plucked up the courage to leave their home and, accompanied by the paternal grandfather, went to file a police report.
 That day, the mother and one of the girls were in the kitchen when the family dog suddenly started barking, waking up the accused who angrily complained he could not sleep.
 Then the man’s mobile phone rang.
 Soon after, he began to shout at his partner and her daughter who answered back. The man flung verbal insults at the girl, roping in her father in the tirade.
 Just as she was about to exit the house, the man threatened, “if your dad dares come here, I’ll smash his face.”
 The girl stepped outside to call her grandfather, while her mother and the accused continued to argue indoors.
 That was not the first time when the woman and her girls were insulted and threatened by her abusive and aggressive partner, the minor later told police.
 But her mother was always scared of revenge, the girl claimed.
 However, when the trio arrived at the depot, more serious allegations surfaced.
 One of the minors, then 15, recounted how she had been sexually abused by her mother’s partner.
 The man would call her into the bedroom “to talk.” Then, as she sat on the bed he would approach and run his hand up her arm, touching her chest.
 He would tell her that he loved her. This happened a couple of times, the girl claimed.
 She once snapped a photo of his hand while he touched her. The girl showed that picture on her phone to the police.
 A man’s hand, wearing a gold ring and a bracelet, was clearly visible, touching the girl’s chest while she sat with the dog on her lap. The photo was subsequently presented as evidence.
 The girl explained she had long wanted to report, but she was scared until the last incident.
 She also claimed that her mother’s partner twice entered the bathroom while she was there, once while she was showering.
 Her sister confirmed that the bathroom door had no key.
 The girl’s mother, who claimed she only learnt about her daughter’s ordeal when the girl spoke out at the depot, said she had long been putting up with her partner’s abusive behaviour.
 Whenever there was a row, he would threaten to smash her car or humiliate her at her workplace, often speaking in a vulgar manner and reacting aggressively.
 That report led to police investigations and criminal charges against the man who was accused of non-consensual sexual acts with the minor, subjecting her to acts of physical intimacy, acts having sexual connotations as well as insulting and threatening his partner and her daughters.
 He pleaded not guilty.
 When delivering judgment the court declared that “without a shadow of  doubt” touching the girl’s chest and bottom was a non-consensual sexual act.
 After examining all evidence, the court concluded that the girl’s version was credible.
 She was always consistent and gave a significant amount of details. The accused never contradicted that photo, nor her version but was rather evasive.
 In his police statement, he denied there was anything ‘sexual’ about his actions, saying that if that were so, the girl would have slapped him on the face instead of allowing him to continue and laugh it off.
 He told the interrogating officer that he did sometimes touch the minor’s breast “but not for that purpose [namely, sexually].”
 Confronted with the photo, he did not deny that that was his hand in the picture.
 “But it was above her top not beneath,” he argued.
 The court observed that the accused admitted his actions but tried to make them seem like some kind of joke.
 However, that was a “fallacious argument”, said Magistrate Claire Stafrace Zammit.
 He knew very well that she was a minor, his partner’s daughter and that he was touching her intimately.
 “Had he meant to joke, he could have done so through other licit and normal means,” remarked the court.
 In the proceedings, the accused opted for his right to silence. His testimony might have helped the court to evaluate the situation in a more analytical manner, observed the magistrate.
 When all was considered the court found the man guilty and condemned him to an effective jail term of four years and five months.
 His name was also to be included in the Sex Offenders Register.

 The jurors returned a 'not guilty' verdict of eight votes against one on the charge of attempted murder. 
  The incident dates back to October 31, 2018, at around 5:30am in the area of 'Ta’ Dnat’ at San Gakbu, Dingli. According to Scicluna, the confrontation began when he calmly asked Farrugia not to shoot low while hunting to avoid damaging his irrigation pipes.
 He also allegedly warned Farrugia to leave his son alone, which he claimed triggered Farrugia's violent reaction. 
 A scuffle ensued, during which Scicluna hit Farrugia with a thick wooden rod, asserting it was in self-defence after being punched by Farrugia. Scicluna managed to grab Farrugia's shotgun, fearing for his life, and fired a shot.
 Farrugia, however, testified that Scicluna attacked him unprovoked with the handle of a hoe as they were discussing birds and the weather. 
 The jury found Scicluna guilty of acting in excess of legitimate self-defence due to fear or fright. 
  Scicluna was acquitted of possessing a weapon during the alleged crime and possessing a firearm without a police permit.

'Clueless' wife cleared of fraud role in husband's secret scam,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/clueless-wife-cleared-fraudulent-scam-husband-behind-back.1094722,07-01-2024,001333.png,"A woman, who found herself up to her neck in trouble because of a fraudulent scheme devised by her husband behind her back, was cleared of fraud and money laundering.
 Jemelyn Aliga Silos, a 41-year old mother from the Philippines, was working and leading a normal life in Malta when she found herself under arrest, facing interrogation at the police depot without quite understanding what it was all about.
 It all began to dawn on her when her lawyer explained why the police had arrested her and her husband who appeared to be the source of all the trouble.
 The man, Arvin Guerrero Silos, had devised a scam by setting up a Facebook page imitating and purporting to be the official Bank of Valletta page, complete with corporate logo and all.
 He then lured unsuspecting customers into contacting the page making inquiries about some difficulty they encountered when attempting a banking transaction.
 The duped customers, believing that it was authentic and that they were communicating with bank personnel, would supply bank card details.
 Those details were then used for online purchases and transfer of funds from the victims’ accounts to third party accounts, both locally and abroad.
 Customers with a two-factor authentication set up were sent a code to effect a “test purchase.” Funds were siphoned away as soon as the transaction was completed.
 Almost €10,000 were swindled through the scam.
 All throughout the man used his wife’s email account, also setting up an Azimo account in her name to effect the fraudulent transactions.
 But it was all done behind her back.
 The couple was prosecuted and the husband was sentenced after admitting to making money through false pretences, fraud, identity card fraud and money laundering.
 He insisted from the very start that his wife was innocent.
 When testifying in her case he confirmed that “he alone was responsible for the scam,” giving details of how he managed to trick his victims.
 He had even sent money to his wife’s cousin in the Philippines, telling her that those were earned through crypto transactions.
 He paid her a €100 commission for transferring the funds to his own bank account in his homeland, telling the cousin not to tell his wife.
 All along, his wife was “clueless” about the fraudulent transactions taking place since her husband made sure to delete all emails and notifications on her phone, emptying the trash bin too.
 The man explained that he had access to his wife’s accounts for the past ten years because “she was not knowledgeable about these matters” and needed help to operate such technology.
 The woman admitted that she only used WhatsApp and Facebook to communicate with her family back home.
 It was her husband who used her debit card to top up her tal-Linja card, helping himself to a double top-up.
 When his wife asked about the double notification to her phone, he lied to her, saying that there was some technical glitch in Transport Malta’s system.
 The husband later “regretted his actions,” apologized to the victims and said that he was “blinded by the easy money.”
 He insisted that his wife was innocent.
 When delivering judgment against the woman, Magistrate Rachel Montebello, observed that the man’s testimony alone was not sufficient to clear his wife.
 However after analyzing all evidence, documents and testimonies the court concluded that there was nothing linking the accused to the victims other than the fact that her name and email were used to open the Azimo account and that the monies were deposited in her account.
 The prosecution failed to prove that she had designed the fake Facebook profile or operated the scam. Nor did she chat with the unsuspecting customers.
 In fact, her husband’s mobile number was the one provided to the victims for verification purposes.
 All evidence pointed to her husband as the author and administrator of the scam.
 The prosecution did not prove that the wife had the necessary IT skills and the court was convinced that she did not know nor even suspect that the funds were derived through her husband’s criminal activity.
 “I was so clueless what he was doing,” the woman testified, and her “genuine” explanation did not go unnoticed by the court.
 The woman showed “marked disappointment” when recalling her discovery of her husband’s criminal wrongdoing.
 Not only did he defraud others but had used her personal details and accounts to do so, rued the woman, admitting that she was “thinking of leaving him.”
 When all was considered the court cleared the woman of all criminal liability.

 Magistrate Gabriella Vella must juggle that load of work with 99 court cases that she is also presiding over.
 Her workload is not unique among her colleagues: most magistrates have dozens of pending magisterial inquiries and court cases that they have yet to be concluded. In some cases, those numbers run into three figures.
 Vella, who last week concluded an inquiry into the privatisation of three state hospitals, has been targeted for criticism by former prime minister Joseph Muscat – who is a subject of that probe – as well as Muscat’s successor, Abela.
 
 Abela has repeatedly argued that, by law, Vella should have concluded her inquiry within 60 days and that the four-year period it took her to complete work on the Vitals one was “exaggerated”.
 But a Times of Malta  fact check earlier this year concluded that practically every inquiry takes longer than that to be concluded, and one in five take longer than four years to complete. Some ongoing inquiries date back to the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s.
 Legal sources said that most of the delays are caused by the limited pool of court experts who take longer than expected to complete their reports, sometimes due to elaborate tests, some of which have to be carried out overseas.
 According to the latest court statistics published in April and which cover until the end of February, there are 1,735 pending magisterial inquiries.
  The magistrates with the heaviest workload of inquiries are Monica Vella, Victor Axiak, Yana Micallef Stafrace, Philip Galea Farrugia, Antoine Agius Bonnici, and Ian Farrugia. The latter three, along with Magistrate Joe Mifsud, who has 30 pending inquiries, are the chosen four magistrates who will focus solely on inquiries.
 Magistrate Astrid May Grima has more than 90 pending, Magistrate Noel Bartolo has 85 and Rachel Montebello has 81. The other magistrates have between 20 and 66 pending inquiries.
 Apart from these, all magistrates, except those who will be focusing on inquiries, have on their hands nearly 2,700 pending compilations of evidence between them. The magistrates with the highest workload of compilations are Elaine Rizzo (351), Claire Stafrace Zammit (331), Marseann Farrugia (263), Caroline Farrugia Frendo (231), and Astrid May Grima and Rachel Montebello, who have 203 and 201 cases respectively.
 On top of that, Grima has nearly 1,400 pending district cases, Monica Vella has 945 and Farrugia Frendo has just under 500 pending district cases.
 Along with 149 pending inquiries, Magistrate Victor George Axiaq has 2,522 pending traffic cases and 3,235 pending appeals from decisions of the local tribunal.
 There are just over 2,040 domestic violence cases that are being heard by two magistrates, Abigail Critien and Nadia Helena Vella.

 The Court of Appeal found members of the adjudicating panel within the Contracts Department had a conflict of interest and ordered a new evaluation process take place.
 The Contracts Department last year recommended that Wasteserv, the government waste agency, award the tender to a consortium made up of French company Paprec and Bonnici Bros. The company put in a €600 million bid.
  However, rival bidder Hitachi-Zosen Inova AG – Terna SA, which had submitted a €780 million offer, appealed the decision.
 The Court of Appeal’s ruling on Thursday represents another setback for a project, deemed crucial by Wasteserv to reduce the need for more landfilling space to dispose of non-recyclable waste.
 A new adjudicating committee will have to be formed to consider the bids once again.
 Hitachi-Zosen was represented by lawyers Matthew Paris, Adrian Delia, Luke Dalli and Zack Esmail. The lawyers argued that the Tenders Evaluation Committee was irregularly composed and the tendering process was tainted.
 Hitachi first appealed before the Public Contracts Revision Board, pleading that there had been a wrong evaluation of its bid, irregularities in procedure, and irregular composition of the evaluation committee.
 The appeal was dismissed earlier this year, prompting the company to take the matter before the courts. Hitachi reiterated its original objections but added that two members of the revision board, Kenneth Swain and Vincent Micallef, also had a conflict of interest.
 Hitachi said Swain was a former director of Enemalta, which had a power purchase agreement with Wastserv, and Micallef was a director of ClearFlowPlus plc, a State-owned entity like Wasteserv and Enemalta.
 Presided by Chief Justice Mark Chetcuti and judges Josette Demicoli and Christian Falzon Scerri, the Appeals Court first considered the claims of conflicts of interest by members of the revision board.
 The judges upheld Hitachi’s pleas, but made it clear that this did not imply the decision taken by Swain or Micallef was motivated by personal gain or intended to breach principles of good governance. The Appeals Court declared the revision board’s decision as being null.
 But the judges also ruled that Stephanie Scicluna Laiviera, who stood on the Tenders Evaluation Committee, was in breach of public procurement regulations since she was listed as a member of the Public Contracts Revision Board and also worked as Wasteserv Procurement Manager.
 “Once Stephanie Scicluna Laiviera was, by law, precluded from sitting on the Tenders Evaluation Committee, the composition of the committee was irregular and, as a consequence, all decisions it took were irregular too,” the court ruled.
 As a consequence, a new adjudicating committee will have to be set up to reconsider the bids.
 The Magħtab incinerator bidding process was mired in controversy when the Contracts Department in June last year ‘mistakenly’ published the initial offering price of the five competitors who showed interest until then.
 This allowed the bidders to adjust their final offer a month later. Two of the lowest-priced bids dropped out of the running and the Paprec-BBL consortium reduced its initial price by around €17 million to put in a final offer for €599.7 million.
 The other two consortia – FCC Medioambiente Internacional and Hitachi Zosen Inova-Terna – submitted final bid prices of €616 million and €781.5 million respectively.
 In October 2023, Paprec-BBL were selected as the preferred bidder, however, the process was halted when Hitachi appealed the award.
 MaltaToday had also revealed that the Maltese partner in the winning consortium has ties to 2013 oil scandal kingpin George Farrugia.
 Bonnici Brothers is the sole shareholder in ENV Energy Solutions, a company run by Farrugia. At the time, a spokesperson for Bonnici Brothers denied Farrugia was in any way involved in the incinerator tendering process and insisted he would neither be involved afterwards.
 The Magħtab incinerator is expected to process 192,000 tonnes of non-recyclable waste annually and is a crucial cog in Malta’s waste management plan. The incineration of waste will help reduce the dependence on landfills.
 The tender issued by Wasteserv was for the construction and operation of a plant that is also expected to generate 5% of the country’s energy needs. The selected company will be granted a 20-year concession to run the facility.  ",Kurt Sansone ,court_and_police
Caritas director hits out at poor enforcement of cannabis law,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/caritas-director-hits-poor-enforcement-cannabis-law.1094560,28-06-2024,001381.png,"Caritas director Anthony Gatt stopped short of saying ‘We told you so’ as he described an increasingly worrying drug situation in Malta on Thursday.
 “We are seeing a reality that is a crying shame, and much of it stems from a lack of law enforcement,” Gatt said as he referred to the legalisation of recreational cannabis in December 2021.
 Speaking during the graduation of former addicts who have just completed a drug rehabilitation programme at San Blas therapeutic centre, Gatt explained that in terms of the law, no one could smoke cannabis in public or near children and one could not have more than four cannabis plants at home.
 Yet Caritas was increasingly receiving calls from concerned parents as cannabis smoke wafted into their apartments from neighbours smoking downstairs, or teachers not knowing what to do as schoolchildren faced problems caused by their parents.
 “We used to warn that the enactment of the new law would convey the wrong message... that we would have an enforcement problem.... that youths at risk would transit faster to cocaine... that cannabis would be seen as nothing major... that admissions to  Mater Dei and Mount Carmel would increase…Some told us we were scaremongering,” Gatt recalled.
 “We know what happened for cigarettes, and we are seeing the same thing with cannabis. While tobacco could cause cancer, cannabis was a danger for mental health, he said.
 Since October last year, Caritas, along with the Oasi Foundation and the University had been pushing the authorities to ban the sale of synthetic cannabis products known as HHC from grocers, corner shops and stationers. Yet now one could even go on Maltese websites to buy Gummy MDMA and Gummy speed, Gatt said. A sample had been sent to a laboratory for testing and it had revealed traces of MDMA (Ecstasy), Ketamine and Amphetamine.
 “This is a dark moment,” Gatt said, although he believed matters could be resolved with proper law enforcement.
 He believed, he said, that the Cannabis regulatory authority was serious in the way it authorised the opening of social clubs, but it was worrying that an information campaign by the same authority to inform the public where cannabis could be consumed said nothing about cannabis being dangerous.
 And, he added the situation regarding Cocaine was ‘truly serious’.
 56% of the 808 persons who sought help for drug addiction from Caritas last year were addicted to cocaine and crack cocaine. And this was also the first time that more people sought help because of cannabis (21%) than from heroin (17%).
 “We never saw those figures before,” Gatt said.
 He said that many addicts sought shelter at Mt Carmel Hospital. They often wanted to kick their addiction but couldn’t, and viewed Mt Carmel as an emergency shelter. They were sometimes stuck there for months until a rehabilitation programme was drawn up for them.
 Then there was another cohort of people who were not yet ready for a rehabilitation programme and kept going in and out of Mt Carmel, drifting from one emergency to another and viewing Mt Carmel as a homeless shelter. There was a gap for a ‘low threshold residence’ for such people so that they would not end up in the streets, becoming a danger for themselves and others, Gatt said.
 The Caritas director earlier also pointed to a financial and personnel problem facing NGOs.
 He said he was very pleased that social workers at the government’s Foundation for Social Welfare were recently given a pay rise, an incentive to encourage more people to join the profession. But this had created a new challenge for NGOs, which could not afford the same salaries to engage these much-needed professionals.
 While NGOs did what they could through fund-raising activities, they risked losing good people unless government assistance increased. That, in turn, meant they could not continue to provide the services which the community needed, he warned.
 Funds were also needed to ensure that facilities were kept in good order. Over the past years, Caritas had refurbished two blocks at San Blas and installed air conditioners. It now needed to refurbish the kitchen block at San Blas and fund the Prison Inmates Programme and the Female Programme at a total cost of €1.5 million. Only €200,000 had been raised so far.
 In 2023 alone, he said, Caritas saw 808 people who sought its help because of drugs, of whom 257 were admitted to residential programmes. 515 relatives of these drug addicts were also helped.
 Caritas also assisted 686 other people in counselling and general social work. Meeting were held for 3,382 schoolchildren and 451 workers.
 Collaboration with the Family Ministry and the Alfred Mizzi Foundation last year translated in emergency shelter being provided to 402 people. 1028 vulnerable people were fed at Dar Papa Frangisku.
 The Caritas director thanked the Family Ministry for funding most of the rehabilitation programmes for adults and the Home Affairs Ministry for providing funds for the Prison Inmates Programme. He also thanked public and corporate donors for their generosity.

"Four men, 16-year-old girl charged with theft of her father’s Porsche Cayenne SUV",maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/128839/three_men_16yearold_girl_charged_with_theft_of_her_fathers_porsche_cayenne_suv,25-04-2024,001382.png,"Four men and a 16-year-old girl are facing charges in connection with the theft of a Porsche Cayenne SUV belonging to the girl’s father and other crimes.
 The minor was first to be arraigned before magistrate Claire Stafrace Zammit on Thursday.
 Police Inspectors Lydon Zammit and Stephen Gulia, assisted by lawyers Alessia Schembri and Brendan Hewer from the Office of the Attorney General, charged the girl with theft, aggravated by value and place and defrauding her father.
 Defence lawyers Jose Herrera and Martina Herrera informed the court that the girl would be filing a guilty plea, requested that she be placed under a temporary supervision order until a pre-sentencing report could be drawn up. The parties had agreed that the defendant’s father would provide her with alternative accommodation for her to stay until the pre-sentencing report is complete.
  As the defendant was less than 17-years-old, the court observed that the competent court to decide her case was the Juvenile court and ordered the acts of the case be sent there for sentencing.
 Herrera requested bail in the interim period, which met no objection from the prosecution or the victim's lawyers, Alfred Abela and Rene Darmanin.
 The court upheld the bail request and released the girl from arrest against a €10,000 personal guarantee, also ordering the girl not to contact or approach any of the victims, with the exception of her father and to sign a bail book at regular intervals.
 The court imposed a ban on the publication of her name and that of the victim.
 Four men also charged with offences linked to the theft
 Four young men are also facing charges in connection with the stolen luxury car.
 In a separate arraignment on Thursday, Luis Maxim Kunzel 24, an unemployed German national residing in Marsaskala, self-employed businessman Luke Vella, 28, from Zabbar, as well as 19-year-old Dillon Gatt and 23-year-old Syrian national Mohamed Mohamed Ali, the latter two both unemployed and with no fixed address, were charged with handling stolen goods and the theft of cash which was aggravated by violence, means and by detaining people against their will.
 They were also accused of stealing a number plate during the night of April 17, stealing the Porsche Cayenne from Mellieha and a credit card from inside it, and defrauding the owner out of over €5,000.
 More charges, relating to attempted hold ups at a jeweller in Santa Venera and a pharmacy in Qormi on April 21, as well as another attempted hold up at an electronics shop in Birkirkara the following day, were also issued. The group are also accused of conspiracy to rob the jewellery shop.
 Kunzel, Gatt, Ali and Vella were jointly accused of criminal conspiracy - having allegedly planned to burglarise the Porsche owner’s home.
 Kunzel alone is facing additional charges of stealing number plates from cars parked in Zabbar on 22 and 23 April, while Vella alone is also accused of trying to sell the stolen Porsche, trafficking cannabis and breaching three sets of bail conditions.
 Ali is also charged with trafficking and possession of cannabis in circumstances which indicated an intention to sell.
 Kunzel and Gatt are also charged with carrying a knife in public without police permission, with Gatt also accused of breaching the conditions of a suspended sentence he had received in May 2023.
 Inspector Lydon Zammit explained that the road leading up to the arrests had started with the violent robbery of a bakery in Marsaskala on Friday, April 19. Two armed robbers and an accomplice pretending to be a customer had been involved, he said.
 The suspects had arrived and fled in a Mazda Demio using number plates which had been reported stolen from Marsa the day before, explained the inspector.
 A number of other thefts were reported during the night between Saturday and Sunday, he said, amongst them the theft of the Porsche from Attard, an attempted robbery at a jewellery store in Santa Venera and another attempted theft at a pharmacy in Qormi.
 The Mazda Demio was involved in every one, Zammit told the court.
 The next day, the police received a report of another attempted theft in Birkirkara involving the same car and similar descriptions of the perpetrators.
 Staff at the jewellery shop told the police that a few hours after the theft, they had seen three suspicious-looking youths hovering around the area.
 In the meantime, information had started to come in about the theft of the Porsche. Louis Maxim Kunzel was first to be identified, after using the stolen credit cards. Gatt, who had been accompanying him, was identified next. Ali was identified because he hadn’t covered his face.
 The stolen Porsche had been sold in a part exchange for drugs. It was found in Luke Vella’s garage, said the inspector.
 When questioned after being arrested the men had given the police information not only about their involvement in the crimes, but had also indicated third parties who were involved.
 When asked to enter a plea, the defendants admitted the charges, with the exception of Gatt who pleaded not guilty
 A bail request for the remaining three was met with objections from the prosecution, who argued that the charges, which included drug trafficking, were serious and that some of the defendants were already out on several sets of bail conditions.
 They were not trustworthy, argued the prosecution, and besides that, there were eyewitnesses who had yet to testify
 Lawyer Marion Camilleri, assisting Vella, argued that the charges against her client were related to handling stolen goods and cannabis. The bail breaches alleged were “charges like any other,” yet to be proven, said the lawyer.
 She also took issue with the trend of the risk of witnesses being suborned being raised “in every blessed case,” arguing that this risk had to be substantiated.
 “This happened just now,” replied Inspector Zammit, telling the court that while he was in the police lockup Vella had tried to communicate with a witness.
 The court ruled that there was a serious risk of evidence being tampered with if bail were to be granted and denied the request.
 Lawyer Victor Bugeja suggested that the folly of youth was behind Ali’s crimes, while Gatt’s lawyer, Yanika Barbara Sant, argued that difficult social circumstances, including homelessness and drug abuse were big factors in his offending.
 Lawyer Thomas Barbara Sant, assisting Kunzel, asked that his client be given help for mental health and drug problems, suggesting a custodial sentence of minimum duration.
 The court adjourned the case for sentencing at a later date.  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police

Developer accused of taking money for homes that were never built,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/developer-accused-taking-money-homes-never-built.1094566,27-06-2024,"001390.png,001391.png","A property developer was on Thursday accused of multiple counts of misappropriation and conspiracy to commit fraud.
 The charges, some of which date back to 2018, name 25 people who alleged they lost most of their savings in payments to Alexander Mercieca for homes that never materialised.
 For each count, police said that alleged crimes involved more than €5,000 in funds taken from victims.
 Mercieca, 61, pleaded not guilty. 
 Last year, Times of Malta reported how Mercieca was being chased by dozens of people, including young couples who were set to buy property from him, contractors who worked on his sites and even the taxman, with whom he had a €140,000 pending bill.
 A long paper trail showed how people bitten by Mercieca were left in the lurch as the properties they had intended to purchase remained in shell form for months on end or in some cases were never built at all.   
 One couple,  Stephen Mifsud and Marouska Fenech, had described how the Qormi site where their reasonably priced apartment was supposed to be built, replacing an old factory, remained untouched for months, with the couple later finding out that Mercieca had not been able to purchase the property himself.
  “The €20,000 was all our savings. We lost all of it, we were left without a home and we had to take a loan just so that we could pay a deposit on another apartment,” Mifsud said at the time.
 “We are morally and financially devastated. We barely make ends meet and we’re paying two loans, just so that we can have a home. We fear we will never see our money back.”
 In his reply to Times of Malta at the time, Mercieca said that he had set out with the intention of building affordable housing, but the pandemic as well as a few “legal upsets” had eaten into his profitability.
 During the arraignment on Thursday the court upheld a prosecution request for a freezing order of €1,063,884 on Mercieca’s assets.
 Prosecutors did not object to a request for bail but asked that the accused be barred from approaching witnesses. The court upheld the request and granted Mercieca bail against a deposit of €2,000 and a personal guarantee of €50,000. He was barred from travel and ordered to sign the bail book at the St Julian’s police station every day.
 Police inspector Andy Rotin and AG lawyers Nicole Sladden and Andrea Zammit prosecuted. Brandon Kirk Muscat appeared as legal aid for the accused.

Construction worker cleared of stealing tools,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/construction-worker-cleared-stealing-tools.1096376,08-06-2024,001406.png,"A construction worker has been cleared of stealing jiggers from a Valletta construction site for lack of evidence.
 Patrick Cassar, 44, of Qawra had been accused of aggravated theft after two jiggers worth close to €3,000 went missing from the site in St Paul Street in October 2020.  
 CCTV footage from the site showed a man entering the room where tools were stored. He left soon afterwards, carrying two ‘bags.’ Footage from other security cameras further down St Paul Street showed the suspect walking along, ‘suitcases’ in hand. 
 Investigators identified the suspect as Cassar who at the time should have been home in terms of a previously-imposed court curfew that applied after 8pm. 
 His home was searched but the missing items were not found. Nor did the officers find any clothes similar to the ones worn by the suspected thief in the footage, the court was told.
 Cassar was charged with aggravated theft, breaching bail conditions, committing the alleged crime while under probation, breaching the terms of a conditional discharge as well as relapsing. 
 He pleaded not guilty.
 The crux of the case concerned the identification of the suspect seen entering the premises on CCTV footage. 
 A police constable assigned extra-duty watch at the construction site said that he recognized Cassar as one of the workers at the Valletta site and had identified him in the footage through his gait and tattoos. 
 The building contractor in charge of the Valletta works, testified that Cassar had last reported for duty the Friday before the alleged theft. That day he needed to call at Sedqa and also had to settle some local council fines.
 Since that day, Cassar had not reported for work.
 Magistrate Elaine Rizzo observed that a witness, even if a police officer, must testify about the circumstances leading to the identification of the suspect. 
 Were there any characteristic features? Did the witness compare the suspect to other workers at the site? Did he identify the suspect independently of the site to which he was associated? 
 The court observed further that such testimony had to be supported by other evidence, particularly forensic evidence.
 When all was considered the court said that the policeman’s testimony alone did not satisfy the degree of proof expected of the prosecution. 
 CCTV footage and stills from the CVA (controlled vehicular access) system in Valletta were also presented as evidence. 
 The court observed that although the stature and gait of the suspect resembled those of the accused, the tattoos were not visible.  Nor was the suspect’s face clearly visible. 
 As for the CVA stills, they proved that a car registered in the name of Cassar’s partner had entered the city at 7.32pm and exited at 8.39pm that October evening. 
 But those images did not prove that Cassar was driving his partner’s car. 
 When all was considered, there was nothing concrete beyond the realm of probability to link the accused to the theft. And since the other charges depended on a finding of guilt on the first charge, the court cleared the accused of all criminal liability.

 “We appeal to anyone receiving these phone calls to not give out any personal information, and if in doubt to contact the entity directly though official numbers,” the statement read. 
 Such scam calls, emails and messages have increased in popularity over the years, as  entities and police have called for the public to be more diligent and aware of such scams.

"'Accountant' charged with defrauding Buġibba hotel of €25,000",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/accountant-charged-defrauding-bugibba-hotel-25000.1092190,05-09-2024,001409.png,"Updated 7pm
 A woman who allegedly defrauded her employer of some €25,000 was granted bail after pleading not guilty on Thursday. 
 Natalija Markovic, a 50-year-old Slovenian national from Żurrieq, was charged with misappropriating funds to the detriment of the company running the Buġibba hotel where she worked as an account payable supervisor.
 The alleged criminal wrongdoing took place on April 30.
 Markovic said she was an accountant by profession. However, a spokesperson for the Malta Institute of Accountants told Times of Malta that she is not listed on the  Register of CPA Warrant Holders and is not warranted to work as an accountant in Malta. 
 Upon arraignment on Thursday afternoon, the accused pleaded not guilty to misappropriation, fraud, making a fraudulent gain as well as a false declaration in a private document.
 Prosecuting Inspector Godwin Scerri pointed out that the charges carried a term of imprisonment. 
 However, a request for bail was not objected to as long as sufficiently stringent conditions - including an adequate deposit and personal guarantee - were imposed by the court.
 Defence lawyer Francesca Zarb highlighted the fact that the accused had an untainted criminal record and had firm ties in Malta.
 She had lived here for 20 years, had a Maltese partner and a family. 
 After hearing submissions, the court, presided over by Magistrate Jean Paul Grech, upheld the request against a deposit of €700, a personal guarantee of €5,000, signing the bail book twice a week and a curfew between 9pm and 6am. 
 The court also prohibited the woman from approaching the hotel.

"Teen bomber suffered drug-induced psychosis, psychiatrists believe",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/teen-bomber-suffered-druginduced-psychosis-psychiatrists-believe.1098327,20-09-2024,001416.png,"A teenager caught with a garage full of explosives and plans to bomb landmarks across Malta was suffering from substance-induced psychosis at the time, three psychiatrists have concluded.
 Psychiatrists told a court on Friday that David Brincat’s medical files showed that he was making use of psychoactive drugs and that he had told them, in interviews, that he produced his own substances and drank significant amounts of alcohol.
 In a 13-page report, they concluded that the young man had suffered a substance-induced psychosis and a state of insanity at the time of the offence.
 Brincat was arrested last May after a small explosion went off in a public dustbin outside  Labour Party headquarters in the middle of the night. Following a manhunt, police arrested the young man and discovered that a garage he was living in was packed with explosive material.
 Further investigation led police to believe Brincat had also placed explosives outside two pharmacies in St Venera and Birkirkara and had plans to target other sites, including parliament.
 Brincat was charged and pleaded not guilty by virtue of insanity.
 While psychiatrists have concluded that Brincat was insane at the time of the offence, the court has not yet pronounced itself on that matter.
 During a hearing on Friday, Magistrate Kevan Azzopardi ordered forensic doctor Mario Scerri to take a hair sample from Brincat, who is being held in prison.
 That sample is to be sent to a lab overseas for toxicological tests. The order was made after the court heard that Brincat had only been subjected to urine tests following his arrest and that it was now too late to run more detailed substance abuse tests.
 Only tests on hair samples could scientifically determine whether Brincat had made use of psychoactive drugs, the court heard.
 The prosecution did not object to the test, saying that it would help to give “the full picture.”
 Psychiatrists met Brincat twice – once at the Corradino Correctional Facility and a second time at Mount Carmel Hospital’s forensic unit- and spoke to his parents to get an overview of his life history.
 They concluded that he was a vulnerable youth because of the use of substances and mental health problems.
 When subjected to a risk assessment, all risks were low because at the time Brincat was being detained within a secure setting. But when considering all factors, future risks were high unless he received help from a specialist team.
 The youth showed “little remorse for what was going to happen or could have happened” and he appeared to have little support from mental health services.
 “He will need a lot of scaffolding to reintegrate him in our community to help him become an independent person,” explained the experts.
 Brincat’s parents told the experts they suspected that he was abusing alcohol.
 The youth appeared to confirm that, telling psychiatrists that he was consuming in excess of seven beer bottles daily and had spent three days in his garage at the time of the incident.
 He had previously also consulted different psychiatrists.
 Experts told the court that Brincat was “very disturbed” in the days following his arrest, when he was held at Mount Carmel
 “Then why was he discharged?” asked the prosecution.
 “Because he received treatment and got better,” explained consultant psychiatrist Rachel Taylor East who testified via videoconference.
 The other two experts were psychiatrists Nigel Camilleri and Christian Sant. Both were present in court for Friday's hearing. 
 The case continues next month when the parties are expected to ask the psychiatrists further questions.

 The man, who pleaded not guilty to having intimidated his partner during an incident that happened in March, told the court that he was unemployed and currently receiving in-patient care at Mount Carmel Hospital.
 Lawyer Alexandra Mamo, assisting the man’s partner, informed the court that her client wished to withdraw one of the charges.
 Lawyer Jacob Magri , assisting the defendant together with lawyer Arthur Azzopardi, requested the man be released on bail.
  Police Inspector Omar Zammit, prosecuting, did not object to the request, both in view of the parte civile’s request to withdraw her complaint, as well as because the defendant had signed himself in to Mount Carmel Hospital, voluntarily on the day after the incident in March, in order to begin addressing his problems with drug addiction.
 The man had been due to start a residential drug rehabilitation program with Caritas next week, said the inspector, explaining that if he were to be remanded in custody, that opportunity would be missed.
 Magri added that the man spent the last month at Mount Carmel and had completed the first phase of rehab, with the next stage due to start later this week. He asked the court to take into account the man’s financial means in setting bail conditions.
 After hearing the parties’ submissions on bail, Magistrate Caroline Farrugia Frendo upheld the request for bail and released the man from arrest, ordering him to sign a bail book three times every week. His compliance with his bail conditions was secured by a €500 deposit and a €5000 personal guarantee. A protection order in favour of the alleged victim was also issued.

 The court cited concerns over trustworthiness and ongoing risks.

 The man is accused of allegedly breaching bail conditions by confronting his ex-partner near an abandoned villa has been remanded in custody, with the court rejecting his defence’s request for release.

                     The inspector recalled to the Court how on 9 December 2024, a woman reported her male ex-partner to the Police’s Domestic Violence Unit.

 The woman had reported that after she had finished work on 8 December 2024, at around 7:15pm whilst she was on the way to her home, the woman had arrived near a corner on the road. Near the corner, it was said, there was an abandoned villa from which a man with a black hoodie jumped out of and startled the woman.

 The woman noticed that this man was her ex-partner. Upon confronting him, the man said that he did not want her to file a police report and said that he was simply looking around the villa. The inspector revealed that the man had a number of bail conditions imposed on him, such as a restraining order and a protection order in favour of his ex-partner.

 In light what the man did, and following the woman’s report, the inspector issued an arrest warrant, and the man was arrested shortly after. The man was subsequently interrogated and negated all which the police asked him about.

 The defence asked for a release from his arrest. To this, the prosecution and parte civile objected on the basis that the accused is untrustworthy due to the accused allegedly breaking previous bail conditions. 

 The defence countered by saying that if the man is given the liberty from his arrest, he will leave the residence in around two days. “The problem is that they live in the same house.” the defence concluded.

 The court declined the defence’s request for the accused release of his arrest, and the man was thus remanded in custody.

 This is an ongoing case.

 At the heart of the claims are a series of WhatsApp messages in a group run by AirX founder John Matthews, seeking to build momentum against rival VistaJet and its owner Thomas Flohr.
 Last week, Mr Justice Toni Abela reduced cautions requested on individual AirX employees in the lawsuits filed by VistaJet against Air X CEO Friederich Baldinger, group chief officer Hassam Hazzouri, CFO Abigail Bartolo and other Maltese employees. Both AirX and VistaJet are based in Malta.
 Mr Justice Toni Abela described the allegations hurled by both parties at each other as a “commercial war” in which AirX officers are accused of having mounted a mediatic campaign against VistaJet.
 The judge revised the guarantees being claimed on the individual defendants, such as in the case of Baldinger, down to €200,000, and €5.1 million on the prospective court proceedings.
 AirX said in its reply to the court that VistaJet was requesting a fantastical figure for what it said was an abusive lawsuit.
 VistaJet accused the founder of AirX, British national John Matthews, of having mounted a campaign of misinformation against VistaJet founder Thomas Flohr, to damage the company.
 The case is based on messages that were exchanged in a WhatsApp group between AirX employees called ‘Vista Comms’, in which the defendants are accused of having distributed false and damaging information to journalists about VistaJet as well as its clients, and supplier Bombardier.
 The Malta claim is aimed at implementing a garnishee on AirX employees to safeguard the companies’ pretensions for damages on loss of business, should its case be upheld in a court of law.
 AirX has replied that VistaJet is attempting to massage what should have been allegations of defamatory libel in news reports appearing in The Financial Times or the Wall Street Journal, into a vexatious request for commercial damages.
 AirX told the Maltese courts that the WhatsApp group in question was set up by its founder John Matthews, who has not been sued by VistaJet, and said that the people added to the group had little to no involvement in the chats.
 “The veracity of the various news reports published by reputable, third-party media houses, allegedly caused through the defendants’ ‘manipulation’, which have allegedly caused damages of €386 million… has not been challenged through the exercise of VistaJet’s ‘right of reply’,” AirX’s lawyers told the Maltese courts.
 “Even if damages were indeed suffered by VistaJet entities, the causal link between the defendants’ alleged acts or omissions, and the damage suffered, is non-existent.”
 VistaJet, founded in 2004, relocated to Malta in 2012 and is today one of the largest private jet operators with some 280 aircraft, and has 3,225 employees, 445 of which are based in Malta.
 AirX, which has 16 jets, was founded in 2011 by John Matthews and is also registered and operates in Malta.
 The bitter rivalry between the two companies can be witnessed on LinkedIn, where Matthews regularly posts missives taking to task VistaJet’s financials, Thomas Flohr’s comments to the press, and now, the claims advanced in the Maltese courts by the company.
 In the international press, questions were raised back in 2023 about the debts accumulated by VistaJet throughs its expansionist investment and dealmaking. The Financial Times reported disclosures to bondholders showing net losses of $436 million, and debts of $4.4 billion as Vista’s fleet doubled to 360 jets with the acquisitions of Air Hamburg, Europe’s largest charter operator, and US-based Jet Edge.
 One month before the FT story, Matthews began a series of over 20 articles he has since written and posted on LinkedIn, taking to task VistaJet as an ‘LMO’, or loss-making pperator.
 VistaJet believes the information to the FT came from Matthews, with its lawyers informing the AirX founder in a legal letter that the documents from its investor portal – featured in separate London court filings – carried a a non-disclosure agreement.
 VistaJet’s business model is based on a global fleet that can provide a jet to its subscriber clients with as little as 24 hours’ notice, without having to own the luxury asset. At the end of 2022, clients had paid $831 million up front for hours yet to be flown. Vista’s Jet Card customers sign three-year contracts that do not normally allow refunds.
 But in 2022, the balance of “flight hours sold but not yet flown” increased by $179m. Rising debt and losses eating into its cash reserves led to auditors EY to note “a material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt on the group’s ability to continue as a going concern”.
 Flohr replied to the FT report by saying the volume of pre-booked flights did not warrant concern, because the company only needed roughly 22% of clients’ up-front payments to fly the jets they book. The deposits are non-refundable and is not money that clients can withdraw. “We have a subscription business model. The key of this number is to serve these hours. It costs us about 22% of those numbers to actually fly them.”  ",Matthew Vella ,court_and_police

Justice minister critical of 'gagging order' requested by the AG in Vitals case,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/justice-minister-critical-gagging-order-requested-ag-vitals-case.1093179,29-05-2024,001461.png,"Updated 4.45pm with PN reaction.
 Justice Minister Jonathan Attard and former prime minister Joseph Muscat have separately criticised the attorney general's request for those accused in the Vitals case not to be allowed to comment about the proceedings.  
 Magistrate Rachel Montebello upheld the request on Tuesday and ordered the former prime minister and his co-accused, including former chief of staff Keith Schembri and former health minister Konrad Mizzi not to make any public comments about any testimony or evidence in the proceedings.
 Speaking on One Radio, Attard hit out at the decision, saying it was disproportionate.
 ""The prosecution's request for what has been publicly described (by Muscat) as a gagging order applicable only for the accused was, I believe disproportionate,"" the minister said, ""especially in the context of a magisterial inquiry that was characterised by strategic leakages (of information) which more than one judge deplored.""
 Attard explained that what was requested by the court - that everything said about the case should be in the interests of the proper administration of justice - was what was expected by all those who believed in the basic principles of justice. 
 But it was worth remembering that sittings were held in open court, he said. The context of this case was one characterised by ongoing political comments which, in many cases, ignored the presumption of innocence and constituted insults at the accused. 
 The rule of law group Repubblika had been among those that had issued statements which criticised the courts, and therefore interfered in the administration of justice.
 Attard said he recognised that the prosecution did not want a trial by media, which some organisations and the Opposition had resorted to, but he felt that the prosecution should also ensure that the source of the leakages which undermined the proper administration of justice was properly investigated so as to safeguard the independence of the judicial process. 
 In a video posted on Facebook on Wednesday, Muscat said he had wished to comment on what had taken place and what had not taken place on Tuesday, but was banned from speaking on the matter by the court.
  ""I respect the court's decision, but I have a lot of thoughts on how the attorney general of an EU country could ask that somebody be denied of his freedom of expression,"" he said, adding that he would not comment further because of the court's decision.
 He said that in the coming days he would announce the next steps that needed to be taken in the context of democracy and the rule of law.
 Muscat thanked the 'hundreds of people' who had shown him support in various ways, including the civilised and serene' gathering in Valletta on Tuesday. It showed, he said, that the country had reached a level of maturity where everyone could make his voice heard in a civilised way, without incidents and with reciprocal respect. 
 The Nationalist party slammed Jonathan Attard's critical remarks on the prosecutor's request and the magistrate's decision to accept it.   
 This, the party said, was the first time that Malta's Minister of Justice had publicly and shamelessly attacked a prosecutor and a magistrate serving the state in the biggest-ever corruption case taken to court.  
 The minister was attempting to interfere and influence the two to protect those accused of major fraud to the detriment of the Maltese people. Instead of putting the interests of the people and the institutions first, Jonathan Attard was rendering himself complicit in a coordinated attack against the judiciary and all those seeking justice, the PN said. 
 Such behaviour was unacceptable in a democracy.

Man remanded in custody for threatening former partner under protection order,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/131135/man_remanded_in_custody_for_threatening_former_partner_under_protection_order,10-09-2024,001483.png,"A 36-year-old man was remanded in custody on Tuesday on charges of having threatened and intimidated the mother of his child.
 Police inspector Omar Zammit arraigned the man, who told the court that he lived in a boathouse in St. Thomas Bay, before magistrate Caroline Farrugia Frendo, accusing him of threatening the woman as well as harassing and insulting her, breaching a protection order and recidivism.
  The inspector explained the man had continued to threaten his former partner, in spite of the protection order. A risk assessment was carried out and concluded that the woman was in “extreme” danger.
 The defendant, who told the court that he was self-employed, pleaded not guilty to the charges.
 Defence lawyer Matthew Xuereb asked the court to release the man on bail.
 Inspector Zammit objected to the request, in view of the risk assessment result, the severity of the crime and the fact that civilian witnesses had yet to testify. The man already had a criminal record, added the inspector.
 The man started to weep and sniffle loudly in the courtroom when Xuereb told the magistrate that a social worker who had been assigned to the defendant had recommended that the custody of his two children be granted to him.
 “Maybe it’s time we start hearing both sides when drawing up risk assessments,” remarked the lawyer. He asked that the defendant’s Appogg case worker be summonsed to testify about his behaviour in a future sitting.
 The court remanded the man in custody due to the fact that the case was still in a very early stage, saying that it was not convinced that he would stick to the bail conditions that it would otherwise impose.  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police
Government ordered to list its witnesses after a wasted sitting in PN's Vitals compensation case,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/128971/government_ordered_to_list_its_witnesses_after_a_wasted_sitting_in_pns_vitals_compensation_case,03-05-2024,001497.png,"A judge has given the government six days to present a list of its witnesses in the Nationalist Party's civil case seeking a court order to recover the millions paid out from the public purpose as part of the privatisation of three public hospitals.
 The civil case had been filed by the Nationalist Party, requesting the recovery of the millions paid from the public coffers to Vitals Global Healthcare (later substituted by Steward Healthcare) in a 2015 deal, which had handed over the running of St Luke’s, Karin Grech and Gozo General hospitals to the company.
 That deal was subsequently annulled by a court on the basis of fraud last year, that judgement later also being confirmed on appeal. The Court of Appeal judgement went one further and suggested that there had been collusion, as well as fraud.
  The Friday morning sitting before Mr. Justice Toni Abela was intended for the Government, which was admitted as a party at its own request, to make their case and Prime Minister Robert Abela, Justice Minister Jonathan Attard, Opposition leader Bernard Grech as well as Grech’s predecessor Adrian Delia were all present for today’s court sitting.
 But when the sitting started, lawyer Ian Borg, who is assisting Cabinet, informed the court that he was endorsing the submissions made by the State Advocate in the previous sitting both regarding the authenticity of the documents in the acts as well as that about the cross-examination of Adrian Delia and asked the court for another sitting in order to present all of his client’s evidence.
 Lawyer Adrian Delia, who had triggered the investigation into the deal with Vitals Global Healthcare, pointed out that today’s sitting had been meant to hear all the remaining evidence. “So they should at the very least, explain why they haven’t done so.” 
 Lawyer Edward Debono, assisting plaintiffs Bernard Grech and Adrian Delia, dictated a note, stating that today’s sitting had been intended for all the submission of all the intervenor’s  evidence, but none had been brought. “So if an adjournment is going to be requested for further evidence, at least the intervenor must state what evidence he wants to bring,” argued the lawyer.
 “We are talking about €400 million that Vitals apparently ran away with. But the courts have established collusion and fraud involving the government, and the developments since [this case was filed] indicate that we will be having more problems.”  If the companies made off with the money, their Maltese representatives and companies and properties should be held responsible for reimbursing it, Debono submitted.
 The lawyer representing the Office of the State Advocate, James D’Agostino, replied that this case had “nothing to do with the money,” and that the other party was misunderstanding the role of his Office.
 Judge Abela noted that he had read “something about a freezing order” connected to the Vitals issue in today’s newspapers and asked D’Agostino to confirm whether it was true. 
 “What we know is only from the media,” replied the lawyer. “Only the AG can say whether or not this has been issued.”
 The judge agreed with Debono’s point that the Government’s witnesses should be identified before the next sitting, and ordered the government to do so within six days from today, by means of a note.
 The case was adjourned to May 15.
 Lawyers Edward DeBono and Nicholas DeBono are representing Grech and Delia. Lawyers James D'Agostino and Julian Farrugia are representing the State Advocate. Lawyers Chris Cilia, Ian Borg and Maurizio Cordina are representing the government and the Cabinet.  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police
Tourist smashes plane's inner window during flight to Malta,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/tourist-smashes-plane-inner-window-flight-malta.1097882,09-10-2024,001499.png,"A British tourist has been fined €3,000 and ordered to reimburse KM Malta Airlines after smashing an inner window of one of its aircraft as it flew over the Alps.
 The incident happened on Sunday during a flight from London to Malta.
 ""It’s the stupidest thing I’ve done in my life. I know I’ve let my parents and family down. This isn’t me. I’m so so sorry,” said Anand Rajesh Ganatra, 33, a recruitment manager, as he filed a guilty plea and apologised in court. 
 The court was told that Ganatra suddenly flipped when a fellow passenger threw something at him, likely to tease him.
 Ganatra appears to have overreacted and smashed his hand against the thick perspex window.
 “I did not mean to break it... I hit it. It smashed,” explained the soft-spoken man, his right-hand thumb and middle finger thickly bandaged.
 The damage to the thick inner window pane was calculated at €2,125.
 “Are you aware of that amount of damage?” asked the court.
 “I understand. I’m willing to pay right now by debit or credit card,” said the defendant, registering an admission.
 The court condemned him to a €3,000 fine and ordered him to reimburse the airline for the damage. 
 “Make sure that tomorrow at the crack of dawn you come to Valletta to pay your dues,” warned the magistrate.
 “Absolutely your honour. I’d like to point out that it’s the stupidest thing I’ve done in my life. I know I’ve let my parents and family down. This isn’t me. I’m so so sorry,” said the man, apologizing profusely for the trouble caused.

 Ryan Cachia, a 40-year old Tarxien accountant, landed under arrest following the latest incident on Saturday evening when he allegedly went to the woman’s home in Zebbuġ and tried to touch her breasts.
 That unwelcome move followed a previous incident on June 3 when the man shared some intimate photos which his ex had sent him when they were together.
 The photos were shared in a private chat with a third party.
 The couple’s relationship had ended in October but the accused seemingly found it hard to accept the breakup.
 On Tuesday the man was charged with committing a non-consensual sexual act against his ex, causing her emotional or other harm by sharing her intimate pictures, harassment, causing her to fear violence as well as misuse of electronic communications equipment.
 He was also charged with recidivism.
 He registered an admission which he confirmed after the court gave him time to reconsider and consult his lawyer.
 In light of the nature of the charges and the early guilty plea, Magistrate Yana Micallef Stafrace issued a three-year probation order and a restraining order for an equal term, warning the accused that if he breached those orders he would land back in trouble and most likely in jail.

Inquiry into Stephen Mangion’s death finds no negligence by medical staff,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/inquiry-stephen-mangion-death-finds-no-negligence-medical-staff.1097834,09-10-2024,001538.png,"Doctors and nurses who attended to Stephen Mangion did nothing wrong and should not face criminal prosecution for his death, a magisterial inquiry has concluded. 
 An inquiry by Magistrate Joe Mifsud found no evidence of intent, negligence or delay by medical staff assisting Mangion. It concludes that the doctors and nurses on duty that night are not liable for criminal prosecution.  
 Times of Malta is informed that the 500-page report also calls for the reintroduction of imprisonment for defamation and the intentional spread of misinformation regarding third parties.
 Mangion, a 55-year-old resident of Valletta and a former police officer, died from an aortic dissection after collapsing in the hospital’s emergency waiting room.
 
 His sudden death sparked outrage on social media with claims that he had waited for hours despite reporting chest pains, first at the Floriana health centre and later at Mater Dei Hospital.
 The inquiry, conducted with the assistance of several court experts, established that Mangion had first experienced symptoms at 4am but delayed seeking medical help for 15 hours. 
 Despite advice from family and friends throughout the day, Mangion initially chose not to seek medical assistance at the Floriana health centre.
 The inquiry revealed that Mangion had not been taking his prescribed medication for high blood pressure.  His symptoms were atypical, making it difficult for the medical team to diagnose the aortic dissection that led to his death.
 Sources privy to the inquiry told Times of Malta that the healthcare providers did everything possible to save Mangion's life. 
 He underwent three ECGs, one at Floriana health centre and two at Mater Dei, none of which indicated that he was at immediate risk of a heart attack.
 In his report, the magistrate stated that, given the circumstances, the medical staff could not have reasonably foreseen Mangion’s condition.
 A court expert’s report, quoted by the magisterial report, shows that between 7:15pm and 7:46pm, a total of 13 ambulances were in service and none could be dispatched immediately to transport Mangion from Floriana health centre to Mater Dei hospital.
 It was then that Donald Cassar, a friend and a nurse who had been with Mangion all along, offered to drive him to Mater Dei.
 The inquiry also shows that on that day, 251 patients visited the Emergency department, with more than half classified as urgent.
 The department was particularly busy between 7pm and 9pm, during which 22 urgent cases were handled, averaging one case every 15 minutes. Eight of these patients complained of chest pains.
 The report further indicates that between 8pm and 10pm, 41 new patients registered at the Emergency Department, 25 of whom, like Stephen Mangion, were classified as urgent.
 Court sources told Times of Malta that the inquiry also addressed the public controversy surrounding the case, dismissing allegations spread on social media.
 These claims, which started from a fake profile named Manuel Debono, were described as having caused ""unnecessary fear and alarm.""
 Magistrate Mifsud emphasised that the claims were unfounded and lacked any basis in eyewitness testimony or documentary evidence.
 In his conclusions, Magistrate Mifsud called for stronger protection to safeguard the reputations of public health workers when false claims are made.
 He also proposed reconsidering the reintroduction of Article 252 of the Criminal Code, which previously prescribed imprisonment and fines for those convicted of intentional defamation.  The provision was removed when criminal libel was abolished in 2018.
 Police sources told Times of Malta that the report called upon the police to warn certain individuals identified by a cybercrime expert, to refrain from commenting publicly in tragic circumstances before the facts are fully known.
 It is understood that the magistrate advised that the inquiry be made public to dispel the public alarm caused by the allegations.
 The magistrate praised the family for publicly condemning those who used the tragic event to spread misinformation.
 Copies of the report were handed to the Attorney General’s Office, Health Minister Jo Etienne Abela, the health ministry’s permanent secretary Joseph Chetcuti, and Police Commissioner Angelo Gafà.
 4am  Stephen Mangion complains of chest pains and heartburn.
 7:45pm Mangion texts his former wife to ask for information about pills for heartburn.
 8am Mangion communicates with his friend Donald Cassar. Cassar suggests, twice, that Mangion should go to the Floriana health centre.  Mangion also refuses similar advice from his children.
 4.30pm Mangion texts his daughter to tell her that the pain has increased and that Cassar had offered to accompany him to the Floriana health centre.
 6pm Cassar visits Mangion at home. He is still in pain but refuses to go the health centre. He instead calls a telemedicine service and is attended by Dr Martin Mallia, who suggests that Mangion should go to the Floriana health centre.
 7:07pm  CCTV footage shows Mangion arriving at the Floriana health centre.  He is driven by his friend and nurse Donald Cassar.  
 7.10pm Within a few minutes, after registering, Mangion is examined by Dr Andre Abela and undergoes an ECG.
 7:37pm  The doctor calls Mater Dei’s emergency department requesting an ambulance for Mangion.  The doctor is told to keep an eye on Mangion, because no ambulances are available but one will be sent as soon as possible.  
 7:44pm A second phone call cancels the request for an ambulance, because Mangion’s friend has offered to drive him to Mater Dei.
 7.44pm  CCTV footage shows Mangion walking out of the Floriana health centre and settling into the passenger’s seat of his friend’s car.
 7:47pm  CCTV footage shows the car moving away from the car park.
 7:58pm  Mangion, once again accompanied by Cassar, walks into the Mater Dei Emergency department and registers his name.
 8pm  Mangion reaches the waiting room of the Emergency department.
 8.16pm Mangion is assessed at triage by nurse Nicole Schembri.
 8:19pm Mangion is given a second ECG. 
 8:22pm Mangion walks out of triage and sits in a location that is not covered by CCTV.  All the while he is accompanied by Cassar.
 8:24pm  A nurse approaches Mangion and asks him to follow her.
 8:28pm  A third ECG is administered to Mangion.  None of the ECGs show that Mangion was at imminent risk of a heart attack, but repeated tests show that blood pressure is high.
 8:29pm  Mangion returns to the seat he had previously occupied.  He remains there for an hour and fourteen minutes. During this time he stands up multiple times and makes phone calls.
 9:15pm Ronald Mangion, Stephen’s brother, replaces Donald Cassar.
 10:13pm Mangion speaks to two different nurses including Elisa Vella, who hands him two paracetamol tablets.
 10:18pm Mangion returns to his seat.
 10.22pm A man notices Mangion appearing unwell and reaches out to him.  Several nurses converge on the scene. 
 10.25pm Mangion collapses. Dr Josef Mifsud intervenes. Mangion is placed on a stretcher and is taken inside. CPR is performed before the resuscitation room is reached.  Dr Pierre Agius and Dr Mark Abela lend a helping hand.
 11pm Mangion is certified dead by Dr Josef Mifsud.

Former PN councillor says he was sidelined after refusing to join splinter faction,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/128992/former_pn_councillor_says_he_was_sidelined_after_refusing_to_join_splinter_faction,04-05-2024,001548.png,"A former PN local councillor from Bormla has claimed he was sidelined by the Party after refusing to join an internal faction plotting against PN leader Bernard Grech.
 In the judicial protest filed on Friday, against the Nationalist Party, its secretary general Michael Piccinino and the Electoral Commission, and signed by lawyer Ishmael Psaila, James Cauchi explained that he had been a member of the Nationalist Party for over 35 years and had held a number of roles within the party, adding that he had received the absolute majority of votes in one Bormla local council election, but had been ineligible for the post of mayor because the party did not achieve a majority.
 Judicial protests are often a first step before civil proceedings are filed, but have no executive power by themselves, nor are they sworn on oath.
 Cauchi is asserting that in January this year, he had been approached by PN Secretary General Michael Piccino and asked to contest the local council elections again, a proposal which Cauchi accepted via an email he sent a few days later.
  Piccinino had confirmed receipt of the email.
 In the following months, while his candidature was still being discussed by the party executive, he had received a phone call “from a person with close ties to the PN”, asking him to join an internal group which was intended to push for a new party leader, to replace the current PN leader, Bernard Grech.
 The judicial protest filed by Cauchi alleges that the unidentified caller was part of an internal faction which was large enough to see Grech toppled by a vote of no confidence and that Cauchi had refused to join the rebels.
 He had received that phone call after he had accepted the Secretary General’s invitation to re-contest the local council elections, he said.
 But despite following up and frequently asking about the progress of his candidature, he was left in the dark as to whether he had been accepted.
 Cauchi felt that his unblemished reputation and the fact that he had never been the subject of internal disciplinary action made him an ideal candidate to represent the party.
 But no confirmation of his candidature ever arrived, he said, adding that he later found out that his nomination had not been presented to the Executive before the lapse of the nomination period, depriving him of the opportunity to contest the election.
 The would-be candidate said he had “ended up feeling like he had betrayed a number of voters from Bormla who had always given him support over the years”
 While it does not contain any explicit demands, the judicial protest warns that Cauchi was reserving his right to exercise the legal remedies available to him.

Woman’s attempted murder charges dropped after victim says they plan to marry,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/woman-case-future-husband-attempted-murder-dropped.1100274,30-10-2024,001549.png,"A woman who allegedly tried to run over her partner, driving a car onto him with a baby onboard, was spared further criminal prosecution after the victim dropped his claims, saying that the couple planned to marry in the near future.
 The now 28-year-old mother, whose name was banned under court order when she was arraigned under arrest over two years ago, was charged with attempted murder, slightly injuring her partner, insulting and threatening him beyond the limits of provocation.
 She was also charged with wilfully damaging the vehicle, driving dangerously as well as having on board children who were not wearing a seatbelt.
 The woman pleaded not guilty and was granted bail upon arraignment after the court heard that the alleged victim did not object and was even willing to move out of the couple’s home so that his partner could supply that address for bail purposes.
 The incident occurred on a Sunday afternoon in March 2022 in Żabbar.
 When summoned in the proceedings last year, the accused’s partner said that he did not want to testify against the woman who was the mother of his minor son.
 He wished to put an end to the proceedings.
 His lawyers said he was dropping all those charges that were prosecutable only upon his complaint as a victim.
 The man stood fast by that position and repeated his request when called back to the witness stand earlier this month.
 He told the court that since that incident, the couple had patched things up and were planning to marry.
 The prosecution stated it would not object to the victim’s request to stay proceedings against his partner in terms of article 543(e) of the Criminal Code which dealt with such a request in domestic violence cases.
 In light of these circumstances, the court, presided over by Magistrate Astrid May Grima, observed it was in the best interests of the victim and the couple’s child for the case against the mother not to continue.
 The court declared that proceedings were stayed, effectively putting an end to the case.

"Jamie Vella files 10th bail request, as defence lawyers allege 'missing volumes' of evidence",maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/129972/jamie_vella_files_10th_bail_request_as_defence_lawyers_allege_missing_volumes_of_evidence,28-06-2024,001580.png,"A lawyer representing accused murderer Jamie Vella has railed against the Attorney General, insinuating that “a group of people who have an interest” in the case were forcing the AG’s hand over bail and withholding evidence.
 The claim was made on Friday as the Madam Justice Edwina Grima dealt with pre-trial pleas in criminal proceedings against Vella, George Degiorgio and the tal-Maksar brothers Adrian and Robert Agius.
 The judge noted that the defence had recently filed an application requesting a copy of testimony given by Melvin Theuma and Vince Muscat, in order to exhibit them in separate civil proceedings.
  Lawyer Alfred Abela, assisting the Agius brothers, told the court that in civil proceedings related to the murders, Police Superintendent Keith Arnaud had testified that Vince Muscat had given evidence before an inquiry led by magistrate (now judge) Neville Camilleri. The lawyer claimed it was not in the case file, however.
 “We have 25 volumes of the inquiry and the testimony of Vincent Muscat is not there. I am assuming that there are further volumes that we don’t have.”
 The judge pointed out that Muscat did not testify in the case against Alfred and George Degiorgio and that a copy of his prior testimony to the inquiry had been exhibited in those proceedings.
 But Abela told the court that the inquiring magistrate was refusing to provide him with a copy because the inquiry was still ongoing. “We are being deprived of evidence that under the criminal code the prosecution should have exhibited in total.”
 The inquiry had been reopened, explained the judge.
 Prosecutors Godwin Cini and Anthony Vella argued that the request had no basis in law. “If the inquiry is still open, it can’t be requested,” said Cini. “Let’s adjourn the case sine die until the AG decides it’s comfortable, then,” Abela hit back, accusing the AG of being selective.
 The judge dictated a note ordering that the defendants are to have access to all the acts of the inquiry into the Caruana Galizia murder to date, before the jury begins.
 Cini insisted that the prosecution was duty bound to present all evidence in favour and against the accused. “If there are any missing volumes, we want to exhibit them, but there are no legal grounds for us to request the acts of the inquiry. Only the inquiring magistrate can declare the inquiry closed.”
 “The law requires the AG to make the request to close the inquiry,” replied the defence.
 “Open or closed, what is certain is that for the purposes of clarity and peace of mind … at this stage we are in agreement that there is an open inquiry and that these men cannot be deprived of their rights,” lawyer Ishmael Psaila, who is assisting Jamie Vella, told the judge.
 The judge upheld the request and ordered the registrar of the Criminal Court to file a request to the inquiring magistrate for permission to exhibit copies of the inquiry into the murder of Daphne Caruana Galizia, “in their entirety.” She also ordered the registrar to exhibit transcripts of the testimonies given by Vincent Muscat and Melvin Theuma in the case against Alfred and George Degiorgio, “including every declaration or deposition exhibited in those acts, given by those witnesses in the context of the magisterial inquiry.”
 A copy of the depositions by Vincent Muscat and Melvin Theuma, made during the proceedings against Yorgen Fenech and during the civil proceedings against Fenech, filed by the Caruana Galizia family were also ordered to be exhibited.
 The court further instructed the Registrar to exhibit, within one week, a list of pending and concluded criminal cases involving Vincent Muscat.
 Jamie Vella makes 10th bail request
 Madam justice Grima is to issue a decree in chambers after hearing submissions on the latest bail request filed by Jamie Vella - his tenth.
 Vella has spent the last three and a half years in preventive custody, accused, as an alleged associate of the Ta’ Maksar brothers Robert and Adrian Agius, of involvement in the murder of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia in October 2017, besides also being charged, alongside George Degiorgio and Adrian Agius, of involvement in the murder of lawyer Carmel Chircop, who was gunned down inside a Birkirkara garage complex in October 2015.
 His lawyer, Ishmael Psaila, railed against the Attorney General’s consistent opposition to bail, after noting the reply, objecting to his latest application.
 “His last request was filed nearly nine months ago, and yet the AG is still objecting due to public disorder and the gravity of the crime. The charge is what it is and will remain to be what it is, but the AG is forgetting the presumption of innocence.”
 He asked the prosecution to explain what made this case different to any other, and suggested that it was because of the identity of the murder victim. “It is,who the parte civile is. Such cases have been heard and will continue to be heard,” said the lawyer, replying to his own question.
 Psaila said the stage where the AG could claim there was a prospect of more people being charged was over now. “To date, all we know is that the Commissioner of Police held a press conference to reassure the nation and said that the murder of Daphne Caruana Galizia had been solved.”
 The lawyer added that after Jamie Vella was first questioned, he had been granted police bail, which was repeatedly renewed and that Vella had even been allowed to travel.
 “Jamie Vella, had he wanted to attempt to manoeuvre or tamper with evidence or abscond, had all the time in the world to do so. Now on the eve of an unprecedented trial, the AG continues to object to bail and tell us that it is not the right stage to request it.”
 “This time he’s citing the risk of public disorder as a ground. Unlike other cases, in this case, whatever we say, there is a group of people out there who have an interest in its outcome. This is why the AG is constrained to continuously object to bail. This is nothing but a total injustice,” concluded the defence lawyer.
 In his counter arguments Cini rebutted the defence’s claims, stressing that “there is a strong element of organised crime,” in the two murders. AG had cited several ECHR judgments which justified continued detention in organised crime cases.
 There are also other elements in play, he said. “Public order is not something we made up,” said the lawyer, reading from a court decree on a constitutional reference which described the Caruana Galizia murder as having ‘not only shaken Malta but also countries, abroad’.”
 Now was not the time to release defendants, said the prosecutor, pointing out that the final pre-trial stages are almost over and the trial itself is approaching. “We must see it through.”
 Judge Grima announced that she will be issuing a decree on the issue from chambers, and adjourned the sitting to July.  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police
No bail for anti-social neighbour who breached protection order issued to neighbours,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/131049/no_bail_for_antisocial_neighbour_who_breached_protection_order_issued_to_neighbours,05-09-2024,001589.png,"A man from Qormi pleaded guilty to breaching a protection order issued in favour of his neighbours by insulting and threatening them.
 69-year-old George Muscat was arraigned before magistrate Claire Stafrace Zammit on Thursday on charges relating to threats and intimidation directed at his neighbours.
  The man is understood to have previously been arraigned over similar incidents, in which he would allegedly shout insults and threats at his neighbours, whenever they were at home.
 Lawyer Adriano Spiteri, assisting Muscat, told the court that his client would be pleading guilty to the charges and requested that the defendant be released on bail until a pre-sentencing report was compiled.
 The request for bail was objected to by lawyer Michaela Giglio, appearing for the man’s neighbours. “He didn’t understand a protection order, so how is he going to abide by bail conditions?” Giglio asked, pointing out that the victims lived three doors away from his house and telling the court that the man also owned a firearm which he kept at home.
 Bail should not be granted until the man received the treatment he required, she said.
 The court denied bail at this stage, in spite of the man's early admission of guilt and issued a treatment order for alcohol abuse, as well as a protection order for the victims.
 Magistrate Stafrace Zammit explained that the court had to be sure that the defendant was responding positively to the treatment order before it would consider granting bail.

Financial firm hit in business clone scam,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/financial-firm-hit-business-clone-scam.1092807,23-05-2024,001613.png,"An investment services firm has been hit by fraudsters who cloned its name and details to dupe individuals looking to invest money.
 The legitimate company ALB Limited was cloned by a CapitaliaFX “in an effort to deceive the public”, the Malta Financial Services Authority warned.
 It said CapitaliaFX – which has an internet presence at www.capitaliafx.com – was not a registered company in Malta, nor was it authorised to provide financial services.
 The authority reminded the public that a list of reputable operators is available on the MFSA website and that it should be alerted in instances of any suspicious transactions or companies.
 The website belonging to the purported company CapitaliaFX appears to be a direct clone of that of ALB Limited, featuring the same layout and identical graphics. The site also lists the Ta’ Xbiex address of ALB Limited in its contact details.
 It claims to offer investments in a range of products including currencies, commodities, bonds and cryptocurrencies, among others.
 While the legitimate site (alb.com) is in English, the clone is in Italian, however. This, in addition to the Italian phone number listed on the site, indicates it is being used to mainly target Italian internet users. When Times of Malta tried to call the number listed, the call did not connect.
 According to records for the domain of the cloned site, it was created in September last year.
 In 2021, the MFSA warned that another website mimicking the details of registered company Alpha Global Limited had been created in an attempt to scam investors.
 Victims of a scam or people who think they might be dealing with an unauthorised entity or any other type of financial scam should stop all transactions with the company and contact the MFSA.

"Vitals inquiry cost €10 million, justice minister says",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/vitals-inquiry-cost-10-million-justice-minister-says.1091948,21-06-2024,001639.png,"A magisterial inquiry into the Vitals hospitals deal cost over €10 million, Justice Minister Jonathan Attard said on Saturday. 
 He said the hefty price tag shows that the government provides all the resources necessary to the judiciary. 
 “They say the judiciary doesn’t have resources, but this inquiry cost more than €10 million,” Attard said. 
 Attard said that he would like to see the method by which court experts are appointed reformed. Currently, those appointments are entirely at the discretion of the inquiring magistrate. 
  “In a situation like this everyone appoints experts at their discretion, but at the end it is the people who are paying for it,"" Attard said.
 Similar inquiries in the recent past have also cost millions. An inquiry into Pilatus Bank cost €7.5 million, and the  Egrant inquiry cost €1.25 million in forensic services alone.
 The Vitals inquiry, which was concluded last week but remains under wraps, was tasked with seeing whether top government ministers had committed any crimes in relation to the deal to lease three state hospitals to a private company. 
 That privatisation deal, which cost taxpayers an estimated €400 million, was struck off by a court last year. The court ruled that the deal was tainted by fraud, that contractual obligations had not been honoured and that top officials had colluded against the national interest. 
 Justice minister Attard provided the €10 million figure during an interview on RTK 103 Radio with show host Andrew Azzopardi. He did not provide any further detail about that cost. 
 Attard also defended Prime Minister Robert Abela's criticism of the magistrate leading the inquiry, saying it was the government’s duty to speak out when trust in the judiciary was at risk.
 Like Abela, the minister questioned the timing of the inquiry. Abela has said it is no coincidence that the probe was concluded just as nominations for MEP electoral candidates opened.   
 “In every situation that somehow impacts trust (in the judiciary), we have a responsibility to comment. This is not an attack on the judiciary,” Attard said on Andrew Azzopardi's RTK 103 Radio programme. 
 He noted that the Abela-led government had introduced reforms that granted the judiciary more independence, and said that more new magistrates have been appointed in the past few years than in the three previous legislatures combined. 
 Attard said that while he could understand why the magistrate could not conclude her work within the 60-day time limit set by law, he could not understand why she needed four-and-a-half years to conclude it.
 The probe was triggered in late 2019 following a complaint filed by NGO Repubblika. The Vitals deal itself was annulled last year after a court upheld a case alleging fraud which was filed by then-Opposition leader Adrian Delia. 
 The Opposition has accused Abela of trying to leverage the inquiry for political gain, turning Labour supporters against the magistrate in question. 
 Opposition leader Bernard Grech even wrote to the police commissioner asking that inquiring magistrate Gabriella Vella be given police protection.
 Shadow justice minister Karol Aquilina also spoke on the Saturday morning radio show.
 Aquilina said it was ""ridiculous"" to question the inquiry's timing. 
 “Justice shouldn’t stop from happening because of an electoral campaign, it should happen whatever the circumstances,"" Aquilina said. “The fact that the prime minister is accusing the magistrate of having electoral timing in mind is ridiculous.""
 Aquilina said magistrates and judges who had previously been politicians have all proven to be competent and respected members of the judiciary.

Man charged with beating his partner with firearm is denied bail,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/132805/man_charged_with_beating_his_partner_with_firearm_is_denied_bail_,16-12-2024,001665.png,"A man has been remanded in custody after allegedly injuring and threatening his partner, including with the use of a firearm.

 The accused, who cannot be named due to a publication ban was arraigned under a plethora of charges including breaching five separate sets of bail conditions, causing slight injury to the alleged victim as well as possession of a firearm without the appropriate license.

                     The Court was informed that over two days the accused variously threatened that he would injure his partner. On one particular occasion, the accused allegedly took the victim to a field where he threw her to the ground and hit her with the firearm. 

 During the sitting, the alleged victim requested that the proceedings against her partner be terminated. She informed the court of her wish that any problems between herself and her partner be resolved privately, and that positive talks had taken place between the day of the filing of the report and the sitting.

 She declared that her statement was voluntary, and that she was neither enticed nor threatened to make such a request.

 The Court, however, presided over by Magistrate Victor Axiak, rejected the request, taking into account various factors including a risk assessment.

 A request for bail was also made. Whilst the prosecution objected, noting that the accused allegedly failed to sign the bail book on a particular day and that it was not confident that the accused would not commit another offence if granted bail, defence lawyer Franco Debono argued that the request of the alleged victim should at least be taken into account for the purposes of bail.

 It was furthermore argued that the accused was to be presumed innocent until guilty and that adequate conditions could be imposed by the Court.

 The Court rejected the request for bail, noting that it was not confident that the accused would comply with any conditions laid down by it.     ",Thomas Cilia ,court_and_police
Inmate dies 19 days after being found in pool of blood at Mount Carmel,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/inmate-found-pool-blood-mount-carmel-forensic-ward.1096078,08-01-2024,001683.png,"A man detained at Mount Carmel Hospital’s forensic ward while awaiting release on bail has died after he was found with head injuries in a pool of blood earlier this month.
 Jesmond Gatt, 54, was discovered on the ground in his room where he was housed with two other inmates on July 13.
 However, Gatt later succumbed to his injuries and died on Thursday morning.
 Prison director Chris Siegersma said on Thursday that the man had a long medical history and died at Mater Dei Hospital.
 The forensic unit, located within Mount Carmel psychiatric hospital grounds, is managed by the prison authorities.
 The police are investigating and a magisterial inquiry is ongoing, the police said.
 Siegersma earlier said: “The Correctional Services Agency has been informed that he slipped and hit his head.”
 Gatt, from Ħamrun, was charged with arson last April after allegedly setting fire to the main door of a Ħamrun house while an elderly man was inside.
 CCTV footage retrieved by the police allegedly showed Gatt setting the door on fire but the flames went out. He then returned to set it alight again, according to the prosecution.
 Gatt had a long criminal record and was recently released from prison after serving a four-year jail term, according to court records.
 Represented by his lawyers Franco Debono, Marion Camilleri and Adriana Zammit, Gatt’s initial bail request was denied, leading to his detention at the forensic ward.
 He was granted bail on July 9 and was waiting for his family to pay a €500 bail bond. He was also bound by a personal guarantee of €14,500 and had conditions to be home by 7pm and continued to undergo treatment.
 The exact circumstances of the incident remain unclear. Sources indicated he shared a room with two other inmates, raising questions about the safety of such arrangements for patients with mental health problems.
 In response, Siegersma said: “As with any other unit coordinated by the Correctional Services Agency, the Forensic Unit of Mount Carmel Hospital prioritises the safety and well-being of its patients. In respect to the ongoing inquiry, it would be imprudent for me to comment on an active investigation. However, I can assure you that our team is fully committed to ensuring a safe and secure environment for all individuals, even under such medical care.
 “Having mental health issues does not mean you should be isolated from the rest of the patients. We have protocols and procedures in place to address the needs of patients with mental health issues and to prevent harm within our facility. Collaborating with healthcare professionals and relevant authorities is essential in maintaining a standard that meets the requirements of a licensed facility.”
 Mount Carmel psychiatric hospital has been criticised for its run-down state and the government has pledged to close it down within the next four years. The process has started with the relocation of some 100 patients.

 The officials scanned the container - originating from Morocco and bound for Tripoli in Libya, following a risk assessment. 
  A first scan of six induction ovens in the container showed significant inconsistencies, and further scans left no doubt that irregular material was concealed in the ovens, Customs said in a statement. 
 Getting to the drugs was a complex process that took over two days to conclude and involved the Customs canine teams, a team from the Police narcotics squad and members from the Civil Protection Department.
 Once the panels had been dismantled, 4,300 kilos of Cannabis resin were found embedded in the inner parts of the induction ovens.
 Customs said this was ""a remarkable find not only because the quantity was considerable – even on an international scale – but also because the structures were ingeniously built to distract and mislead the authorities"".
 Last week, Customs intercepted a separate 50 kilos of cocaine from a container that arrived from Ecuador with the final destination set for Slovenia.

Habitual criminal given 44-month jail sentence for grocery store robbery,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/131626/habitual_criminal_given_44month_jail_sentence_for_grocery_store_robbery_,08-10-2024,001697.png,"A man with a criminal history stretching all the way back to 2004 has been jailed for three and a half years after being found guilty of stealing cash from a grocery store.
 Matthew Camilleri, 38, was jailed for 44 months by magistrate Donatella Frendo Dimech yesterday, upon his conviction for aggravated theft, breaching bail and breaching a probation order in 2019.
 Magistrate Frendo Dimech had taken over the case from another magistrate in February this year.
 A court representative who had been summonsed by the prosecution had exhibited copies of Camilleri’s previous convictions. In two separate theft cases in 2012, he had been sentenced to two years and four years in prison respectively, and subsequently placed on probation in 2018 in connection with another crime.
 The court said the evidence against Camilleri on the theft charge was unequivocal, as colour CCTV footage clearly showed Camilleri opening the shop’s cash register, taking out a wad of €20 notes and stuffing them in his pocket, keeping an eye on the back of the shop all the while. Camilleri was also proven to have been on probation at the time, and was therefore found guilty of breaching the conditions of the probation order.
 He was cleared of breaching bail however, as no copies of the bail decree in question had been exhibited.
 When handing down judgement, the court said it had to take into account his habitual criminality, noting that his “career in thievery” had started in 2004. Drug addiction appeared to be at the root of the man’s problems, but the court noted that Camilleri had not shown any intention to help himself or change his ways, and had instead pushed away the assistance that he had been offered.
 Camilleri was sentenced to imprisonment for 44 months, from which the time already spent in preventive custody was to be deducted.  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police
Court strikes down decision on €600 million waste-to-energy plant,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/court-strikes-adjudication-multimillion-wastetoenergy-contract-bids.1094201,20-06-2024,001698.png,"A court has thrown out the recommendations of a committee to award a €600 million contract for a waste-to-energy facility in Magħtab.
 The Court of Appeal found members of the original panel and board had a conflict of interest.
 Following an appeal filed by unsuccessful bidder Hitachi, the Court of Appeals ordered on Thursday that a new adjudicating committee be formed to consider the bids.
 Members of the Tenders Evaluation Committee and the Public Contracts Revision Board who considered bids for a multi-million contract for a waste-to-energy facility (an incinerator)  had a conflict of interest, the Court of Appeals ruled on Thursday
 
 The appeal was filed by Hitachi-Zosen Inova AG - Terna S.A., which had filed a €780 million offer to build and operate the waste management facility. Lawyers Matthew Paris, Adrian Delia, Luke Dalli Zack Esmail argued that the Tenders Evaluation Committee was irregularly composed and the tendering process was tainted. 
 The committee had recommended that Wasteserv award the contract to Paprec-Bonnici Bros consortium on the back of a €600 million bid, but the process was stopped when Hitachi appealed.
 Hitachi first appealed before the Public Contracts Revision Board, pleading that there had been a wrong evaluation of its bid, irregularities in procedure, and irregular composition of the evaluation committee.
 When the appeal was dismissed, it went before the court, again complaining about the composition of the adjudication committee and also arguing that two members of the revisions board, Kenneth Swain and Vincent Micallef, also had a conflict of interest.  The consortium also complained about irregular procedures by the board.
 
 The appeals court presided by Chief Justice Mark Chetcuti with judges Josette Demicoli and Christian Falzon Scerri, started by considering complaints about conflicts of interest by members of the revisions board.
 Hitachi argued that Swain had a conflict of interest since he was a former director of Enemalta, which had a power purchase agreement with Wastserv. Similarly, another board member, Vincent Micallef was a director of ClearFlowPlus plc which like Eastserv and Enemalta, had Malta Government Investments as its shareholder.
 The court upheld the pleas, adding that by so doing it was not saying that Swain or Micallef had decided in any manner which gave them personal gain or that they intended to breach good governance norms.
 The court declared the decisions of the revision board in this case as being null.
 The court also upheld pleas that Stephanie Scicluna Laiviera stood on the Tenders Evaluation Committee in breach of public procurement regulations as she was also on the list of members of the Public Contracts Revision Board and worked as Wasteserv Procurement Manager
 ""Once Stephanie Scicluna Laiviera was, by law, precluded from sitting on the Tenders Evaluation Committee, the composition of the committee was irregular and, as a consequence, all decisions it took were irregular too,"" the court declared.
 The court said that once it had already declared the committee's composition was irregular, it did not need to consider the alleged conflict of interest of another committee member, Charlon Buttigieg.
 The court therefore upheld the appeal by Hitachi and annulled the decisions of the revisions board and the recommendations of the adjudicating committee. It ordered that a new adjudicating committee be formed to consider the bids.

"Yorgen Fenech's constitutional case over disclosure filed prematurely, judge rules",maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/131559/yorgen_fenechs_constitutional_case_over_disclosure_filed_prematurely_judge_rules,05-10-2024,001721.png,"A judge has decided not to proceed further with a constitutional case filed by Yorgen Fenech, who is awaiting trial for allegedly commissioning the murder of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, in which he is claiming to have suffered “manifest prejudice” to his fair trial rights through what he said was the police’s failure to disclose all of the relevant evidence in their possession to his defence.
 Fenech had filed the constitutional application in December 2021, shortly after he was indicted for complicity in the journalist’s murder. The court filing states that the police had only revealed a limited selection of the evidence collected during the investigation, which he said had been hand-picked by the prosecuting official. 
  Fenech alleged that he had not been granted disclosure of recorded conversations between Melvin Theuma and Edwin Brincat, declarations and statements by other witnesses who had been investigated in connection with the proceedings against Fenech, as well as their mobile data and finally, data extracted from Daphne Caruana Galizia’s mobile phone and Keith Schembri’s electronic devices.
 This, Fenech’s lawyers had said, contravened a direct order by the Court of Magistrates, as well as the police’s duty to grant the defence access to all the evidence it had collected, including evidence which they did not intend to exhibit as prosecution evidence because it favoured the person accused.” 
 The lawyers had asked the court to declare that Fenech had suffered a breach of his right to a fair hearing and provide an effective remedy that would safeguard his fundamental rights in the circumstances.
 In their reply, filed in January 2022, the State Advocate and the Commissioner of Police denied Fenech’s allegations and related claims. The main thrust of their rebuttal was that Fenech could not claim that his fair trial rights had already been breached because the proceedings against him were still far from over and jurisprudence had established that could proceedings had to be examined “in their totality” in order to find possible breach.
 Fenech’s complaint was already addressed by a remedy codified in the law, added the respondents. If a person felt they had not been given full disclosure by the police, they had the option to apply to a court or magistrate, who would then be obliged to listen to what the prosecution had to say on the issue before deciding whether access to the evidence should be granted or refused.
 The claim was dismissed in a judgement handed down on Friday by the First Hall of the Civil Court, presided over by Madam Justice Audrey Demicoli.
 The judge, citing case law from the European Court of Human Rights, observed that the entitlement to disclosure of relevant evidence is not an absolute right, citing an ECHR judgement in which it was held that “in criminal proceedings there may be competing interests, such as national security or the need to protect witnesses who are at risk of reprisals or to keep secret the methods used by the police to investigate crime, which must be weighed against the rights of the accused. In some cases it may be necessary to withhold certain evidence from the defence so as to preserve the fundamental rights of another individual or to safeguard an important public interest.”
 The doctrinal “strict necessity” test of non-disclosure, coupled with the established restrictions on the use of other forms of secret evidence suggested that any non-disclosure of evidence would not breach the defendant’s fundamental rights “so long as that piece of evidence is not used to a decisive extent to form a basis for the conviction or is not a crucial piece of evidence in the case.”
 In a judgment handed down on  Friday, Judge Demicoli concluded that the right to disclosure was a qualified right, in which the court had the final say as to whether the prosecution had a valid reason to withhold access to certain documents or pieces of evidence from the defence.
 The judge also noted that in the time since the case had been filed, no less than fifteen further witnesses had testified in the compilation of evidence against Fenech, adding that it was therefore evident that there was yet more evidence to be compiled.
 “In the Court’s opinion, the applicant should have at least waited for the conclusion of the evidence at compilation stage before alleging a breach of his fair trial rights, in view of the fact that it is impossible for this court to carry out an appreciation of the applicant’s allegations at a stage when the picture is still incomplete.”
 The court abstained from taking further judicial notice of Fenech’s requests, which it said, were premature in view of the fact that the criminal proceedings against him were still ongoing, urging him to, instead, make use the legal remedies available to him at this stage of criminal proceedings.
 Lawyers Gianluca Caruana Curran, Marion Camilleri and Charles Mercieca assisted the plaintiff. The defendants were represented by lawyer Charlene Camilleri Zarb.

Man pleads guilty to trafficking third-country nationals,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/130395/police_arrest_man_for_human_trafficking_,24-07-2024,001739.png,"A Maltese man was handed a two-year prison sentence after admitting to human trafficking charges on Wednesday.
 The man, whose identity is subject to a court-imposed publication ban,  was charged with bringing in third-country nationals illegally and making false declarations to authorities.
 Inspector Karl Roberts told the court his arrest was the result of joint investigations by Jobsplus and Identità, after officials from the two entities received reports of an excessive amount of workers employed in the man’s company.
 Moreover, an inspection from Jobsplus found that one of the three restaurant’s under the company’s ownership was in the process of closing down. Another restaurant was not in operation yet, and a third was just a kitchen set up for online deliveries only.
 Despite this, many foreign workers were registered employees with the company. When Jobsplus discovered that the workers were registered as employeed with the company, but were not actually working there, the authority terminated their employments and forced them to pay their due taxes and national insurance.
 The third-country nationals told immigration police that they saw online adverts from the company for waiters, cleaners and dishwashers while still in India. They contacted the company, and were asked to pay a €1,500 recruitment fee.
 Both the prosecution and the defence agreed that the man should be given a two-year prison sentence on the grounds that he had cooperated with the police and pleaded guilty at the earliest possible stage of the proceedings.
 Lawyer Giannella de Marco, representing the accused, asked that he be kept in the appropriate conditions at the Corradino Correctional Facility, as he suffers from diabetes and high blood pressure.
 Magistrate Monica Vella, who presided over the case, sentenced him to two years in prison but recommended that the prison administration ensure that his health conditions are catered to.
 Jobsplus was represented by Bernard Zarb during the hearing.  ",Nicole Meilak / Juliana Zammit ,court_and_police

 On Wednesday, police said that a manhunt was underway after a 25-year-old Colombian woman was found grievously injured on a beach next to the Dragonara in Paceville. 
 Officers finally caught up with the man at around 8pm in Pembroke, where officers on the hunt saw a person that matched the suspect's description. 
 He was stopped and arrested on the stop. 
 It later resulted that the man in custody is also a Colombian national. 
 He is currently being held in the police lock-up in Floriana as the investigation continues. 
 Earlier on Wednesday, police said they were informed the incident happened at around 10am, on the beach close to Wilġa Street in St Julian's.
 It emerged that a 25-year-old Colombian woman, who lives in Sliema, was with a friend on the beach when a man approached them. A commotion followed.
 The man started brandishing a broken bottle and seriously injured the Colombian woman, police said.
 A medical team arrived on site and the woman was taken to Mater Dei Hospital for further medical assistance.
 Magistrate Philip Galea Farrugia appointed experts to assist him in an inquiry.

"Lilu King 'in legal limbo', lawyers argue, as court confirms validity of arrest",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/lilu-king-in-legal-limbo-lawyers-argue-court-confirms-validity-arrest.1100376,11-01-2024,001747.png,"Mohamed Ali Ahmed Elmushraty, better known by his online name Lilu King, remains behind bars “in legal limbo” after a second bid by his lawyers to challenge the validity of his recent arrest proved unsuccessful.
 Elmushraty, 32, was arraigned earlier this month over an incident where he allegedly threatened and injured a man during an argument at a Sliema bar.
 CCTV footage showed the alleged victim running “for his life” as Elmushraty gave chase.
 Elmushraty, who was out on bail over separate criminal proceedings, was subsequently charged with causing his alleged victim slight injuries, breaching the public peace as well as breaching three sets of bail conditions.
 He pleaded not guilty but was denied bail.
 But the case took an unexpected twist following the testimony of a medico-legal expert who examined both the alleged victim and Elmushraty.
 At the first hearing of the case earlier this week, the expert confirmed that the victim’s injuries were certified as grievous since he had suffered a fractured leg and ribs.
 Elmushraty suffered slight injuries in the incident.
 The prosecution informed the court that the charge sheet needed to be amended, changing the reference to slight injuries caused to the victim, to grievous.
 But that correction also changed the competence of the court.
 The more serious charge could only be presided by a court of criminal inquiry, rather than a court of criminal jurisdiction.
 Both are presided by a magistrate but their competence is different.
 Elmushraty’s lawyers argued that since the case would have to be sent back to the Court Registrar to be assigned to a different magistrate, the charges had lapsed and consequently the arrest was no longer valid.
 This was not a request for bail but a scenario where there were no charges against Elmushraty, argued defence lawyers Franco Debono and José Herrera.
 Magistrate Kevan Azzopardi turned down that argument, declaring that the correction of the charge sheet did not alter the facts in any way.
 And since nothing had changed, the court did not find reasons to declare the arrest invalid.
 Elmushraty’s lawyers then filed a habeas corpus application, arguing that the defendant was to be immediately released since his ongoing arrest was illegal.
 During a lengthy session,  legal arguments were thrashed out before duty Magistrate Leonard Caruana.
 “A person is under arrest over proceedings which have not started yet. If this is not illegal arrest, then we don’t know what is,” said Debono, highlighting the fact that the charges would have to be read out again once Elmushraty’s case started again before a different magistrate.
 At this stage, Elmushraty was “in legal limbo,” argued the lawyers.
 The prosecution countered that the defence should have filed the habeas corpus under a different provision of law, arguing that the court lacked competence to assess the validity of the arrest.
 Moreover, the defendant could file a bail request once his case was reassigned to a new magistrate.
 “That’s an enormous legal fallacy,” hit back Herrera, arguing that at this stage the defendant had nowhere to turn.
 “Lilu currently has no forum to review his arrest.”
 Laws of procedure were there to “safeguard a person’s rights,” continued Debono. “Casting aside those, we’d be doing away with everything.”
 After hearing submissions Magistrate Caruana observed that Elmushraty faced seven charges. Only one had changed, the rest were still effective.
 His arrest had been pronounced valid upon arraignment and so he was now arrested under court authority, rather than police or other public authority.
 Moreover the transfer of proceedings from one court to another did not bring about their termination.
 And finally, the habeas corpus was a repetition of an identical request put before Magistrate Azzopardi two days before.
 The legal and factual circumstances had not changed and the court could not review the decision given by a court of same competence two days previously, concluded Magistrate Caruana.
 Superintendent Jurgen Vella and Mario Haber, Inspector Eman Hayman and AG lawyers Kevin Valletta, Valentina Cassar and Dejan Darmanin prosecuted.
 Lawyers Franco Debono, Jose’ Herrera, Martina Herrera and Adreana Zammit were defence counsel.

Over 200 University academics condemn judiciary 'intimidation',timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/over-200-university-academics-condemn-judiciary-intimidation.1092188,05-09-2024,001770.png,"More than 200 academics have condemned attacks on the judiciary in the aftermath of the Vitals magisterial inquiry which led to criminal charges being filed against former prime minister Joseph Muscat, among others.
 “We are deeply troubled by the recent and ongoing attacks on the Maltese judiciary, particularly the targeting of a specific magistrate who conducted a sensitive magisterial inquiry on a topic of national interest,” a petition featuring the academics' signatures reads.
 As of 4pm on Thursday, 222 had signed the petition.
 “These attacks undermine the independence of a critical institution. An impartial judiciary is the cornerstone of a healthy democracy, ensuring justice is served without fear or favour. We firmly believe that the truth is essential for a just society. Only when institutions, including the judiciary, can function independently and without intimidation can the truth be revealed,” the petition continued.
 The University of Malta academics condemned any attempt to deflect scrutiny through attacks on the institutions responsible for upholding the rule of law.
 They also urged those ""who value a just and democratic Malta"" to support their condemnation. 
 The petition features the names of professors, faculty deans and lecturers. 
 It is the latest in a series of condemnations that Prime Minister Robert Abela and his predecessor, Joseph Muscat, have faced. 
 Both men have heaped scorn on a magisterial inquiry that triggered  criminal charges against top political figures, including Muscat himself, his chief of staff Keith Schembri and former health minister Konrad Mizzi, deputy prime minister Chris Fearne and central bank governor Edward Scicluna, among others.
 They all face charges ranging from money laundering to corruption and fraud.
 Abela has repeatedly claimed the magistrate purposely delayed the conclusions to time it with the European Parliament and local council elections, that the inquiry was biased and that sections of the judiciary were part of an ""establishment"" that was out to destroy the Labour Party.
 His comments earned him rebuke from NGOs, who said that his comments were 'authoritarian' and a 'threat to democracy', particularly those directed at  Magistrate Gabriella Vella, who oversaw the magisterial inquiry.
 Law students on Tuesday also staged a demonstration outside the law court, and employers have called for an urgent meeting of social partners to discuss the comments. 
 On Wednesday, Abela and Muscat received their strongest rebuke yet: President Myriam Spiteri Debono called for cool heads and said the judiciary should be allowed to work in a ""serene environment"".

 Caruso had been contesting the request for his rendition on the basis of what his lawyers said was the Italian authorities’ failure to guarantee that he would be held in conditions where his fundamental human rights would not be breached.
  In a judgement handed down on Friday, Magistrate Leonard Caruana rejected Caruso’s contestation to the European Arrest Warrant issued against him by Italy, declaring that there were no bars to extradition.
 The magistrate said that, although Caruso’s lawyer had raised a potential breach of his fundamental human rights as one of the grounds on which the extradition was being contested, his court was not the correct forum to tackle that issue. “Here, the court is not saying that the complaints about the alleged breaches of the fundamental rights of the requested person should not be examined, but that this court is not the forum equipped to examine it, which examination…requires an in-depth evaluation of the submissions as well as the evidence which either of the involved parties may have.”

 Jurisprudence had established that in such cases, the role of the Court of Magistrates was to ensure that the requisite elements for the execution of a European Arrest Warrant were satisfied, as its remit was limited to criminal law, as was the Court of Criminal Appeal.
 The magistrate ordered that Caruso be held in police custody until he could be returned to Italy.
 Following today’s unfavourable decision, Caruso is understood to be planning to file a human rights case.

 A police spokesperson however acknowledged that officers must list the contraventions they issue every day, as part of a broader performance review by which their work is assessed.
 “Police officers assigned to field duties are expected to enforce traffic legislation appropriately, without any predetermined targets for issuing contraventions,” a police spokesperson said.
 “This expectation is based on the volume of traffic and activity in their respective areas, and their respective shift duration.”
 The denial about officers having predetermined quotas comes two days after a police officer stationed in Ħamrun testified under oath that an unofficial quota system existed for traffic contraventions.
 Officers were expected to issue a minimum of 10 contraventions per month, officer Clive Mallia told the court, with targets higher in high-traffic areas like St Julian’s.
 Mallia was testifying in a case concerning five people who assaulted him and another officer following an argument over a traffic contravention.
 It was the first time a police officer had acknowledged the existence of a quota-based system. Community officers, previously called wardens, had such a system in place for years but it was abolished in 2015 following a reform of that system by the Local Enforcement System Agency.
 In reply to questions by Times of Malta, the police said that district police officers' performance is evaluated on “a number of criteria”.
 Each district officer must fill in an End of Shift Report (EOSR) every day to that end. The EOSR includes, among other details, information about patrolling, engagement with the public, road checks, and any contraventions or charges issued.

 Judge Edwina Grima dismissed the Attorney General’s appeal to convert the temporary freezing order into a permanent one and revoked the order completely.

 In its decision, the Court said that “the law firm DF Advocates can never be found guilty of any crime”. The decree mentions that in order to be found criminally guilty you must have a company or a united body.

                     In this case, the law firm of DF Advocates does not fall under any of these categories.

 The Court affirmed that the judicable persons are actually Jean Carl Farrugia and Kevin Deguara, where then, in the event of them being found guilty, a penalty would be imposed on them, even in the case of a pecuniary penalty, so that there can never be the conviction of DF Advocates as a legal person in itself.

 Jean Carl Farrugia and Kevin Deguara are two of a number of individuals and companies facing charges related to the Vitals scandal, which saw three state hospitals privatised.

 The deal was pushed forward by former Prime Minister Joseph Muscat and his administration. It was later deemed null by a court.

 This is the first freezing order that has been revoked in the Vitals case.

 DF Advocates were represented by lawyers Franco Debono, Jonathan Thompson, Ezekiel Psaila.     ",Jordan Pace ,court_and_police
Family of murder victim Nicolette Ghirxi call for independent inquiry,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/family-murder-victim-nicolette-ghirxi-call-independent-inquiry.1096913,19-08-2024,"001534.png,001535.png,001536.png","Updated 3.45pm with OPM reaction
 The family of Nicolette Ghirxi has called for an independent inquiry into the circumstances surrounding her murder at the hands of her ex-partner.
 Her former lawyer Joseph Borda and two members of the Ghirxi family told Times of Malta they wanted an inquiry “to establish the facts leading to her tragic death”.
 In response, the office of the prime minister said the Independent Police Complaints Board will review the conduct of the police force.
 Their calls come a week after the 48-year-old was found stabbed to death in her apartment in Swatar, Birkirkara. Her ex-partner Edward Johnston, who had been harassing her for months, was later shot dead by police after a three-hour stand off in St Julian's. 
 Borda urged the prime minister and the home affairs minister to initiate an inquiry “similar to the one that was opened following the murder of Bernice Cassar in November 2022”.
  That particular inquiry was intended to determine whether the authorities were, or should have been, aware that Cassar’s life was in danger and if there were any failings in implementing domestic violence law.  
 “May I publicly ask Hon. Byron Camilleri and Hon. Robert Abela that a similar inquiry is opened to establish the facts leading to Nicolette Ghirxi's murder,” said Borda.
 He explained that the ongoing magisterial inquiry, which primarily focuses on preserving evidence and determining criminal responsibility, “is insufficient to serve Nicolette with justice because the perpetrator is dead”.
 Speaking to Times of Malta, Borda said that this should not be a matter of controversy, asserting that “Nicolette’s family have a right to know what led to her murder, and if her death could have been avoided.”
 ""This is the only way we can identify the state’s failings and how it failed Nicolette,” he said.
 In a statement to Times of Malta, the prime minister's spokesperson said neither his office nor the home affairs ministry had receved any official communication from the victim's lawyer.
 ""However Facebook posts related to the matter have been noted,"" he said.
 He said the Independent Police Complaints Board, chaired by retired Judge Geoffrey Velenzia, is being tasked with assessing the implementation of the recommendations from the Cassar inquiry. 
 ""The board will also review the conduct of the Police Force concerning established standard operating procedures and relevant legisation,"" he added.
 In April, Ghirxi filed two harassment reports against Johnston, after receiving emails from him following their break up.
 However police said she decided against a risk assessment, telling police and social welfare officials of her decision in writing. 
 The following month she filed another harassment report, but at the time police established that Johnston was abroad. By July she reported slanderous posts about her on social media, informing police she suspected Johnston. 
 Last week her lawyer told  Times of Malta that Ghirxi could still be alive if the police had done their duty, rather than allowing her murderer to toy with them.
  He publicly criticised the police for failing to adequately protect Ghirxi by not acting on her harassment reports.
 He published emails showing how Johnston mocked the police when they summoned him for questioning last April, telling them he was abroad to “top up my tan"" in Dubai and challenging them to “notify Interpol” if they wanted to speak to him.
 In early 2023, the inquiry into Bernice Cassar’s femicide, led by Judge Geoffrey Valenzia, had established that the state had failed the victim, particularly because of a lack of resources and a heavy caseload.
 Cassar had filed multiple police reports on domestic violence against her estranged husband Roderick before she was shot dead as she drove to work on 22 November 2022 in Corradino.

Leasing company urges TM to stop tender awarded to alleged kidnapper,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/leasing-company-urges-tm-stop-tender-awarded-alleged-kidnapper.1096741,14-08-2024,001546.png,"A car leasing company is calling on the transport watchdog to stop a company linked to alleged kidnapper Christian Borg from continuing to operate a government tender it won four years ago.
 The company Davico Limited - which came second in the tendering process - is arguing that since Borg's company was in “conflict and direct breach” of that tender, the tender should be awarded to the runner-up.
 Davico Limited already cried foul two years ago when it filed a judicial protest against TM.
 In 2019, TM had suspended Christian Borg’s licence to operate the international franchises Goldcar and Rhodium. 
 But in 2020, Borg, as director of Princess Operations Limited, had made a bid for a public tender which involved the leasing of 38 low-emission motor vehicles, one crew/cargo van and two self-drive vans.
 The fleet of vehicles was meant for use by institutional and government authorities. 
 The tender document expressly stated that bidders attributed professional misconduct would be automatically disqualified.
 Davico Limited had claimed that Borg’s company was well aware of the situation concerning the licence suspension when submitting its bid.
 What was even more “inexplicable and alarming” was the fact that the transport authority did not take that “extraordinary” issue into consideration and made no mention of it when the matter landed before the Public Contracts Review Board. 
 Although well aware of Borg’s licence suspension, the authority allowed Princess Operations Limited to be confirmed as the winning bidder. 
 Davico Limited’s first judicial protest in 2022 went unheeded by the respondent authorities who did not file any reply. 
 Still, Borg and Princess Operations filed a judicial protest against Davico, rebutting the company’s claims and arguing that the licence suspension issue was still pending in court. 
 The licence had been suspended after the Malta Competition and Consumer Affairs Authority received “numerous repeated and extremely serious complaints of malpractices” from clients of Borg’s car hire company. 
 Borg took his grievances before the Administrative Review Tribunal which confirmed the suspension. 
 That decision was confirmed on appeal in March 2023. 
 The court of appeal, presided over by Mr Justice Lawrence Mintoff, did not only confirm the tribunal’s decision but observed that “years had passed and [Borg] failed to remedy the situation by improving his operations”.
 The appellant “had no interest in remedying his shortcomings so that the complaints would decrease,” said the judge. 
 That pronouncement cancelled the arguments previously made by Borg, said Davico Limited in its second judicial protest filed against the transport authority, the director of the department of contracts and the permanent secretary at the Finance Ministry.
 Once the licence suspension was definitive, it was now “blatantly clear that [Borg and Princess Operations Limited] were operating without a valid licence” and this was in conflict and a direct breach of the tender, claimed Davico, calling upon the relative authority to award it the tender as second-placed bidder. 
 The protesting party also stated that it would hold the relative authorities responsible for damages, whilst it reserved the right to take further legal action.
 Lawyer Adrian Delia signed the judicial protest.

 Just after the judgment was delivered on Tuesday morning, Brincau resigned his post and the Home Affairs Ministry immediately appointed Christopher Siegersma. Brincau had subsequently lodged an appeal.

 Witnesses had described to the court how the prison director had allegedly threatened an ambulance crew with a handgun in an incident apparently motivated by commercial rivalry between the ambulance service provider and the Malta Red Cross, which Brincau had been the director of.
 On Wednesday, the Court of Criminal Appeal, presided over by Madam Justice Natasha Galea Sciberras, rejected the appeal and confirmed the suspended sentence. It was explained to the appellant that the sentence would run from today.

 His whereabouts were reportedly betrayed by social media posts and stories published on Instagram and TikTok by people close to him. This information allowed the Italian authorities to zero in on the movements of two of his associates, before sharing the information they acquired with their Spanish colleagues from the UDYCO Fugitive Localization Group of the National Police.
 A surveillance operation was set up, and when Lapis’ associates caught a flight from France to Barcelona, police officers started tailing them shortly after their plane landed at an airport in Barcelona.
 Lapis' associates swapped taxis after leaving the airport in what police said was an effort to evade surveillance.
 They did not succeed, however and the police continued to track them to the outskirts of Barcelona, ​​where they were met by Lapis himself on a public road. At that moment, police officers moved in and arrested him on the strength of a European Arrest Warrant issued by Italy. He remains in custody awaiting extradition to Italy.

From the Bench: Mutual trust in European Arrest Warrant proceedings,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/from-bench-mutual-trust-european-arrest-warrant-proceedings.1098163,21-09-2024,001637.png,"The European Arrest Warrant (EAW) is a key instrument in judicial cooperation across the EU. Its primary purpose is to facilitate the extradition of individuals between member states, having replaced bilateral extradition treaties with a standardised process.
 The Framework Decision that ushered in the European Arrest Warrant promoted the principles of mutual trust and recognition between member states, aiming for the swift and efficient surrender of individuals either for prosecution or the execution of a custodial sentence.
 Malta transposed the EAW Framework Decision into its national law through the Extradition Act (Chapter 276 of the Laws of Malta) and the related Subsidiary Legislation 276.05.
 The principle of mutual trust and cooperation underpins the EAW, assuming that all member states uphold comparable standards of justice and human rights. However, this principle is not absolute, and member states retain some discretion to refuse the execution of an EAW under specific circumstances, such as concerns over fair trial rights or human rights violations.
 In the judgment The Police vs Thomas Zaugg, delivered by the Court of Criminal Appeal presided by Mr Justice Neville Camilleri on August 14,  the court was faced with an appeal concerning the execution of two European Arrest Warrants (EAWs) issued by Belgian authorities against the appellant, Thomas Zaugg.
 This case involved complex issues related to the application of the EAW Framework Decision, particularly in the context of judgments delivered in absentia and the principle of mutual trust and cooperation.
 Zaugg, a Swiss national, was the subject of two EAWs issued by Belgian authorities. The first, dated January 27, 2023, covered several judgments, including judgments from the Turnhout Criminal Court and the Antwerp Court of Appeal. The second, dated April 2, 2024, related to a sentence of 50 months’ imprisonment imposed by the Antwerp Criminal Court. The warrants sought Zaugg’s surrender to serve various prison sentences in Belgium.
 The Maltese Magistrates' Court as a Court of Criminal Inquiry ordered Zaugg’s return to Belgium, concluding that the execution of the EAWs was not barred by any legal impediments.
 Zaugg appealed, raising several grievances, including the application of article 4a(1) of the EAW Framework Decision, which deals with judgments delivered in absentia.
 Zaugg pleaded that the Court of First Instance erred in concluding that article 4a(1) of the Framework Decision was inapplicable to the judgment delivered by the Belgian court. Article 4a(1) provides for the refusal of an EAW if the individual was not present at the trial that led to a conviction unless certain conditions are met, such as being informed of the trial and having legal representation.
 Zaugg argued that the Belgian judgment was delivered without him being present or represented by a lawyer, and that the court had exercised discretion rather than merely revoking a suspended sentence. He referenced the Ardic and Zdziaszek judgments of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), arguing that his case should be afforded the protections under article 4a(1).
 The Court of Criminal Appeal rejected this grievance. It found that the Belgian court’s decision was based on a mathematical formula rather than discretion, aligning with the Ardic case, where the CJEU ruled that decisions revoking suspended sentences based on objective criteria do not trigger the protections of article 4a(1). The court held that the Belgian authorities had provided sufficient guarantees, and the execution of the EAW was therefore obligatory.
 Zaugg also contested the finality of the Belgian judgment, arguing that the Maltese court should have requested further information from the Belgian authorities to confirm whether the judgment was subject to appeal. He claimed that assuming the judgment was final without evidence violated his right to a fair trial.
 The Court of Criminal Appeal also dismissed this grievance, observing that there is no requirement under Maltese law or the Framework Decision for a custodial sentence to be final for extradition to proceed. The court also noted that the Belgian authorities had provided a guarantee that Zaugg could seek a retrial upon surrender, thus fulfilling the requirements of article 4a(1)(d) of the Framework Decision.
 Zaugg further argued that the EAW did not provide sufficient evidence that he was validly summoned for the Belgian proceedings. He requested that the Maltese court either annul the decision or seek additional information from the Belgian authorities under Regulation 13A of Subsidiary Legislation 276.05.
 The Court of Criminal Appeal rejected this argument, emphasising the principle of mutual trust between EU Member States. It held that the Maltese court was not required to question the veracity of the Belgian court’s findings, particularly in light of the guarantees provided by the Belgian authorities.
 In his final grievance, Zaugg argued that the execution of the EAW was disproportionate and violated his human rights under the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and Directive 2016/343, particularly regarding the right to be informed of the trial and the consequences of non-attendance.
 The Court of Criminal Appeal rejected this grievance as well, citing the CJEU’s ruling in TR v. Generalstaatsanwaltschaft Hamburg (C-416/20 PPU), which clarified that non-conformity with Directive 2016/343 cannot serve as a ground to refuse the execution of an EAW. The court emphasised that the Belgian authorities had provided the necessary assurances regarding Zaugg’s right to a retrial, thereby safeguarding his rights under the Directive.
 This judgment illustrates the strength of the EAW system and its foundation on mutual trust and cooperation between EU Member States. The Court of Criminal Appeal upheld the validity of the EAWs issued by Belgium, emphasising the limited scope of discretion in refusing such warrants. This case reaffirms the importance of mutual recognition of judicial decisions across the EU, even in complex cases involving judgments delivered in absentia, and underscores the balance between individual rights and the obligations of Member States under the EAW Framework Decision.

Woman grievously injured after being hit by a car in Gżira,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/woman-grievously-injured-hit-car-gzira.1094265,21-06-2024,001663.png,"A woman was grievously injured on Friday morning after she was hit by a car in Gżira. 
 The 51-year-old Gżira resident was walking in Rue D'Argens at around 7.45 am on Friday when she was struck by a Mazda Demio being driven by a 21-year-old man from Sliema, police said in a statement. 
 She was given first aid from a medical team on site and was later transferred to Mater Dei Hospital by ambulance, where her injuries were certified as grievous.

 As her coffin was raised and carried down the aisle at the end of service, the congregation burst into spontaneous applause.
 A visibly emotional Fr Anton D’Amato, who officiated the funeral, had earlier made a heartfelt appeal against violence and injustice.  
 “We must fight them with action, not lip service,” he said.
 “We live in a violent society.  We have become so accustomed to violence that we do not take action and turn a blind eye.” 
 Ghirxi was stabbed to death by Edward Johnston, her former partner, at her apartment in Swatar late on Sunday night.  
  Her body was discovered on Monday at 2am. Johnston was shot dead by police officers in St Julians after he pointed a gun at them. Officers later discovered the weapon was a replica.
 Fr D’Amato said he found it extremely difficult to process what happened to Nicolette Ghirxi.
 “Why has Nicolette had to die unjustly?  I am still not able to answer that question”, he acknowledged.
 ""What justice is this when such a vibrant person was murdered this way?  What justice is this?”, he repeated.
 Fr D’Amato called upon the grieving congregation to find solace, trust and hope in God.
  He said that many victims of violence are suffering in silence in their homes, and at their workplaces.
 “Although they do not die a tragic death they are dying every day in their hearts. Let’s fight this”, he insisted.
 Mourners heeded the wishes of the Ghirxi family, as they attended the funeral wearing colours rather than black.  
 Bouquets lined the staircases leading to the semi-circular, partly elevated altar.
 Singer Ivan Grech performed at the funeral.
 In a show of support towards the fight against violence towards women, the family has requested donations to be made to the Women for Women Foundation.
 Any other donations may be made to animal shelters.

 The accident occurred at around 5pm on Sunday close to a bend on the SS 115 state road connecting the two cities.
 Local media reports said the two Maltese suffered life-threatening injuries – termed ‘code red’ injuries by Italian emergency services – after being involved in a “violent impact” with a Fiat Panda driven by a 57-year-old Modica resident. 
 The car driver was also taken to the nearby Giovanni Paolo II hospital, but with “less worrying” injuries, Sicilian media reported.
 One news outlet said the accident occurred during an “increasingly disastrous summer” for roads in the Ragusa province and highlighted the “extremely dangerous situation” for motorists in the area.

Court rejects injunction request by San Ġiljan waterpolo player,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/court-rejects-injunction-request-san-giljan-waterpolo-player.1096385,08-06-2024,001698.png,"A waterpolo player's request for an injunction to stop a 12-match ban was dismissed by a court on Tuesday because the player failed to show how he would suffer irremediable prejudice by missing out on the matches.  
 The request was made by San Ġiljan waterpolo player Ben Plumpton.
 The ban was imposed by the ASA, waterpolo's regulatory authority, following a report by rival club Sliema that the player had bitten two of its players during a match on July 17. The ASA originally imposed a four-match ban, which was tripled on appeal.
 Plumpton took the matter before the civil courts where his lawyers argued that the ASA’s appeals board acted beyond its powers.
 The ASA defended its board and also pleaded that Pumpton's action was premature as he had not exhausted all avenues open to him before seeking the court injunction.
 In Tuesday’s decree, Madam Justice Josette Demicoli declared that at this stage the court would not delve into the issue as to whether the board of appeal acted beyond its powers and scope. To do so would be touching upon the merits of the case. 
 The right which Plumpton expected to safeguard and how that right translated into legal claims was “not at all clear,” observed the court. 
 Moreover, the court was faced with two conflicting versions as to what happened before the board of appeal. Plumpton  failed to prove that “what he alleged had actually taken place.”  He had also failed to show how missing out on matches would in itself translate into personal irremediable prejudice, said the court.
 Citing case law on the subject, Madam Justice Demicoli observed that the necessity of an injunction implied “something more than discomfort or difficulty.” 
 The applicant must prove that kind of prejudice which could not be remedied except by means of an injunction.
 Plumpton had failed to prove that prejudice, said the court, rejecting his request with costs. 
 Lawyer Herman Mula is assisting the ASA. Lawyers Charles Mercieca, Carlos Bugeja and Ismael Vella are assisting Plumpton.

Manuel Delia challenges gag order on Daphne Caruana Galizia murder discussions,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/131360/manuel_delia_challenges_blanket_ban_on_daphne_caruana_galizia_murder_discussions,24-09-2024,001699.png,"Manuel Delia has asked the Criminal Court to reconsider the blanket ban it imposed on public discussions about the assassination of Daphne Caruana Galizia and the person accused of commissioning it on broadcast and social media, in order to prevent further weakening of Maltese democracy.
 This emerges from an application filed before the Criminal Court earlier today by lawyers Evelyn Borg Costanzi and Matthew Cutajar on Delia’s behalf, in which it is argued that the prohibition imposed on the reporting of Fenech’s unsuccessful attempt at obtaining a Presidential pardon was too wide in scope, unnecessary in a democratic country and breached the right to freedom of expression.
  Fenech’s 2019 pardon request, which had subsequently been rejected at Cabinet level, was a publicly known fact which had been subject to a great deal of media coverage at the time. This fact was highlighted in Delia’s application to the court, which provides URLs to stories documenting it from MaltaToday, the Times of Malta, the Malta Independent and the Shift News.
 Fenech had never tried to hide the fact that he had requested a pardon either, pointed out Delia’s lawyers. In fact he had disclosed it himself in constitutional proceedings which he had filed in 2020, in which Fenech had contested the admissibility of Assistant Commissioner Keith Arnaud’s notes as part of the evidence against him.
 One of the grounds Fenech had raised in that case was that “the information had been provided to the police on a confidential basis with the aim of being given a presidential pardon…” Fenech had lost that case with the court ruling that the request was premature, in view of the fact that he was simultaneously making the same complaint to the Criminal Court as part of his preliminary pleas.
 The accused himself had also filed a sworn application to begin separate court proceedings, in which he was requesting an administrative review of the decision to refuse his pardon request.
 The lawyers argued that the order goes beyond the parameters imposed by the law, under which a court could ban reports on proceedings. While the law empowers courts of criminal jurisdiction to prohibit the publication of “writings, both printed and not, about the crime…of which the defendant is accused,” in her decree, Madam Justice Edwina Grima had also prohibited “public declarations and discussions on broadcast media and social media.”
 This, Delia’s lawyers said, meant that until Fenech’s trial’s start date, of which there is currently no indication, nobody could discuss or make declarations related to either the assassination of Daphne Caruana Galizia or to the person accused of that assassination.
 It also meant that even facts which had been unequivocally established during other proceedings which have since been decided, and which were raised by the accused himself of his own accord, such as the pardon request, could not be reported on or discussed either.
 “It is being respectfully submitted that the assassination of Daphne Caruana Galizia has enormous significance to democratic life in the country and the undersigned feels that any restrictions on discussing it  could not but translate into a weakening of the fourth pillar of Malta’s democracy, where not only does the media have the duty to deliver opinions, ideas and information about everything which could be in the public interest, but where the public also has the right to receive that information as laid out in article 10 of the European Convention of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.”
 ECHR jurisprudence had established that a breach of fair hearing rights could not be declared in advance of the hearing itself because of negative publicity, said Delia’s lawyers, “unless it amounts to a ‘virulent press campaign’ according to constant jurisprudence by the European Court - something which definitely does not exist in this case.”
 It was pointed out that jurisprudence had established that even in cases where a “virulent press campaign” had taken place, this does not necessarily always translate into a breach of fair hearing rights.
 Delia also informed the court that he was one of the organisers of annual events which mark the anniversary of Caruana Galizia’s murder, which are normally also broadcast and reported on by the Maltese, European and international press. He said the request for the lifting of the ban was also being made so as to ensure that the anniversary can be observed this October and that “those who wanted to campaign for justice to be done, both to Caruana Galizia as well as to her stories, are able to do so”.

 Joseph Muscat will appear before a magistrate to answer charges of money laundering, corruption, bribery and setting up a criminal association, among others.
 Those charges relate to the 2017 deal that the Muscat government sealed with Vitals Global Healthcare to run three state hospitals. 
 If found guilty, he, Keith Schembri and Konrad Mizzi could face up to 18 years in prison. But they are not the only ones to be charged with serious crimes.
 There are another 11 individuals and eight companies that stand accused of money laundering and other major crimes. 
 And then there's a second group of 14 individuals and two companies that will be charged with secondary offences. That group includes Deputy Prime Minister Chris Fearne, Central Bank governor Edward Scicluna and top civil servants. 
 Here is a complete list of the politicians, lawyers, accountants, civil servants and entrepreneurs who are expected to appear as criminal suspects before Magistrate Rachel Montebello in the coming weeks.
   It all happened on his watch.
 The fraudulent hospitals deal was conceived, negotiated and awarded under Muscat's stewardship. The lucrative contract went to Vitals Global Healthcare - a company that had no prior experience in healthcare and which the National Audit Office subsequently concluded should have never been allowed to bid for the deal. 
 Muscat is suspected of having been directly involved in wrongdoing, however. His house was  searched by the police two years ago. And prosecutors believe he  took kickbacks from the deal.
 They have now charged him with a list of crimes that include money laundering, bribery and trading in influence.
 Muscat denies any wrongdoing and says the charges are an ""abomination"". 
 Meanwhile, prosecutors have filed a freezing order against his assets up to a maximum of €30 million.
  Mizzi spearheaded the deal.
 He has previously been singled out by a judge for taking the lead on the suspicious contract, and for illogically accommodating Vitals even when they failed to meet their contractual obligations.
 Most controversially, he signed an infamous deal with Steward Health Care, which took over the deal from Vitals, that obliged the government to fork out €100 million if the hospitals contract was annulled.
 A court annulled the entire deal, including that side agreement,  last year. But Steward, which is now going through massive  bankruptcy proceedings in the US, is still fighting for that cut.
 It is the latest controversy in Mizzi's long list of political lows, ranging from his Panama Papers offshore scandal to controversy over the  Electrogas power station and allegations of kickbacks concerning a wind farm in  Montenegro. 
 Mizzi has been out of sight for months and has not reacted to the news that he will be charged.
 Together with Muscat and Schembri, Mizzi stands accused of money laundering, bribery, trading in influence and setting up a  criminal association.
 Like Muscat, he is the subject of a freezing order of up to €30 million.
  The former OPM strongman has loomed large over most government deals linked to corruption.
 Schembri seldom comments publicly and is yet to react to the news that he will be charged.
 He previously said his only role in the hospitals deal was to make a room at the prime minister’s office available for the signing of a memorandum of understanding between the government and Vitals investors.
 Court filings by Steward suggest he played a much more significant role, however, and those suspicions are given additional fuel by the charges prosecutors have filed against him. 
 Schembri stands accused of money laundering, bribery, trading in influence, setting up a criminal organisation with Muscat and Mizzi, and is also separately charged with having  sought personal advantages he was not entitled to, and of having  made unlawful or excessive claims.
 The charges also allege Schembri took a private interest in an adjudication or contract, resulting in fraud to the detriment of the government.
 Up to €30 million in his assets have been frozen as a result of the case.
 Prosecutors have also linked Schembri to three companies that they have also filed criminal charges against separately: Sciacca Grill Ltd, Kasco Engineering Company Limited and FSV Limited. 
 On Tuesday, the owner of Sciacca Grill told Times of Malta that Schembri has nothing to do with his business.
 It is the second major criminal case that Schembri faces: he is already pleading not guilty to similar charges of money laundering and corruption in a separate case. 
  Spiteri audited Vitals' accounts.
 In 2017, just one year into the hospitals concession, he warned that there was ""significant doubt"" about the company's ability to function as its liabilities exceeded its assets by €27 million.
 That year, the company paid out €7 million in directors’ fees. 
 Spiteri is among those to face the longest list of criminal charges. 
 Apart from money laundering charges, he is also alleged to have  filed false declarations and  taken false oaths, formed part of a  criminal association,  facilitated trading in influence for Muscat, Mizzi and Schembri,  divulged confidential material and  under-declared income made by Vitals investors such as Shaukat Ali Chaudary and others.  
 He is the the subject of a freezing order against his assets up to a maximum of €30 million.
  Meli served as a legal representative for Steward, which took over the hospitals deal for Vitals, and prosecutors allege that he served as a go-between between the company and Muscat, Mizzi and Schembri and bribed them.
 Other charges include money laundering,  using false documents, being involved in a  criminal association and  making false declarations. Meli has been hit with the single-largest freezing order of €32 million. 
 Prosecutors have also cited Meli as a representative of MTrace Plc, which is also listed as one of the defendants facing criminal charges. Another defendant,  Brian Bondin (see below) is also linked to MTrace.
 Relatively little is known about Vella, other than the fact he served as a legal representative for Vitals' parent company Bluestone Investments Malta Limited.
 In 2022, Times of Malta had revealed how Vitals regularly  transferred millions of euros to Bluestone hours or days after receiving large payments from the Maltese government. Those payments were intended to run state hospitals.  
 Over €21 million was transferred from Vitals to Bluestone between 2016 and the first two months of 2018.
 Swiss accounting records show Bluestone would go on to pay around €300,000 to Accutor AG, the same Swiss firm linked to suspect transactions with former Prime Minister Joseph Muscat.
 Accutor also received millions from Steward as part of the deal to buy out the concession from Vitals.
 Bluestone's ownership was layered behind a company in the British Virgin Islands.
 Vella stands accused of money laundering,  making false declarations,  criminal association and  making use of false documents, among other things.
 Up to €30m of his assets have been frozen as a result of the case. 
  It remains unclear what role Hillman, a former managing director of Allied Newspapers, is alleged to have played in the hospitals deal.
 Hillman was one of several people exposed by the Panama Papers to have set up secret offshore structures and is already facing criminal charges alongside Keith Schembri in another case. He and Schembri are alleged to have  defrauded Allied's sister company Progress Press of millions by overpaying for a printing press it bought off Schembri's company, Kasco.
 In this case, prosecutors say Hillman committed money laundering,  used false documents to commit a crime, and formed part of a  criminal association. 
 Like the other allegedly major players, he is the subject of a €30 million asset freezing order. 
  Sladden is another person whose name was previously not linked to the hospitals deal and we still do not know how prosecutors believe he profited from the deal.
 He is known to have been close to Keith Schembri as well as Ivan Vassallo, another of the individuals indicted by prosecutors. 
 Sladden faces charges of money laundering, using  false documents and  criminal association. Up to €30 million of his assets have been frozen. 
  Tonna and Cini are former partners at the now-defunct accountancy firm Nexia BT, which shut down after being racked by scandal. 
 The two men and Nexia BT first hit the headlines in 2016 after the Panama Papers leak revealed that they set up secretive offshore structures for Keith Schembri and Konrad Mizzi. 
 Tonna and Cini also featured heavily in the inquiry into the offshore company Egrant, which was cited in Panama Papers-leaked documents. 
 That inquiry found that Cini “created” documents to back assertions that the mystery Panama company Egrant was owned by his boss and Nexia BT partner, Brian Tonna. 
  But while the inquiry recommended that Cini be criminally charged, prosecutors opted not to do so. 
 In January last year, they were struck off the Malta Financial Services Authority  register, meaning they have been banned from holding new positions in any registered firm, including being shareholders.
 They already face charges over money laundering and falsifying documents, among others, in prosecutions sparked by inquiries into alleged corruption by Keith Schembri.
 They will now also be charged with allegedly having helped Muscat, Schembri and Mizzi commit their crimes, using  false documents and  criminal association.
 Both face asset freeze orders targeting up to €20 million of their assets. 
  Vassallo faces charges of major crimes both personally and as a representative of his companies Technoline, Eurabytes Ltd and Gateway Solutions Ltd. Those companies also face charges. He has been hit with a freezing order of €11 million.
 Technoline - which was itself a supplier of medical equipment - was in the privileged position of managing the procurement of all medical supplies for Vitals. Vassallo bought the company months before it got that contract and the deal is suspected to have been financed by the people behind Vitals. 
 In the first 10 months of 2022, Technoline was handed €824,000 in direct orders between January and October, more than any other company in Malta during the same period.
 Apart from money laundering, Vassallo also stands accused of having used  false documents,  criminal association, and making  false declarations.
 He is the subject of an asset freezing order totalling €11 million. 
 Three companies linked to Vassallo - Technoline Ltd, Eurabytes Limited and  Gateway Solutions Limited - are also cited as defendants in the case. 
  Bondin has been hit with a freezing order of €12 million and faces charges both in a personal capacity and in his role as director of Mtrace p.l.c, which also faces charges.  
 In 2019, an investigation by The Shift News  revealed that Mtrace, the company supplying cancer treatment and diagnosis equipment, had been bought out by Vitals for €2 million, with the company intending to make money off the back of cancer medication by selling it at a 25% markup.  
 Bondin stands accused of money laundering,  making false declarations and making use of  false documents. 
 Little is known about Gatt or his involvement, save that prosecutors allege that he used false documents, was part of a  criminal association and made  false declarations. 
 He faces those charges in both his personal capacity and as a representative of Technoline and  Eurybates Ltd, which are also cited as defendants. He has been hit with a €7 million freezing order.
 Conger-Thompson was Steward Healthcare Malta’s IT manager. He is facing charges related to money laundering, bribery, using  false documents and  criminal association.
 Prosecutors have also filed criminal charges against various companies linked to individuals who are facing charges. But Taomac Limited, which The Shift News has previously reported owned MTrace Plc before selling it off, is slightly different. 
 Nobody linked to the company has been cited in criminal charges and the company has been hit with a relatively minuscule freezing order when compared to the rest - one of just €62,500.  
 A second group of indictees also face charges in relation to the hospitals deal. They include Deputy Prime Minister Chris Fearne, Central Bank Governor Edward Scicluna, top civil servants and lawyers. 
 While these people are not alleged to have taken bribes or traded in influence, they still face serious criminal charges. 
  Fearne was Joseph Muscat's number two and retained that position under Robert Abela.
 Of all the people who will be charged, he holds the highest public office.
 Fearne was also the health minister overseeing the deal until it was annulled last year.
 Despite once famously describing Steward as “the real deal” when it took over the hospitals concessions from Vitals, the deputy PM later revealed the company had been running parallel talks with Mizzi and Muscat’s office while engaged in negotiations with the Health Ministry.
 Fearne repeatedly claimed he was  kept in the dark throughout the negotiations and had only learned of the concession being transferred to Steward from media reports.
 Last year, he told the auditor general that he had “expressed his dissatisfaction” with the work carried out by Vitals in the months leading to the concession.
 He is to face charges of fraud, misappropriation and  fraudulent gain.
 Following a long and illustrious term as health minister, he was waiting to succeed Helena Dalli as Malta’s next European commissioner, and Robert Abela has already  vowed to go ahead with his nomination despite the charges.
 But the situation will likely impact his prospects for the posts, as he must be approved by MEPs before being appointed an EU Commissioner. 
 Fearne said on Wednesday that he has yet to be notified of charges against him. 
  Scicluna was the finance minister when the deal was negotiated and concluded, and served that post throughout most of the concession period.
 Testifying in court in 2020, however, he said he had very little oversight on what was going on.
 He said he and his ministry were peripheral to the hospital privatisation project as it was being put together. He recalled Konrad Mizzi’s ministry presenting an outline of the project at Castille in March 2016, but said the presentation was sparse on details, and that by that time, a number of agreements concerning the concession deal had already been concluded.
 He said his ministry did not enter into the merits of the decision to award the contract to Vitals. Scicluna also claimed he did not know that the government had signed a clause that obliged it to pay Steward €100 million if the deal was stopped.
 It remains unclear, therefore, what wrongdoing the inquiry found on his part, because it has been kept under wraps.
 But he is also to face charges of fraud, misappropriation and fraudulent gain.
 Scicluna is yet to react to the charges and despite several calls for him to resign, he still holds his role.
 It is not just his role of Central Bank governor that he must grapple with, however. He also holds a seat on the European Central Bank’s (ECB) governing council, alongside central bank governors from around Europe.
 That seat means that he has “a special responsibility to maintain the integrity and reputation of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) and the European Central Bank (ECB)”, according to the ECB’s code of conduct.
  He was the top civil servant under Konrad Mizzi at the time when the deal was conceived, negotiated and awarded to Vitals.
 He had Konrad Mizzi's trust, as he followed him to the Tourism Ministry, when the minister was reassigned to that portfolio.
 Ronald Mizzi is still a permanent secretary to this day, only now he serves in Silvio Schembri's economy ministry.
 Every permanent secretary is considered the servant of the state, not the minister, meaning he is the officer responsible for seeing that the ministry is making the best use of resources in the best possible interest of the state.
 The permanent secretary is not a person of trust and retains their position even when ministers change, to be able to provide permanent, consistent leadership that seeks the interest of the people before that of any governing political party.
 He will be charged with fraud amounting to over €5,000, having made  fraudulent gains and  misappropriation. He will also be charged with having  committed crimes he was duty-bound to prevent.
 In an auditor general's report on the hospitals deal, he was already identified as being partly responsible for the governance failures.
 But in court he claimed not to have been involved in the talks leading to the €100 million agreement, saying he only learned about it from a cabinet memo distributed by Konrad Mizzi.
  Camilleri was the finance ministry's permanent secretary when the deal was negotiated and awarded, and throughout most of the concession period.
 He is widely known in political circles as one of the most loyal and respected civil servants in modern history.
 He served as the finance ministry's permanent secretary for 16 years, from 2006 until June 2022 when he retired - spanning a career during which he worked under both Nationalist and Labour administrations.
 Again, the specifics of his alleged wrongdoing remain unknown as long as the inquiry remains under wraps, but he too, will face charges as serious as the other civil servants - meaning fraud, having made fraudulent gains, misappropriation and having committed crimes he was duty-bound to prevent.
 Prime Minister Robert Abela has alluded to Camilleri's prosecution as evidence that the magisterial inquiry into the deal was unfair. Camilleri's only sin, Abela claimed, appears to be that he ""worked under Labour"". 
  Rapa led Chris Fearne's health ministry as its top civil servant between March 2013 and May 2022, spanning the period of negotiations with Vitals and Steward and throughout the concession period.
 His charges are identical to the other permanent secretaries - Alfred Camilleri and Ronald Mizzi - meaning he is charged with fraud, having made  fraudulent gains and misappropriation. He will also be charged with having  committed crimes he was duty-bound to prevent.
  Deguara is the Chief Financial Officer of DF Advocates - a law firm that served as legal advisers to Vitals as well its medical supplier Technoline.
 Both companies - DF Advocates and Technoline - are also being charged in court. And so is the sister company of DF Advocates - DF Corporate Advisory.
 He will answer to charges of document fraud, including documents related to VAT, as well as  money laundering.
  Deguara is a lawyer and the founding partner of DF Advocates, the law firm that provided legal counsel to Vitals and Technoline.
 The law firm was raided by police in connection with the Vitals investigation in September 2021.
 In a statement issued back then, the firm had refuted suggestions that it or any of its lawyers were being targeted for investigation by the magisterial inquiry.
 The magistrate and prosecutors appear to disagree, however. 
 The firm’s founding partners, one of whom is Deguara, are being charged not only as representatives of their firm, but also personally.
 Deguara will also face money laundering charges and of having actively  participated in a criminal activity and  criminal association.
 Deguara's law firm, DF Advocates, and its sister firm  DF Corporate Advisory Limited are also cited as defendants in the case.
  Farrugia is also a lawyer and a founding partner of DF Advocates.
 The law firm provides advice to local and international companies on day-to-day operations, local and cross-border transactions and other corporate issues in the financial services, gaming, aviation, yachting, shipping, citizenship and residency, real estate, litigation and dispute resolution, according to their website.
 Like his business partner Kevin Deguara, Farrugia will be charged with money laundering, having  actively participated in a criminal activity and  criminal association.
  Chappell served as Vitals' in-house legal counsel and is among those who will face the most charges. 
 Like the Deguaras and Jean Carl Farrugia, she stands accused of money laundering, and like Fearne, Scicluna and the three permanent secretaries, she will face charges of  misappropriation.
 She will also need to answer to charges of document fraud, including documents related to VAT and of having actively participated in a  criminal activity and  criminal association.
 Chappell, who is the only woman to be charged by prosecutors in connection with the case so far, is also the subject of the single-largest freezing order filed. Up to €42 million in her assets have been frozen. 
 Gatt is a corporate lawyer who worked with DF Advocates, the legal firm engaged by Vitals when the company came to Malta. He has since moved on to another legal practice.
 Little is known about Gatt and his direct involvement in the hospitals deal, but he appears to be a peripheral part of the alleged criminal conspiracy. Unlike his former colleagues, Gatt faces just one criminal charge – that of fraud.
  Mifsud Bonnici is a familiar name to political hawks who have followed the Muscat government’s trajectory.
 A lawyer with close ties to Konrad Mizzi, Mifsud Bonnici served as board secretary of multiple entities under Mizzi’s portfolio during his time in office.
 Apart from representing Mizzi as his personal lawyer, Mifsud Bonnici also had three key posts linked to the Vitals deal: he was board secretary to the evaluations committee that recommended the company for the tender, he sat on the negotiation committee that negotiated the concession and also formed part of the steering committee that oversaw the process. 
 Earlier this year, Times of Malta  reported that he was under investigation in connection with €1.4m worth of suspicious transactions. He says they were all above board.
 Mifsud Bonnici faces charges of fraud and forming part of a  criminal association.
  An engineer by profession, he was chairman of the evaluation committee responsible for choosing Vitals as the best company to run three public hospitals.
 Camenzuli had presented the evaluation report which former minister Konrad Mizzi had allegedly used to decide on the hospitals privatisation deal in one of the hearings for Adrian Delia's case.
 The report was never published, but the landmark judgment delivered last year concluded the committee had failed to carry out basic due diligence on Vitals, with Camenzuli insisting that was the responsibility of other entities.
 He is to be charged with fraud amounting to over €5,000 and having made  fraudulent gains.
  Castagna was on the evaluation committee which decided Vitals was the government's best choice. But he was also a Nexia BT official.
 Nexia BT is the same firm ex-government officials Konrad Mizzi and Keith Schembri used to set up suspected money-laundering structures in Panama.
 Castagna has himself since been charged with money laundering, in a case linked to Schembri.
 Two of his former bosses, Brian Tonna and Karl Cini, are alleged to have helped Joseph Muscat, Keith Schembri and Konrad Mizzi commit crimes in the hospitals deal. 
 Castagna has claimed in court to have been unaware that the government had already signed a memorandum of understanding with Vitals, before the tender was issued. 
 He faces charges of having actively participated in a criminal activity and  criminal association.
  An accountant by profession, he completed the committee trio.
 He has also acted as the financial controller of the Labour-leaning General Workers’ Union and has served on many government entities.
 He owned a company called B.E.D Limited, suspected to have been used to channel money from businessman Yorgen Fenech to the Labour Party.
 Like Castagna, Borg also claimed to have been unaware of the MoU with Vitals. 
 Borg is to be charged with fraud amounting to over €5,000 and having made  fraudulent gains.

Construction firm ordered to pay €1.1m damages to family of French teenager killed in Malta holiday villa,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/129974/construction_firm_ordered_to_pay_11m_damages_to_family_of_french_teenager_killed_in_malta_holiday_villa,28-06-2024,001788.png,"The family of a French tourist killed in a wall collapse at a holiday villa in Malta were awarded €1.1 million in damages by a Maltese court.
 In a ruling delivered on Friday, a Maltese court ordered a construction company and its two directors to pay damages to the heirs of 19-year-old Quentin Antoine Marie Michel.
 The victim died under the rubble of the wall near the pool of the Swieqi villa he had rented out with a group of friends in 2011.  The construction company which had built the property, Buz-Dov Developments, and its directors James Mifsud and Gordon Farrugia were prosecuted, together with the owners of the property.
 In a 2019 judgment, magistrate Donatella Frendo Dimech ruled that a “gratuitous danger” had been created when the wall had been built, four years before the accident, by contractors Mifsud and Farrugia without measures being taken to ascertain that it was structurally sound.

 Court experts had reported there only being a “smear” of cement holding the bricks together and that the semi-basement wall was both heavily cracked and not anchored to the rock behind it.
 Mifsud, Farrugia and the company were subsequently convicted of involuntary homicide and sentenced to two years imprisonment, suspended for four.
 In 2015, the Michel family had also filed a civil case for damages against Buz-Dov, Mifsud and Farrugia.
 The defendants had attempted to rebut the claim on the basis of contributory negligence on the part of the victim.
 But in the decision handed down today, Madam Justice Miriam Hayman had no truck with this argument.
 “The most difficult element for the success of the defence of contributory negligence is to prove on the basis of reasonable probability that the deceased, when he accepted to pose for this photo, had any idea that he was putting himself in the danger that had, in fact, occurred, and had chosen to do so regardless,” said the judge.
 “Was this unfortunate young man, who after being in our country for a mere two or three hours, who chose to pose for this picture, supposed to know, using logic dictated by normal reasoning and not technical or expert reasoning - the reasoning of the man in the street - and that at the tender age of 19, that it would collapse on top of him the minute it encountered the least bit of pressure?” asked the court.
 “The answer, bar any evidence to the contrary which was never exhibited is in the negative. More so when today we are aware of a fact that was unknown to this boy that this wall had not been anchored to anything!”
 In calculating the amount to be awarded in damages, the judge took into account the fact that Michel had been a hard worker, simultaneously working three part-time jobs to save up, while planning to specialise in the hospitality industry after completing his studies at business school.
 On the basis of testimony and statistical data, the judge set the teen’s average potential annual earnings to be €50,400, multiplying it by 33 years.
 The owners of the villa were cleared of all liability, with the court ordering the remaining defendants to pay the Michel family €1,140,955 in damages.
 The Michel family was represented by lawyer Michael Zammit Maempel.  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police
Courier accused of pilfering cash from his employer granted bail,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/courier-accused-pilfering-cash-employer-denied-bail.1098044,13-09-2024,001789.png,"A courier charged with allegedly breaking into his employer’s office and helping himself to the cash drawer was granted bail after denying the allegations on Thursday.
 Emanuel Sank, a 44-year-old Birkikara resident, was identified as the suspect who allegedly forced his way into his boss’s company office, unplugged the CCTV camera and then took cash from a desk drawer.
 The alleged victim reported the suspected theft at the Birkirkara police station, claiming that on September 3 he had found the forced entry and some €825 missing.
 CCTV footage showed a male suspect wearing a top, shorts, cap and flip-flops breaking into the office, looking twice at the desk, and then pulling out the wires of the CCTV camera, prosecuting Inspector Maria Francesca Calleja explained.
 A week or so later, the alleged victim received a call from his employee.
 “So you called the police…Now you’ll know who I am,” said the caller, identified as the defendant.
 He had allegedly confronted his boss because he claimed that when police knocked at his home, his daughter was upset.
 The suspect was subsequently told to go to the nearest police station where he was questioned.
 On Thursday he was charged with aggravated theft, causing damage to third party property and knowingly suppressing the traces of a crime.
 He was further charged with insulting and threatening his employer by misusing electronic communications equipment.
 He pleaded not guilty.
 The prosecution objected to the defendant’s request for bail since proceedings were still at an early stage, civilian witnesses were still to testify and also in view of the threat made over the phone.
 Defence lawyer Mark Busuttil rebutted that the court was to assess whether the alleged threat was realistic or uttered in the heat of the moment.
 Moreover, if the defendant were denied bail he would risk his job and that would complicate matters further.
 After hearing submissions Magistrate Rachel Montebello upheld the request, warning the accused not to speak to the alleged victim or communicate with him in any manner.
 He was to sign the bail book twice a week, to pay a deposit of €500 and bind himself under a personal guarantee of €3,000.
 The court turned down the prosecution’s request for a protection order after observing that one of the bail conditions was explicitly for the accused not to communicate with or approach the alleged victim.

Blogger Simon Mercieca denies being paid by Yorgen Fenech’s family,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/131284/blogger_simon_mercieca_denies_being_paid_by_yorgen_fenechs_family,19-09-2024,001803.png,"The academic and blogger Simon Mercieca has told a court that he had visited the home of Yorgen Fenech’s mother Patricia and vice-versa, but insisted that, with the exception of a food hamper, he never received any payments or gifts for writing about her son’s court cases.
 Mercieca, who has blogged extensively about the charges filed against the Tumas magnate who is awaiting trial on indictment, in accused of masterminding the assasination of Daphne Caruana Galizia, is an associate professor at the University of Malta’s Faculty of Arts, where he lectures on history. He was called to the witness stand in the libel case he filed against blogger Mark Camilleri, who had accused Mercieca of having been paid to publish blogs on Fenech.
  Patricia Fenech was due to testify on Thursday, but the magistrate was informed at the start of the sitting that she was unwell, so Mercieca was called to the stand instead, to be cross-examined on by Camilleri’s lawyer, Joseph Mizzi. 
 Mercieca confirmed communicating with, and on two occasions meeting Yorgen Fenech’s mother, Patricia. But he explicitly denied having ever received money for his blog posts about the Fenech case, at one point telling the court that his belief was that Fenech had been framed.
 Mercieca said the charges against Fenech had been weaponised against former PN leader Adriana Delia, whom he had supported for the PN leadership. “History proved me right… Daphne didn’t like Delia,” Mercieca said, adding that leaked chats between Yorgen Fenech and the former PN leader “were used to harm Delia.”
 Mercieca said his interest in the Fenech case was piqued after he hearing the testimonies, saying ""red lights started flashing,"" and after receiving an anonymous letter with information about this case, “which continued to strengthen my suspicions.”
 “So you are interested, not because of demographics, but because of the red lights and the letter,” suggested Mizzi in cross-examination.  
 The lawyer repeatedly asked Mercieca about his demographic analysis of the case against Fenech, but did not receive a clear answer. “My interest is because in my course at univeristy, my students are following the [judicial] process,” Mercieca said.
 When the question was repeated, he said the case had a demographic aspect. “If you see the angle that the process has an influence on a mass of people.”
 But when asked directly by the Court as to whether he had actually carried out any academic studies on this topic, Mercieca replied that he had not. “I maintain an absolute separation between my academic work and my blog. I do not even use University resources to work on it.”
 “My blog has thousands of articles which I authored,” said the witness. “But when I started following Fenech’s case, yes I started to take a deeper interest in it.” Today Mercieca told the court that he believed Yorgen Fenech was framed.
 Mercieca denied having been paid for his blogs. “Sometimes I receive small donations from the public, but these just cover the expenses. They aren’t large, I can afford them.”
 He denied having been approached by Patricia Fenech to write. “No. I approached her… And I never received any [payment] either.”
 He also denied meeting Fenech and the family lawyers at their property in Portomaso, but confirmed he had twice dined with her.
 “The only time is when we invited Patricia Fenech for dinner at Christmas, and she brought us a hamper of food.” The meal took place after Fenech had been charged with the murder, he confirmed.  “I got to know her during the case. Yorgen Fenech’s aunt was a friend of my mother-in-law.”
 On another occasion, he had taken his family for a pool day at the Hilton, which is owned by Fenech’s Tumas Group. “We decided to spend a day by the pool and my children chose the Hilton. I took the whole family and I paid my way.” This had happened once, in 2020, he said.
 Mizzi asked the witness whether he had ever discussed what Yorgen Fenech was going through with Patricia Fenech. “Something must have been said,” replied the witness, but denied the assertion that she had asked him to write about it, or that she had approached other newspapers to do the same.
 “What she said was that when he was arrested, her son was put in a room with a bright light in his face and that she felt this was inhuman. She had tried to speak to some people in the media… I can tell you in private who she approached.”
 “Did she tell you that she was prepared to pay media houses for good press?,” asked Mizzi. “No,” Mercieca replied.  He had already been writing about Fenech’s compilation of evidence at the time, he said. “She thanked me, yes, for speaking about the case but she never asked me to write anything.”
 Patricia Fenech had invited him over for dinner once, too, he added, but when asked whether the murder case was discussed on that occasion, he said “little to no” mention had been made.
 He would communicate with Patricia Fenech through a messaging app, he said, and not over the phone.
 Mercieca told the court that as part of a recent property purchase he had been subjected to “enormous” due diligence checks, which he had passed. “I had to give an account of every expense and income. I use credit cards exclusively. If I was paid in cash, I would have to keep this cash somewhere.”
 He also said that a recent attempt by his wife to deposit a €50 cheque in her HSBC account had been rejected for “irregular endorsement.”
 Camilleri’s lawyer, pointing out that Mercieca was still employed at the University of Malta and enjoyed the support of the Dean of his department, suggested that this incident was not the result of the blogs written about him, but as a result of Mercieca’s own posts about Yorgen Fenech.
 Mercieca disagreed. “They are surely not positive propaganda,” he said of Camilleri's blog posts and highlighted a reader’s comment under one of Camilleri’s stories about him, telling the court that it had been written by a fellow academic. “The mafia couldn’t have a better mouthpiece,” it reads.
 “Financial damages, I obviously haven’t suffered,” Mercieca said. “But academically I have been ostracised,” later conceding, on the court’s direct question, that his ostracisation was “outside the university community.”
 “I tie this to all the propaganda, not just Mark Camilleri,” he added.
 The case was adjourned to October. Lawyer William Cuschieri is assisting Mercieca.  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police
Man remanded in custody after choking former partner and threatening to kill her,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/129189/man_remanded_in_custody_after_choking_former_partner_and_threatening_to_kill_her_,14-05-2024,001817.png,"A 28-year-old man from Sweden, Oscar Olsen, has denied attempted murder charges after allegedly trying to strangle his ex-partner.
 The man was also accused of threatening to kill the woman and holding her against her will.
 During the man’s arraignment on Tuesday, police inspector Sherona Buhagiar told the court that the victim had asked for police assistance through Facebook after an incident where the man had tried to choke her.
  The two had argued at a friend’s house, after the defendant snatched away the woman's mobile phone and discovered messages she had exchanged with other men.
 Later that night, when the woman had gone to bed at their home, Olsen had tried to choke her, while threatening to kill her. The woman told the police that this was the tenth time that the man had done this to her. The inspector added that the police had observed marks around the woman’s neck, resulting from the attack.
 Bail was requested by defence lawyers Franco Debono and Adreana Zammit. The prosecution objected to the man’s release from arrest, arguing that the alleged victim was yet to testify and that the man had assaulted her several times in the past.
 The defence depicted the incident as a case of self-defence, claiming that the woman had assaulted the defendant first, and that therefore he had defended himself. Olsen had a stable job in gaming, had resided in Malta for the past six years and had a fixed address.
 Magistrate Charmaine Galea denied bail. A protection order was issued for the woman.
 The prosecution was led by lawyers Etienne Savona and Manuel Grech for the Office of the Attorney General together with inspector Sherona Buhagiar. Lawyers Franco Debono and Adreana Zammit assisted the defendant.  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police
"Suspected arsonist took a cab to and from scene of car fire, court hears",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/suspected-arsonist-took-cab-scene-car-fire-court-hears.1098069,13-09-2024,001868.png,"A suspected arsonist who took a cab to and from the site where a car burst into flames, was remanded in custody after pleading not guilty to the arson attack.
 Joshua Gatt, a 35-year-old gypsum installer from Tarxien, was tracked down as the suspect who wilfully targeted a car parked on Triq San Ġwann in Cospicua on August 28.
 The arson took place between midnight and 3am.
 CCTV footage from the scene showed the suspected arsonist sprinkling liquid onto the vehicle which then burst into flames. The suspect fled from the scene.
 Two other vehicles parked close by were also damaged by the fire.
 Investigators noted that the suspect arrived at the scene in the very early hours of that August morning in a Peugeot vehicle. He left in another vehicle.  
 Working on the suspicion that those vehicles were taxis, police traced two cab bookings matching the time and location of the arson. Both bookings were made from Gatt’s account, explained prosecuting inspector Jeffrey Scicluna Briffa.
 CCTV footage near Gatt’s residence further confirmed police suspicions. 
 Gatt was arrested and charged with wilful arson, wilful damage to third-party property, involuntary damage to two other vehicles, wilful breach of public peace and disturbing the repose of residents. 
 A request for bail was objected to by the prosecution given the gravity of the offences, the early stage of the proceedings and the fact that civilian witnesses were still to testify. 
 Moreover, the accused had an acute drug problem and various past convictions for theft.
 Other people may also have been involved in the arson attack. 
 Defence lawyer Roberto Spiteri pointed out that this incident took place two weeks ago. 
 Spiteri said the arrest was based on CCTV footage and information from the cab company app. He said there were no eyewitnesses to confirm it was Gatt.
 Gatt’s past convictions were for drug-related offences and petty thefts. He was not charged with recidivism, argued the lawyer. 
 Asked by the court whether the defendant had drug dependency issues, his lawyer replied in the affirmative. 
 “Some supervision would help,” said Spiteri.
 “We don’t stand to gain anything by putting someone in prison,” the lawyer continued, highlighting the reformative aspect of punishment. 
 In light of these submissions, the court presided over by Magistrate Rachel Montebello, placed the defendant under a temporary supervision order, observing that it was in his best interests to be monitored by a probation officer. 
 However, given the gravity of the charges and the defendant’s drug dependence which could affect his trustworthiness, the court turned down the request for bail. 
 AG lawyer Joseph Camilleri Azarov and Inspectors Jeffrey Scicluna Briffa, Mario Xiberras and Antonello Magri prosecuted. Lawyer Roberto Spiteri was the defence counsel.

Man jailed for seven-and-a-half years for violent 2005 robbery,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/man-jailed-sevenandahalf-years-violent-2005-robbery.1091788,05-01-2024,001872.png,"A man who violently robbed an elderly woman at her St Julian’s home 19 years ago has been sentenced to seven-and-a-half years in prison.
 Keith Cremona, now 36, was 17 years old when he robbed the woman in July 2005.
 He was convicted by a criminal court on Tuesday evening, following a two-day trial.
 Cremona’s 69-year-old victim has since passed away but her testimony earlier on in the proceedings before the Magistrates’ Court was read out at the first day of the trial.
 Benedetta Meilaq recounted how that morning around 9:30am she was quietly cooking in her kitchen when the doorbell rang. She went to the front door. That was the start of her ordeal.
 Three strangers, faces uncovered, stood outside. They barged in, pushing her aside and causing her to fall.
 The aggressors told her to hand over her money, but the woman said that she had none.
 She offered them her gold valuables instead but one of the robbers insisted on cash, saying that he had “two kids” and needed the money.
 While two of the intruders rummaged through her possessions, the third suspect, later identified as Cremona, allegedly dragged the woman along the corridor floor, right up to the kitchen where he grabbed a cordless phone and hit her on the head.
 He also twisted her right arm so roughly that she suffered a dislocated shoulder. The pain was “agonizing,” the victim later testified.
 She also told police the men were armed with a hunting shotgun.
 Meilaq told her aggressors about a purse with some money she used to keep at home. They found that purse with some Lm200 (€460) inside. The robbers took the money and fled the scene.
 Dazed and in pain, blood dripping from the cut on her head, the victim managed to make it to the front door but collapsed on the porch.
 A neighbour heard her cries for help. He went outside and found Meilaq lying on the floor, blood dripping from her head.
 Another woman who lived nearby was cleaning her balcony that morning when she heard Meilaq’s cries for help. The neighbour later told police that she had found the elderly victim with “a lot of blood” on her head and torn clothes.
 Other neighbours who were questioned by the police shortly after the incident said they heard nothing.
 None of those neighbours were summoned as witnesses at Cremona’s trial, and nor was the officer in charge of criminal investigations at the time.
 Those shortcomings were pointed out by Madam Justice Scerri Herrera when delivering  judgment on Tuesday evening.
 Cremona’s trial was assigned to the judge in 2019, but the accused subsequently filed constitutional proceedings. Health issues he suffered further delayed the trial.
 The judge noted that attorney general lawyers who were leading the prosecution during the trial were not to blame for “blatant shortcomings”, as they had stepped into the shoes of their predecessors when the bill of indictment had already been issued.
 Not summoning the victim’s neighbours and the investigating officer was a “serious shortcoming” in police work, supervised by the AG during the compilation of evidence.
 Photos of potential suspects that were shown to the victim years ago were not included in evidence.
 Nor did police ask the inquiring magistrate for an identification parade. At the time of the incident, the victim was unable to identify her aggressors, simply describing one of them as “thin.”
 No eyewitnesses were produced as witnesses to shed more light on the events of that July morning.
 Lacking such evidence, the Criminal Court had to examine the victim’s testimonies given shortly after her ordeal, then at the magisterial inquiry and seven years later during Cremona’s compilation of evidence.
 Although there were some divergences, she was consistent in all three versions. Meilaq also identified Cremona in court and said that she still suffered a painful shoulder, a reminder of her ordeal seven years before.
 Other forensic evidence, namely four fingerprints lifted from a wooden chest inside Meilaq’s home, were later found to match those of the accused.
 Criminal investigations kicked off immediately after the incident but it was years later that police received confidential information about Cremona’s alleged involvement in the crime.
 Cremona was subsequently charged in 2012 with aggravated theft, unlawfully holding his victim against her will as well as grievous bodily harm.
 He pleaded not guilty, denying the allegations and insisting that he had never been to that St Julian’s residence.
 Based on the evidence put forward, the court was convinced that Cremona was one of the three aggressors who assaulted and robbed the victim.
 He was declared guilty and condemned to an effective jail term of seven and a half years, after the court also took note of his voluminous record. The prosecution had requested a maximum sentence of 30 years.
 He was also ordered to pay €1,255.29 in court expert expenses within six months.
 AG lawyers Kevin Valletta and Ramon Bonett Sladden prosecuted.
 Lawyers Arthur Azzopardi, David Gatt and Ishmael Psaila were defence counsel.

"'AG was with us in hospitals talks,' say three officials she's prosecuting",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/ag-us-hospitals-talks-say-three-officials-prosecuting.1093090,27-05-2024,"001881.png,001882.png","The three top civil servants the Attorney General is prosecuting this week over the hospitals deal are insisting she was with them in talks over the concession, and therefore has a conflict of interest.
 In a judicial protest filed in court on Monday afternoon through their lawyers, Alfred Camilleri, Joe Rapa and Ronald Mizzi said they want AG Victoria Buttigieg to reconsider her decision to charge them over the hospitals scandal.
 ""They are being charged over what they allegedly did when she was the state advocate assisting them on the same matter,"" their lawyers said in the judicial protest.
 ""They also believe she assumed a conflicting position. For these reasons, they are asking her to reconsider her decision to arraign them with criminal charges and are holding her responsible for damages.""
 In reply to Times of Malta's questions, Buttigieg denied ever attending any ""meeting having responsibility to decide the way forward on such concession"".
 The three men, who served as finance and health permanent secretaries during the deal, are scheduled to be charged with secondary offences on Wednesday, along with former ministers Chris Fearne and Edward Scicluna, among others.
 But they say they have correspondence showing that the AG herself - who was then state advocate - was invited to formal meetings about the future of the concession and that they remember her attending the meetings, during which she was tasked with offering them legal guidance and advice.
  ""She was also included in an email for her attention and consultation that contained a draft with the government's position on the concession,"" they said.
 ""At no point were any shortcomings highlighted on the part of [the permanent secretaries]. Ironically, the draft re-negotiated concession could not be signed because they refused to, for several reasons. They did not want to proceed on the newly negotiated concession!"" 
 Times of Malta understands the three permanent secretaries were among other high-level state officials who, in 2020, were tasked with discussing the terms of a new concession agreement with Steward Healthcare and advice cabinet on the best way forward on the tumultuous deal.
 Steward Healthcare had been locked in talks with the government about improving the terms of the deal ever since taking over the contract from Vitals Global Healthcare in 2018.
 The government had agreed to renegotiate aspects of the controversial, 30-year, multi-million euro concession but talks were often stuck in stalemate for months and the group was tasked with recommending the best way forward to the government.
 The task force also included then-permanent secretaries Joe Rapa, Alfred Camilleri and Ronald Mizzi, all of whom will now be criminally prosecuted by Buttigieg on Wednesday.
 But Buttigieg denied ever being in the meetings and said there is no conflict of interest.
 ""I did not attend any government task force meeting having responsibility to decide the way forward on such concession,"" she told Times of Malta in a reply to questions.
 ""During 2020 until the 8th September of that year, I occupied the role of State Advocate and exercised my functions in such capacity. I assure you that there is no conflict of interest and in any case the Attorney General does not have a judicial function, thus, I kindly urge you to disregard speculative information that does not contribute to the judicial process or the pursuit of justice, a goal that I believe is shared by all.""
 Times of Malta also understands that during those talks the permanent secretaries had raised concerns on the concession and by the middle of that year they pulled out of the task force.
 Buttigieg went on to be promoted to attorney general in September that year.
 On Wednesday, following the publication of the magisterial inquiry, she will be taking all three permanent secretaries, among others, to court to face criminal charges of alleged fraud, misappropriation and having committed crimes they were duty-bound to prevent.
 The judicial protest was signed by lawyers Stefano Filletti, Michael Sciriha, Marion Camilleri, Franco Debono and Maurice Meli.

Weeping hunter admits to injuring fellow hunter in freak Żabbar shooting,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/weeping-hunter-admits-injuring-fellow-hunter-freak-zabbar-shooting.1097928,09-12-2024,001892.png,"A man involved in a freak shooting incident, injuring another hunter on Monday, wept bitterly upon arraignment on Wednesday, claiming that he never meant to shoot at anyone.
 When shots rang out at around 7 am in the fields at Triq Anard, Żabbar, a morning hunt for snails turned terribly sour for Simon Camilleri, a 36-year-old public cleansing worker who wept unconsolably in court today. 
 His lawyer explained that he had gone with his father to the family field to hunt for snails that morning. 
 But the sudden sighting of a turtle dove triggered him into action he later greatly regretted. 
 Grabbing his father’s hunting shotgun, he fired.
 The pellets hit another hunter who happened to be nearby. 
 “He thought that he was alone in the field,” explained his legal aid lawyer Yanika Barbara Sant.
 “He acted in a split second without thinking,” she added, as the accused wept, wiping the tears dripping onto the lawyers’ table away with his shirt. 
 Camilleri pleaded guilty to attempting to hunt without a valid licence, possession of a Benelli firearm and involuntarily causing the victim slight injuries. 
 He was also charged with relapsing. 
 Prosecuting Inspector Gabriel Kitcher pointed out that the defendant had cooperated and behaved well, although this was “not an isolated incident.” 
 The prosecution would not object to a punishment tending towards the minimum.
 The defence argued further that the defendant had never intended to hurt anyone and said he was “very sorry” during interrogation. 
 “This was indeed a most unfortunate incident,” said Barbara Sant as her client and his elderly mother wept. 
 Appearing in court in a t-shirt splashed with the phrase “Everything is Amazing and Nobody is Happy,” the defendant addressed the magistrate.
 “Please Your Honour, don’t be too harsh with me,” he sobbed through his tears. 
 “I must follow the law,” replied Magistrate Lara Lanfranco. 
 This prompted some commotion from the accused's mother, who said that her son had been hit by seven pellets and that ""they had shot at him to kill him"". 
 After some deliberation, the court handed down punishment, 20 months of effective imprisonment and a fine of €7,000. 
 He was also placed under a two-year restraining order not to approach the victim even after serving time. 
 “I wish there was some programme for hunting like there is for drug [rehabilitation],” said the accused. 
 “Ħa mmorru ġewwa! Goodbye,” he said as he followed his escorting officers out of the room.

Charity fraudster given a second chance by court,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/woman-pretended-charity-collector-given-second-chance-court.1101785,29-11-2024,001912.png,"A woman caught red-handed fraudulently collecting money on behalf of a local charity has been given “another chance” to get her life back on track. 
 The 34-year-old mother from Żabbar was escorted to court under arrest on Friday after being caught by officers from the Valletta district trying to sell booklets published by Helping Hands, a voluntary organization teamed up with the Malta Hospice Movement. 
 The woman, whose name is being withheld to safeguard the identity of her child, was a former employee of Hospice Malta but told the court that she had left the organisation after getting a job elsewhere. 
 Prosecuting Inspector Gabriel Micallef explained that last month, police started receiving reports about someone requesting money from passersby while posing as a charity representative. 
 When officers received another such report on Thursday, the police headed to the indicated site where they came across the woman trying to sell a booklet. 
 She was arrested and taken in for questioning at around 4:45pm. 
 The officers had heard her asking for money for the publication, explained the prosecutor.
 The woman had also allegedly been spotted on previous occasions by Hospice Malta staff asking for money. 
 When arrested, she was found in possession of an identity tag which the police confirmed as fake. 
 Upon arraignment she was charged with fraud, making fraudulent gains to the detriment of Helping Hands to the tune of some €200 as well as making a false declaration in a public document. 
 The court sought information about the woman’s background. 
 She had a drug problem in the past but claimed to have been clean for the last seven years, said the inspector. 
 “She might need some guidance to get back on track, possibly because of the bad company she had been keeping lately,” went on Micallef. 
 “It was an unfortunate incident,” intervened defence legal aid lawyer Ilona Schembri. 
 “This was no unfortunate incident but a premeditated one,” remarked presiding Magistrate Kevan Azzopardi, seeking further information about the woman’s current situation. 
 “I have a social worker. If I’m out of here I’ll go to her so that we can work on a plan,” the defendant told the court, weeping and sniffling in the dock as her mother sat silently at the back of the courtroom. 
 The court was then told that the woman had an 11-year-old son. 
  “I am caring for the boy,” stepped in the defendant’s mother, standing up to address the court. 
 The court was not convinced that the woman was yet out of the woods, saying she needed to find a job. 
 “And to steer clear of bad company. To choose her friends [wisely],” added the prosecutor, while the defendant sniffled.
 “If you persist along this path, it will lead you to a long spell of imprisonment,” the magistrate warned her.
 The woman pleaded guilty.
 “I admit I was wrong,” she said. 
 “You’re getting another chance in the child’s interest. His place is with you not your mother. He is the most important person in your life. You’ve burdened your mother long enough with your problems,” said the court, giving the accused quite an earful. 
 “If you want to lose sight of your son as he grows up, persist in this path,” Magistrate Azzopardi warned. 
 After carefully weighing the circumstances and checking the woman’s criminal record, the court placed her under a three-year Probation Order and a two-year Treatment Order. 
 The accused’s last offence dated back to 2014 at a time when she was going through a rough patch on account of her drug addiction. 
 The court ordered that the probation officer was to ask the woman for a urine sample at least once a month and to report back to court immediately should that test result positive to drugs. 
 The officer was to update the court on the woman’s progress on a six-monthly basis. 
 Inspector Gabriel Micallef prosecuted. Lawyer Ilona Schembri was legal aid counsel.

Court declares government's legal phone tapping powers breach fundamental rights,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/131478/court_declares_governments_legal_phone_tapping_powers_breach_fundamental_rights,30-09-2024,001926.png,"The absence of safeguards against abuse when approving phone tapping requests has been found to have breached the fundamental rights of a man accused of drug smuggling.
 This emerges from a judgement handed down earlier on Monday by Madam Justice Miriam Hayman, in the Constitutional case filed by alleged heroin smuggler, Joseph Lebrun.
 It is the latest of a number of judgments in recent years, which express concern at the weak safeguards and oversight of the Malta Security Service (MSS).
  
  How does the law regulate phone tapping?
 MSS is regulated by the Security Service Act, which establishes that the Minister responsible for MSS is designated “from time to time” by the Prime Minister - the same Prime Minister who also personally appoints the Commissioner who is meant to “keep under review the exercise by the Minister of his powers” of issuing of warrants for the “entry and interference with property” and the interception of communications. The wording used in the law implies that the Minister can also arbitrarily exercise those powers, for which exercise he is accountable to precisely no one.
 In fact, the Minister is legally immune in the event that abuses are found to have taken place.
 Offences against the Security Services Act, that is to say, abusing the powers conferred by the Act, can only be committed by persons other than the minister.
 The Act punishes “a person who intentionally intercepts or interferes with a communication in the course of its transmission...”  with up to two years in prison and/or a €5,000 fine.
 It however, excludes all guilt for that offence “if the communication is intercepted or interfered with in obedience to a warrant issued by the Minister”; or where there are “reasonable grounds” to believe the subject consented to interception; or if it was carried out “for purposes connected with the provision of postal, wireless telegraphy or telecommunication services or with the enforcement of any enactment relating to the use of those services.”
 Effectively, the Minister and the Prime Minister when acting in his stead, can do no wrong in terms of this particular law. The Lebrun case
 Joseph Lebrun and two other persons were accused of being involved in a seaborne illegal drug smuggling operation in 2005. The police investigation had roped in MSS, which had been intercepting telephone calls regarding the alleged importation.
 Police officers had testified that the operation, in which the heroin consignment was successfully intercepted, was built around the information gleaned from these calls.
 Court proceedings against Lebrun had collapsed in late 2005 after the court of magistrates ruled that there was insufficient evidence to indict him, but were revived by the Attorney General who requested Lebrun’s re-arrest in December that year. After a Constitutional battle which led to a change in the law, a bill of indictment was finally issued in 2014.
 Lebrun’s lawyers had subsequently focused on the Malta Security Services Act, which requires phone taps to be authorised by the minister responsible for MSS, or other Cabinet staff in emergencies. The law also provides that all such operations be covered by blanket secrecy.
  
 What did the court say about this?
 Lebrun’s lawyers had argued that Malta and, at the time, the UK, were the only countries in the EU to give politicians the power to authorise call interceptions, adding that the safeguards against abuse that were postulated under English law are completely absent in their Maltese equivalent.
 It was argued that the Security Services Act had given this power “to secret institutions, beyond the reach of judicial scrutiny and therefore, in violation of fundamental human rights.”
 In the judgement handed down today, the Court observed that an identical complaint had been made in the similar case filed by Charles Steven Muscat, which had been decided in June 2023, in which it was held that important safeguards against abuse were missing from the law, which does not envisage an independent body to oversee the use of wiretap warrants.
 In her decision, Madam Justice Hayman adopted a characteristically unambiguous position on the matter.
 “The court embraces these teachings and makes them its own. The co-dependency and the ties of every appointment by the executive [arm of government] smacks of incestuousness,” said the judge, going on to say, however, that there was no evidence to show that this power had been abused in Lebrun’s case.
 While declaring that Lebrun had suffered a breach of his fundamental right to a fair hearing, but not of his rights to private and family life, home and correspondence, or his right to an effective remedy before a national authority, the court said that this declaration, when taken together with the Court of Criminal Appeal’s directions, was a sufficient remedy in these proceedings.
 The court did not order the intercepted communications be expunged from the acts of the criminal proceedings, pointing out that this request had to be made to the competent court of criminal judicature.
 “In the opinion of the court, no further remedies, including monetary ones, are opportune in the circumstances,” concluded the judgement.
 Joseph Lebrun was assisted by lawyers Jose' Herrera, Franco Debono, David Camilleri and Alex Scerri Herrera.

Church commission refers three abuse cases involving minors to the police,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/church-commission-refers-three-abuse-cases-involving-minors-police.1094281,21-06-2024,001933.png,"Three abuse cases involving minors were referred to the police by Malta's church safeguarding commission last year.
 In its annual report, the commission said of the 26 cases it concluded in 2023, it had substantiated eight claims of abuse, four of which involved minors.
 Of the four substantiated cases involving minors, two of them were about complaints of sexual abuse by diocesan priests.
 One cleric was referred to the police, while the victim in the other case, who was an adult at the time of reporting, decided against reporting the case to the police, despite an offer of assistance by the safeguarding commission.
 Restriction from public ministry was recommended in both cases.
 The two other cases were against “laypersons” employed by the church. One of the cases involved sexual abuse, while the other involved sexual harassment. Both cases were reported to the police.
 Speaking during a press conference, Mark Pellicano, who heads the commission, did not elaborate on whether any of the three cases referred to the police have led to prosecutions.
 Pellicano said a referral to the police does not necessarily mean there is a criminal case to answer to.
 He said the commission's work is not only about investigating allegations of abuse, but also offering support to victims on a psychosocial level.
 In the other four cases involving vulnerable adults, two of the subjects of complaints were described as “religious,” meaning they were either nuns or priests, while the other two were laypersons.
 Restriction from public ministry was recommended in all four cases, but the commission said no further action could be taken, as in two of the cases the victims declined to report the case to the police, and in the other two, no crime was committed.
 Pellicano said some people are simply relieved to be heard out, and would not want to take the case further.
 In 2023, the Commission conducted background checks on over 5,500 people and provided 22 training sessions to more than 1,300 Church personnel. It also launched two awareness campaigns.
 The Safeguarding Office now comprises three teams: prevention and training, victim care and advocacy, and investigation and assessment. Pellicano oversees the office and serves as the main liaison between Church entities, statutory authorities, and the Safeguarding Commission.
 Since 2022, the Commission no longer works with the Diocese of Gozo, which has established its own Safeguarding Commission. Allegations of safeguarding concerns in Gozo are now referred to the Bishop of Gozo or his delegate.

 Vincenzo Ramaci, a 39-year-old Italian national, had been working in Malta some months ago, staying at an apartment belonging to his bosses, a Maltese man and woman. 
 But the relationship apparently turned sour and the worker ended up without a job and a home. 
 That was when the text and voice messages to his former employers started. The harassment stopped when the victims filed a police report.
 Meanwhile, the sender left Malta.
 He was arrested when he returned after a couple of months.
 Details about the alleged harassment were rather scarce when the suspect was arraigned on Wednesday afternoon.
 He was charged with harassing his former employers, causing them to fear violence and misuse of electronic communications equipment. 
 After consulting his lawyer, Yanika Bugeja, the defendant registered an admission. 
 Assisted by an interpreter, the man confirmed his plea after being granted time to reconsider. 
 Prosecuting inspector Roderick Attard said that the accused had admitted in his statement, cooperated with investigators and expressed remorse over his actions. 
 The accused’s lawyer agreed and further highlighted his early guilty plea.
 The threatening messages had stopped on July 4. Two months had passed and since then the accused has acknowledged his wrongdoing. 
 “He was angry,…he even ended up having to leave Malta,” explained the lawyer. “This is not to justify what he did but to clarify matters.” 
 When the man returned to Malta, he was immediately arrested and charged. 
 “He shouldered responsibility for his actions,” said Bugeja, suggesting a personal guarantee against a monetary value not to harass the victims, as punishment. 
 After hearing submissions Magistrate Lara Lanfranco declared the accused guilty and placed him under a personal obligation for €2,000 valid for one year, binding him not to harass the victims or their families.
 The court also fined the accused €100 and issued a restraining order for one year warning him not to approach the victims in any manner. 
 “How am I to take back my clothes and personal possessions still at the flat?” asked the defendant through his interpreter. 
 He was advised to contact his former employers through a lawyer to sort out that matter.

"One in three women ‘refuse’ risk assessment, despite having filed a report",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/one-three-women-refuse-risk-assessment-despite-filed-report.1097291,28-08-2024,001940.png,"During the first half of this year, a third of domestic or intimate partner violence victims in Malta declined to agree to a risk assessment despite having filed a police report.
 Statistics obtained by Times of Malta reveal that, out of the 1,138 domestic violence reports lodged between January and June, an alarming 368 victims or 32.3 per cent, “refused” a risk assessment.
 
 The risk assessment, conducted by professionals from Aġenzija Appoġġ, is deemed crucial in determining the level of risk the victim faces.
 In mid-August, just days after Nicolette Ghirxi was murdered by her former partner, the Foundation for Social Welfare Services (FSWS) said that most individuals who file a police report agree to a risk assessment but some refuse.
 Reasons for refusal include the belief that their lives are not at risk or having previously undergone an assessment and expecting the same risk ranking.
 The Sunday Times of Malta revealed evidence suggesting that professionals of FSWS/ Appoġġ “ talked out” Ghirxi from taking a risk assessment.
 In a voice note sent to her friend on April 22, shortly after filing a report on domestic violence with the police, Ghirxi indicated she had been discouraged from undergoing the assessment after it was suggested that the messages from her former boyfriend contained insults rather than threats.
 However, the FSWS said the risk assessors involved categorically denied attempting to dissuade Ghirxi from taking the assessment. 
 It said that the assessors have provided a written statement to FSWS management and are prepared to confirm this under oath through an affidavit.
 Statistics provided by FSWS indicate an increasing trend in the number of women undertaking risk assessments, mirroring a yearly rise in domestic violence reports.
 In the first six months of this year, 770 risk assessments were conducted, marking a 37 per cent increase compared to the same period last year, when 562 assessments were carried out.
 Throughout 2023, Aġenzija Appoġġ carried out 1,317 risk assessments for 1,104 people.
 Last week, Police Commissioner Angelo Gafà told a joint session of the social affairs and family affairs parliamentary committees that, by the end of July 2024, domestic violence reports had increased by 12 per cent compared to the same period last year.
 Victims of domestic violence in Malta are encouraged to file reports at two main locations: the Gender-Based and Domestic Violence unit at police headquarters, in Floriana or the Santa Luċija hub.
 The Standard Operational Procedures for Victims of Domestic Violence Services, first published in 2020, along with the Police Handbook for Victims of Domestic Abuse, published online this year, describe the procedures to be followed.
 Once a report is filed with the police, victims are offered a risk assessment, conducted in a private setting by assessors from Aġenzija Appoġġ to establish the level of associated risk.
 When a high level of risk is identified, the case is referred to MARAM, a Multi-Agency Risk Assessment Meeting.
 Bernice Cassar, allegedly murdered by her estranged husband in November 2022, was deemed low risk.
 The Valenzia inquiry, published in early 2023, highlighted the need to fix or update the risk assessment tools used to determine the level of danger domestic violence victims face.
 The Domestic Abuse, Stalking and Honour Risk Identification (DASH), introduced in 2018, was replaced by the Danger Assessment (DA) tool that started being used exclusively since mid-July.
 FSWS states that the risk assessment service is based on the value of client self-determination.
 However, women’s rights organisations and lawyers are calling for stricter policies to ensure that every harassment report is investigated properly.
 The Malta Women’s Lobby, in particular, has called for immediate action to ensure that professionals who interact with victims of intimate partner violence are thoroughly trained in risk assessment and safety planning.

 Nazzareno Dalli, also known as Ronald, who is accused of attempting to murder his ex-partner's two young daughters, has been released on bail. He denies charges of trying to kill the 12 and 15-year-old girls at a house in Triq San Tumas, Marsa, on 9 March. 

                     The youngest girl survived despite being stabbed 16 times and losing 40% of her blood. Her older sister managed to escape with minor injuries after slipping past the attacker and hiding on the roof. 

 Just two hours before the alleged attack, Dalli had posted photographs on Facebook, one captioned with the word “vendetta.” He had been in a three-year relationship with the girls’ mother and allegedly spent the night before the incident drinking and taking drugs with friends. Dalli told police he has no recollection of the violent act, later stating that he loved his ex-partner’s children “like his own.” 

 During the compilation of evidence, testimony was heard from several individuals including a Caritas representative, a prison official, Dalli's probation officer, the prison psychologist, and a psychology assistant from Corradino Correctional Facility. Dalli’s lawyers argued that civilian witnesses had testified, and that he had shown significant behavioural improvement, expressing willingness to accept help. 

 Magistrate Marse-Ann Farrugia granted bail with specific conditions, including an order for Dalli not to approach any prosecution witnesses. Dalli must sign the bail book twice weekly, observe a curfew from 10:00pm to 6:00am, and pay a €10,000 deposit along with a personal guarantee of €20,000. 

 Criminal proceedings against Dalli are ongoing, while the Attorney General is expected to appeal the decision, seeking the accused’s re-arrest.

 The man, now working in construction, testified on Wednesday in proceedings against Andre’ D’Amato, a 37-year-old ICT professional and former diplomat, who is pleading not guilty to human trafficking, fraud, falsification of documents and money laundering.
 D’Amato, was a MITA official at the time of the alleged offences in 2018. He was later made non-resident ambassador to Cuba but was stripped of his diplomatic duties when the criminal allegations surfaced last year.  
 When his case resumed on Wednesday, the Nepalese witness said that he travelled to Malta last December after a friend applied for a job on his behalf. 
 He transferred €4,000 through mobile banking to his friend who told him that the money was meant “for someone else.” 
 But when he went to a company, formerly based at San Gwann, which was meant to engage him, an official told him that some of the documents were not genuine. He never got the job at that company. 
 The prosecution is claiming that the money was handed to D’Amato to apply for a work permit, apparently on behalf of his clients, including the San Gwann company. 
 Prosecuting Inspector Karl Roberts said that at the time of the alleged offences, D’Amato acted as administrator at MITA (the state IT agency).
 The witness said that he had received the work-related documents from his friend who in turn claimed to have acquired the paperwork from a third party named “Navraj.” 
 Under cross examination, the witness said that all transactions were done with his friend.
 He never met D’Amato and could not identify him in court. 
 Asked by defence lawyer Alfred Abela whether he had gone to the company for a termination form, the witness replied, “I do not know exactly.” 
 But he confirmed that when he turned up at the San Gwann company, he already had a job approval from another company. 
 The court also heard submissions about the prosecution’s request for a full download of data on D’Amato’s electronic devices. 
 His lawyers objected, arguing that the prosecution was on “a fishing expedition.” The criminal complaint that triggered criminal charges against D’Amato was “very restricted,” being limited solely to some ten or so individuals who were unknown to the company. Data on the defendant’s devices could possibly concern third parties and other private communication that was totally unrelated to the criminal case, lawyers argued.
 “Why should such data end up in court?”argued defence lawyer Franco Debono, further voicing concerns about the controls applicable in respect of such data extraction. Under UK law, there were codes of practice on how and where such data was to be extracted, he said.
 Debono pointed out that a similar issue had cropped up in separate proceedings concerning former Labour MP Silvio Grixti. 
 In that case, the magistrate had taken particular measures, ordering that the data extraction process was to be recorded from start to finish.
 Inspector Roberts countered that nowadays this process was entrusted to private experts rather than investigators at the police cybercrime unit to waive any doubts about possible conflicts.
 Magistrate Leonard Caruana who is presiding over the D’Amato’s case, said that the court would decree on the matter in chambers. 
 The case continues in September.

 Meiby Jazmin Ramirez Gomez, from the Dominican Republic working as a chef assistant in Spain, had been charged in 2021 of trafficking some €600,000 worth of cocaine. 
  At the time she had been charged along with Jose Angel Hernandez Perez, 47, a Venezuelan man, and Leonardo Jose Marquez Uzcategui, 40, also Venezuelan.

 Inspector Wayne Bonello recalled before the Court that the man had escaped the Police Station after initially being arrested in relation to a completely separate case. The accused was once again arrested after being tracked down by the Police.

                     Whilst the arrest was not contested, the accused pleaded not guilty, with a request for bail also being made.

 Defence lawyer Franco Debono noted that whilst the man had been charged after breaching various bail conditions, the case retained no civilian witnesses.

 The prosecution however rebutted, noting that there was indeed one civilian witness, and that the accused could not be trusted.

 Bail was ultimately denied.

Investigators describe detailed records of disability benefits racket payouts,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/131121/grixti_kept_record_of_amounts_he_received_from_disability_benefits_racket_,09-09-2024,001978.png,"The two police inspectors who led the investigation into a €6 million racket of disability benefit fraud have testified about the records which were discovered on a laptop and in handwritten ledgers.
 They detailed amongst other things, the amounts creamed off the top of the disability benefit payments that had been made to healthy recipients.
  In March, Doctor Silvio Grixti - a former Labour MP, and four others: Roger Agius, Emmanuel Spagnol, Dustin Caruana and Luke Saliba, had been charged with setting up and forming part of a criminal organisation, defrauding the Department of Social Security of an amount in excess of €5,000 and forging official documents.
 The men are also accused of forging public documents and knowingly making use of them, making a false declaration to the public authorities and possession of items intended to be used for fraudulent purposes, as well as a separate charge of money laundering.
 Grixti is accused of having provided applicants with medical certificates for disabilities which they did not suffer from in reality, allowing them to qualify for the allowance, after appearing before a medical board.
 The police accuse Agius, Spagnol, Caruana and Saliba of having acted as intermediaries, who collected payments from the fraudulent beneficiaries.
 Testifying about the investigation today, Inspectors Wayne Rodney Borg and Andy Rotin told magistrate Rachel Montebello that after the racket was detected, some of the people identified as having fraudulently received payments for medical benefits had told the police that they had gone to Grixti to apply for them.
 The application required the signature of a medical specialist, which Grixti was not, Borg told the court.
 A detailed list of the beneficiaries found on Grixti’s laptop, were grouped by their link to the different defendants, together with records of the amounts Grixti had received and the totals paid out by the Social Security Department to the fraudulent beneficiaries.
 Further names to those discovered on Grixti’s laptop, were found detailed in handwritten ledgers which the police recovered from Roger Spagnol’s home, said the inspectors.
 The ledgers also showed how Spagnol and Grixti had split the takings, the court was told.
 Three of the beneficiaries who had been investigated by Inspector Shaun Friggieri had identified Agius either as the person they had handed the money to or as the person who had assisted them in successfully claiming the severe disability allowance.
 Caruana’s name did not appear in the ledgers, Friggieri said, adding that there did not appear to have been a relationship between him and Spagnol.
 A number of the beneficiaries questioned had told investigators that they were expected to hand over the first year’s benefits, some €5,000, to the person who had obtained the false documents for them.
 But when the magistrate asked whether the individuals who had mentioned Grixti also told the police that they had paid the money to him, Inspector Rotin replied this had not emerged from his investigation.
 The inspector told the court that Agius had released an audio-visual statement to the police in July, while assisted by his lawyers. The court was told that Agius had received a total of €43,398 in disability benefit payments between June 2016 and November 2023.

Man accused of attempted murder of ex-partner’s daughters released on bail after conditions are eased,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/132613/man_accused_of_attempted_murder_of_expartners_daughters_released_on_bail_after_conditions_are_eased__,04-12-2024,001988.png,"A man accused of trying to kill his ex-partner’s daughters almost 10 months ago has been released from custody after the court agreed to reduce the bail conditions required for his release.

 The decision was made after a woman, who began a relationship with the accused three months ago, stepped forward as a third-party guarantor, offering a €10,000 deposit to secure his bail. 

 Nazzareno Dalli, 43, stands accused of attacking his ex-partner’s daughters, aged 12 and 15, in a brutal assault on 9 March 2024. The younger girl,  stabbed 16 times, lost 40% of her blood but miraculously survived. Her older sister escaped with minor injuries after evading the assailant and hiding on the roof until police arrived. 

 The girls identified the attacker as “Ronald,” their mother’s ex-partner, Dalli. During his interrogation, Dalli claimed to have no memory of the incident, stating that he had consumed alcohol and drugs the night before while out with friends. 

 In October, the Magistrates’ Court granted bail after hearing that Dalli had shown “significant improvement” while in custody. However, stringent conditions were imposed, including a €10,000 personal deposit, a curfew, twice-weekly signing of the bail book, and a €20,000 deposit from a third-party guarantor. 

 Although bail was approved, Dalli remained in preventive custody as he was unable to meet the guarantor requirement. His financial difficulties and lack of family support prevented him from finding someone able to deposit the required sum. 

 Last month, Dalli’s lawyers requested the court to revise the bail conditions, asking for the €20,000 guarantor deposit to be reduced. The Attorney General opposed the application, citing the severity of the charges and the accused’s past behaviour.  

 During a hearing on 3 December 2024, a woman testified that she had started a relationship with Dalli three months earlier and was willing to act as a guarantor. She explained that her father had given her €10,000, which she was prepared to deposit in court to secure Dalli’s release. 

 After considering the testimony, Judge Consuelo Scerri Herrera reduced the guarantor deposit to €10,000 while keeping all other bail conditions intact. 

 In her ruling, the judge noted that bail conditions must reflect the accused’s financial and social circumstances to ensure equal treatment under the law. The system, she said, was designed to provide all defendants, regardless of wealth, with the same opportunities and responsibilities. 

 The court reiterated that bail guarantees serve to remind defendants that breaching conditions could result in the forfeiture of both their freedom and their valuables. 

 Dalli had been in custody for nearly 10 months and lacked the means to meet the original bail requirements, despite being employed. While he had no issue with the €10,000 personal deposit, securing the additional €20,000 from a third party was beyond his reach.

 With the revised conditions, Dalli has been released on bail pending final judgment. 

 The prosecution is led by lawyers Etienne Savona and Manuel Grech.

Hospitals case: Prosecutors to drop charges against company that ‘didn’t exist’,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/hospitals-case-prosecutors-drop-charges-company-didn-t-exist.1092858,24-05-2024,001997.png,"The attorney general’s office is expected to withdraw money laundering charges against a company in connection with the Vitals hospitals concession which claimed it had not even been set up when it was alleged to have committed crimes.
 Sources close to the criminal proceedings instituted against DF Corporate Advisory Ltd said the court was informed that the charges will be dropped during the first sitting taking place on Wednesday. 
 The company was hit with a €20 million freezing order after it had criminal charges filed against it as part of a raft of prosecutions linked to the 30-year deal to privatise three State hospitals annulled by a civil court last year. 
 In the original court filings, prosecutors from the attorney general’s office and the police accused DF Corporate Advisory of having committed those crimes “between 2013 and 2023”.
 But, in a judicial protest filed in court, the financial services firm said it only started operating on January 1, 2024, having opened bank accounts on December 18, 2023, after having received the licence to act as a corporate service provider (CSP) on June 1 last year. 
  It said the company was incorporated on August 18, 2021.
 Through its lawyers, Ezekiel Psaila, Marion Camilleri and Franco Debono, the company said there was “absolutely no case to answer for”. It said the charges filed against it were “absurd” and “completely baseless” and were creating financial distress for the company. 
 The company complained that when the €20 million freezing order comes into effect, it will be “completely paralysed” and unable to operate. 
 The judicial protest was filed against the attorney general, the state advocate, the police commissioner, the justice and home affairs ministers and the court registrar. 
 Sources said lawyers from the attorney general’s office filed a note in the acts of the proceedings informing Magistrate Leonard Caruana, who will preside over the case, of its intention to file fresh charges which will exclude DF Corporate Advisory Ltd from the list of defendants. 
 
 The charges against the company are believed to have been filed erroneously. 
 Several senior officials and companies, including former prime minister Joseph Muscat, are facing charges in connection with the hospitals’ debacle.

Judge abstains in Romanian prince’s breach of rights case,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/judge-abstains-romanian-prince-breach-rights-case.1094707,07-01-2024,002010.png,"A judge has abstained from presiding over constitutional proceedings filed by the Romanian prince whose extradition saga continues before the Maltese courts.
 Paul Philippe al Romaniei, 75, is battling a request for extradition by Romanian authorities to serve an almost three-and-a-half-year jail term after being convicted in his homeland in absentia.
 A Magistrates’ Court rejected that request in May, but the decision was reversed by another magistrate who was re-assigned the case after the Attorney General successfully appealed the first judgment.
 Six days ago, Magistrate Donatella Frendo Dimech upheld the extradition request and remanded the wanted person in custody pending his return to Romania, subject to the right to appeal the decision or file a breach of rights case.
 Since that judgment, al Romaniei’s lawyers unsuccessfully filed two Habeas corpus applications, challenging the legality of his arrest beyond the 60-day statutory time limit within which extradition proceedings were to be wrapped up.
 The prince has been in custody since his arrest in April on the strength of the EAW while attending a conference in Malta. 
 His lawyers also instituted proceedings before the constitutional courts claiming that there was a real risk that the prince would suffer a breach of his fundamental rights if sent back to Romania.
 His conviction by the Romanian courts related to the alleged illegal restitution of real estate near Bucharest, with the authorities claiming that al Romaniei was not the lawful owner.
 The prince denied that claim.
 He had successfully fought a similar extradition request before the courts in Paris where he currently resides.
 On Monday, just over two months since al Romaniei’s arrest in Malta, a judge presiding over the First Hall, Civil Court in its constitutional jurisdiction was scheduled to start hearing his breach of rights case.
 However when the case was called, the applicant’s lawyers pointed out that the judge had pronounced himself over a request for an interim measure to obtain the prince’s release from custody.
 Lawyer Jason Azzopardi declared that they had full confidence in the judge’s impartiality and integrity and for this reason were not requesting the judge’s recusal.
 However, after being informed that al Romaniei’s lawyers would be seeking an interim measure once again, Mr Justice Mark Simiana declared that he would abstain.
 The judge then ordered the case to be sent to the court registry for re-assignment to another judge.

Nine charged over human trafficking ring that forced women into prostitution,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/nine-charged-human-trafficking-ring-forced-women-prostitution.1096705,14-08-2024,"002015.png,002016.png,002017.png,002018.png,002019.png,002020.png,002021.png,002022.png,002023.png","Eight men and a woman were jointly charged over their alleged involvement in a racket whereby Latin American women were trafficked to Malta for prostitution purposes. 
 A court heard on Tuesday how police investigations started in June, initially pivoting around suspicions concerning the running of a brothel. 
 But as investigators dug deeper, they discovered four Colombian women who had allegedly been trafficked. 
 Investigations continued to uncover the masterminds behind the suspected criminal organization.
  Inspector John Spiteri said that a magisterial inquiry began in June, with four of the alleged victims having testified so far.
 They were very scared at first, saying that they feared for the safety of their families in Columbia. 
 On Monday, another brothel came to light which produced other alleged victims who are still to testify. 
 Barely three hours before the arraignment, the inspector learnt that another foreign woman had landed in Malta on Tuesday. 
 One of the defendants was expected to collect her at the airport. The brothels are understood to be located in Msida and Gżira.
 ""We still don't know who she is,"" Spiteri said, adding that it could not be presently ruled out that the charges against the accused may be updated. 
  CCTV footage and the testimonies of the suspected victims enabled police to identify the masterminds behind the illicit activity which is believed to have generated significant sums of money. 
 With enough evidence in hand, police obtained search and arrest warrants which were executed on Monday morning against 11 suspects. 
 On Tuesday afternoon, nine of those suspects were charged in court.
 These are: Luke Farrugia, 36, a self-employed maintenance worker from Birkirkara,  Clint Lawrence D'Amato, a cab driver from Gudja,  Denzil Farrugia, 19, a food shop employee from Sliema,  Alexandra Suhov Pocora, a 32-year-old Romanian from St Paul's Bay,  Kane Vassallo, a 22-year old barber from Siġġiewi,   Gordon Cassar, a 44-year-old maintenance worker from Kalkara,  Luca Emanuele Corito, 21 from Senglea,  Dylan McKay, a 30-year old taxi driver from Fgura and  Nicolae Efimov, 37 from St Paul's Bay.
   
 They were all charged with money laundering, setting up a criminal organization, enticing persons over the age of 21, through violent or fraudulent means, to travel to Malta for prostitution purposes, holding the alleged victims against their will at a brothel, and living off the earnings of prostitution.
 Luke Farrugia, D'Amato, Denzil Farrugia, Suhov, Vassallo and McKay, were separately charged with human trafficking.
 The other three defendants were charged with assisting in the trafficking. 
 McKay was also separately charged with committing the alleged wrongdoing under a suspended sentence as well as relapsing. 
 Corito and Luke Farrugia were charged with breaching bail. 
 Luke Farrugia and D'Amato were also charged with unlawful possession of weapons. 
 D'Amato was further charged with possession of cocaine under circumstances denoting that it was not for personal use, unlawful possession of ketamine as well as failure to submit tax and VAT returns.
 The defendants' lawyers made lengthy submissions on bail, addressing different roles allegedly played by the co-accused. 
 Attorney General lawyer Ramon Bonett Sladden highlighted the fact that this was an intricately woven operation designed to lure these women into prostitution. 
 The victims are vulnerable people and the risk of tampering with evidence was real, he said, adding that it is possible that more victims could come forward. 
 Inspector Spiteri added that the illicit activity had stopped for a fortnight while the victims were taken to a safe place. 
 The suspects were under the impression that the women had left Malta. 
 ""That's why there was no tampering in these months,"" Spiteri said. 
 Defence lawyer Franco Debono argued that because the inspector had declared ""that there was no tampering"" while investigations were ongoing, bail should be allowed. 
 But when all was considered, Magistrate Claire Stafrace Zammit turned down the request for all defendants. 
 The alleged crimes are of a very serious nature and the fear of tampering with evidence is very real particularly as proceedings are still at a very early stage, she said. 
 Bail was denied for all of the accused and they were remanded into custody. 
 AG lawyers Ramon Bonett Sladden and Charmaine Abdilla prosecuted together with inspectors John Spiteri, Joseph Xerri and Dorianne Tabone.
 Lawyers Franco Debono, Marion Camilleri, Charles Mercieca, Roberto Montalto, Kathleen Calleja Grima, Mario Mifsud, Michaela Giglio and Etienne Borg Ferranti assisted various defendants.

Criminal charges filed in connection to hospitals inquiry,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/129033/breaking_criminal_charges_filed_in_connection_to_hospitals_inquiry_,06-05-2024,002030.png,"Updated at 4pm with more details 
 The police have issued criminal charges against 19 individuals in connection to the Vitals Global Healthcare inquiry this afternoon.
 MaltaToday understands that former Prime Minister Joseph Muscat, his chief of staff Keith Schembri and former minister Konrad Mizzi are amongst those facing criminal charges. Several top civil servants are also believed to be among those charged.  
 A number of sources have told this newspaper that the charges include corruption and fraud to the tune of up to €30 million.
 In separate comments to this newspaper, former President of NGO Repubblika, notary Robert Aquilina, also confirmed that criminal charges have been filed against the persons indicated by the inquiring magistrate.
  Aquilina said that the NGO was informed by email from the Attorney General’s office on Monday.
 In a Facebook post on Monday afternoon, Joseph Muscat said he is ready for the fight against those who want to ""seek revenge against the Maltese.""
  It is understood that at least 19 defendants are to be arraigned by summons and not under arrest. This contrasts with similar cases of money laundering and corruption, such as those involving Keith Schembri and Adrian Hillman in the Progress Press case, when the accused where arraigned under arrest. 
 Lawyer Jason Azzopardi, who is representing the NGO in the case, announced on Facebook that charges have been filed against Muscat, Mizzi and Schembri.
 “This is a new chapter for our country,” he said.
 Magistrate Gabriella Vella, who was investigating the sale of three public hospitals to Vitals Global Healthcare, concluded her report and passed it on to the Attorney General last week.
 The inquiry was initiated in 2019 on Repubblika’s initiative.
 Joseph Muscat had tried to remove the magistrate from the inquiry, insisting she had a conflict because her relatives were publicly critical of him. He also complained of constant leaks from the inquiry and decried the magistrate’s refusal to let him testify before her.
 In January 2022, as part of the inquiry, police officers searched Muscat’s Burmarrad home and ceased several electronic devices.
 Muscat told reporters on Tuesday that he had no doubt he will be charged as he adopted a defiant tone. He insisted he did nothing wrong and would fight the charges tooth and nail.
 NGO Repubblika said on Monday they filed a written request to the AG to pass on the full magisterial inquiry. In a statement later on Monday, they said they were informed by the AG’s office it will not be handed over due to ongoing criminal proceedings.
 Revisiting the hospitals deal
 Under the 2015 deal, brokered by then minister Konrad Mizzi, Vitals Global Healthcare (later substituted by Steward Healthcare), were entrusted with the running of St Luke’s, Karin Grech and Gozo General hospitals.
 That deal was subsequently annulled by a court on the basis of fraud last year, and was later confirmed on appeal. The Court of Appeal judgement went one further and suggested that there had been collusion, as well as fraud.
 But in the criminal law sphere, everything hinged on the magisterial inquiry conducted by magistrate Gabriella Vella. Four years after it started, the meticulous evidence collection process was finally concluded, with the recommendation that charges be pressed against a number of individuals and companies, Muscat, Mizzi and Schembri amongst them.

  Political reactions 
 A few days before the inquiry was submitted, Prime Minister Robert Abela warned the judiciary not to engage in “political terrorism” in a veiled reference to growing expectations that his predecessor could face criminal charges.
 Without mentioning Joseph Muscat, Abela referred to the political earthquake of 2019 and accused “the Nationalist establishment” of trying to impede the government’s progress.
 He doubled down on his comments after the submission of the inquiry was made public, pitting what he said was the “establishment” against Labourites. 
 The Nationalist leader Bernard Grech on the other hand slammed the PM’s comments, saying it was a “terrorist attack” on the judiciary.
 “We are holding you responsible... for every abuse to stop the progress of justice and for the terrorist attack you are launching on our courts,” Grech said.
 Last week, MaltaToday reported that Fearne had told the PL parliamentary group that he is ready to resign if his name is mentioned in the hospitals inquiry.
 The Deputy Prime Minister was health parliamentary secretary under Konrad Mizzi when the hospitals deal was concluded with Vitals Global Healthcare in 2015 and later health minister when the concession was transferred to Steward Health Care in 2018.
 Following MaltaToday’s report, Fearne took to Facebook to say that he was certain of his innocence as he wrote, “There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that the Court will find nothing but my complete innocence. I make it clear that I speak confidently and openly. As a minister and citizen of a democratic and European country, I continue to believe firmly that justice should not look at anyone's face and should appear to be doing just that.”  ",Matthew Agius / Karl Azzopardi ,court_and_police
Villa Rosa loses its original development permit over site notice failings,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/villa-rosa-loses-original-development-permit-site-notice-failings.1102433,13-12-2024,,"A permit to turn the Villa Rosa site into a complex of offices, restaurants, villas and a language school has been overturned by a court due to the developer’s failure to follow site notice procedures.
 Under the revoked plans, developer Anthony Camilleri, known as Tal-Franċiż, had the green light to build restaurants, residents offices and a language school in front of St George's Bay in St Julian's. The developers also had permission to demolish two historic buildings in the area. 
 Camilleri obtained that permit in 2018 but works to develop the site never started, as he subsequently changed tack and presented a revised proposal to develop three large hotel towers on the site.
 In the meantime, objectors took the developer to court, saying site notices were not affixed on one side of the project site and did not include the names of all the access roads next to the project.  
 This week, Chief Justice Mark Chetcuti ruled that was good reason to scrap the approved permit. 
 The Planning Authority was wrong in not fully revoking the application to renew plans after learning that the developer failed to follow procedures, the court said.  
  Therefore, Chetcuti ruled that the Planning Authority’s approval of the Villa Rosa project was no longer valid. 
 Camilleri's proposal to build a 34-storey tower and two 27-storey ones on the site has yet to be decided by the Planning Authority. 
 However, the developer has since said he is scrapping that proposal and will reissue a new one once a  revision of the area's local plan is complete. 
 The court's decision means the Villa Rosa site is currently not covered by any development permit.
 Objectors to Camilleri's vision for the site say that has big ramifications. 
 Activist Andre Callus said that the argument put forward by the government and the developer “that the site is already committed to development, and we are only trying to improve it” no longer holds water.
 He also noted that the developer had already demolished two historic British-era buildings in the area as part of the now-revoked permit.
 “What are they going to do now? Rebuild them again?” he said.
 Contacted for comment, a spokesperson for Camilleri’s company, AC Investments, said the company “notes with concern that a simple and genuine mistake in an address led to the total cancellation of the renewal of the permit.”
 They said the Planning Authority republished the application and allowed any person to participate in the process.
 “The company is evaluating its position at law and will take any actions it considers appropriate in the circumstances,” they said.

 A domestic violence case came to an abrupt end after the victim, under oath, confirmed her decision to withdraw the proceedings against her partner, stating that she had regretted filing the initial report. 

                     Inspector Jason Cachia Butler recalled that on 24 November 2024, a woman had filed a report to the Domestic Violence Unit. On that day, which also happened to be the woman’s birthday, she and her partner had a verbal disagreement which arose after he refused to attend a family dinner due to a prior incident. The woman had gone to the police station to file a police report.  

 Inspector Cachia Butler recalled how the woman filed the report and had presented a medical report dated two months prior, indicating an incident which left the woman with light wounds.

 The man pleaded not guilty, with his defence counsel not contesting the validity of his arrest. 

 Before procedures could continue, the victim approached the prosecuting inspector, and asked if the procedures can be terminated. The victim was thus ordered by the Court to take the stand.

 Sultana had been accused of driving while under the influence of alcohol or drugs, dangerous driving, insulting and attempting to intimidate LESA officials, giving them false particulars and refusing to submit to a breathalyser test.
 The incident in question had occurred at around 2am on 20 July 2022, when Sultana’s Renault SUV was stopped in Santa Venera by two LESA Community Officers who believed that the driver was not in full control of his vehicle.
 They told the police that Sultana had begun insulting after being told that he would be breathalysed, disobeying their instructions to stay where he was and driving off instead.
  Sultana later went to the Ħamrun police station and released a statement, denying the allegations.
 From affidavits and testimony of the people involved, Magistrate Victor Axiak established that the two Community Officers in question had been ordered to man a fixed-point station, diverting traffic heading away from Triq il-Kbira San Ġuzepp in Santa Venera because fireworks were being set up for the feast, further up the road.
 One of the Community Officers in question, Brian Dimech, told the court that he had been resting in his car for a few minutes and had put his feet up, when Sultana had walked up to the car and knocked on the window, “shouting and swearing,” because he had paid for two officers and expected to find them both at their duty station.
 The court noted that this was not the first time that he had found one of the Community Officers resting in their car - he had, in fact, found that very situation the day before.
 Sultana had then walked up to the other Community Officer, who had been standing a distance away and allegedly swore at him too, before Sultana climbed into his own vehicle and drove away.
 At that point, the officer had phoned two other LESA colleagues in the area and instructed them to stop the vehicle, which was approaching their position, because its driver “had a strong smell of alcohol” and alleging that the driver had not been fully aware of his surroundings.
 Sultana had also testified, telling the court that the local council had an agreement with LESA to station two Community Officers at a number of fixed points in the locality during the week leading up to the village feast. When he had found a LESA car and motorcycle unattended. Sultana told the court that he had called up their superior, Marius Bugeja and had politely informed him that, as LESA was not providing the service in the manner agreed, he would not be paying them. 
 Bugeja had been upset, said the mayor. “He told me that he didn’t know who had elected me mayor and that I don’t know anything about traffic management, before hanging up.”
 Later that night, at 1:30am on Saturday, while walking to his car in Triq il-Kbira San Guzepp, Sultana had once again noticed that only one Community Officer was manning his post. The other officer was asleep in his vehicle with his feet up on the dashboard, wearing a pair of sunglasses, the court was told.
 When he had asked the Community Officer why he was not standing beside his colleague, the other colleague replied that he had been there until a short while before.
 The officer in the car ignored Sultana and got back into the car, after which Sultana had walked up the road to speak to members of the local fireworks club - of which Sultana was president - and brought them something to drink.
 As he drove home, Sultana spotted a second LESA car with two Community Officers asleep inside it and stopped his car beside it to ask them who had given them orders to stay inside the car.
 They replied that the order had come from their superior. “Don’t worry,” Sultana told the officers, “when I get the bill, we will discuss the matter further.” He then went home.
 From the witness stand the mayor had explained that, as the local council was publicly funded, it was his responsibility to stand up to these things. He denied swearing at the officers or driving dangerously in their vicinity.
 Under cross-examination he also denied both having consumed any alcohol and that the officers had asked him to submit to a breathalyser test.
 Sultana told the magistrate that the officers had made up the drunk driving claim in an attempt to frame him as revenge for pointing out their dereliction of duty.
 Two members of the fireworks club and a supervisor from the cleansing department also testified that, far from being drunk, Sultana had been asking about what progress was being made in the setting up of the ground fireworks.
 In a judgement handed down on Tuesday, Magistrate Axiak observed that even if Sultana had shouted and sworn at the LESA officials in those circumstances, his actions did not amount to vilification of a public officer.
 The court said it also had, at minimum, reasonable doubt as to the credibility of the Community Officers’ testimony with regards to the dangerous driving charges, in the context of the disagreement which emerged between their employer and the mayor about serious shortcomings in the service being provided.
 No evidence had been presented to substantiate the drunk driving charge and neither the charge of refusing to give his particulars, nor did that of breaching the public peace, said the court. Ruling that the prosecution had also failed to prove that Sultana had been drunk and incapable of taking care of himself in public, the court acquitted him of all charges.

Company loses €1.2 million for failure to purchase Sliema seafront property,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/company-loses-12-million-failure-purchase-sliema-seafront-property.1093019,25-05-2024,002099.png,"A company that agreed to buy a prime Sliema property only to renege on that deal has been told it must forfeit a €1 million deposit and cough up an added €200,000 in damages for dropping the sale.
 All Round Entertainment Ind Ltd had signed a promise of sale agreement to purchase three tenements on Tower Road, corner with Guze Fava Alley, in March 2018.
 That deal required it to pay SMS Group Limited €4.45 million for the properties. All Round paid a €1.04 million deposit, with the contract stating that the deposit would be liquidated in the seller’s favour “should purchaser fail to appear on the final deed of sale without a valid reason at law.”
 The promise of sale was renewed several times up to the end of April 2021. SMS Group also filed four separate judicial letters between September 2020 and that date, calling on All Round to conclude the purchase. All Round said it did not have the capital to go ahead with the sale.
 All Round Entertainment is owned by a company called Lifetime Limited. Its sole shareholder is Luke Chetcuti, the son of murdered Paceville magnate Hugo Chetcuti.
 With SMS Group and All Round unable to reach an agreement on the sale, the seller filed civil proceedings in court.
 SMS argued that it was entitled to keep the €1 million deposit and was also due damages.
 All Round Entertainment argued that the promise of sale had expired and that SMS was now intent on pocketing the €1 million deposit for no valid reason.
 When delivering judgment, Madam Justice Audrey Demicoli observed that the dispute pivoted on three main issues.
 The first was whether the promise of sale was still valid and whether the seller had a right to claim damages without seeking to force the sale.
 The court concluded that SMS Group had filed the necessary judicial letters within the legal time limit, but had not sought to force the sale in its civil action.
 In terms of article 1357 of the Civil Code, the promise of sale had thus expired.
 Did the seller thus have a right to keep the deposit and sue for damages?
 Case law on this point differed, with one line stating that unless the deposit was described as “earnest” (kapparra) the sum was not forfeitable, and another line saying that a deposit termed as forfeitable if the purchaser does not sign the contract for no valid reason, is “earnest” no matter how it is termed.
 In this case, the wording of the promise of sale was “clear and unequivocal” and the court concluded that the €1 million was “earnest, whatever it was called.”
 The next issue was whether the purchaser had a valid reason not to sign the final deed.
 Correspondence between Luke Chetcuti, All Round Entertainment director, and Simon Mifsud on behalf of the seller, showed that the buyer was not prepared to go ahead with the sale.
 When testifying, Chetcuti described certain correspondence as “bluff,” simply an attempt to negotiate a more favourable price for the Sliema property.
 But the court said that taken in context, Chetcuti’s explanation was not credible.
 If the buyer really wanted to sign the contract, there was no need to renew the promise of sale three times, nor to be called upon four times to honour its obligations.
 All Round Entertainment argued that the seller had allowed the promise of sale to expire and did not try to force the sale.
 But the court observed that the buyer’s behaviour was indicative of someone who, after signing the promise of sale, had lost all interest in proceeding with the acquisition and went back on its promise.
 The defendant put forward no evidence to prove that it was effectively in a position to buy the property.
 The court concluded that the buyer had no valid reason not to sign the final deed and that the €1 million deposit was to be forfeited by way of pre-liquidated damages in terms of the specific clause which survived the expiry of the promise of sale.
 The court also ordered the defendant to pay a further €199,694 in damages representing loss of rents and a sum paid by SMS Group to third parties to vacate the premises as it had agreed to on the promise of sale.
 The judgment is subject to appeal.

Man remanded in custody after wife reports him for assault,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/132398/man_remanded_in_custody_after_wife_reports_him_for_assault,21-11-2024,002106.png,"A man has been remanded in custody after he was reported by his wife for allegedly committing acts of violence against her.

 The accused is a 29-year-old man from India living in Rabat.

 He was arraigned on Thursday before Magistrate Astrid May Grima and was accused of using force against his wife and insulting her.

                     A police inspector said that the alleged victim had reported to the domestic violence unit in order to lodge a report against the accused, to whom she has been married for the last four years and with whom she has a seven-month-old child.

 The alleged victim informed the police that an argument had broken out between herself and the accused wherein he shouted at her, grabbed her hair and hit her on the head. She also alleged that he hit her on the face, grabbed her by the neck and hit her in the stomach. She stated that she also hit him back.

 No medical certificates to this end were brought forward, noted Inspector Sherona Buhagiar.

 Whilst the defence did not contest the validity of the arrest, a request for bail was made. The prosecution, in objecting to this request, argued that since the alleged victim must still testify, there existed a risk of contact by the accused who could furthermore tamper with evidence.

 It was also noted by the prosecution that a risk assessment confirmed that the victim was in ‘extreme danger’.

 Legal aid lawyer Martin Farrugia argued that any fear of tampering with evidence could be expunged by the issuing of relevant measures, including a protection order.

 He also noted that the accused, a person in full-time employment, ultimately faced charges consisting of contraventions which did not merit the detention under arrest of the accused, especially when sufficient guarantees could be made.

 It was further confirmed that the accused and alleged victim do not live together.

 The Court denied the request for bail, citing that the alleged victim must still testify.

 Whilst police inspector Sherona Buhagiar prosecuted, legal aid lawyer Martin Farrugia represented the accused.

 The case is to be assigned to the relevant court according to law.     ",Thomas Cilia ,court_and_police

Driver who killed my father ‘got off with slap on the wrist’ – biker’s son,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/driver-killed-father-got-off-slap-wrist-biker-son.1098132,16-09-2024,"002155.png,002156.png","The son of a motorcyclist who was killed in a collision four years ago has spoken of his family’s heartbreak and disappointment after the woman responsible for his father’s death escaped jail time in an appeal judgment on Friday.
 Mark Camilleri was killed on Mistra Bridge in 2020 when his motorbike collided with a car driven by Lithuanian woman Ligita Imbrasiene.
 Last November, a court acquitted Imbrasiene of the 46-year-old contractor’s death, concluding that Camilleri had been driving recklessly when he died. The court found he was travelling at 195km/h while standing up with his right hand in the air, preventing him from using both brakes.
 But that version of events was met with disbelief by those in the motorcycle community, who argued it would have been impossible for him to have been standing at those speeds, let alone operate the throttle with his right hand in the air.
 On Friday, the appeal court overturned the original decision. It found Imbrasiene guilty of involuntary homicide and sentenced her to a one-year jail term suspended for six months.
 Reacting to the sentence, Camilleri’s family said they were “very disappointed” and paid tribute to the person they described as a “massive family man”.
 Speaking for the family, Camilleri’s 29-year-old son Nathan said they were “very happy his name has been cleared”, adding that the original verdict blaming his late father was “disgusting”.
 However, the family was unhappy with the sentence handed down to the driver.
  Camilleri, who grew up in Malta but now lives in Australia with his fiancée, three-year-old daughter and two young sons, said: “We don’t think it was a fair call. Six months probation? In Australia, there would have been jail time. She got off with a slap on the wrist.”
 Slamming the way the case had been handled, Camilleri said there was “so much evidence that wasn’t brought forward”, pointing to unused video footage he said showed his father was not responsible for the accident.
 Camilleri, who is a keen motorcyclist himself, said that when he told his 600-strong motorcycle community in Australia about the case they been “gobsmacked” at the version of events heard in November, just like their fellow riders in Malta.
 He stressed his father “used to drive on that road every day” and there was “no way” he could have accelerated up to almost 200km/h on that stretch of road.
 “With respect to those involved, those calculations were wrong on all counts,” said Camilleri, calling the accusations of excessive speeding “out of character” for his father.
 “My father always taught me that speed is a killer; his intention when he went out on the motorbike was always just to return home safely,” he said, adding he didn’t believe “for one second he was doing those speeds”.
 ‘So many good qualities’
  Camilleri said it was difficult to describe his father because “he was a person with so many good qualities”.
 Calling him “easy going” and without judgement, he said, “you could chat with him about anything”, stressing he learned a lot from his late father.
 “He taught us so much, he used to be very handy; he could do tiling, electrical work – he was a real ‘all-round’ person, a ‘turnkey’ bloke,” he said, adding “if he didn’t know how to do something, he’d learn how to”.
 Describing his father as “getting along with everyone,” Camilleri said his friends enjoyed spending time with him too and “wondered why they couldn’t have fathers like him”.
 He recounted how he and his father used to go partying together in Paceville. “I don’t know anyone else that can party with their father.”
 ‘My sister still tears up’ 
 Camilleri said the fatal accident occurred one month after his father visited him and his 26-year-old sister Nicole in Australia.
 “Me and my sister were together the night we got the call, and we didn’t know what to do,” he said, describing his sister as still not being able to discuss her father and “tearing up” at the mention of his name.
 Describing him as still in his prime when he was “ripped away” from the family, Camilleri said his father’s death had affected them all and he was only recently coming to terms with it.
 His father’s death had been particularly difficult for his youngest sister who was 10 years old at the time, he said.
 And while his late father got the chance to meet his two grandsons, his death occurred before the birth of his granddaughter.
 “My boys keep asking when they can see him again, and my daughter sees photos of him and asks, ‘who’s that?’ It’s heartbreaking.”
 Describing “mental health issues” following his father’s death, Camilleri said the way the case had been handled had changed how he thinks about his homeland.
 Expressing his “stress and frustration” at the country’s justice system, he said that while he “loved” Malta and had always planned to move back with his family, the court case had made him reconsider.
 “My biggest fear is what if something happens to my kids in Malta,” he said.
 The family’s lawyer José Herrera said the family was planning to claim damages, which were usually worked out according to a person’s projected earnings until retirement, minus a “consumption” figure of around one-fifth.
 However, he said that in this case he did not think the 20 per cent should be taken out due to the case having dragged on so long.
 Herrera said that while the case had been won, the police had “carelessly” failed to submit camera footage of the accident as evidence in the case.
 “The police had the best evidence but didn’t use it,” he said. “I was amazed how that document was omitted but it was perfectly clear even on the evidence presented that the deceased was not at fault.”

Man denied bail over alleged threats and assault on Karl Stagno Navarra,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/130957/man_denied_bail_over_alleged_threats_and_assault_on_karl_stagno_navarra,30-08-2024,002164.png,"“What am I going to do with my daughter?” protested the father of a young girl, after he was denied bail on charges of insulting and threatening ONE TV host Karl Stagno Navarra over an unpaid debt.
 Maintenance worker Jean Pierre Schembri, 47, from Zebbug, was arraigned under arrest before Magistrate Giannella Camilleri Busuttil on Friday, on charges of harassment, intimidation, insult, criminal damage, assault resulting in slight injury, and offences relating to the misuse of telecommunications equipment.
  Police inspector Doriette Cuschieri told the court that Stagno Navarra had filed a report at the Qormi police station on Wednesday, claiming to have been receiving messages containing “insults and threats” from the defendant for several months. Stagno Navarra also claimed that the defendant was loitering in the vicinity of his home and his workplace. 
 After the police had called Schembri in for questioning, Stagno Navarra had once again called the police, this time claiming that the defendant had gone to his house carrying a crash helmet, with which he had smashed a vase, before allegedly attacking and slightly injuring the TV presenter.
 Schembri was later contacted by the police and told to go to the police station, where he was arrested.
 Inspector Cuschieri requested a publication ban on the name of the victim, but defence lawyer Lennox Vella objected, arguing that there was no legal basis for a publication ban and telling the court that Stagno Navarra “had 60 other cases just like this.”
 The court subsequently rejected the request for the publication ban.
 Schembri pleaded not guilty and requested bail, which was objected to by the prosecution, which argued that the victim had not yet testified and was therefore at risk of subornation. Schembri was also being accused of breaching the terms of a conditional discharge, added the inspector.
 Vella said that it was an objective fact that his client had no drug or alcohol problems, had a fixed address and worked with AWAS, the association for the welfare of asylum seekers.  He explained that the root of the problem was a car which Schembri had sold to Stagno Navarra, for which the TV host had never paid him for. Schembri had filed a judicial letter and obtained an executive title over the vehicle. “[Stagno Navarra] tells him to go collect the money from here and from there, always for nothing, and then threatens my client with having his daughter placed in State care.” 
 Vella told the court that he feared that his client was being set up to prevent him from pursuing Stagno Navarro for the outstanding debt.  The defence also submitted that there were insufficient grounds to merit remanding the man in custody, especially in view of his family and employment situation. “At the time that my client was supposedly smashing vases, he had been picking up his daughter from school and I have a signed school register to prove it,”  said the lawyer.
 The court rejected the bail request, however, noting that the defendant had previous convictions for similar offences. A protection order was also issued, prohibiting the man from following, visiting or contacting Stagno Navarra.
 “What am I going to do with my daughter?” he said to his lawyer when bail was denied. “I'm going to go mad!”
 In a last ditch attempt to help his client, the lawyer informed the court that Schembri was “contemplating withdrawing his plea and would be pleading guilty to avoid his daughter being taken into care.” The court dismissed that submission, curtly informing the lawyer that the decree denying bail had already been given.
 Vella told the court that he felt perplexed by the decision and informed the magistrate that just last week, Stagno Navarra had borrowed €50 from the man he claimed had been harassing him for months.  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police
'Nun walked me up the aisle' - Ruth recalls her story of hope,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/nun-walked-aisle-ruth-recalls-story-hope.1098447,23-09-2024,"002184.png,002185.png,002186.png","When Ruth got married, she was walked down the aisle by the woman who acted as a parent figure all her life: Sister Denise who raised her at the children’s home where Ruth lived since she was two years old held her hand in the bridal car before walking into church.
 “I was not brought up by parents. I was brought up by nuns. But I was brought up,” says Ruth, recalling the 16 years she spent living at Dar Sagra Familja.
 Ruth shared her story through a video interview during a press conference organised by Church NGO Fondazzjoni Sebħ, which runs residences and services that support children and families.
 Currently, the four children’s residential homes can take up to 41 children at any one time, with many other children needing a safe place to stay.
 The foundation, established in 1956, originally focused on children’s homes. In 2000 it expanded to include mothers who were victims of domestic violence and their children. It became an NGO in 2018 and now focuses on prevention, and community support for children and families and women escaping violence.
 During the press conference, the foundation also announced a rebrand. The new logo is made of three elements: the tulip – the first flower to bloom in spring, the heart that symbolises love and a parent and child. They come together to represent the hope that the foundation – and the people behind it – represent for the families it supports.
 Ruth lived this hope. “My parents faced problems. My mum was not fit to look after me so I was sent to the nuns at about two/three years old. I don’t really remember much. My dad died when I was nine.
 “My mum would call and tell me she would come for me and I would wait and wait. But it never happened. That was the worst thing – when you hope and wait and nothing happens,” she says.
  At school, she was bullied and left out by some children because of her living situation.
 “I could not say 'ma' or 'pa'. During parents' day I was kind of scared and worried about what they would say when a nun turned up instead of my mum,” she says.
  But she had immense words of gratitude towards Sister Denise, who she refers to as her aunt.
 ""I was 18 when I left and Sister Denise helped me find a place to stay – she was always there for me even when I became a mother. When I got married she gave me away,” she says. 
  Alexia Baldacchino, children’s services senior manager, said the homes can take a total of 41 children at any one time. Some children leave, either because they return to their family, or are placed in alternative care, like fostering.
 “The waiting lists for our services keep growing and we receive phone calls almost daily requesting placements for children that have to be taken out of their family because of their safety,” she said. 
 A number of children at the homes were now approaching their teenage years.
 The organisation was now working on a new service to help these children transition out of the homes.
 The children in the four children’s homes are hosted in home-like apartment settings – with each child having their own bedroom. Siblings are kept together when possible.
 These homes include Dar Fra Diegu, Dar San Nicola and Dar Sagra Familja (that each host 12 children) and Dar Santa Tereza, which hosts six children up to five years old.
 When it comes to the family services, Kerry Hermitage – service senior manager – outlined what happened at Il-Milja - that hosted 30 families over the past two years.
 Many were women - from the ages of 18 to 80 – who were escaping violence. They were allowed to bring their children, including adult children, as well as pets. The home supported about 500 individuals over the past five years.
 Another service, the Community Family Service is aimed at early intervention and 73 families benefited from the service in 2023, she says.
  Sebħ director Yvonne Mallia spoke about the cost of running these homes and services  -  €2.4 million to run last year. Children's services for 2023 cost €1.8 million – or €45,000 per child.
 This was projected to increase to €64,000 per child with the cost to increase as staff complement increased to make up for the loss of religious staff and the complex needs of the children. 
 The government covered €1.3 million last year with the rest covered by the Curia.
 The cost to run family services at Milja is €415,000, which amounts to about €34,600 per family. This is projected to increase to €46,000 per family. Of this, the government covered €336,000.
 Community family services and after-care services were funded internally through fundraising with the former costing €90,200 and the latter €15,000 in 2023.
 When it came to fundraising, the foundation collected €218,000 in fundraising and donations,  a further €262,000-worth was covered by donations in kind (such as food and detergents) and €45,000 were covered through savings made through corporate CSR events -  such as painting and maintenance jobs.

Murder victims found at sea: a look at crime in the 19th and 20th century,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/murder-victims-found-sea-look-crime-19th-20th-century.1102378,13-12-2024,,"The first recorded murder in Malta in the 19th century with the victim being found at sea was that of Wenzu Bonanno, whose corpse was spotted floating in the sea in Marsa on November 30, 1888. 
 The magistrate’s inquest established that there were no signs of violence on the corpse and it was assumed that the old man had accidentally tumbled into the sea off the wharf’s edge.
 Death, it was concluded, was due to drowning and the magistrate declared the case accidental. 
 Six years later, Wenzu Galea, who was serving a prison sentence for theft, made a statement to prison superintendent Crispo Barbaro and the police that Bonanno had been murdered by Rużar Mizzi, known as Il-Lajs. 
 Mizzi was accused of murder and, during a trial, the jury returned a unanimous verdict of guilty and Mizzi was condemned to death. 
 When the sentence was being passed, Mizzi shouted from the dock that he was innocent of the crime.
 Pointing to the crucifix in the criminal court, he said: “He is the witness of my innocence and your sentence.”
 On March 10, 1900, the dead body of a newly-born baby girl was found in Balluta Bay, St Julian’s.
 A post-mortem examination carried out by three doctors established that the baby had been born alive and died of asphyxia due to drowning. 
 Police investigations revealed that an unmarried woman was pregnant but, when questioned by the police, said that her baby was not yet due. However, after an examination, a doctor certified that the woman had just given birth to a child. 
 Further inquiries revealed that the woman was in love with Francesco Barone, a 33-year-old Sicilian. Their love affair had started in August 1899, when the woman was already pregnant and Barone was aware of her pregnancy.
 The woman turned king’s evidence and the police arrested Barone and charged him with wilful homicide and his trial opened on April 1, 1901.
  In her testimony, the woman stated that when the child was due, her mother wanted to call the midwife but Barone opposed this idea as he was aware that the midwife was duty-bound to inform the police after assisting with the birth of a child.
 The witness added that Barone had helped her during the delivery of the baby but, as soon as the baby was born, he had every intention to kill the baby. She said that when Barone wrapped the child in a blanket and tried to strangle her, she pleaded with him to baptise the child.
 She also said that Barone had killed the child and placed the baby in a small zinc bath, which he filled with water. When her mother called at her the following day, they planned to bury her in a cemetery but, once more, Barone opposed this idea. So they went to Balluta Bay, where they disposed of the baby. 
 The verdict was six votes to three and Barone was found guilty as charged and received a life prison sentence. He was released by pardon on April 1, 1911.
 Early in the morning of Tuesday, March 26, 1918, some boatmen plying their trade in the French Creek within Grand Harbour, while off the hose shed of the Royal Dockyard, made the horrifying discovery of a human trunk floating on the water. 
 The head and limbs were found some distance away. Later, the mutilated remains were identified as those of a 17-year-old youth who had been reported missing the previous evening, having failed to return home as usual.
 Police inquiries disclosed that the youth, a dockyard employee, had been regularly in the company of a 57-year-old hose-maker at the dockyard. It was also a well-known fact that the latter was a homosexual. 
 After a search in the shed where he worked, the police found a wooden board which bore signs of a chopping board. The search continued and, after diving operations near the shed, the boots and clothes of the victim were found. 
  In his statement to the police, the suspect admitted that he was a homosexual and added that the victim was also a homosexual. He also alleged that, after inviting him for sexual relations, the victim threatened him that he was not keeping this relationship a secret. At that time, such acts were illegal.
 Before the trial in June 1919, the defence pleaded insanity, however, a board of medical experts declared him to be sane at the time of the murder.
 However, after the defence quoted several instances in which the accused had acted abnormally, the jury declared, with a vote of five to four, the accused was insane at the time of the murder and was confined to a mental hospital. 
 Early in the morning of  September 11, 1944, the police were informed that a corpse had been seen floating beneath St Leonard Fortress, limits of Xgħajra, in the locality known as Ġolf it-Tafal.
 When the body was recovered from the sea, it was identified as that of a 37-year-old woman who was married to a police constable.
 During the preliminary investigations, the police suspected no foul play and the case was at first classified as suicide. This hypothesis was strengthened when the constable said that his wife had been indebted to some people and he had repaid the debt. He also said that his wife had left him a couple of times but she returned after a few days missing.
 When the case was reported in the press, Carmelo Mercieca informed the police that, three weeks before, he had been approached by the victim’s husband who told him that he was looking for a hitman. Mercieca stated that he had met this man near the Marsa slaughterhouse and, during their first meeting, he left without a reply and told him that he was going to think about it.
  Mercieca added that, after a fortnight, the same man called at his house and asked him to meet him near the petrol station in Birżebbuġa the following morning.
 According to Mercieca’s statement, this meeting was held on Sunday, August 27, 1944, and the man told Mercieca that he wanted to get rid of a woman and that he was ready to pay £70 for the job.
 Later, there was another meeting and it was revealed that the constable wanted to get rid of his wife. Mercieca stated that he had met the woman on a particular day but his courage failed him and, after waiting for some time, he accompanied Carmela to her house where he had sexual intercourse with her.
 When the police continued with their inquiries, it transpired that, before the woman’s death, her husband had been seen in the company of his brother and another man.
 When questioned by the police about the woman’s death, the constable’s brother made a statement, admitting that, when Mercieca failed to do the job, his brother enlisted him to kill the woman.
  It was also revealed that the woman was told that her husband was coming on a boat with stolen objects. After waiting for some time in the dark in Ġolf it-Tafal, they could see a boat drawing near but this was pure coincidence as the victim’s husband was not on that boat. At that moment, the two men invited the woman to come up to them, saying that her husband was coming and, as she reached the edge of the cliff, she was pushed into the sea.
 The police charged two men with the murder and her husband was charged as an accomplice. Their trial began on October 3, 1945. The accused were found guilty and sentenced to death.
 However, after an appeal before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council on behalf of the victim’s husband, the Judicial Committee decided that there were sufficient grounds to order that the conviction should be overturned and that there should be no order for a new trial.
 After the judgment of the Privy Council, the victim’s husband was set free. Moreover, the governor reprieved the others and they were sentenced to life imprisonment.

Man who set former partner’s car on fire imprisoned for seven years,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/131289/man_who_set_former_partners_car_on_fire_imprisoned_for_seven_years__,19-09-2024,002222.png,"A man who set his ex-partner’s car on fire after threatening her has been sentenced to seven years in prison.
 27-year-old Omar Djelassi from Bormla had been charged over an arson attack in December 2020 in which a Fiat Punto parked on Triq il-Vitorja, Isla was destroyed and another car damaged, together with the façade of a nearby home.
 That Fiat Punto was registered to his ex-partner but was being used by her mother at the time.
  He was accused by the police of having intentionally set the car on fire, as well as with causing damage to the second vehicle and the house. He denied the charges, as well as others relating to having committed a crime while under a suspended sentence and breaching bail conditions imposed in separate proceedings.
 Djelassi denied the charges.
 The court was told how the damaged property’s occupant had to be rescued by the CPD from his roof, after a fireball and smoke swept through the house.
 It emerged in court that Djelassi had fathered a child with the daughter of the Fiat’s owner and that he had sent a string of Facebook messages from fake social media profiles to his ex-partner and her mother in the days leading up to the arson attack.
 The messages also spoke of a previous fire which had completely destroyed the mother’s car, after which she had bought another vehicle.
 One of the messages, reproduced in court, reads: “Tonight you’re going to get a bigger fright than your mother because you’re going to end up homeless… I feel better now that your mother’s car caught fire haha"".
 “And by the way, your mum’s new car is nice. If you think I’m bluffing go on and do so. But just as we burned the other one, we’ll burn this one,"" the messages went on.
 Investigators had discovered that the messages were sent from an IP address originating from Djelassi’s family home.
 In her judgement, finding Djelassi guilty of the charges, Magistrate Rachel Montebello said the messages were strong evidence of his involvement in the crimes, noting that the sender had repeatedly and unequivocally stated that he had started the fire, which he also threatened to repeat on the woman’s new car her house.
 The court said it was “abundantly satisfied” that Djelassi was involved in the arson attack, observing that this was corroborated by CCTV footage and geolocation data from Djelassi’s mobile phone, which showed him to be in the area of the fire on the night of the arson.
 Finding him guilty of the charges, the court sentenced Djelassi imprisonment for five years, to which a previously suspended two-year sentence was added, bringing the total sentence to seven years.
 Djelassi was also ordered to pay a total of €8,300 to the various victims, as well as €4,474 in court costs relating to the appointment of experts.
 A three-year restraining order and a treatment order for the same duration was also imposed.
 Inspectors Mario Xiberras, Jeffrey Scicluna Briffa and Darren Buhagiar prosecuted.

University association backs lecturer in 'white hat' hacking case,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/university-association-backs-lecturer-white-hat-hacking-case.1097610,09-04-2024,002225.png,"A university lecturer who is facing court charges along with three of his students in a 'white hat’ hacking case has been backed by the University of Malta Academic Staff Association (UMASA).
 Mark Joseph Vella and his students Michael Debono, Giorgio Grigolo and Luke Bjorn Scerri are due to be arraigned in March, accused of gaining unauthorised access to a computer’s data, software or supporting documentation and using, copying or modifying the data, software or document.
 
 The charges were filed after the students found and exposed security flaws in Malta's largest student application, FreeHour, two years ago. The students had e-mailed FreeHour to alert it of the security flaw and requested a reward - or ‘bug bounty’- a common practice in ethical or ‘white hat’ hacking. But they were arrested instead and had their computer equipment seized.
 The association said Vella has stated that he provided his students with the ethical framework that should be applied when discovering vulnerabilities through ethical or ‘white hat’ hacking, ""thereby fulfilling his duties and responsibilities as a lecturer, and acting within the bounds of established ethical practices.""
 The association said that international guidelines specifically stated that before any such flaw was made public, it must be fixed - as was done in this case.
 ""The students resorted to a common practice when they asked for a non-monetary award for discovering these vulnerabilities. We believe that Dr Vella acted with academic integrity and in accordance with procedure,""  UMASA said, as it expressed solidarity and support.
 The University Students' Council in a separate statement later expressed solidarity with the students, insisting that their actions were aimed to protect the data of thousands of students from potential exploitation.
 The council said it had been informed that the court proceedings were being pursued by the police on an ex officio basis and not at the request of FreeHour.
 The council reiterated a commitment to cover any legal expenses the students may face.
 “The situation demonstrates a clear gap in Malta’s current legislative framework surrounding ethical hacking and cybersecurity, one which necessitates urgent legislative reform,” KSU said. “Legislative changes are necessary to clearly define and protect ethical hacking activities, ensuring that individuals who responsibly disclose security vulnerabilities receive legal protection and support, rather than facing negative repercussions.”

Woman acquitted of fake BOV app scam after husband confesses to leaving her 'clueless',maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/129925/woman_acquitted_of_fake_bov_app_scam_after_husband_confesses_to_leaving_her_clueless,26-06-2024,002233.png,"A woman accused of scamming Bank of Valletta customers through a fake mobile app has been acquitted after evidence revealed her husband was the true perpetrator.
 Jemelyn Aliga Silos, 42, had been charged alongside her husband, 44-year-old Arvin Guerrero Silos, for fraud and money laundering in 2022. The couple was accused of defrauding five individuals out of €9,389.95 using a counterfeit mobile banking app.
  Investigations by the Cyber Crime Unit found that the scam involved a fake profile impersonating Bank of Valletta. Victims, believing they were contacting the bank, provided credit card details, copies of their debit and credit cards, and official identification documents. This information was then used for online purchases and fund transfers to third-party accounts, both locally and overseas. The scam included 10 fraudulent transactions between April 2021 and January 2022.
 Arvin Silos confessed to the charges and was convicted, while Jemelyn maintained her innocence. Her defence lawyer, Joe Giglio, argued that although some apps were registered in her name, she had been unaware of the fraudulent activities. Arvin, who was called to testify for the defence, supported her claim, telling the court that he alone was responsible for the scam and that he had used her identity without her knowledge to create necessary accounts.
 Arvin admitted to creating a fake BOV Facebook page, deceiving customers into providing security codes for transactions. He also confessed to using his wife’s passport and email to set up an Azimo account when his own was deactivated. He confirmed that Jemelyn was “clueless” about the Azimo account.
 The court found Jemelyn's testimony credible, noting her lack of proficiency with online services and absence of any relevant training or employment history in customer care or banking. Despite being the recipient of some fraudulent funds and having her credentials used for account registration, the evidence did not link her to the creation or operation of the fraudulent scheme.
 A forensic analyst testified that managing such a scam required technical knowledge and customer support skills, which Jemelyn did not possess. Her employment history showed only menial jobs, reinforcing the defence's argument that she had been unaware of the fraud.
 The court concluded that the prosecution failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that Jemelyn was involved in the scam. Her husband testified that upon learning of his actions, Jemelyn was devastated and confronted him, blaming him for the situation. He also revealed that one of the victims harassed and threatened her, leading her to file a police report.
 In the end, the magistrate ruled that Jemelyn's lack of awareness and the prosecution's failure to establish her involvement in the fraudulent scheme warranted her acquittal. The court acknowledged her genuine distress and marked disappointment over her husband's deceit and misuse of her identity.

"Trio plead not guilty to February Luqa hobby store heist, granted bail",maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/130550/triopleadnotguiltytoFebruaryLuqahobbystoreheistgrantedbail,02-08-2024,002235.png,"Three men have denied committing a burglary at a Luqa hobby store in February.
 Police inspectors Keith Rizzo and Antonello Magri, together with prosecutor Claire Sammut, arraigned the three 39-year-olds, from Santa Venera and Qormi before magistrate Lara Lanfranco on Friday. 
  Wayne Delia was charged with theft, aggravated by value, criminal damage and breaching previous bail conditions, while twin brothers Gordon and Stephen Cassar were accused of complicity in the thefts. All three were also charged with recidivism. 
 Delia is no stranger to the courts, having been arraigned over a violent robbery in 2011 and an arson attack on a yacht in 2022. Gordon and Stephen Cassar are also known to the police, having been charged with a string of handbag thefts targeting elderly women in 2019..
 Inspector Rizzo explained that at around 3:00am on February 27 this year, a police patrol in Luqa had noticed two suspicious persons who fled when the police approached. 
 Officers gave chase and observed one of the men drop the stolen cash register and mobile tablet. The policemen managed to taser and arrest that suspect, who was later identified as Delia, while the other man managed to escape. The Cassar siblings were identified later during the investigation and subsequently arrested on the strength of a court-issued warrant, and also re-arrested Delia, who had since been released on police bail.
 All three defendants pleaded not guilty. Lawyer Yanika Barbara Sant, assisting the Cassar twins and Delia’s lawyer, Daniel Attard, asked the court to grant bail to their respective clients.
 The prosecution objected to the Cassars brothers being released from arrest, arguing that doing so would jeopardise the preservation of evidence and pointing to their brothers’ criminal records as evidence that they were untrustworthy.
 An objection was also registered with regards to Delia, who besides having a colourful criminal record was also being accused of breaching bail conditions imposed by this court. This showed that he was inclined not to follow them, the prosecution argued.
 Barbara Sant countered, telling the court that her clients, the Cassars, had always observed and honoured their bail conditions and had never been charged with breaching bail. 
 The court should not be overly impressed by the men’s criminal records, added the lawyer, stressing that Criminal Court jurisprudence had established that bail should not be denied solely on the basis that the applicant had a criminal record. The legislator did not discriminate between clean and soiled criminal records for the purposes of granting bail, but had left that to the discretion of the courts, said the lawyer.
 There was little evidence that could be preserved at this point because the alleged crime had taken place six months ago, in February, she pointed out, which meant that the prosecution had “all the time in the world” to preserve the evidence, and her clients the same time to destroy it.
 Both brothers had put their drug abuse days behind them and were now on the right path, with that progress potentially being undone if they were to be denied bail.
 The defendants had been in a totally different situation at the time, argued Barbara Sant, adding that they were now gainfully employed and one of them had rented a property with his partner, who is unemployed and would be unable to afford the rent if he were to be remanded in custody.
 The court heard the defendants’ partners testify for the purposes of bail, all of whom told the court that their respective partners had changed for the better and had worked hard to overcome their drug problems, while confirming that the defendants would reside with them if released on bail.
 The court upheld the bail request, stressing that it was only doing so because the alleged offences took place in February and so as not to undo the progress they had made in their lives. “If you breach your bail, that will be entirely on you,” warned the magistrate.
 The men were released from arrest, their bail set at a €1,000 deposit and a €7,000 personal guarantee. They were also ordered to observe a curfew and sign a bail book at regular intervals.

Watch: Woman relives brutal stabbing: ‘I had to stay alive for my son’,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/woman-relives-brutal-stabbing-i-stay-alive-son.1097224,26-08-2024,"002259.png,002260.png","A woman who was stabbed in the chest during a sunrise visit to the beach has revealed how thoughts of her one-year-old son kept her alive in the aftermath of the attack.
 The 25-year-old recounted the harrowing incident in an interview with Times of Malta, describing how a stranger armed with a broken glass bottle attacked her on a rocky beach in St Julian’s on August 7.
 Clinging to life as she awaited medical help, she was driven by the thought of seeing her son again.
  The young Colombian mother, who required surgery after an artery was severed during the assault, tearfully recalled the moments following the attack.
 “In that moment, my son was my life, my angel. I needed to continue,” she said, asking to remain anonymous.
 Fabian Medina Paira, 21, also from Colombia and unknown to the woman, has been charged with attempted murder. Police say he was caught on camera attacking her on the beach in Triq il-Wilġa.
 The victim had been swimming with a friend when they noticed someone on the shore near their belongings break a bottle. They quickly came out of the sea to get their bags.
 “I would never think that I was on the beach and something would happen to me to make me lose my life,” she recalled, her English broken but her emotions clear.
 She recalls little of the attack.
 “I was on the floor covering my face. That’s all I remember. I didn’t feel anything.  I saw blood. I didn’t think too much of it. I saw a mark on my chest,” she said.
 Her friend’s voice urged her to stay awake.
 “‘Don’t sleep, don’t sleep’ – those words are in my mind,” she said.
 “At that moment, I was thinking about my son because I knew that if I do sleep, I will sleep,” she added.
 Rushed by ambulance to the hospital, the severity of her injuries became apparent, and she was told she would need to have an X-ray.
  “That is when I worried and thought: oh my God, this is not a small situation,” she said.
 Surgeons operated to repair the damaged artery. “They put the mask on and I slept.”
  Days after testifying against her alleged attacker in court, she spoke to  Times of Malta from her apartment where she is recovering.
 A small scar on her upper chest marks where she was stabbed, and a longer linear scar that leads down her chest shows where surgeons had to operate to repair the internal bleeding. She was also stabbed in her left side.
 After the operation, she “realised that I had almost lost my life”, and was hit by unbearable pain.
 “I couldn’t breathe well. And I could not speak – just small words. I had too much pain here in my back. I couldn’t move well,” she said.
 After five days in hospital, her recovery requires constant care and regular appointments.
 Initially dependent on others for basic tasks, she is now gradually regaining her strength.
 “Every day I can do something else: now I can move, now I can walk. And who is giving me that? It’s my son,” she said.
 Her son remains in Colombia, and she hopes he can join her soon in Malta.
 “My son needs to know his mum. Once I woke up [after the attack] I saw that I’m again here and I have one opportunity. I must still have time. I must still have a life.”
 The woman had lived in Malta for three years before returning to Colombia, only to return after becoming a mother, in search of a better future for her child.
 She arrived in Malta to pave the way for her family, with the necessary work and job permits currently being processed. She plans to work in a casino.
 “I come here to think about the future of my son. When I started here in Malta again, it was difficult. Because when I saw a baby on the street, I miss him. I say: why am I here alone without my baby? But I know he is good and safe,” she said, adding that she speaks to her son every day.
 Her son had just started walking before she came to Malta and “now he is running”.
 As she comes to terms with the ordeal, she says she feels thankful for being given “a new opportunity” to live.
 “You never know when a bad situation is going to happen to you. You never think it’s going to happen to you... Maybe God has some message for me. But I don’t know yet what is the message. I just say: thank you God because it’s a new opportunity for me,” she says, thanking police and hospital staff for their support.
 Despite the incident, she still believes that Malta is a much safer place than Colombia for her family.
 “I don’t know why but I feel stronger now. I want to stay here in Malta. I know Malta is not like that. I have family here too and real friends… I don’t want to stop because someone on the street… made me this. I want to stay here in Malta and now my son is my motivation to continue. I’m going to start again.”

What happens when a judgment binds someone left out of the lawsuit?,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/what-happens-judgment-binds-someone-left-lawsuit.1097630,09-07-2024,002267.png,"Judgments are pronouncements by the courts that are binding on the parties involved. So, what happens if someone who should be bound by a judgment is left out of the lawsuit?
 That was the question faced by the Court of Appeal in the case Environmental Landscapes Consortium Limited vs Information and Data Protection Commissioner et, decided on July 30, 2024.
 The case began through a freedom of information request (FOI request) filed by an individual, Mr X, seeking a copy of an agreement between Environmental Landscapes Consortium Limited and the Ministry for Transport and Infrastructure in 2015.
 The request was refused, so Mr X lodged a complaint with the Information and Data Protection Commissioner (IDPC).
 The IDPC ruled in his favour and ordered the publication of the contract. This led the Environmental Landscapes Consortium to file court proceedings against the IDPC and the ministry to have that decision annulled.
 Judgement was delivered in favour of Environmental Landscapes Consortium at first instance.
 The IDPC appealed and the Court of Appeal realised that Mr X, the original complainant who had a vested interest in the annulment of the decision, was not involved in the lawsuit. He was only asked to testify and made two appearances.
 The Court of Appeal had to ask itself: Should he have been involved? And if so, what happens next?
 After much deliberation, the Court of Appeal decided these two questions as follows:
 In the first place, Mr X should have been involved in the lawsuit before the courts because the original decision by the IDPC was delivered in a case instituted by him against the ministry. Therefore, that decision could never be annulled without Mr X being a party to the judgment that annuls it.
 The Court of Appeal then went on to conclude that, since Mr X had been absent from the court proceedings, the judgment delivered had to be annulled and given again, this time with Mr X as a party to the suit.
 Why?
 Because the annulled judgment would only be effective between the parties to the lawsuit – and not Mr X. As far as he was concerned, the decision upholding his FOI request remained valid and he could not be legally constrained to not reap its benefits. Hence the judgment of the Court of First Instance, which annulled a decision obtained following proceedings instituted by him, could not be enforced against him: it was equally alive (for Mr X) and dead (for the other three parties) at the same time.
 The Court of Appeal, which cannot allow unenforceable judgments to remain in existence, was left with no option but to point this fact out when the appeal came before it and send the case back before the Court of First Instance for Mr X to be roped into the suit and a decision given anew.

 The man, Roderick Grima, a 36-year-old man from Żabbar, was accused of stealing a blower whilst being a recidivist. He initially pleaded guilty, but then said that there might be some doubt about what actually happened. The accused further added that it might not be him. 

                     A police officer abruptly interrupted the accused, explaining to the Court that his bodycam was active during his arrest, and it was seen that the accused had verbally confirmed that he had done the acts, and was in fact wearing the same clothes he was wearing during the court proceeding.

 “You never learn it seems”, stated the Magistrate. It was revealed that she had previously sentenced him for another offence. During the proceeding, the man looked agitated, asking the Magistrate to allow him to speak with his lawyer numerous times. “If you are not certain, take back your plea”, the Court said, adding “forget it that I will grant you bail”.

 “What do you want me to say?” postulated the accused whilst addressing the Court. Both the prosecution and the defence were baffled in the way the accused had addressed the Court. However, the accused’s lawyer quickly explained what the magistrate had just told him.

 After a moment, the Magistrate asked the man, “What do you want to do in life? Are you happy as you are?”. The man responded, “I feel like I am in a dark place”.

 The Court reminded the man that whilst he was outside of prison, instead of going to Caritas to receive treatment, he went to do “other things”.

 “In your head, you aren’t right, it is apparent that you need help” (“Ġo moħħok mintix sew, tidher li għandek bżonn l-għajnuna”). After the Court explained to the accused of all the possibilities that he has, he confirmed his plea once again and was sentences to 13 months of imprisonment.

Court rejects request to summons Prime Minister to explain social benefits cheats' pardon,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/128958/court_to_summons_prime_minister_to_testify_on_pardon_for_social_benefits_cheats,02-05-2024,002317.png,"Lawyers representing a number of people accused of fraudulently receiving social benefits have told a court today that their clients had not yet received any confirmation of the Presidential Pardon announced by the Prime Minister last week.
 In a verbal note dictated before the start of eight of the cases of alleged social benefits fraud, lawyer Jason Azzopardi asked the court to immediately issue a summons to the Prime Minister in order that he testify about the pardon, which they had not received a copy of.
 Azzopardi told the court that the Head of State had signed a pardon “which exonerates those who, like the defendants in today’s cases, who had already started to repay the social benefits they had received unduly,” at the request of the Prime Minister, but that all he had to go on was a Government press release.
  Other defendants echo adjournment request 
 In another benefits fraud case, defence lawyer Jose Herrera also noted that the Prime Minister had issued a statement that the President had been advised to use her prerogative to issue a general pardon to people accused of social benefits fraud.
 “The issue is that the defence understands that this pardon is an option to those defendants or persons under investigation who wish to use it. So the pardon does not apply to whoever does not file a petition in his own name. The main condition for the pardon seems to be the repayment of the money received from the department.  It would mean that these proceedings become extinct, said the lawyer, asking that the case against his client also be adjourned. Silvio Grixti’s benefits racket cost €6 million in taxpayer money
 “Eight days on, Dr. Azzopardi cannot instruct his clients, because to date this pardon has not yet been published, and so the defendants are not aware of its contents, bar that which emerged in a news article and was confirmed by the Government.”
 The lawyer emphasised that the prosecuting officials were also in the dark about this, not having been informed of the details of this pardon, which is affecting hundreds of cases. “In the light of this, Dr. Azzopardi asks, even out of a sense of loyalty to the court itself, this case does not begin, that the Prime Minister be summoned immediately, so that he can explain to the court exactly what this pardon says and what it doesn’t.”
 Lawyer Anita Giordmaina, representing the Social Security department, did not object to the case being adjourned to a later date.
 The court said that it did not see any difficulty at this stage, to concede an adjournment in order for the defendant’s position to be clarified. This was because it is not the first time that adjournments are given for this reason.
 The Magistrate, however, added that she would not be summonsing the Prime Minister to testify as requested, expressing her hope by the next sitting “what is meant to happen in these cases will become clearer.”  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police
FSWS denies professionals discouraged murder victim from risk assessment,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/fsws-denies-professionals-discouraged-murder-victim-risk-assessment.1097281,27-08-2024,"002323.png,002324.png","The Foundation of Social Welfare Services (FSWS) has denied that its employees discouraged murder victim Nicolette Ghirxi from taking a risk assessment. 
 The denial comes after one of Ghirxi's close friends and her lawyer told Times of Malta that Ghirxi had agreed to take a risk assessment but that she had been  ""talked out of it"" when she attended the evaluation. 
 In a statement on Tuesday, the FSWS insisted that at no point did their employees discourage Ghirxi from taking the risk assessment. 
 To back this up, the agency published two affidavits from Jodie Baldacchino and Pavel Cuschieri, the two risk assessors present on the day that Ghirxi went to file a report.
 In the two near-identical statements, the assessors said that on April 22, they had explained to Ghirxi what carrying out the risk assessment would involve using the DASH risk checklist. 
 They said that after they explained to her in detail what the process would involve, Ghirxi said that she did not feel that she needed to undergo the assessment. 
 To justify this decision, they said that Ghirxi had insisted that her report was connected to harassment and insults. 
  Baldacchino and Cuschieri said they told her that the decision whether to carry out the assessment or not was up to her, but that if she wanted to do it they would be able to start immediately. 
 For a second time, they said that Ghirxi refused, saying she did not feel she was at risk. 
 The assessors said they made it clear to Ghirxi that if she changed her mind she could return to take the assessment any time, as they were available 24 hours a day. 
 At her refusal, Ghirxi was then directed to fill in a form that documents her refusal of service in writing, as is standard procedure, where assessors say she confirmed her refusal of the assessment in writing. 
 “Presently, I don’t think I am at risk. My report is based on insults and harassment. If anything new comes up, I will report,"" the assessors quote Ghirxi as saying. 
 Ghirxi was found stabbed to death in her Swatar apartment on august 12. She is believed to have been killed by her former partner Edward Johnston, who was later shot dead by police. 
 Johnston engaged in a three-hour standoff with the police while pointing what later transpired to be a replica Beretta pistol.
 Ghirxi's family are calling for an independent inquiry to establish the facts surrounding her death, as well as to identify whether authorities should have been aware that she was in danger.
 The PN has called on police commissioner Angelo Gafa to resign over the matter, saying that he lied about Ghirxi refusing to take a risk assessment and tried to ""victim blame"" her. 
 The FSWS said it is ready to cooperate with any inquiry or investigation that seeks to examine its works in this field in general and on this specific case.

 The officers then searched the driver's house in Mosta, where they arrested a third man, aged 24.
 There, the police found more heroin, weighing around 700 grams, a firearm and bullets, and other items linked to drug trafficking.
 The three men will be charged in front of Magistrate Rachel Montebello.

Yorgen Fenech seeks remedy over 'untrue' Jason Azzopardi statements,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/yorgen-fenech-seeks-remedy-untrue-jason-azzopardi-statements.1097367,29-08-2024,002341.png,"Jason Azzopardi’s “categorical” statements about Yorgen Fenech being the “sole” mastermind behind Daphne Caruana Galizia’s murder were a flagrant violation of court orders and highly prejudicial to a fair trial, Fenech’s lawyers claim.
 Certain statements made by the lawyer and former PN MP when recently interviewed by LovinMalta journalist Tim Diacono, prompted fresh legal action by the lawyers assisting the businessman who is currently awaiting trial for his alleged complicity in the 2017 murder.
 When the interviewer zoomed in on the murder case, Azzopardi said that Fenech sought a presidential pardon “because he committed a crime. Let’s be clear… let’s not forget… that during his interrogation he requested a presidential pardon.”
 “You ask for a pardon because you did [something] wrong,"" Azzopardi went on, driving home that point.
 And when asked whether Fenech was the mastermind behind the journalist's murder, he emphatically stated there was “more than an abundance of evidence to show the incontrovertible guilt of the person accused”.
 Moreover, when Diacono asked whether there were other masterminds, Azzopardi replied, “So far there is nothing to indicate otherwise.”
 All evidence that had emerged in court so far pointed towards Fenech as the sole mastermind, Azzopardi continued, prompting his interviewer to ask whether he [Azzopardi] was “protecting someone else”.
 But Azzopardi insisted over and over that all evidence “so far” pointed “only” at Fenech, emphasising the word “only.”
 Those statements triggered an application by Fenech’s lawyers before the judge presiding over the criminal proceedings to take all necessary measures, not only to end such contemptuous behaviour but also to make sure it does not go unpunished.
 Azzopardi’s statements were not only “untrue” but also prejudiced Fenech’s right to a fair hearing and presumption of innocence.
 They were meant to influence public opinion - that same public from which jurors would be selected to decide upon Fenech’s fate at a trial which is looming closer.
 What Azzopardi stated also contradicted certain evidence and documented facts.
 A witness, assisted by a lawyer from Azzopardi’s own office, had testified in the murder compilation saying that there were “several masterminds”.
 The reference by Fenech’s lawyers is presumably to Fenech’s former business associate Johann Cremona.
 There was other evidence showing the existence of at least “five masterminds” besides what was being alleged about Fenech.
 Alfred and George Degiorgio, currently serving a 40-year jail term for their role as hitmen, were summoned as witnesses by Azzopardi in a bid to defend himself in a  libel suit filed against him by former minister and Labour MP Carmelo Abela.
 The Degiorgios’ statements on that occasion also ran counter to what Azzopardi claimed in the interview.
 Moreover, the prosecution in the murder case stated several times that investigations are still ongoing.
 In fact, that was one of the reasons why prosecutors objected to Fenech’s bail requests time and time again.
 Former deputy AG Philip Galea Farrugia declared in open court in April 2021 that “no one is convinced that all those connected to this case have been charged.”
 Worse still, Azzopardi’s reference to Fenech’s pre-pardon statements was a “blatant violation” of the court’s decision -confirmed on appeal - that no reference was to be made to the topic of the pardon throughout the murder proceedings.
 Azzopardi should have known better that his statements to LovinMalta were prejudicial to the trial that was getting closer. 
 He seemed to want “to do everything [to ensure] that the defendant does not get a fair hearing,” argue Fenech’s lawyers.
 “What was Azzopardi’s aim?” they said.
 Whatever the reason, his behaviour was doubtlessly incorrect and in contempt not only towards the proper administration of justice but towards the courts’ decisions, the lawyers continued. 
 Such “challenging behaviour” was to be stopped and could not go unpunished, said Fenech’s lawyers, calling upon the court to take all necessary measures.
 Lawyers Gianluca Caruana Curran, Charles Mercieca and Marion Camilleri signed the application.

Ronnie Azzopardi claims central witness had lied during murder trial,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/131181/ronnie_azzopardi_claims_central_witness_had_lied_during_murder_trial,12-09-2024,002344.png,"Ronnie Azzopardi, the man who was sentenced to life in prison in 2012 for the car bomb murder of his brother’s partner Angela Bondin, has asked that his sentence be revoked.
 Azzopardi's request comes following his claim that a central witness in his trial had recently confessed to the convict’s father that he had “not really recognised” Azzopardi as the person who had placed the explosive device beside the victim’s car.
  The case reaches back to June 2005, when Ronnie Azzopardi had clashed with his late brother’s partner, Mary Rose Cassar, over the inheritance left by his sibling who had been murdered in Bormla in 2001.
 In a court application filed by Azzopardi’s lawyers: Jose Herrera, David Camilleri and Martina Herrera, on Thursday, it was claimed that Joseph Grima had given false evidence when he had told the court that he had been on the roof of the house together with his wife, Therese, setting up decorations for the Żejtun feast.
 Grima had testified that from their roof, he and his wife Therese could observe the goings-on in Triq il-Madonna tal-Ħniena. “In fact they saw a car stop, saw the defendant emerge from it and place what they thought to be a rubbish bag in the road and leave.”
 Therese Grima had testified that the rubbish bag seemed to be heavy and had appeared to contain a battery connected to several wires. Bondin had happened to be passing by and had helped her carry the bag to a construction site. After moving the bag, the women had stopped to chat, at which point the bomb it contained, detonated. 
 Bondin’s life was snuffed out by the explosion, which also left Grima grievously injured.
 Azzopardi’s lawyers are now stating that their client had “gotten to know” that the eyewitness, Joseph Grima, had recently been publicly stating that he had never identified the defendant as the person who planted the bomb. After informing his son about this, the son and Azzopardi’s father had paid the witness a visit to speak to him about the matter.
 The lawyers claim that Grima told the men that it was not true that he had recognised Azzopardi as the person who placed the bomb, and that he was prepared to go to prison instead of Azzopardi “if he had said so.”
 The application requests the court to declare that Azzopardi had therefore been convicted on the strength of evidence which subsequently turned out to be false and revoke his sentence.  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police
Five arraigned after drugs are found in three houses and a car,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/five-arrested-drugs-found-three-houses-car.1099156,10-08-2024,"002354.png,002355.png","Updated 11.56am with arraignment details.
 Four men and a woman have been taken to court following an investigation which led to a drug importation ring being smashed, the police said.
 Investigations started weeks ago, with arrests being made on Sunday.
 A car was surrounded, stopped and searched in Żabbar, where seven kilograms of cocaine were found.
 Raids followed in a house in Żabbar and another two houses in Marsascala, where the police found more cocaine as well as six kilograms of cannabis resin,  drug-related equipment, a cash counting machine, counterfeit documents and ammunition.
 The arrested persons are Nikola Vujakovic, 36 and Sara Lerinc, 22 from Serbia, Salvatore Rogazione, 37, an Italian, Aleksander Vujakovic, 34 from Croatia and Goran Davkovski, 54 of Macedonia. 
  Nikola Vujakovic was charged with procurement of cocaine, possession of cocaine and cannabis under circumstances denoting that the drugs were not for personal use, possession of weapons without a police licence, falsification of documents and possession thereof. 
 Aleksandar Vujakovic was charged with possession of cocaine and cannabis not for personal use and document forgery.
 Rogazione was charged with procurement and possession of cocaine not for personal use and Lerinc was charged with procurement of cocaine, possession of cocaine and cannabis not for personal use and unlicensed possession of weapons. 
 Lerinic was charged with procurement of cocaine, possession of cocaine and cannabis not for personal use and unlicensed possession of weapons. 
 Davkovski was charged with possession of cocaine and cannabis not for personal use, forgery of documents and possession thereof. 
 Prosecuting Inspector Mark Anthony Mercieca gave an overview of the investigation. 
 He told the court that over the past months, police received information about a group of Serbian nationals who were likely involved in drug trafficking, arms possession and document forgery in Malta.
 One of the suspects was Nikola Vujakovic who lived in Zabbar with his girlfriend Sara, but also visited other premises and made use of a place at Marsascala. 
 The man used various vehicles.
 Police carried out short spells of surveillance over the last weeks to get an idea of the gang’s lifestyle. 
 On October 5, police upped their surveillance to confirm the intelligence in hand. 
 On October 6, Nikola was monitored as he drove a Volvo vehicle to a parking area where he approached a Peugeot, opened the boot and filled a bag with something. 
 He placed the bag in his Volvo and drove to Baħar ic-Cagħaq.  
 Police officers kept watch at the area where the Peugeot was parked. 
 On October 6, Nikola drove up to the Peugeot on a white motorbike along with his girlfriend. 
 Once again, he opened the boot, took a small bag and drove off again, police in tow all the way to Triq il-Miklem Malti, Marsascala.
 There he placed the bag on the front porch of a residence,
 A man wearing a green jumper collected it soon after. 
 Police arrested that man, later identified as Salvatore Rogazione.
 The bag contained a block of cocaine.  
 Nikola and Sara were arrested at their Zabbar residence where police found a cocaine sachet and a sachet of cannabis as well as a firearm.
 There was also an indeterminate amount of cash and a money-counting machine. 
 There were various mobile phones, several weighing scales and €14,000 cash in the glove compartment of the Volvo. 
 Another €3630 in cash was in Nikola’s wallet. 
 Searches were carried out at various premises linked to Nikola. 
 Those searches yielded 7 kilos of cannabis and 7 kilos of cocaine. 
 A sizeable press and moulds bearing traces of cocaine were also found. 
 The defence jointly registered their objection to the prosecution’s request for a freezing order but Magistrate Nadine Sant Lia issued the order in terms of law. 
 All except for Davkovski pleaded not guilty. Davkovski opted not to answer any questions, repeating “I don’t want to answer” to each question put by the magistrate’s deputy.
 The defence did not request bail and all were remanded in custody.
 AG lawyer Maria Francesca Spiteri and inspectors Mark A Mercieca, Jonathan Cassar, Jonathan Pace and Oscar Baldacchino prosecuted.
 Lawyers Franco Debono, Alfred Abela and Rene’ Darmanin were counsel to the Vujakovic brothers and Lerinc. Lawyer Charles Mercieca was counsel to Davkovski. Lawyer Julia Micallef Stafrace was counsel to Rogazione.

Suspended sentence for police sergeant who grievously injured 14-year-old boy,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/suspended-sentence-police-sergeant-grievously-injured-14yearold-boy.1096085,31-07-2024,002356.png,"A police sergeant involved in an incident where a 14-year-old boy suffered grievous injuries was handed a suspended sentence after the court took note of his untainted criminal record and immediate admission.
 The 37-year-old officer, whose name was banned from publication together with that of the victim, landed on the wrong side of the law when called upon to assist in handling a difficult situation at a social shelter earlier this month.
 Although details about the incident were sparse, it is understood that the 14-year-old boy was allegedly kicking up trouble at a Birkirkara shelter.
 When the police arrived at the scene, the situation was soon brought under control but matters took a sudden twist while the sergeant was reprimanding the boy, who ended up with facial injuries.
 The officer accompanied the teen for medical assistance and, once back at the police station, waited until his shift was over for his superior to call at the office.
 Once the police superintendent arrived, the sergeant immediately told him what had happened. Later, he voluntarily went to the police headquarters to face an investigation.
 He was subsequently charged with grievously injuring the minor, assaulting, insulting and threatening him, causing fear of violence and breaching the public peace, aggravated by the fact that, as a public officer, he was duty bound to prevent such offences.
 He was also charged with wilfully damaging third-party property, namely property belonging to the Foundation for Social Welfare Services and the government. The sergeant registered an admission upon arraignment and was granted bail pending judgment.
 The court, presided over by Magistrate Gabriella Vella, yesterday handed down a two-year jail term suspended for four years after noting that the accused had immediately reported the incident to his superiors, had an untainted criminal record and registered an early guilty plea.
 The officer was also ordered to pay €826 in damages caused to FSWS property. He was to cover the costs of psychological sessions needed by the victim, up to a maximum of 10 sessions.
 The court provided help for the officer too, in the form of a two-year treatment order, which was intended to help him cope with the effects caused by this episode.
 A two-year restraining order was issued to safeguard the victim.
 Finally, “without downplaying in any manner the gravity of the case, [the court] recommended that the accused should not lose his job, even in light of his service to the police corps”, said Magistrate Vella.
 AG lawyer Tilden Tabone and police inspector Jessica Bezzina prosecuted.
 Lawyers Alfred Abela and Renè Darmanin were defence counsel. Lawyer Christian Camilleri appeared parte civile.

Man admits to forcing his way into loved ones' homes to demand money for crack,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/130726/addict_admits_to_forcing_his_way_into_loved_ones_homes_to_demand_money_for_crack,13-08-2024,002358.png,"A 26-year-old man from Marsa was remanded in custody on Tuesday after admitting to having intimidated and threatened his mother, sister, and girlfriend into financing his crack cocaine habit.
 Police inspector Colin Sheldon arraigned the man, who is unemployed, before magistrate Claire Stafrace Zammit, on charges of having caused the women to fear that he would use violence against them or their property, both on August 12 when he was arrested, as well as in the weeks and months leading up to it.
 He was further charged with insulting and threatening the women, attempting to intimidate his girlfriend into giving him money, breaching a suspended sentence and recidivism.
 It is understood that the man had broken down his girlfriend’s door while demanding money from her so that he could buy crack. The defendant’s sister arrived at the scene while this was going on, and was also threatened by the man, who then fled. 
 It was the man’s sister who had encouraged the girlfriend to file a police report about the man’s threats and unannounced appearances at her workplace, demanding money.
 The police arrested the man at his family home, having gone to his mother’s residence shortly after running away from his girlfriend and sister.
 When the mother refused to give him money, the defendant proceeded to break down the door to the common area of the block as well as the door to her apartment.
 The incident appears to have taken place while the man was under the effects of crack cocaine.
 The court was told that the defendant had been off drugs for nearly three years in total, before suffering a relapse.
 Lawyer Martina Herrera, assisting the defendant as legal aid counsel, entered a guilty plea on behalf of her client and requested a pre-sentencing report.
 The case was adjourned to September for the report to be drawn up. Bail was not requested.  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police
Five-year prison sentence for pair behind arson attack in Valletta,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/132403/fiveyear_prison_sentence_for_pair_behind_arson_attack_in_valletta_,21-11-2024,002359.png,"Judith Bakoush and Omar Trabelsi were each found guilty of causing a car fire five years ago in St. Dominic Street and were subsequently sentenced to five years imprisonment.

 In its judgment, the Court, presided over by Magistrate Rachel Montebello, noted how on 10 November 2019, Omar Trabelsi, acting on the instructions given by Judith Bakoush, carried out an arson at around 3.30am, with the fire ultimately spreading and damaging two cars along with the façade of a building.

                     Throughout the proceedings, evidence confirmed that Bakoush had instructed Trablesi to burn a particular car ‘well’, with Trabelsi in turn reporting to Bakoush that the ‘mission is complete’ upon perpetuating the arson attack. It was also noted that Bakoush provided Trabelsi with some drugs, as she ‘was not going to forget the favour’.

 The gravity of the attack was such that various persons had to be evacuated from the apartments of the block in question due to the severe smoke and heat generated by the fire, which ultimately engulfed the common area. The fire in fact prompted a response from the Civil Protection Department. 

 The defendants were also, in addition to the sentence of imprisonment, ordered to pay around €21,000 in damages as well as around €1,100 each in court costs.

 A restraining order and a treatment order were further issued.

 Bakoush also has separate court proceedings related to drug trafficking from her Valletta home.

"Josie Muscat: I 'never, never, never' discussed cyclotron with Vitals",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/live-blog-joseph-muscat-back-court-vitals-corruption-case.1094140,19-06-2024,"002360.png,002361.png,002362.png,002363.png","Updated 1.15pm 
 Saint James Hospital magnate Josie Muscat on Wednesday strongly denied having anything to do with a failed cancer treatment project spearheaded by Vitals Global Healthcare.
 Muscat confirmed that he was the first person to suggest setting up a cyclotron in Malta but insisted he had discussed that with state agency Malta Enterprise, not Vitals or its shareholders. 
 He “never, never, never” spoke to Vitals or its suspected secret shareholder Shaukat Ali Chaudry about the plans, Muscat said when questioned in court.
 Josie Muscat, whose Saint James Hospital group is the largest private healthcare provider in the country, was testifying in the case against Joseph Muscat, Keith Schembri, Konrad Mizzi and many others.
 Prosecutors allege that Joseph Muscat and other defendants took bribes and committed acts of fraud and money laundering as part of the Muscat-led government’s project to award Vitals a 30-year deal to run three state hospitals.
 That deal was annulled by a civil court last year on the basis of fraud. All defendants facing criminal charges deny any wrongdoing.
 Wednesday’s court hearing was almost entirely taken up with testimony concerning the Cyclotron project.
 The project cost millions to set up and was then sold to Malta Enterprise for roughly €6.9 million when Vitals’ successor, Steward Healthcare, decided to drop it.
 Even now, years later, the equipment remains unused at the Life Sciences Park adjacent to Mater Dei Hospital, a Malta Enterprise representative confirmed under oath on Wednesday. 
 
 Investigators working on a magisterial inquiry into the Vitals deal concluded that the company used taxpayer money to purchase the firm that owned the Cyclotron, then eventually resold the firm to Malta Enterprise.
 Testifying on Wednesday, Josie Muscat said that the idea for a cyclotron first arose in 2011 or 2012 but that he dropped out of the project after growing suspicious about an Italian investor in the project.  
 Muscat said he met that Italian investor during a trip to Israel together with Malta Enterprise representatives. Muscat stressed that he had paid for his own passage and accommodation on that trip.
  The court also heard testimony from an architect engaged to work on structural works at the Life Sciences Park in connection with the cyclotron project. 
 The project was dropped in around 2017, Karl Farrugia testified, as he recalled equipment being left abandoned in the Mater Dei Hospital car park. 
 Earlier in the hearing, the court heard testimony from a Malta Business Registry representative, who said that one of the companies facing charges, Sciacca Grill, had no known ties to co-defendant Keith Schembri.
 The company was previously called Kasco Food Group and owned by Schembri’s Kasco but shares were transferred to Noel Zammit in 2014, the representative said. Zammit remains the company’s owner and director to this day.
 The court also heard testimony from former inspector Anthony Scerri, who was tasked by the inquiring magistrate with helping to arrange and coordinate testimony as part of that inquiry.
 Scerri came under some tough questioning by the lawyer representing auditor Chris Spiteri, who testified several times before the magistrate.
 The former inspector insisted that police officers simply followed the magistrate’s instructions at all times and consulted with court-appointed experts when seizing items and documents from Spiteri’s office.
 He also confirmed that Spiteri was never cautioned or given the option of having a lawyer present while testifying in the inquiry.
 “I never suspected Spiteri, I didn’t know what the magistrate had in hand,” Scerri said. 
 The case continues on Thursday.
 1.15pm That's all from us for today - a relatively uneventful court hearing.  We've got a wrap-up of the key events available at the top of this article.
 Thank you for having joined us, we'll be back tomorrow. 
 12.45pm And with that, the magistrate  defers the case to tomorrow morning, when submissions on the prima facie case presented by prosecutors will start being heard. 
 The magistrate is running a tight ship: she tells defence lawyers that the case will then continue on June 25. That session, she tells them, will be just two hours long.
 12.44pm No more witnesses are to testify today – Inspector Wayne Borg was due to testify but the two defendants who wanted him to do so, David Meli and Mario Victor Gatt, appear to have had a change of mind. 
 The witnesses who were due to connect via videoconferencing are also no-shows for today.
 12.39pm A Bank of Valletta representative is the next to testify. The witness is here to provide account statements of Taomac Ltd, one of the companies linked to the cyclotron project, dating back to January 2012. 
 They do so, and that’s about it. The witness is done testifying.
 12.35pm Josie Muscat is asked by lawyer Chris Cilia about his involvement in the cyclotron project.
 He says it all began years ago, when Malta Enterprise wanted to set up a project “for animals.”
 “I found that rather strange,”
 Josie Muscat eventually ended up in Israel with Malta Enterprise representatives at some point between 2010 and 2012. He says that’s when he met Musarella. “I didn’t like the look of it,” Muscat says.
 Muscat emphasised that he paid for his own passage and accommodation during that trip. 
 He confirms that the cyclotron idea was his, but says he never signed any contracts with Malta Enterprise.
 Cilia says the inquiry concluded that the project’s real promoter was Shaukat Ali Chaudry.
 Muscat says Vitals had nothing to do with the project for as long as he was involved in it and that he “never, never, never” spoke to Vitals or Ali about the project.
 He denies suggestions by Cilia that he was just a front for Ali. 
 12.21pm The next witness is Josie Muscat, the doctor and former MP who owns Saint James Hospital. 
 Muscat has said that Vitals shareholders were initially keen on buying out the private hospital group he owns. 
 12.18pm The next witness is Joseph Zammit, the CFO at Malta Enterprise. He is also asked about the Cyclotron project.
 Zammit says the agency approved a soft loan in 2017 for the purchase of that cancer equipment, which is currently installed at the Life Sciences Park.
 The project was originally proposed by Josie Muscat [of Saint James Hospital] back in 2015, he recalled.  Muscat later informed Malta Enterprise that he was exiting the project for personal reasons. By that point, €4.7 million (61% of its full cost) had been approved.
 When Josie Muscat exited the project, an Italian investor (Musarella) took over. And then Vitals came in. The agreement was for the loan to be repaid in three tranches.
 By the time the third payment was due, Steward had taken over from Vitals. The company told Malta Enterprise it was no longer interested in the project. And at that point, Malta Enterprise took over the project for €6.9 million, says Zammit.
 And all these years later, the equipment is still not working, the witness confirms under questioning.
 Audit firm RSM was tasked with carrying out due diligence on Mtrace [the company that owned the cyclotron] when Malta Enterprise decided to buy it. 
 12.08pm We’re getting into the weeds of the Cyclotron project here.
 Farrugia is asked for details about specific companies and individuals linked to the project. He explains that his firm had a Polish consultant who advised on the type of concrete needed to block radiation. 
 After another volley of questions about the project specifics, Farrugia is done testifying. 
 12.03pm The next witness is architect and civil engineer Karl Farrugia, the director of Forward Structures.
 His firm worked on the Cyclotron project at the Life Sciences Park in 2014 – structural interventions and various other works on an underground section of the park used for cancer treatment.
 Then there was a change in shareholders and suppliers – “there was some issue with payments, apparently,” the witness recalls – and things ground to a halt. Equipment was left at the Mater Dei car park, he recalls.
 Farrugia says his firm’s involvement in the project ended in around 2018. The last set of drawings they drafted was dated May 2017. His firm was not involved in the installation of equipment, he says. 
 Reminder: the Cyclotron project was a failed Vitals initiative to create a cutting-edge cancer treatment centre. Prosecutors suspect the company used taxpayer money to fund the project, then re-sold the failed venture back to the government.
 11.56am Back to legal proceedings: a representative from the Malta Business Registry presents documents related to Sciacca Grill, one of the companies facing charges. The witness also confirms that lawyer David Meli [another co-accused] was not involved in Nexia BT or Steward’s Maltese firms.
 Lawyers David Bonello and Franco Debono note that shares in Sciacca Grill were transferred from Keith Schembri’s Kasco in March 2014. The company was previously known as Kasco Foods Limited.
 The MBR representative confirms that Schembri resigned as a director of the company in 2013 and transferred shares to its current owner, Noel Zammit, the following year. 
 11.48am Meanwhile, Repubblika's Robert Aquilina says he's encouraged by the way things are going so far. 
 Defence lawyers are focused on finding non-existent procedural defects, he says, rather than focusing on substantive matters.
 ""It is clear that the inquiring magistrate and her appointed experts did a serious and thorough job,"" he writes. 
  11.46am But there’s a problem – none of the three [non-Maltese] witnesses have connected to the videoconferencing link. 
 There’s an Italian interpreter in court, but defence lawyer Arthur Azzopardi says that won’t be needed as all three speak English. If only the court could get in contact with them. 
 11.43am That’s all from Scerri. The next three witnesses will testify via videoconference. They all relate to Technoline, the medical procurement firm at the heart of the alleged wrongdoing.
 We've written plenty about this company. You could start here and  continue here.
 11.41am Grima gets the witness to say that he never considered Spiteri a criminal suspect. 
 He asks the witness why he did not caution him before he testified before the magistrate a second time. “I never suspected Spiteri, I didn’t know what the magistrate had in hand,” Scerri said. 
 11.37am Scerri, under questioning, confirms that Spiteri had no lawyer to assist him during questioning by the magistrate. Nor was he cautioned.
 Defence lawyer Grima says other defendants were legally assisted and even cautioned. 
 11.34am Grima presses on. The application also notes that “investigations are still ongoing by the police.” Is there a mistake there, too?
 Scerri insists that the police always followed magisterial orders in the case.
 Grima says that court experts were “looking in boxes” during the search. Did police check to see what experts were seizing?
 Scerri says that police officers showed the experts files or items to see if they believed they were relevant. They did not make that decision themselves. “We checked the titles of files and so on and handed them to the inquiring magistrate. Then it was up to her,” Scerri said.
 He confirms, under questioning, that police did not exclude any documents containing privileged information.
 Scerri also confirms that he did not seek the authorisation of the Commissioner for Inland Revenue before pressing charges against Spiteri. He says he does not know if any other police officers did so.
 11.24am Grima is questioning Scerri’s credibility as a witness: he notes that Scerri was not present for each of his client’s testimonies before the inquiring magistrate, and pokes holes in his assertion that the police did not investigate the Vitals case.
 The inspector,  Grima tells the court, testified that after one of Spiteri’s testimonies, his testimony was examined by the police. So did the police investigate, or not?
 Scerri says that he was instructed by the magistrate to search Spiteri’s office. But he needed that order in writing, in the form of a search warrant. So he filed a request for one.
 But Grima says the dates do not tally: the search warrant was filed in June, while Spiteri testified in June and July.
 Scerri sticks to his recollection of events but says “there might be a mistake in the date.”
 11.15am We begin proceedings with the testimony of former inspector Anthony Scerri.
 Lawyer Jason Grima has questions for him [Grima represents Vitals auditor Christopher Spiteri]. 
 11.12am Magistrate Rachel Montebello begins today's court hearing. All defendants are present, save for one person representing one of the companies facing charges. Another company representative is appearing on its behalf today. 
 We still don't know who will testify today, but given that the police have stated that they relied solely on the magisterial inquiry to press charges, they most likely do not have too many witnesses up their sleeves.
 At this stage, the prosecution’s biggest headache is getting to the prima facie stage (namely, the court decree that there is enough prima facie evidence for accused to stand trial on indictment).
 11.03am The court session will begin any minute, and the courtroom has filled up. There are lawyers, defendants - Muscat, of course, but Adrian Hillman, Christopher Spiteri, Pierre Sladden, Brian Bondin and Konrad Mizzi too. Others might be present, too, but it's hard to tell from the gallery that journalists are packed into. 
 10.43am We spotted Muscat as he entered court. A few bystanders applauded. One encouraged him ""ejja Joseph"" [Come on Joseph]. Muscat met those words of encouragement with a grin. 
  10.40am There were hundreds for the first court hearing. Dozens for the second. And even fewer for today's. The only person we spotted outside court ahead of the 11am court hearing was Robert Aquilina, honorary president of NGO Repubblika. 
 It was Repubblika's work that led to this case reaching the criminal courts: prosecutions were based on a magisterial inquiry the NGO triggered back in 2019.
  10.35am This will be the third time Muscat and co. appear in court as criminally accused defendants. 
 In their first appearance, they were read charges and pleaded not guilty, doing so over the din of a braying crowd gathered outside court to voice support for Muscat. 
 That circus did not go down well with Labour insiders, who say it cost them votes.
 The second court hearing was held after the MEP elections, which humbled Labour and Muscat's pre-electoral bravado. And that was reflected in the show of force outside court: the hundreds of people who gathered for Muscat's first court hearing had thinned out to just a handful.  
  10.30am Good morning and welcome to this live blog. We'll be bringing you live updates from the Valletta law courts, where the case against Muscat, Schembri, Mizzi and others will continue. 
 Those three - and another 11 people - have been jointly charged with a litany of serious crimes concerning the Vitals deal.

Suspended jail term for former prisons director confirmed,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/suspended-jail-term-former-prisons-director-confirmed.1098531,25-09-2024,002433.png,"A court has confirmed the conviction of former prison boss Robert Brincau over a gun incident which occurred at Għadira Bay two summers ago. 
 In January 2023, Brincau was found guilty of a series of offences linked to the incident, including injuring a volunteer ambulance driver and carrying a gun without a licence. 
 The court had heard how in the previous August, Brincau had pointed a gun at an ambulance driver's head and was recorded threatening him with the words ""I'll kill you and your family"". 
 Volunteer ambulance driver Liam Doublet described to the court how he ""turned cold"" when the 49-year-old prison boss whipped out a firearm and pointed it at his head during a heated argument. The weapon and ten 9mm bullets, were among the list of weapons registered at CCF but not to Brincau himself. 
 The Magistrates’ Court had handed Brincau a 12-month jail term suspended for three years but cleared him of misusing electronic communications equipment. 
 Brincau subsequently resigned from his post and lodged an appeal. 
 On Wednesday, the Court of Criminal Appeal, presided over by Madam Justice Natasha Galea Sciberras, rejected the appeal and confirmed the sentence. 
 The court explained to Brincau that the suspended sentence would run from today. 
 The judge warned that if the appellant had some brush with the law during the next three years, that one-year jail term would come into effect.

Court dismisses ADPD case on allocation of additional parliamentary seats,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/132802/court_dismisses_adpd_case_on_allocation_of_additional_parliamentary_seats,16-12-2024,002448.png,"Chairperson Sandra Gauci confirmed the ADPD will lodge an appeal from a court decision which dismissed the pleas made by the party in a constitutional action challenging the manner in which additional seats were allocated to the two main political parties following the 2022 general election.

 The First Hall of the Civil Court rejected all pleas made by ADPD, in a judgment raising several legal points of interest.

                     In its application, ADPD argued that Maltese electoral laws give rise to discrimination against smaller parties. In particular, reference was made to those provisions which provide that the allocation of additional parliamentary seats to reflect proportionality with votes applies solely to those parties which would already be represented in parliament.

 The recent mechanism referring to the allocation of additional seats for the under-represented sex, which only comes into play if two parties are elected in a general election, was also criticised as being discriminatory against smaller parties not being the two traditional parties elected to parliament. 

 In its judgment, the Court noted that no provision of the Constitution could be deemed to be inconsistent with, or in breach of, another article of the same Constitution. Indeed, the so-called supremacy of the Constitution which affords primacy to the Constitution where any other law conflicts with it, makes no reference to the possibility of inconsistencies between different articles of the same Constitution. Thus, no article of the Constitution could be deemed to be inconsistent with another article thereof.

 Through its press release, ADPD expressed particular disagreement with this part of the judgment, with deputy leader Carmel Cacopardo commenting that ‘every part of the Constitution which conflicts with human rights remains dubious as regards its validity’.

 The Court also noted that whilst ordinary legislation is subject to the European Convention on Human Rights, the Constitution of Malta is not so.

 References made by ADPD to the provisions of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union were also discarded, with the Court noting that the Charter could not be invoked in the proceedings at hand.

 Decision will not discourage ADPD – Sandra Gauci

 Whilst Chairperson Gauci noted that the decision is not what she had hoped for, especially in light of the 50th anniversary of the Maltese Republic, the party will continue to work in favour of all citizens and their right to be represented. Deputy chairperson Carmel Cacopardo added that even if the Court of Appeal does not rule in ADPD’s favour, recourse will be made to the European Court of Human Rights.

 Gauci concluded by noting that human and financial resources were necessary in order that the appeal could be lodged.

 To this end, she encouraged persons to contribute through a fundraising campaign which will shortly be launched by the party.      ",Thomas Cilia ,court_and_police

 The Malaysian national pleaded not guilty.
 Magistrate Marse-Anne Farrugia also ordered the freezing of his assets.
 Times of Malta is informed the man was arrested on Saturday afternoon at the Malta International Airport after a routine inspection led to the discovery of a significant quantity of cannabis in his luggage.
 The man had just landed in Malta aboard flight EK0109 from Dubai.
 Shahrul Idzwan Bin Mohd Ali was arrested on the spot while carrying a large blue suitcase and a small piece of luggage.
 As his luggage passed through the customs scanner, authorities detected potential hidden packages within the large blue suitcase, Times of Malta was told.
 Upon inspection, it was revealed to contain 20kg of cannabis grass.
 Police also seized a mobile phone for further investigation.
 The man told police he had been given the sum of €2,000 to traffic what he believed to be ‘Chinese substances’.
 Times of Malta is informed that Bin Mohd Ali was approached by authorities to facilitate a controlled delivery. However, he was reluctant to proceed.
 Sources said the man attempted to alert an associate outside Malta to tell them he had been stopped by police.
 The operation at MIA was carried out by the Police’s Drug Squad in collaboration with Customs.

 Said requested bail but Police Inspector Antonello Magri, prosecuting, objected saying that the accused was overstaying in Malta, he does not have a fixed address and may tamper with evidence. 
 Lawyer Jason Grima, who is representing Said with lawyer Kirsty Muscat, said his client cooperated with police and went to police out of his own will when he learnt he was being investigated.
 The lawyer said that his client wanted to remain in Malta especially now that he was expecting a child which meant he had a strong tie with the island and would not abscond. 
 The lawyer added that other people charged with similar crimes were not arraigned under arrest but were summoned to turn up in court.

 The court issued a publication ban on the man’s name, requested by the prosecution at this stage in order to prevent jeopardising ongoing investigations into his network.
 The Syrian defendant was arraigned before Magistrate Giannella Camilleri Busuttil late on Wednesday afternoon, accused of setting up or forming part of a terrorist training organisation, inciting terrorist activity by distributing messages which promote terrorism, as well as recruiting or encouraging others to carry out terrorist activities or travelling abroad for this reason, training others to use explosives, firearms or other specific or technical actions with the intention of carrying out a terrorist attack.
  The man was also accused of having himself received training in the production or use of explosives, firearms or poisonous substances for that purpose.
 Further charges relating to travelling abroad in order to plan and prepare for a terrorist attack, financing or otherwise facilitating that travel, as well as distributing publications encouraging terrorism and making them available to others were also pressed.
 Inspector Zammit said that yesterday, another man wanted for offences relating to financing terrorism had been arrested on a warrant. During his arrest, the defendant, who lived in the same residence as the warrant subject, while his documents were being verified, he was handed a letter of rights in Arabic.
 The defendant informed the police that he might have other documentation on his phone.
 Police officers noticed what appeared to be extremist material while checking his phone.
 “While checking his mobile at the office we discovered that it contained much more extremist and terrorist material than we had noticed at first.”
 MaltaToday is informed that over one terabyte of material related to terrorism was discovered on the device, but this did not emerge in court.
 Lawyer Nicholas Mifsud asked whether the man had been living in Malta legally. He had.
 The defendant was informed why he was being charged later, once an Arabic-speaking police officer could be brought to interpret.
 The court declared the man’s arrest to be valid.
 Mifsud told the court that the defendant was not currently in Malta illegally, because he had been here for less than 30 days, but pointed out that this period would lapse while the case is ongoing.
 Lawyer Noel Bianco asked the court to officially recommend to the Principal Immigration Officer to suspend the running of the 30-day period pending the proceedings. This would prevent the man’s regular immigration status from becoming irregular, the defence explained.
 The prosecution argued that it was not the court’s job to make recommendations about the man’s immigration status and pointed out that at this stage, the court had no evidence of the length of time that the defendant had been in Malta.
 The court rejected the request, as it had no basis in law.
 Bail was not requested.

Former Excelsior owner claims breach of rights in 50-year-old case,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/former-excelsior-owner-claims-breach-rights-50yearold-case.1094035,17-06-2024,002507.png,"A majority shareholder in the company that formerly owned the Grand Hotel Excelsior, who was “totally divested” of his property rights at a ministerial stroke of pen 50 years ago, is claiming a breach of his fundamental rights.
 The claim was made in constitutional proceedings filed recently by Massimiliano Martone as an offshoot of the politico-legal saga surrounding the now-defunct Bank of Industry, Commerce and Agriculture Ltd, more commonly known as BICAL, that was put under administration in 1972.
 That order, issued by the finance minister of the day, meant that the bank, owned by siblings Cecil and Henry Pace, was placed under the direction of a state-appointed controller, along with a number of companies which, though not owned by the Pace brothers, were somehow connected to BICAL.
 One of those companies was Malta and Europe Hotels Ltd [MEHL] whose majority shareholder was Martone’s father, Michele, who subsequently transferred his shares to his son, the applicant.
 That ministerial decision meant that the shareholders of MEHL were “totally divested” of control and administration of the company, Martone claims.
 Those functions were entrusted to a controller and liquidator appointed by the minister, but decades later, they still have not distributed any funds, nor published accounts nor updated shareholders on their work.
 And worse still, these officials are immune from legal action in terms of law, says Martone who has now taken his grievances before the constitutional courts.
 MEHL was set up on June 8, 1966, with a shareholding capital of Lm900,000.
 The aim of the company was to build and run a hotel in Floriana, later named the Grand Hotel Excelsior.
 Building works kicked off in 1966 and were completed by July 1972, funded by means of a loan which MEHL took from BICAL.
 Four months after completion of works, on November 25, the then minister of finance  put the bank under administration in terms of the Banking Act of 1970.
 Three days later, the government appointed lawyer Karmenu Mifsud Bonnici as controller of the bank.
 In September 1974, the ministerial order was extended to a number of companies, including the hotel-owning company, even though MEHL did not belong to the Pace brothers.
 The controller took over administration at MEHL with all the legal powers endowed upon him by the Banking Act by virtue of his office.
 The ministerial order made it clear that he was to dispose of the company’s assets and “keep the funds in such profitable manner as may be appropriate in the circumstances with a view to eventual payment or distribution of those funds according to law”.
 Michele Martone held 51% of the shares in MEHL. In 1991, he transferred that property to his son who is now suing the state, the current controller and liquidator whose shortcomings have resulted in “devastating, irrevocable and prejudicial” consequences for MEHL’s shareholders.
 The government’s decision 50 years ago to put MEHL under administration, despite the fact that those investigated were the BICAL owners, was an act “of disproportionate and unjustified interference,” Martone claimed.
 The minister’s order “blatantly” impinged upon shareholders’ property rights. In 1985, Emanuel Bonello took over as controller.
 The Grand Hotel Excelsior was run to the ground on account of shortcomings by the controller, until it was sold for Lm2,540,000 in 1991.
 The sale meant that MEHL was left with no other assets or commercial ventures.
 Yet, the controller did not step down.
 To date, the company is still shown on the Register of Companies as being “in dissolution”.
 A “scheme of dissolution” was prepared in 2014 but to date, those funds have still not been distributed to the shareholders, including Martone.
 Moreover, lawyer Robert Tufigno and accountant Raymond Gatt, on behalf of MGI Malta, as liquidator and controller of MEHL respectively, have still not published accounts, nor accounted for their tasks.
 And in terms of the Controlled Companies (Procedure for Liquidation) Act they are immune from legal action.
 Martone is claiming that all this clearly breached his fundamental right to peaceful enjoyment of property, namely the shares that were meant to secure substantial interests for the shareholder.
 He is calling upon the First Hall, Civil Court in its constitutional jurisdiction to declare that the ministerial order and sale of hotel both breached his rights.
 The delays by the controller and liquidator also resulted in damages that are to be shouldered by the state, claims Martone.
 Lawyers Mario de Marco and Ryan Bezzina are assisting Martone who is represented in the case by Luigi Martone.

"'I know I'll be charged', Muscat says as Vitals inquiry concluded",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/live-blog-joseph-muscat-court-amid-talk-vitals-inquiry-earthquake.1091746,21-06-2024,"002523.png,002524.png","Updated 3.20pm
 A magisterial inquiry into Joseph Muscat and other ministers’ role in the Vitals deal to privatise three state hospitals has been concluded, a court heard on Tuesday.
 Attorney General Victoria Buttigieg must now analyse the inquiry and the 78 boxes of evidence it involved, to decide whether or not to file criminal charges against people named in it.
 Muscat, who has spent the past year battling the inquiry, described it as a personal “vendetta” and accused the magistrate leading it, Gabriella Vella, of waging war against himself and the Labour Party.
 “The institutions are working – working against Labourites,” Muscat said in a press conference on Tuesday afternoon. He said he had “no doubt” he would face criminal charges as a result of the probe, but said he had nothing to fear.
 “If justice exists, I will be a free man and then receive compensation for damages suffered,” he says. “I know I did nothing wrong.” 
  Prime Minister Robert Abela also criticised the timing of the inquiry conclusions, which he said appeared to have been timed to damage the party’s campaign for the June 8 MEP elections.
 Abela said he wanted the inquiry conclusions to be made public “for the sake of transparency"" - a request made by NGO Repubblika, who triggered the probe in 2019, following Tuesday's court session. 
 Opposition leader Bernard Grech said both Muscat and Abela were determined to block the wheels of justice from turning.
 “They are attacking our country’s institutions, because they are working,"" Grech said in a video message. ""Justice must be done whether you are the prime minister, an ex-prime minister or a regular citizen."" 
 The inquiry’s contents are secret and it is up to Attorney General Victoria Buttigieg to decide whether or not to publish the inquiry’s proces verbal, its conclusions or nothing at all. When Muscat faced another inquiry into alleged criminal behaviour, regarding Panama company Egrant, then-Attorney General Peter Grech had published most of that inquiry’s conclusions.
 
 The Vitals inquiry began in 2019 and was tasked with assessing whether Muscat or his government’s ministers committed any crimes in relation to the hospitals deal.
 Signed by Muscat’s government, that deal saw a newly-formed company, Vitals Global Healthcare, handed a multi-million contract to run three state hospitals. Vitals subsequently sold the concession to US healthcare giant Steward.
 But in 2023, a court annulled the deal, saying it was tainted by fraud and that the concessionaires had not fulfilled their contractual obligations. A court of appeal went further, saying it appeared top government officials had colluded against the national interest.
 In parallel to that civil case, a magistrate was investigating the role that Muscat and his ministers played in approving the deal. The probe was triggered by a legal request by NGO Repubblika, which initially named ministers Konrad Mizzi, Chris Cardona and Edward Scicluna in its legal request for investigation.
 That probe was subsequently broadened, and in January 2022 police raided Muscat’s home and office, seizing documents and devices as part of the probe.
 One year later, Times of Malta revealed that Muscat had  received tens of thousands of euro from a company linked to Vitals and Steward. He says the money was for consultancy work he did for them, unrelated to the hospitals deal.
 But after that report, Muscat began a year-long legal battle to have the magistrate leading the inquiry taken off the case. He has said that Vella’s relatives posted comments critical of him on Facebook, and that various leaks related to the inquiry meant he could not trust the magistrate leading it.  
 When his first legal bid to have Vella recused failed, his lawyers filed a second one.
 On Tuesday, a court hearing that case was told that the inquiry was concluded on Thursday, April 24 and sent to the attorney general’s office the next day.
 The timing coincided with the opening of nominations for candidates to contest June’s MEP elections. Both Muscat and Abela pounced on that and said it was no coincidence.
 “It’s a totally vitiated process,” Muscat said at a press conference. But when asked to state why he believes the magistrate has a conflict of interest, Muscat demurred.
 “Ask her, not me,” he said.
 The former prime minister also said he now regretted having sacked his then-deputy leader Anġlu Farrugia in late 2012, after he made similar criticism of a different magistrate.
 “I probably moved too fast,” Muscat said. “I now understand where Anġlu was coming from.”

 2.35pm Muscat is asked to spell out why Magistrate Gabriella Vella has a conflict of interest in this case. 
 “You should ask her,” he says, curtly. “I wouldn’t even recognise her if she was seated here right now.” 
 He says that while he disagreed with the Daphne Caruana Galizia public inquiry’s conclusions, “I respected them.”
 “In this case, it’s a totally vitiated process,” he says.
 2.28pm Muscat is asked if he fears ending up behind bars.
 “If justice exists, I will be a free man and then receive compensation for damages suffered,” he says. “I know I did nothing wrong.” 
 The press conference is ongoing.
 2.20pm Back in 2012, when he was still Opposition leader, Muscat had  sacked his deputy leader Anġlu Farrugia after he called a magistrate partisan. Now he’s the one attacking the judiciary. 
 Muscat says he regrets that decision. “I probably moved too fast,” he says in reply to a question. “I now understand where Anġlu was coming from.” 
 2.15pm Muscat says he has “no doubt” he will be criminally charged, because people who leaked information about the inquiry have said so. 
 “I have no doubt it will happen. We’re braced for it, but we’re coming out fighting.” 
 The press conference is ongoing. 
  2.09pm In a press conference at the Hotel Excelsior, Muscat repeated his arguments about the inquiry being politically motivated. 
 He noted that his house was raided by police a few months before the general election and that the inquiry was now concluded weeks before the MEP elections. 
 “Just as the Egrant inquiry exonerated me completely, the same will happen here. I know what I did and didn’t do,” Muscat said.  ""Me and my family are at peace.""

  By law, it is the attorney general [Victoria Buttigieg] who is empowered to make that call. 
 There is precedent for the AG’s office doing so: in 2018, the AG had published conclusions [albeit not all of them] of the Egrant inquiry, which also involved Joseph Muscat. 
 1.50pm  In a Facebook post, lawyer Jason Azzopardi claims his sources within the Office of the Prime Minister tell him the inquiry conclusions are ""unprecedented"".
 ""No wonder they were terrified... they're going to need a bigger hall than the one of Palermo in its process against the Mafia in 1986. Our courts are too small,"" he wrote.
  1.45pm In a brief statement, Bernard Grech slammed Abela for lashing out at the magistrate responsible for the inquiry. 
 ""They are attacking our country’s institutions, because they are working,"" Grech said. ""Abela and Muscat first did everything to stop us from taking our hospitals back, and now they are doing all they can to stop those responsible for this theft from paying the price.
 ""Justice must be done if you are the prime minister, an ex prime minister or a regular citizen."" 
 1.35pm PN leader Bernard Grech will soon give a statement about today's developments. Watch it live in the video below. 
  1.10pm Repubblika wants the inquiry conclusions to be made public. Aquilina emphasises that they are asking for the conclusions, not the entire inquiry, to be published. 
 “If crimes were committed, every single Maltese citizen was a victim,” he says. “We will not allow the attorney general and police to act as obscenely as they did in the Pilatus case,” he adds. 
 That is a reference to another inquiry which recommended criminal charges against several Pilatus Bank officials. The AG and police opted to press charges against just one, then tried to have that case heard in secret. 
 1.05pm Repubblika's Robert Aquilina is speaking to reporters outside court. Watch it live in the video below. 
  1pm Joseph Muscat did not answer questions as he exited court. Instead, he told reporters that he will be holding a press conference at 2pm at the Excelsior Hotel. 
  12.50pm After more than an hour of legal arguments, the judge calls time on the hearing. He minutes all the arguments presented by each side, and adjourns the case to May 9 at 1pm. 
 We expect Muscat to make a statement of some sort once he exits court. 
 12.30pm Muscat’s lawyers make it clear: they're pushing ahead with their bid to have the inquiring magistrate recused. 
 ""Now that the inquiry is wrapped up, do we simply say 'what’s done is done' and ignore the applicant’s breach of rights?,"" Galea asks somewhat rhetorically. 
 “God forbid if we reach a situation where the State breaches a person’s rights and is allowed to proceed…. The court can revert back to any prior stage when the rights were not yet breached,” Galea tells the court.
 12.24pm Labour acolyte Jason Micallef says the news that emerges from court today proves that Robert Abela was right to say the inquiry is politically motivated. 
 ""Four-and-a-half years to conclude an inquiry, and it's concluded just as an electoral campaign gets underway,"" the former PL general secretary writes. ""I stand with Joseph Muscat."" 
  12.10pm 
 The lawyers are still wrangling, but here’s the gist of each respective position.
 Muscat’s lawyers: The AG has a document that is of great interest and relevance to our client. He has a right to see it, as caselaw proves. He needs to see it before arguing his case for the interim measure. How can we rebut arguments if we do not have their source? 
 State advocate lawyer:To get what he wants, Muscat wants the court to order the AG to break the law. The law is the law, and that means Muscat must file his request once the paperwork is deposited in the court registry. The AG has 78 boxes of evidence to sift through. That will take time. The caselaw cited by Muscat’s lawyers is not relevant to this case. 
 There’s also another point being made by the state advocate’s lawyer: he wants to know if Muscat is still asking for the inquiry to be brought to a halt, given that the proces verbal has been concluded. 
 11.54am Back in court, lawyers from each side are arguing over whether or not Muscat is entitled to request a copy of the inquiry. 
 We won't bore you with all the legal arguments they're making, though we will summarise each side's position once they are done. 
 11.45am Reactions are already trickling in. 
 Repubblika's honorary president Robert Aquilina describes news of the inquiry having been concluded as a ""very important step towards justice.""
 Aquilina is in court today. Reminder: it was Repubblika's court action that led to the inquiry in the first place. 
  11.43am As events unfold in court, Muscat sits with his arms crossed, occasionally taking notes on a paper that he keeps in his pocket. 
 11.40am A couple of more details about the inquiry: it involved 78 boxes of evidence and investigations were led by police inspector Wayne Borg. 
 Muscat's lawyers formally ask the Attorney General to present a copy of the inquiry - its proces verbal, to use legal jargon. The State Advocate objects, saying this is not the right forum to file that request. 
 11.38am The Vitals inquiry is finished: it was concluded on Thursday, April 24 and sent to the attorney general’s office on April 25, court registrar Franklin Calleja tells the court. 
 11.35am Judge Giovanni Grixti tells the court that after filing his court case, Muscat also filed another application for an interim measure. Today’s hearing will focus on that request, the judge says. 
 An interim measure is an urgent application asking the courts to suspend an action which the applicant says will cause them serious and irreversible harm. 
 We still don’t know what action Muscat has asked to suspend, though an educated guess would be that he wants the courts to suspend the Vitals inquiry altogether until these proceedings play out. 
 11.30am Muscat is in court, represented by his lawyers Charlon Gouder and Vincent Galea. 
 State Advocate lawyers James D’Agostino and Isaac Zammit are representing the respondents.
 Attorney General Victoria Buttigieg is in court, too. 
 11.20am We caught Muscat as he walked into court. Here's what he told us:
 ""I am afraid of no truth. The truth is that this is all conjecture, a vendetta. As the prime minister said, it's political terrorism.""
  11.15am The judiciary does not have a communications arm and judges and magistrates are not authorised to speak to the press. So we do not know how Robert Abela's words were received. 
 Lawyers, however, have no such restrictions. And the Chamber of Advocates did not hold back. 
 It reminded Abela that he is the prime minister, not just the leader of the Labour Party.  
 “Therefore, he is obliged to weigh his words carefully without undermining the judiciary and its work. The judiciary should be left to work in liberty without interference,” the chamber said. 
 The Nationalist Party said Abela was racked by ""paranoia"" and lashing out at the judiciary as a result. 
 Nationalist MEP David Casa has also written to European Commission Vice President Vera Jourova and to the Council of Europe, to complain about Abela attacking the judiciary.
 ""Malta’s institutions have been intentionally subverted, hijacked and sabotaged so as to ensure impunity for those who abused their power to enrich themselves. It is the judiciary that is the last bastion of democracy, protecting the people of Malta and Gozo and filling the void left by other authorities. Any action or pressure intended to derail their work must necessarily be met with harsh repercussions,"" Casa said in a statement.
 11am For years, Abela avoided commenting on the ongoing Vitals inquiry. Whenever he was asked about it, he would say that he  did not want to influence the investigation with his comments. 
 That all changed last January, when the prime minister abruptly changed tack. The inquiry was taking too long, he said, adding that it would smack of political bias if it were to be concluded in the run-up to the MEP elections. 
  Last Sunday, Abela returned to that point by saying the judiciary was engaging in ""political terrorism"" - a reference to rumours that the completed inquiry was handed to the attorney general on the same day nominations for MEP candidates opened. 
 On Monday, the prime minister doubled down on those comments. 
 10.50am Joseph Muscat was prime minister when the government agreed to lease three public hospitals to a company with no track record in anything, Vitals Global Healthcare.
 Vitals pocketed millions and then exited, selling the concession to US healthcare giants Steward. Years later, a court would annul all those contracts on the basis of fraud.
 Suspicions about the deal prompted rule of law NGO Repubblika to request an inquiry into ministers involved in it.
 In late 2019, a court said there were grounds to investigate. The investigation initially focused on three of Muscat's ministers - Konrad Mizzi, Chris Cardona and Edward Scicluna - but was subsequently broadened to include Muscat himself. 
  In January 2022, police raided Muscat's home and office in connection with the inquiry. 
 We then heard little about the probe until May 2023.
 That month, a Times of Malta investigation revealed how Muscat had received payments from a company linked to Vitals and Steward. Muscat said the payments were for legitimate work he did - and that he wanted a new magistrate to lead the investigation. 
 He has since spent the past year fighting in court to have Magistrate Vella removed. When he lost one case seeking her recusal, he promptly  filed a new one. 
 Which brings us to Tuesday, when that second case will start being heard before Judge Giovanni Grixti.

Aria nightclub owners seek eviction after tenant sub-lets premises to his own company,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/129647/aria_complex_owners_seek_tenants_eviction_for_subletting_premises_to_tenants_company,10-06-2024,002526.png,"The owners of the Aria nightclub in Iklin have asked a court to evict a company which organises events there, alleging it breached its rental contract.
 The alleged breach concerns the subletting of the premises to a third company, owned by the same person – Dominic Micallef – who operates the nightclub.
 Micallef owns the now defunct Tattingers nightclub in Rabat, which he was recently trying to develop into a hotel.
  The company that owns Aria is accusing Micallef of operating from and hosting events at an illegal development, which MEPA is requesting to be removed.
 In an application filed recently before the Rent Regulation Board by Aria’s owners, Martan Limited, against Dominic Micallef and Signature Entertainment Festivals Limited, claiming that DJRL Dance Ltd had leased the property in November 2021 and that since then, it had also carried out a number of illegal works there, which had resulted in enforcement orders.
 Martan Ltd said that it had recently discovered that DJRL Dance had also sublet the premises to Signature Entertainment Limited.
 Despite having previously bound itself to remove the illegal structures, DJRL Dance had failed to do so and had obstructed Martan when it had attempted to do so itself, reads the application, which was signed by lawyers Franco Galea and Chantel Muscat.
 As a result of this, Martan are requesting the termination of the lease and filed separate court proceedings requesting a pronouncement to that effect. They are also asking that DJRL Dance be evicted from Martan’s property.
 Micallef and another group of companies that he is linked to are also the subjects of a separate case filed by Seasport Ltd, which is seeking €1,270,000 from Micallef’s SEG Concessions Limited, in connection with the sale of the Mambo Beach Club in Armier.
 In the Seasport case, the plaintiffs allege that SEG Concessions was diverting the takings of the Beach Club operation to its sister companies, shifting funds from one company to another to avoid paying privileged creditors. The court is being asked to “lift the corporate veil” of SEG Concessions Ltd, SEG MBO Ltd and SEG Holdings Ltd and put aside the companies’ separate juridical personalities to observe that Micallef is the sole beneficial owner of them all.

"Ukrainian mother, daughter win legal battle over revocation of temporary humanitarian protection",maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/132522/ukrainian_mother_daughter_win_legal_battle_over_revocation_of_temporary_humanitarian_protection,30-11-2024,002540.png,"Eleonora Shokur and her daughter Mylana Shokur have successfully overturned the revocation of their humanitarian protection, with a Maltese court ruling that their forced return to Donetsk, Ukraine would endanger their lives and violate their rights. 

 Shokur, her husband, and daughter arrived in Malta in 2014 as refugees from the Donetsk region of Ukraine. Initially denied refugee status, they were granted temporary humanitarian protection. For almost a decade, Shokur lived and worked in Malta whilst paying taxes. 

 Shokur had applied for international protection as regulated by the law on 20 November 2014 and was refused on 6 December 2014. From that decision there was a right of appeal before the International Protection Appeals Tribunal (IPAT) which right of appeal was not used by the applicant. However, the applicant was granted temporary humanitarian protection after the refusal of international protection.  

 In June 2021, the International Protection Agency decided to revoke her protection status, citing that her case no longer merited such support. Shokur’s appeal to the International Protection Appeals Tribunal was dismissed, as the relevant legislation explicitly prohibits appeals against the withdrawal of temporary humanitarian protection. 

 Shokur argued that the lack of an appeal mechanism and the absence of a proper hearing violated her fundamental rights under the European Convention of Human Rights. 

 The court emphasised that the removal of humanitarian protection would force Shokur and her daughter to return to the Donetsk region in Ukraine, where conditions remain uncertain. 

 The judgmenet, handed by Judge Toni Abela, noted “The Court is obliged to consider the best interest of the minor.” Mylana has as spent most of her life in Malta.  The court ordered that their previous protection status be reinstated until the situation in Ukraine stabilises to ensure their safety. The ruling also mandated the return of their identity documents. 

 The court criticised the lack of procedural safeguards in the decision to withdraw protection, describing the measure as inconsistent with Malta’s policies supporting Ukraine amid the ongoing conflict. Citing European Court of Human Rights precedents, the judgment stressed that compelling a settled minor to return to a dangerous environment would breach her rights. 

 The decision annuls the 2021 revocation of protection and reinstates Shokur and her daughter’s previous status. The court ordered this protection to remain effective until Ukraine’s situation “stabilises and not serve as a danger” to the claimant Shokur, and especially her daughter.      ",Jordan Pace ,court_and_police

 Courier Emmanuel Sank, 44, from Birkirkara was arraigned under arrest before magistrate Rachel Montebello on Thursday, accused of aggravated theft, criminal damage, uttering insults and threats and misusing telecommunications equipment.
  Police Inspector Francesca Calleja, prosecuting together with lawyer Nadia Ciappara from the Office of the Attorney General, told the court that a report had been filed at the Birkirkara police station on 4 September, by a man who had found signs of forced entry at his office, and €850 missing from a cash box.
 Analysis of CCTV footage from the office showed the thief breaking down the door and taking the money, before trying to disconnect the CCTV system’s wiring.
 Sank, who is an employee at the same company, was identified from the footage, said the inspector, adding that the police had also received a recording of a subsequent phone call made by the defendant to the victim in which threats had been made.
 After obtaining a warrant for Sank’s arrest, police officers had knocked on the door of his residence, but he was not at home. Instead, the police had called Sank’s number and instructed him to go to the Hamrun police station, where he was subsequently arrested.
 The defendant pleaded not guilty to the charges. Lawyer Mark Busuttil, appointed as legal aid counsel for the arraignment, requested bail, which was subsequently granted, secured by a €500 deposit and a €3,000 personal guarantee.  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police

Court orders Identità officials to be investigated over conflicting testimony,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/130378/court_orders_identit_officials_to_be_investigated_over_conflicting_testimony,23-07-2024,002552.png,"A magistrate has ordered the police commissioner to investigate two officials from government agency Identità after they gave conflicting testimony in court.
 The officials appeared as witnesses in proceedings against an Egyptian man who is accused of giving false information to obtain a residency permit in Malta. The Egyptian man, Moustafa Ata Moussa Darwish, had falsely told the agency he was married to a British woman. Darwish was issued a permit in March 2023 but the residency card was revoked on police orders last month.
 Chief information officer Stefano Rodoligo said he had asked an official from the Expats section at Identità to search for the file in the agency’s archives.
 Rodoligo testified that Isaac Micallef, from the Expats section, had personally taken the requested file to his office. The file contained documentation related to the accused’s application for a permit as a non-EU family member.
 Rodoligo’s testimony raised eyebrows with the magistrate asking him whether he was sure of what he was saying. Just before Rodoligo, Micallef had told the court that he found no trace of the file on the agency system or in the archives.
 The court then ordered Micallef to reiterate what he had said in the presence of Rodoligo. Micallef again confirmed that he had not found the file he had been tasked to look up a week ago. Micallef had been given a list of names to look up.
 Woman denies being married to accused
 Another witness was an English woman, who was supposedly married to the accused. She said that in 2022 an official from Identity Malta, as the agency was known then, called to ask her whether she had sponsored any family member to take up residence in Malta.
 She denied the claim via email and heard nothing else until receiving a more recent call from Inspector Lara Butters from the police Immigration Unit, who asked whether she was married and whether she had ever travelled to Egypt or had Egyptian relatives.
 The woman testified that she had nothing to do with any Egyptian nationals, denying ever being married to the accused.
 This case, like two others in which Egyptian men admitted guilt and were sentenced to six months in prison, came to light after an internal investigation by Identità’s Compliance Unit.
 The case was then passed on to the police for further investigation.
 Former official inputted application details in computer
 Under oath, Butters confirmed the residence permit was issued on false premises by speaking to the woman because there was no file at Identità. She testified that there was only an application on the computer.
 Pressed by the defence lawyer, Butters conceded that Identità official, Maria Spiteri, who used to work at the agency’s expatriates section, inputted application details on the computer system.
 Of note is the fact that in replies to questions by MaltaToday Identità had refrained from saying whether its internal investigation into the racket had flagged wrongdoing by its own officials. The agency would only say that it is cooperating with an ongoing police investigation.
 Inspector Hubert Gerada testified that Darwish entered Malta irregularly in August 2018 as part of a group of 59 people rescued at sea. He had no personal documents but only a Samsung mobile phone. Nonetheless, in June 2022, Darwish travelled to Istanbul with an Egyptian passport and a Maltese residence permit.
 A representative from the International Protection Agency said that the accused’s application for asylum status was rejected and was still subject to appeal.
 The accused’s residence permit was revoked after it turned out that it was allegedly obtained by means of a false declaration.
 The court upheld a request for bail with the owner of a barber shop where Darwish was regularly employed, stepped in as guarantor. The accused’s employer was to secure a €5,000 third-party guarantee over and above a €10,000 personal guarantee binding the accused.
 Inspector Lara Butters and Christian Abela prosecuted. Lawyers Nicholas Mifsud and Tiziana Micallef appeared for Darwish. The case continues.  ",Kurt Sansone ,court_and_police

Man accused of trying to bite police officer after nightclub drug bust,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/man-accused-trying-bite-police-officer-nightclub-drug-bust.1092127,05-08-2024,002557.png,"A 29-year-old man was remanded in custody on Wednesday after a court heard how he tried to bite the police officer who was trying to arrest him after allegedly catching him with drugs in a Ta' Qali nightclub. 
 Sebastian Fiedler, an oil rig worker from Żabbar, was arraigned in front of Magistrate Joseph Gatt accused of possessing cocaine, ecstasy and ketamine that was not for his personal use, violently resisting arrest and breaching bail conditions set out in a previous case, amongst others. 
 He pleaded not guilty to the charges. 
 Police inspector Francesca Calleja told the court that the incident occurred in May at a nightclub where police doing an inspection spotted the accused acting suspiciously. 
 As he noticed the officers approaching him, the accused dropped a sachet with traces of white powder and a €50 note from his hands to the floor, she continued. 
 This prompted the police to search and arrest Fiedler, during which he allegedly violently resisted the officers and attempted to bite one of them. 
 He was subsequently taken to the Birkirkara police station where a search of his person revealed four sachets of a substance thought to be cocaine, one sachet full of pink powder suspected to be ketamine and 24 pills of suspected ecstasy. Some €460 in cash was also found on his person.
 Calleja said she was subsequently informed that Fiedler is restricted under bail conditions in a separate case and police decided to search his home in Żabbar. 
 There, police found a butterfly knife and a switchblade, which are illegal to own in Malta. 
 As the police and the defence went over the circumstances of the arrest, some confusion arose as to whether the drugs retrieved from the accused were found on his person or not. 
 Lawyer Franco Debono said that according to his Fiedler, the sachets and pills were found on the floor of the nightclub, where many other people were. 
 But Calleja vehemently denied this version of events, insisting that the substances found had been pulled out of Fiedler’s pockets by the police. 
 “He dropped the first sachet, which only contained traces, to the ground and started to push it with his foot,” she said. 
 “It was when he was escorted to the police station that he was searched properly and the drugs were found on him,” Calleja added, as Fiedler shook his head in the negative. 
 A request for bail was objected to by the prosecution, who said that the seriousness of the charges was underscored by the fact it was committed at a place frequented by youths.
 Furthermore, the man had been accused of a crime while under separate bail conditions, proving he was not trustworthy or able to abide by set conditions, particularly when he tried to injure a police officer, Calleja said. 
 Debono countered by saying that, while the defence was still contesting the manner in which the drugs were found, the amounts were nonetheless small and Fiedler had not been accused of trafficking. 
 He also pointed out that between his arrest and arraignment on Wednesday, the police had seen fit to grant the accused police bail while they continued to investigate and he had no problem abiding by conditions set during this time. 
 “Here the court has concrete proof that when he was trusted by the police inspector with police bail, he obeyed,” Debono said. 
 Fiedler, he said, has successfully completed drug court after getting into trouble with the law a few years ago. Since then he had completely turned his life around, having a job a stable relationship and a child, Debono said.
 The knives found in his possession, Debono continued, once belonged to the accused’s Swiss father, who collected Swiss knives. They had been found under Fiedler’s bed where they had been for many years. 
 Debono also pointed out there were no civilian witnesses to testify in this case and all evidence had already been captured by police body cams. 
 After hearing submissions, the court decided that, due to the nature of the crimes, it would be too early to grant Fiedler bail. He rejected the request and remanded him in custody. 
 He also granted a protection order in favour of the police officer involved in the arrest.

 Magistrate Rachel Montebello issued the so-called prima facie decree at the end of today’s sitting as the compilation of evidence against the disgraced former Prime Minister, former minister Mizzi and former OPM Chief of Staff Keith Schembri, who form part of the group of 14 persons and nine companies facing criminal charges, amongst them corruption, fraud, conspiracy and money laundering,  in connection with the sale of three State hospitals to Vitals Global Healthcare. 
  The sale had been declared fraudulent by the courts and struck down in 2023, Earlier this year, the conclusions of a magisterial inquiry that had been launched in 2019 following an application by Repubblika, had recommended that they be prosecuted. 
 All of the defendants are pleading not guilty to the charges.  
 Sciacca Grill, one of the companies, was discharged although this does not preclude the possibility of further investigations leading to criminal charges in the future.  
 According to prosecutor Francescao Refalo, Sciacca Grill – once owned by former chief of staff Keith Schembri – had received a number of contracts to supply another catering company that had been supplying the hospitals in the PPP. “We are saying that these companies were taking a percentage of the money coming from the concession. They were skimming money off the concession,” Refalo said. 
 His argument was rebutted by Sciacca’s defence lawyer Franco Debono. “God forbid we reduce prima facie to this methodology. I did not hear a single mention of a page number, or a piece of evidence. Is this the examination that must be carried out to establish prima facie?” 
 Veronique Dalli, defence lawyer for Taumac – the company which had sold its shares in MTrace to the Vitals concession via Vitals Procurement Ltd in Jersey – submitted to the magistrate that the prosecution’s suspicion in her client was insufficiently based on one witness only. “Between April and today, someone had investigated and decided there were sufficient grounds to press charges... The prosecution is saying that Taumac should have suspected that someone recommended by the Maltese state [was committing criminal offences].” 
 Dalli said the court was right in saying that at this stage it was only empowered to establish whether there is a case to answer. “But is it not possible or probable for Taumac to sell its shares at no profit, so as not to lose its investment... is there anything extraordinary or out of the ordinary that a company tries to recoup its investment, especially when the government is telling it to leave the deal to be replaced by another company recommended by the government?” 
 Lawyer Chris Cilia, for MTrace, added that the inquiry experts who assisted the magisterial inquiry “had arrived at a certain narrative”, accusing them of ‘creating’ the storyline. 
 “Completely gratuitous assertions which make no sense... and had they taken the initiative of hearing what Dr Josie Muscat had to say, they would have realised that this narrative is nothing but a fairytale,” the lawyer said with respect to accusations levied against MTrace on its acquisition of a cyclotron machine, through money loaned by VGH. 
 The company was sold off to government investment arm Malta Enterprise in 2020. 
 Cilia queried where the crime of money laundering against MTrace arose from. “The conclusion seems to be that from day one, VGH was the actual owner of MTrace and the cyclotron. This could have easily been dispelled had they sent for Josie Muscat. In four years, they had not and so this leads to some doubts taking root.” 
 Arthur Azzopardi took to task the way the inquiry experts had worded their suspicions on defendant Brian Bondin. “On Brian Bondin, there is no appendix in the inquiry. All that is mentioned in the conclusions, the experts only say it is in the realm of possibility... ‘potential fraud.’” 
 He derided the experts’ stated definition of legal terms, such as fraud, as being ‘Wikipedia’-type definitions. “The use of the word ‘potential’ with regards to MTrace, is always less than probable, which is required for prima facie... what the experts aren’t doing is that, apart from the concession agreement itself, there is a number of other specific agreements.” 
 He attacked the expert’s contention that the government funds paid to the private concession companies, were somehow the State’s. “When it was paid, it no longer remained public funds. The moment the money became theirs, it is theirs to decide how to use it.”  
 “I want to be clear. The problem is not the fault of the inquiring magistrate. The problem is how the experts worked it out and then reported to the magistrate.” 
 By way of example, Azzopardi said that the experts claimed MTrace’s expenditure was €1.2 million one year, the next €2.5 million, and then extrapolated a €600,000 sum for Brian Bondin. He said there was nothing else in the inquiry to buttress this argument. “If what the experts are saying is true, the question arises as to why the person involved in the raising of fraudulent invoices, was not charged.” 
 Another defence lawyer, Jason Grima, made submissions on behalf of Crossbow audit employee, Jonathan Vella, who is also accused of money laundering, fraud, and falsification of documents. “Who is this Jonathan Vella? He is a simple accounts clerk working for auditor Christopher Spiteri.” 
 Grima said Vella was merely a company secretary for the Vitals holding company Bluestone. “I don’t think that merits him being charged... Vella did not choose to be a company secretary. His job is to do secretarial work and had done this job for decades, even with a previous employer.” 
 Grima also said the inquiring magistrate had not explained on what grounds he was being accused. “Nobody sent for him. Not the police, not the magistrate and not the experts. So Jonathan Vella’s testimony was not heard by anyone. It appears that they charged him without speaking to him first.”

Teenager fighting for his life after falling two storeys in Paceville construction site,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/130446/teenager_fighting_for_his_life_after_falling_two_storeys_in_paceville_construction_site,28-07-2024,002587.png,"A 16-year-old boy is fighting for his life after falling two storeys after entering a construction site in Paceville. 
 The incident happened at around 11:30pm in Triq Ball, St Julian's.
 Preliminary investigations show that the young man entered the construction site and fell down two storeys.
 Last June, a French woman had sustained grievous injuries after she entered a construction site just metres away from Saturday's accident site, and fell down one and a half storeys.
 A medical team and workers from the Civil Protection Department assisted the victim and he was taken to Mater Dei Hospital, where he would later be certified as having sustained serious injuries.

Second Vitals case ends up in legal limbo; AG admits there's no police report,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/live-blog-fearne-scicluna-court-second-day-hospitals-scandal-case.1093157,30-05-2024,"002611.png,002612.png,002613.png,002614.png,002615.png,002616.png,002617.png,002618.png,002619.png,002620.png","Two former senior ministers and three permanent secretaries faced charges in connection with the hospitals scandal on Wednesday, but a marathon 11-hour sitting is expected to be nullified after one of the accused was absent from the court room.
 Former health minister Chris Fearne and Central Bank governor Edward Scicluna led a list of 14 officials charged with 'lesser crimes' as the hospitals debacle reaches a critical phase. All pleaded not guilty.
 But an 11-hour sitting ended in disbelief after it transpired that one of the defendants representing DF Advocates was not notified about the proceedings.
 The long session in court also confirmed that the prosecutions were relying on the strength of the magisterial inquiry into the hospitals debacle and there was no police report to back the findings. 
 Several senior government officials sat as they saw a series of defence lawyers tear into the prosecution's arguments though the court ruled that was admissible.
 11pm Repubblika honorary president Robert Aquilina and lawyer Jason Azzopardi pin the blame of Wednesday's court debacle squarely on the shoulders of police commissioner Anġlu Gafa’ and Attorney General Victoria Buttigieg.
 ""If you mess up the judicial process, we will hold you personally responsible,"" read a Facebook post at the end of the proceedings.
  10.15pm The prosecution exhibits the notices for one of the accused - DF Advocates. The magistrate observes that the individuals were notified in their personal capacity. In terms of legal procedure, that meant the entity itself was absent from today’s hearing. This meant that one of the accused was not served notice for these proceedings with all the legal consequences that this carries.
 And consequently, the case was being deferred to June 11 at 11am for the court to proceed according to law.
 Debono warns that there will be legal consequences.
 De Marco adds: ""The legal consequences are nullity. Let's state facts as they are.""
 The magistrate turns to the prosecution and gives them a dressing down.
 ""I would expect the prosecution to have told the court that DF Advocates was not notified at 11am. You chose to press charges. Now it’s you to decide what to do. Had you told the court first thing this morning all would be home with their families by now!""
 This impacts Wednesday's proceedings and not Tuesday's.
 10.10pm Debono informs the magistrate that the Chamber of Advocates just issued a directive that they are to work till 10pm.
 ""Was this a general directive or just for this case,"" asks the magistrate.
 ""No, for this case.""
 The chamber directed the lawyers not to proceed further with the case because they cannot assist their clients to the best of their abilities. (spare a thought for those poor journalists who have been covering this for longer!)
 The magistrate takes note and asks the defence to stay on for a further 30 minutes simply to close the chapter of prosecution exhibiting the notices of service.
 9.50pm The atmosphere inside court is surreal. We have been stuck inside hall 22 with former political heavyweights and senior civil servants for 11 hours and we still don’t know how it will end.
 Could the whole case be declared null? It's unlikely but the defence are pushing and pushing.
 And the prosecution are defending their case as best as they can.
 Our court reporter and lawyer Edwina Brincat says she has rarely seen a sitting like this. 
 9.40pm Debono asks who was served notice on behalf of DF Advocates.
 Good question, says the magistrate.
 ""There was no notice of service of summons as such,"" says the AG lawyer. Farrugia and the two Deguaras were notified. 
 But the magistrate points out that prosecution chose to charge DF Advocates as an entity. And Kenneth Deguara is charged as CFO.
 ""We’re alleging that funds flowed through that company.""
 Debono says that if the prosecution goes ahead and insists on a €20 million freezing order they’re exposing the state to a €20 million damages claim.
 Legal ping-pong continues
 9.35pm Debono says that proceedings were dragged out because of mistakes by the prosecution. The magistrate blocks that line of argument.
 It's 9.30pm and the prosecution has again asked for a correction of the charges, stresses Debono.
 It's a never-ending game of legal ping-pong in the court room. 
 9.05pm There's palpable tension in the court room. 
 At one point someone in the room claps. 
 The magistrate wants to know who clapped. Nobody answers.
 ""Who clapped?"" he repeats.
 Nobody volunteers.
 8.55pm Most people in the crowded court room are clearly tired and getting jittery now. Do you blame them? They've been stuck there for almost 10 hours. 
 And many outside of that court room are starting to fear this session will go down in legal history for all the wrong reasons. 
  8.45pm  The magistrate returns.
 So on what legal basis did the prosecution charge DF Advocates, which is just a trade name? AG cited article 121D. The court ordered DF advocates to answer personal details but the question about the plea will not be put to any individual. So it’s DF Advocates only, with no plea at this stage.
 The legal team asks the court to consider withdrawal of the charges against it, the same way they were withdrawn in respect of another entity. 
 Refalo declared that the prosecution was not going to withdraw the charges.
 After a pause, Refalo returns to the court room to say DF Advocates is represented in court today. And there are three persons who may represent it.
 So the AG will not withdraw the charges against DF Advocates.
 8.11pm Lawyer Ezekiel Psaila points out that DF Advocates is the trade name.
 ""So how did the prosecution conclude who is to represent it?""
 The company is the last one on the charge sheet.
 Refalo says that DF Advocates are a corporate body. But the defence ask him to substantiate that.
 It’s a trade name. It’s not a corporate body. So who does the AG expect to answer to the criminal charges? A corporate body is a state of fact. It implies a CEO for instance. On what basis did AG issue this charge?
 Refalo says there is evidence that funds flowed through this firm. He doesn’t wish to go into the merits. But whether a trade name or anything else, someone must answer, Refalo argues.
 The magistrate again walks out. 
 8pm We finally got to the plea stage of the arraignment - all those charged plead not guilty. 
 Chris Fearne, 61, surgeon 
 Edward Scicluna, 77, Governor of Central Bank
 Ronald Mizzi, 41, permanent secretary
 Alfred Camilleri, 64, pensioner
 Joseph Rapa, 57, public official
 Kenneth Deguara, 44, employee
 Kevin Deguara, 47, lawyer
 Jean Carl Farrugia, 48, lawyer
 Deborah Anne Chappell, 37, lawyer
 Bradley Gatt, 43, lawyer
 Aron Mifsud Bonnici, 50, lawyer
 James Camenzuli, 53, engineer
 Manuel Castagna, 50, accountant
 Robert Borg, 50, auditor
 7.48pm Refalo from the AG's office counters that all accused had the 1,200-page report and so, none of them suffered breach of rights.
 The magistrate says that at this stage the process verbal cannot be exhibited because the personal examination of the accused has not yet been done and the prosecution has not yet exhibited its evidence.
 Tonna Lowell says that he and his clients read all 1,200 page-report and they “still don’t know why they’re here.”
 7.45pm ""Please stand,"" the magistrate tells the accused. 
 But no. Lawyer David Farrugia Sacco speaks for the first time and wants a constitutional reference too.
 ""There was nothing to replace the missing police report. That report was substituted by the process verbal but that process verbal is not exhibited in these proceedings,"" he says.
 The magistrate tells the accused to sit down again.
 ""Let me make it clear. This sitting will come to an end today. Be it at 10pm or later,"" says the magistrate.
 Farrugia Sacco, on behalf of James Camenzuli, minutes that the process verbal is missing and his request for a constitutional reference is not frivolous or vexatious. The prosecution rebuts. 
 7.40pm The AG and police should not have reached this stage with the charges simply because they relied on the process verbal.
 ""They should have investigated too to see if they agreed before issuing charges. The AG and police should have consulted before issuing such serious accusations against persons with an untainted criminal record,"" de Marco says.
 The inspector is called back in. He says that he got the 1,200 page inquiry and the magistrate’s conclusions where she said what charges were to be pressed.
 Since the police officer declared on oath that the inquiry report served as the basis for the charges, the court deems that the dictates of law were satisfied. 
 7.30pm De Marco asks if the action to prosecute was simply taken based on the final part of the inquiry and that he didn’t see the evidence.
 Magistrate says that the purpose of that question is not permissible at this stage. Question disallowed.
 Lawyer Galea insists: ""What led the prosecutor to issue those charges? I feel that that is a legitimate question.""
 Lawyer Filletti adds: ""we're circumventing the whole system. They just gave them the final part of the inquiry and told them to issue charges. At this point, we’re going to ask for discharge (liberatorja). The court cannot proceed.""
 7.25pm De Marco asks the police inspector which part of the inquiry did the police base their actions on - simply the conclusive part? 
 Tension is mounting in the court room. The prosecutors stand - and the magistrate tells them to stop.
 As the bickering continues, the inspector is asked to go out because such arguments cannot be made in presence of a witness. The magistrate is calling for order. 
 7.22pm Inspector Wayne Borg is asked to take the witness stand to explain.
 He is asked what he based his charges on. His reply: ""the inquiry"".
 Borg says that neither he nor any other officer involved in the investigation drew up a report.
 7.15pm Refalo from the AG's office admits there is no police report on the Vitals case, which have led to the charges.
 The defence lawyers pounce on that and in chorus they say: ""please minute that"".
 Refalo explains that there was no police report because there was a magisterial inquiry.
 De Marco steps in: ""The law of procedure makes that report a mandatory requirement. It says 'charges and police report. Not either or'.""
 Debono adds: ""if you choose to charge 16 persons, you must give an account for each. The inspector must explain. We're not talking about a ghost here.""
 7.02pm Debono intervenes: ""people are being charged haphazardly and then when we ask the prosecution or the police to explain, they don’t.
 ""We’re down on our knees begging for an explanation,"" says Debono.
 ""They should be eager to come here and say why they are charging these individuals, what emerged in the investigations. But no, their reluctance is telling.""
 7pm But before the personal details, Filletti points out that the law says that first the court must have the police report. He cites another article of law. 
 ""So we need the police report besides the reading out of the charges,"" wraps up Filletti. 
 The magistrate minutes that request and all the defence adheres to the same request. 
 AG lawyer Refalo stands up to rebut: “Your honour, I don’t know if my learned colleagues wish to remain here till midnight.”
 “As long as necessary,” the defence hits back. 
 Refalo says that since there was a magisterial inquiry there’s no need for the police report. The investigation leading to these proceedings was the magisterial inquiry. 
 Secondly, this request is untimely. Article 391 lays down that procedure but the prosecution will be following the wording of the law in due course. 
 After the personal details of the accused, the evidence will be produced, says Refalo.
 ""The prosecution is telling us without actually saying so that they do not have a police report to exhibit,"" says Galea. 
 Giannella de Marco adds: The law says “charges and the report” not “or”.
 ""Their reluctance is concerning. When they press charges under oath, they must know why they are doing so. It’s obvious they don’t know why these persons are charged today. Should we ask the AG to come here to explain? It’s as though none of them know what’s in the inquiry. Charges were based on the conclusions of the inquiring magistrate based on the conclusions of experts,"" says de Marco.
 6.40pm ""Please stand"", the magistrate tells the accused seated in the hall down below.
 He explains their right to silence and the implications of their plea.
 ""Have you understood this warning?""
 The replies are barely audible from the gallery. The magistrate sums up the charges briefly.
 Each will now be asked for their personal details and how they will plead.
 6.35pm Magistrate is back. He says the Criminal Code explicitly lays out the procedure and states what the defendant may do. The process can be challenged if the court does not hear evidence. It does not automatically bring nullity but that may be challenged before the appropriate court. 
 If the defence’s request to question prosecution at this stage is upheld, it would stultify the proceedings. So the request is turned down.
 The case will therefore proceed.
 6.15pm As we wait for the magistrate to emerge, the tug-of-war between the two main parties persist. 
 In a reply to an earlier post by the PN's Karol Aquilina, Justice Minister Jonathan Attard said the PN spokesman and his friends believe it is only him, his relatives and his friends from the ""establishment"" who have a duty to comment. 
  6.05pm Lawyer Franco Galea says the prosecution is muddling things up. The law allows the defence to produce witnesses at any stage of the compilation.
 If the prosecution is not prepared to face questions about the charges it filed on oath, then there will be consequences, he warns.
 The magistrate suspends the session again to deliberate over his decision.
 6pm Lawyer Tonna Lowell says that so far, all that the prosecution has produced are the taxman and two police officers involved in the searches (in reference to Tuesday's sitting).
 He says that once the court turned down their request for cross-examination, the defence has a right to produce its own evidence. And so it needs to put questions to the prosecution as examination-in-chief.
 ""That’s the extent we’ve come to. The prosecution is doing all it can not to expose itself to the consequences of the bad decisions taken. The AG's office issued the charges and we want him to justify them,"" Tonna Lowell says.
 5.50pm The magistrate has rejected the request to cross-examine the prosecutors, sparking protests from the defence lawyers. 
 Tonna Lowell, formerly an AG lawyer, says that the law itself grants the defence right to cross-examine.
 ""And whatever the court decides, with all due respect, unless we know what this inquiry consists of, we’re arguing that this whole compilation will be null.""
 5.40pm Refalo from the AG's office says that cross-examination follows testimony-in-chief and not on the charges read out. The prosecuting officers represent an office and they read out the charges on oath.
 This same issue arose before Magistrate Montebello who decreed along the prosecution's line of argument.
 Magistrate Caruana warns that unless the defence proceeds in an orderly manner, the court will allocate a few minutes to each defence legal team “as is done in other foreign courts after all.”
 Filletti says our criminal code does not exclude cross-examination at this stage.
 5.25pm Laywer Filletti, on behalf of Chappell, Ronald Mizzi, Alfred Camilleri and Joseph Rapa asks the court to allow defence to cross-examine the prosecution officials who read out the charges and confirmed the veracity collectively, namely Francesco Refalo and Shelby Aquilina and AG lawyer Rebekah Spiteri, superintendent Hubert Cini and inspector Wayne Rodney Borg. 
 The defence reminds them that they drew up those charges based on evidence they had in hand. Now they must explain what evidence there was to charge the accused with fraud, how they reached the conclusion of the crimes in respect of Chappell and how they reached moral certainty that a €40 million freezing order was to be issued against her because those were the illicit gains made. 
 Since they confirmed those charges on oath, they were to face cross-examination. 
 5.20pm All officials are charged with fraud, fraudulent gains to the detriment of government. 
 Fearne, Scicluna, Mizzi, Rapa, Camilleri and Chappell are charged with misappropriation.
 Chappell, Kevin and Kenneth Deguara , Farrugia and DF Advocates are charged with money laundering.
 Chappell, Mifsud Bonnici, Castagna, Kevin Deguara and Farrugia are charged with actively participating in an organisation set up for criminal activity.
 Chappell, Kenneth Deguara are also charged with document fraud and falsification of records for VAT purposes. 
 The three permanent secretaries are charged with allegedly committing crimes they were duty bound to prevent.
 The prosecution asked the court to order restitution of all misappropriated funds upon conviction. 
 The requested freezing orders:
 Chappell €40 million, Kevin Deguara: €20 million; Kenneth Deguara: €14 million; Farrugia €20 million; DF Advocates €20 million.
 In case of conviction, the accused can forfeit their professional warrants.
 All prosecuting officers confirm the charges on oath.
  5pm In the meantime, the Nationalist Party has condemned the Justice Minister’s ""attack"" on the prosecutor and called out his behaviour as “unacceptable in a democracy”.
 In a statement, PN justice spokesperson Karol Aquilina said Attard “turned his guns” on the magistrate and prosecutor for their decisions. 
 “This is the first time in our country’s history that we have a Justice Minister who publicly and without any shame, is without any restrain going against the prosecutor and the magistrate who are serving the State in the biggest case of corruption this country has ever seen,” he said.
 He said it is a clear example of Attard not sharing the interest of the State and its institutions but is making himself complicit with Muscat in this “orchestrated attack” against the judiciary and those working for justice in the country.
  Meanwhile, Adrian Delia has urged Edward Scicluna to go, saying he was inflicting huge reputational damage on the country be persisting in staying on as Central Bank governor.
  4.55pm The constitutional reference has been turned down because at this stage the criminal proceedings had not yet got underway. 
 Which means that after almost six hours of legal debates and deliberations, the magistrate asks the prosecution to proceed with reading the charges.
 4.50pm The defence asked for all material evidence before the charges are read out.
 The magistrate turned down that request because the court was not in a position to determine whether the prosecution had given defence all evidence as ordered. And the court couldn’t do so because the inquiry was no longer in the prosecution’s possession.
 Kenneth Deguara’s lawyers immediately asked for a constitutional reference arguing that such lack of evidence breached the accused’s right to a fair hearing. 
 Moreover, if the case went ahead and the prosecution sought a €14 million freezing order, the accused’s fundamental property rights would also be breached. 
 How can the defence challenge that freezing order without having all evidence in hand? 
 The prosecution are saying that this request for a constitutional reference is “totally frivolous and vexatious.”
 It’s for the court to decide now whether this request is frivolous and vexatious.
 ""Is this the state of justice in Malta, an EU member state?"", says Franco Debono.
 4.25pm We are back in session. The magistrate takes his place.
 The magistrate says that at this stage the court denies the defence’s request and orders that the charges are to be read out.
 Franco Debono, on behalf of Kenneth Deguara, immediately informs the court that he was requesting a constitutional reference after having read the full contents of the decree just delivered.
 What does that mean? Well it's complicated. Constitutional references, if granted, will suspend the case until the constitutional issue is actually decided. But it will be the court that will decide whether to go ahead with that. 
 The magistrate has briefly suspended the hearing to give the defence time to discuss. Some of the country's best criminal law brains are now mulling their options.
 3.30pm While we're waiting for the magistrate to emerge, there appears to be a lot of confusion on the interpretation of the court's decision on Tuesday to restrict public statements made by the accused in connection with the hospitals case. 
 Was it a case of a gagging order? Muscat says it is. The justice minister says it is disproportionate. Others say the order is being misinterpreted. We hope to be able to clarify the issue soon. 
  Muscat has just issued a video statement about the matter.
  2.40pm Meanwhile, back in court, the magistrate has retired to deliberate whether the court needs to have all material evidence in hand before the charges are read out.
 The sitting resumes at 3.30pm.
 Just for the record, we've already been more than three hours into this sitting and we've only seen a ping-pong of procedural issues that have stalled the court from even hearing the charges. 
 2.32pm We've had a Prime Minister directly attack a magistrate. Now we've got a Justice Minister turn on a prosecutor. 
 Jonathan Attard has slammed a ""disproportionate"" order that prohibits Joseph Muscat from speaking about the case against him. 
 In a comment on ONE, the minister said that if prosecutors want this ""gagging order"", they should be just as zealous when it comes to investigating leaks related to the case. 
 Interestingly, Attard singled out the prosecutor who requested the gagging order - and did not make any reference to the court, which upheld the request (and could have turned it down).
  2.30pm Debono continues: The prosecution “surprised"" the defence teams yesterday when it was asked to support the request for freezing order.
 ""If the charges are read out today before we get that evidence, the right to fair hearing and to peaceful enjoyment of personal property, will be breached. The situation is urgent and grave,"" says Debono.
 Magistrate: ""So basically you’re saying that unless you have all that evidence you cannot contest the freezing order.""
 ""Precisely,"" says Debono. ""Yesterday the prosecution came here firing a request for millions worth freezing orders and that’s it. Today we are guarding ourselves against a repeat"".
 2.20pm While Malta’s top media outlets are live-streaming the historic court sittings, the proceedings were conspicuously absent from One.
 A social media post by Sandro Mangion, editor of the Labour Party's The Journal and former editor of One, is making the rounds.
 He recalled how on Monday evening, while the court case was still ongoing, he could hear how most of his neighbours were following the court saga on the PN’s television station, Net TV.
 He said he cannot understand how during this moment of upheaval in our country, it is the opposition party's TV station that is giving the people what they are looking for.
 ""This should be the duty of the national broadcaster, which is paid from our taxes,” he said. And for the Labour Party station? Mangion said it was a “missed opportunity” to provide people with a different perspective.
  2.15pm Lawyer Debono tells the court that the suspect's rights are being breached when he is not sent for by the police.
 ""It’s not on to argue that they don’t have a duty to do so. Yes, they do under the umbrella of disclosure. Secondly, in case of money laundering, there’s shifting of the burden of evidence. How can that be if the person is not sent for? The suspect might have some explanation to proffer and waive the suspicion. And thus avoiding being charged in court.""
 2pm The magistrate earlier cautioned that, at this pace, today's case could extend until 2 AM.
 Defence lawyers are systematically challenging the charges against their clients and raising procedural issues, such as disclosure, with no end in sight.
 Meanwhile, outside court, Robert Aquilina from Repubblika accused prime minister Robert Abela of undermining journalists.
 ""He depicts you (journalists), just like magistrates - enemies of the people,"" he said.
 Aquilina said those accused yesterday, including Joseph Muscat, should have been taken in under arrest and not ordered to court via summons. Instead, the former prime minister had a chance to have a rally of support outside court. 
 He accused police commissioner Angelo Gafa and Attorney General Victoria Buttigieg of choosing this path.
 ""Journalists should not have to confront a crowd incited by the prime minister.""
  1.35pm Lawyer Sciriha says his client James Camenzuli was only summoned by the police for three minutes. He was in and out and was given no rights. 
 Lawyer Ezekiel Psaila said his client Castagna was summoned by the inquiring magistrate - he went with his lawyer at the time but the lawyer was not allowed to accompany him inside.
 He was given no indication he was a suspect, no right to silence and was then slapped with a notification of the charges.
 Refalo from the AG's office says that at no stage did the prosecution breach any of the accused’s rights. 
 1.30pm Franco Debono takes centre stage again. Says the court order must be obeyed before the charges are read out, pointing out that some of the accused are facing a freezing order running into millions.
 The law on freezing orders was recently amended and criminal lawyers welcomed that.
 But today we’re still in a state where we have to rebut the prosecution’s request for a freezing order without having all the evidence.
 ""Yesterday we asked the prosecutor to substantiate his request for the freezing order and all he said was 'it’s in those boxes' (of evidence).
 “Fool me once…. today I’m going to guard against that,” says Debono.
 Further down in this blog you will find the amounts of freezing orders the accused are facing. 
 1.15pm Meanwhile, Bernard Grech says the Prime Minister must remove Edward Scicluna from his role as Central Bank governor to ensure the integrity of the Central Bank and the country’s economy.
 “You deserve institutions with clean leadership... We have a governor of the Central Bank who is accused of being part of the biggest fraud our country has ever seen,"" the PN leader says in a Facebook post.
  1.10pm Alfred Camilleri and Deborah Anne Chappell were never spoken to.
 ""No one sent for Camilleri to clarify any doubt that may have existed and he was faced with fraud charge without being given a hearing. As for Chappell, she was spoken to as a suspect with no right to silence or disclosure. She was charged with hiding facts when, as a lawyer, she was bound by professional secrecy.
 Had she been told she was suspect, she would have been freed of that professional secrecy.
 Other defence lawyers are making the same arguments. 
 1.05pm Lawyer Filletti adds the accused who were spoken to - like Ronald Mizzi and Joseph Rapa - were not given the right to a lawyer, the right to silence, and full disclosure.
 This means they were allowed to speak at a stage when they were deemed as 'persons of interest' so much so that today they are inexplicably charged. Had they been given those rights, had they been told about the suspicion in their regard they would have waived such suspicion.
 Also, the inquiry did not attribute any wrong behaviour towards them. They were given no chance to waive any misinterpretation. All that breached their rights, Filletti argues.
 1pm The case resumes. Franco Debono says his clients were not spoken to before these proceedings. As for former permanent secretary Alfred Camilleri he didn’t even know that he was being investigated.
 ""This is an anomalous and exceptional situation. It’s an administrative decision whether to charge persons in courts. We learn from seasoned lawyers that the prosecution is the accused’s best friend. There’s an article of law that the prosecution must bring all evidence both for and against the accused. No one sent for the accused to take their version. In my years of practice, never had I a case when police did not send for a person before charging.""
 He insists that all this must be brought to the court’s attention before the charges are read out. The accused’s rights were breached.
 12.50pm Once again, the police are offering cover for the journalists covering one of the most important legal cases in our history.
 Here's a picture we just snapped outside as journalists get comments from Robert Aquilina and Jason Azzopardi. In reality, it shouldn't be this way. Journalists are merely doing their job. 
  12.20pm The court says that after hearing the arguments by both sides, it deems that article 175 of the COCP is applicable. The law allows the substitution of some court acts.
 What the prosecution asked for does not mean that new proceedings are being filed but only the charge sheet is being substituted. Therefore the court upheld the prosecution’s request and orders substitution.
 The defence requests some time to compare the new charge sheet with the one they had before. The prosecution does not object. The court grants them 20 minutes for this purpose.
 12.12pm Meanwhile, former EU Commissioner John Dalli has taken exception to the fact his picture was included in yesterday’s live blog, showing him leaving (not entering) the court. 
 “I conclude that your cryptic insertion was made to give the impression that I was in any way involved in these proceedings.  This is fake, a continuation of the denigration you have been directing at me,” Dalli claimed. 
 Dalli said he was in court because he was summoned for the umpteenth time in the case which “Angelo Gafa decided to start against him” – dating back to his European Commission scandal. 
 At no point in yesterday’s live blog did we say - or even insinuate - that Dalli was involved in the hospitals court case. The inclusion of the picture runs in parallel to the very nature of a running commentary!
  12pm The magistrate has had enough of the procedural bickering - the charges haven’t even been read out yet.
 Refalo from the AG's office cites the law article 175 of Code of Organization and civil procedure which says that the court may substitute or change an act as long as that change does not alter the merits of the case.
 So today’s charges do not need to go through the registry, he insists.
 Magistrate says that if they keep going on this point “we’ll be here till 2am!”
 Lawyer Franco Galea warns the prosecution: ""it’s up to you what to decide. Your decision will have consequences. This is a matter of public order and if procedure is not followed properly, there will be consequences. Even in ordinary run-of-the-mill arraignments, charges are registered before the hearing.""
 11.55am Lawyer Filletti (counsel to Chappell) points out that the AG is requesting a freezing order for €40 million in his client's regard.
 ""The charge sheet is the alpha and omega of these proceedings… we’re worried that this document is presented here at the sitting, rather than filed in the registry and the accused notified two days beforehand in terms of law.”
 Filletti adds: ""We were only notified of the charges, the new one given to us now and the inquiry report. The AG was hasty. I’m highlighting the sensitivity of this document.""
 The magistrate says the legal debates are sensible and interesting but if no  requests are made, the proceedings will move forward. 
 11.45am Reporters also swarmed around Labour stalwart Jason Micallef as he exited court and headed towards St George’s Square.
 He was asked why he did not also rally supporters behind Chris Fearne and Edward Scicluna on Wednesday, like he did for Muscat on Tuesday. 
 He did not answer. The former PL general secretary, accompanied by MEP candidate Daniel Attard, only said he wanted to go have coffee and asked the reporter whether she cared to sit down for a coffee with him, before walking into a coffee shop.
  We finally have the audio of Chris Fearne's comments to reporters before he walked in to court. 
 The former minister said he is determined to continue defending his integrity and that he took all decisions in the interest of the people and the country, including the decision to resign.
 ""I will defend my name in court, and not on the street,"" he said.
 “I understand that I need to answer for my actions like every other citizen,” he told reporters. 
 He also said he was the one who asked the auditor general to investigate the concession in 2016 - a probe which he said completely exonerated him from all guilt. 
 We have a separate story about his comments.
  11.35am Meanwhile, while lawyers engage in a procedure war inside the court rooms, former Labour minister Evarist Bartolo has published a Facebook post. He warns the PL leadership that people from within the party - who were only interested in personal gain - were ""Labour's worst enemies"".
 Read the story here. 
 11.28am Filletti says they feel worried and irritated by an  article on Times of Malta about charges to be dropped against one of the companies.
 ""If the newspaper had it five days ago, why are we told about it now? It worries me. The whole of Malta saw that story, me too,"" says Filletti.
 11.23am When the inspectors go to retrieve the sheets, there’s reluctance from the defence’s bench. The inspectors insist it’s a court order - the court marshall steps in to calm down the situation.
 ""Are you going to start,"" the magistrate intervenes. 
 We haven’t even got to the reading of charge sheet and the situation is already tensing up.
 Magistrate tells Debono not to raise his voice as the lawyer says it is unacceptable for the prosecution to come with new charges, even out of respect for the court.
 Defence lawyer Michael Sciriha says that never in 40 years of practice did police officers go to take charge sheets away from the defence. 
 11.20am Concern Refalo rebuts no charges were being added in respect of Debono's client, but was removing one of the accused from the list. The company originally facing accusations did not feature anywhere in the inquiry.
 And as for the inquiry, the records cannot be presented again today. In fact, the 78 boxes of evidence are nowhere in the hall.
 Lawyer Filletti chips into the debate and says he is worried.
 ""There’s a new charge sheet and we have to rely on the AG’s word that none of the other charges have changed.""
  11.15am Franco Debono says that everyone may make a mistake but the court is now faced with a new charge sheet.
 ""It's not on that we come here with 78 boxes of evidence and ask for freezing orders expecting the defence to know what’s in them telepathically. That’s the consequence of haste. The AG did not act stubbornly and withdrew the charge. Let’s understand that haste breeds mistakes.
 The magistrate immediately points out that he has not even finished taking the attendance.
 But Debono says that the accused should have been notified anew with the new charge sheet.
 ""It’s not on that AG dictate proceedings. I reserve the right to demand fresh notification of the charges,"" he says.
 11.11am Francesco Refalo from the AG's office say they are filing a new charge sheet because charges were withdrawn in respect of DF Corporate Advisory. The rest of the charges remain unchanged.
 Here's the story we wrote about DF Corporate Advisory - in a nutshell the company had not even been set up when it was alleged to have committed crimes.
 11.10am Fearne and Scicluna are assisted by lawyer Stephen Tonna Lowell.
 Ronald Mizzi is assisted by lawyer Stefan Fillletti.
 Kenneth Deguara is assisted by lawyer Franco Debono.
 Chappell is assisted by Filletti, Roberto Montalto, Meli and Mizzi.
 Mifsud Bonnici is assisted by Giannella de Marco and Charles Mercieca
 11am Our court reporter Edwina Brincat will be reporting from hall 22. Several defence lawyers are gathering to make their case in front of magistrate Leonard Caruana.
 Given the size of the case, the magistrate immediately sets some ground rules. Each accused has a legal team. So one lawyer is to speak at a time for each team. There will be no shouting or speaking over each other - and videos, photos, comments from the public are barred.
 10.55am A small crowd has gathered outside the court and the atmosphere was tense as reporters swarmed around Fearne as he approached the court house from St George’s Square.
 A few supporters surrounded him, applauding him and thanking him for his service to the country. A couple of them heckled reporters who tried to ask questions.
 10.30am Fearne resigned as deputy prime minister and minister on May 10, days after prosecutors filed fraud charges against him related to hospitals scandal.
 He said that despite facing ""injustice"" he had a duty to ""put the people first"", as he also withdrew his nomination as Malta's nominee to the next EU Commission. 
 Scicluna and Fearne are not seen to have played a role in the scandal, and the two were sidelined, but investigators believe they failed to flag and challenge the deal.
 10.20am Compared to Tuesday there's a sparse crowd to welcome the accused - at least so far. Our reporter Daniel Ellul says while the media is in full force on the steps of the courthouse, together with a large police presence, there are few Labour supporters gathered in the square.
 Labour firebrand Manuel Cuschieri who engineered the show of support for Joseph Muscat, is, however, outside the lawcourts. 
  10.16am Edward Scicluna, the former finance minister and Central Bank governor made an early entrance to the court. 
 It's the first time he has spoken about the case.
 He insists that the role of a governor is completely different to that of a minister. He insists his role is governed by strict EU statutes and not by that of a national government. 
 Here's a separate story.
  10.11am Only last Monday, the three top civil servants that the Attorney General is prosecuting over the hospitals deal  insisted she was with them in talks over the concession, and therefore has a conflict of interest.
 In a judicial protest filed in court on Monday afternoon through their lawyers, Alfred Camilleri, Joe Rapa and Ronald Mizzi said they want AG Victoria Buttigieg to reconsider her decision to charge them over the hospitals scandal.
  10.10am All are charged with fraud, fraudulent gains to the detriment of the government 
 Fearne, Scicluna, Mizzi, Rapa, Camilleri and Chappell are charged with misappropriation 
 Chappell, the Deguara brothers, Farrugia and the companies are charged with money laundering.
 Chappell, Mifsud Bonnici, Castagna, Kevin Deguara, Farrugia are charged with actively participating in an organization set up for criminal activity. 
 Chappell, Deguara Kenneth also charged with document fraud and falsification of records for VAT purposes. 
 The three permanent secretaries are charged with allegedly committing crimes they were duty bound to prevent.
 10.05am Chappell: €40 million; Kevin Deguara: €20 million; Kenneth Deguara: €14 million; Jean Karl Farrugia €20 million; Companies €20m each 
 Chappell, the in-house lawyer, faces the highest charges and the highest freezing order of the scandal, even greater than Tuesday's maximum €32 m against David Joseph Meli.

 Christopher Mercieca, 40 and from Santa Venera, was also fined €5,000 for the crime.
 The sentence was handed down during a court hearing on Friday after Mercieca pleaded guilty to shooting and killing the protected bird, a short-toed eagle (Circaetus Gallicus), as well as unlawful possession of a number of protected species, both alive and dead.
 Mercieca was identified as the poacher responsible for that crime through footage provided by third parties, who filmed the incident and alerted the police.
 The police said they received a report on Tuesday evening about the shooting, which took place at around 6:15pm in the limits of Mġarr, Malta.
 Mercieca was arrested later that evening, then released after a few hours.
 Prosecuting inspector Elliot Magro explained that Mercieca was released pending further information from third parties about the alleged incident.
 Footage of the incident was later handed over to the police.
 After viewing that footage, the investigator obtained an arrest warrant which was executed on Thursday.
 On Friday, Mercieca appeared before the court. After consulting his lawyer, Edward Gatt, the defendant registered an admission.
 He confirmed that plea after being warned of the implications by the court and after being given time to reconsider.
 In light of that admission at the earliest possible stage, the court, presided over by Magistrate Jean Paul Grech, stated that the court would not impose an effective jail term but would hand down a fine of €5000 and the immediate revocation of the accused’s hunting licence to the maximum permitted by law.
 The court banned Mercieca from holding any such licence for life.
 He must pay the fine in €150 monthly instalments.

Man taken to court after threatening to 'chop off' his partner's head,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/man-taken-court-threatening-chop-off-partner-head.1098810,30-09-2024,002251.png,"A man who flew into a rage when his partner name-dropped someone else, allegedly grabbing the woman by the hair while threatening to cut off her head, has been denied bail.
 The incident occurred in the very early hours of Sunday when the woman returned home at around 1:30am.
 When she mentioned a “third party” her partner allegedly “went crazy,” explained Inspector Audrey Micallef who pressed charges against the 49-year old Tarxien resident on Monday afternoon.
 The man allegedly grabbed his partner by the hair, dragged her to a balcony and threw a metal ashtray and foodstuffs at her.
 Then making a throat-slitting gesture, he allegedly threatened, “tomorrow I’ll chop your head off.”
 The defendant pleaded not guilty upon arraignment.
 A request for bail was objected to by the prosecution because of the risk of tampering with evidence and the fact that he was under bail conditions in relation to a separate case.
 The prosecutor explained that the woman had wanted to break up and had told the accused to move out of her home. But he refused to leave.
 Defence lawyers Nicholas Mifsud and Andre’ Portelli countered that the defendant had an alternative address and produced his daughter as witness and possible third party guarantor. She briefly took the witness stand to confirm that her father had the keys to her paternal grandparents’ home which was presently vacant. She was willing to step in as third party guarantor for bail purposes.
 But the prosecution objected, explaining that when police went to the alleged victim’s home, her son opened the door.
 When asked about the whereabouts of the defendant, he replied “I don’t know.”
 In actual fact, the suspect was found hiding inside.
 After hearing submissions and after taking note of the circumstances of the case and the defendant’s criminal record, Magistrate Noel Bartolo turned down the request for bail since there was a risk of tampering with evidence, the alleged victim and other civilians were still to testify and also because of the nature of the charges.

Defence lawyers in Vitals corruption case challenge inquiry expert's impartiality,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/131517/defence_lawyers_in_vitals_corruption_case_challenge_inquiry_experts_impartiality,02-10-2024,002254.png,"Updated at 2:49pm with more details
 Defence lawyers representing former prime minister Joseph Muscat and others in the Vitals corruption case have challenged the independence and impartiality of a court expert.
 A court sitting today, was characterised by multiple objections and interruptions as lawyers took aim at Samuel Sittlington, a financial crime expert who was involved in the Vitals inquiry.
 Sittlington, with a background of 20 years as a police officer specialising in economic crime, was called to testify on his involvement in the Vitals inquiry.
  He was appointed as an expert to assist in data gathering and analysis, specifically to locate elements that could aid the magistrate. During cross-examination, the defence lawyers repeatedly interrupted, pointing out his heavy accent, which rendered parts of his testimony inaudible.
 The defence also questioned Sittlington’s qualifications and role within the inquiry. He detailed his position as a liaison between the magistrate and the police, particularly during searches, and confirmed he did not author the report but contributed by organising documents in appropriate folders. This, however, became the defence’s point of reference in the cross-examination.
 Despite his involvement in the inquiry, Sittlington refused to take full responsibility for the report. He asserted that his contribution was limited to providing supporting evidence for the appendix. The defencee, however, tried to paint a negative image of his impartiality, citing alleged commercial dealings he had offered to police officers and pointing to similar actions during his previous employment with the UK government.

 Sittlington admitted his contract with the British High Commission in Guyana had been terminated, and there were claims that he improperly used the personal address of the head of the Specialised Organized Crime Unit.
 Further scrutiny was directed at Sittlington’s LinkedIn profile, including references to his acting career, which raised questions about his credibility as an impartial expert.
 Joseph Muscat’s defence counsel, Vince Galea, argued that Sittlington was neither objective nor independent. He cited LinkedIn messages that seemed to indicate a lack of impartiality and probed the witness regarding any possible meetings with the NGO Repubblika or Maltese politicians. Sittlington denied having any such meetings and stated he could not even identify members of the Maltese Opposition.
 Objections were also raised regarding Sittlington’s nomination as a court expert, with lawyers Vince Galea, Stefano Filletti, Stephen Tonna Lowel, and other members of the defence arguing that the expert's independence had not been adequately assessed. However, the court denied the request to question the impartiality and integrity of the witness, referencing the law, which mandates that expert witnesses testify on the matters assigned to them by the Attorney General. It was further clarified that while no formal request for recusal had been made, any such challenge should be addressed in the court responsible for determining the accused's guilt.
 The court noted that the defence’s line of questioning was intended to cast doubt on Sittlington’s impartiality. In response to questions about payments received for his services, Sittlington did not recall receiving any or having a pricing chart for such payments. The defence also made observations about the witness's statements, highlighting inconsistencies, such as his reluctance to accept responsibility for parts of the report he signed, and the inability to point out whether he was a ‘contributor’ or an ‘author’.
 After a brief pause the sitting resumed with Sittlington returning to the witness stand.
 He was asked about a work reference on his Linkedin Profile that mentions he was an advisor for audit firm PwC. However, Sittlington said this was no relevant to the proceedings. Sittlington also denied using any information which he had obtained from other inquiries in the Vitals inquiry.

Appeal overturns fair hearing ruling against FIAU,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/132340/court_declares_fiau_procedures_lacked_the_necessary_safeguards_to_ensure_fair_hearing_,18-11-2024,002260.png,"A court of appeal has overturned a decision which concerns XNT Limited, an International investment services company established in 2011 that offers global multi-asset financial services, faced significant penalties amounting to €244,679 due to alleged violations of anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism regulations.

 The penalties were based on findings from a compliance review conducted by the Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit (FIAU), which identified serious offences, including transactions that exceeded the established thresholds without adequate due diligence.

                     In a previous case, a judge declared that the laws regulating the administrative fines imposed by Malta’s financial crime watchdog are in breach of fundamental rights. The same company, XNT Limited was informed of the fine in June 2022 by means of a letter and given 20 days to pay what was referred to as an “administrative fine,” of almost a quarter of a million euros. The judge had upheld XNT’s request to declare the Act and regulation to be in breach of its fundamental rights.

 It was seen how the FIAU’s penalties must have jurisdiction to examine all relevant questions of fact and law. The Court highlighted that the administrative process conducted by the FIAU did not meet the necessary requirements for a fair hearing as required by the European Convention of Human Rights, as it was both the investigator and the adjudicator in the case. Thus, the FIAU was responsible for both investigating the offences and imposing penalties.

 The compliance review conducted by the FIAU revealed multiple transactions that exceeded the regulatory limits, with one transaction significantly surpassing the threshold. The committee decided to increase the penalty amount based on the risks associated with these transactions.

 However, although such exceptions were contested, the Court noted that the law itself also makes exceptions particularly when it comes to the time frame one must adhere to in filing an appeal.

 The Court decided that certain articles being contested to in the Act against Money Laundering do not go against the Constitution or the European Convention of Human Rights.     ",Jordan Pace ,court_and_police
Drug trafficking trial in jeopardy after distracted juror remains in courtroom,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/131232/trial_begins_for_three_men_accused_of_trafficking_almost_2000_ecstasy_pills_in_2008,16-09-2024,002267.png,"Updated at 5pm
 The trial of three men indicted for allegedly having trafficked almost 2000 ecstasy pills in 2008 is in danger of collapsing on its first day because a supplementary juror had been present in the courtroom while the parties were discussing whether to remove offences from the bill of indictment.
 On Monday, Madame Justice Edwina Grima presided over the trial of Rio Micallef, 41, David Tabone, 40- and 34-year-old Darren James Vella, who stand indicted for trafficking the drugs, a crime punishable by imprisonment for life.
 Micallef is also indicted for the possession of 1,940 MDMA, valued at €18,624, while Tabone is further accused of possession of MDMA pills and cocaine. All three men are denying the charges.
 But the plans were thrown into disarray after the judge was informed that the man chosen as supplementary juror number 12, had been in the courtroom’s public gallery before the sitting, during discussions on potential amendments to the bill of indictment.
 The defence lawyers asked the judge to order the dissolution of the jury, telling the judge that before the jury had been empanelled, one of the reserve jurors had been present in the courtroom whilst parts of the bill of indictment’s narrative, relating to verbal statements Vella had made to the police, and which the Court of Criminal Appeal had declared to be inadmissible, were being removed.
 Prosecutors Godwin Cini, Kevin Valletta and Danika Vella suggested that the court should first establish whether there was any truth to this allegation.
 The court duly ordered the deputy registrar to privately contact the juror and ask him whether he had heard the submissions, whilst also ordering that footage from the courtroom CCTV cameras be produced.
 “I was explicit and clear. I said that if any prospective jurors are in the courtroom, they are to leave immediately,” the court recalled.
 When she returned from speaking to the juror in question, the registrar informed the court that he had told her that he had been playing a videogame on his phone at the time and had not been paying attention to what was being said in court. His attention had only returned to the courtroom when the judge had ordered the jury to be called into the courtroom.
 Judge Grima asked whether the defence would object if only the supplementary jurors were to be replaced. Object it did, however.
 Cini argued that the objection had no basis. There was no risk, he said, because the supplementary jurors were kept apart from the jury, and there was no risk of contamination.
 “Jurors are kept separate from supplementary jurors so unless they are telepathic, they cannot communicate amongst themselves,” he argued.
 But lawyer Franco Debono insisted that there was, arguing that supplementary jurors “aren’t just for decoration.”
 “The panel is a single entity. If it is tainted, it is tainted,” he said, adding that even if the same pool of potential jurors were to be called back tomorrow, they now already know the names of the defendants and charges they are facing.
 Lawyer Arthur Azzopardi pointed out that “the first thing a person who is not selected as a juror will do is check the news to see what the jury was about,” arguing that it was unlikely that the jurors would forget what they read about the trial in the news in the space of a week.
 The judge considered dismissing the supplementary juror after calling him to testify to see whether he had said anything to the other jurors about what he had heard, allowing the jury to proceed if he hadn’t.
 But Debono expressed doubt as to whether a juror could legally disclose what he had discussed with the other jurors and pointed out that the court could not take him at his word.
 The jury was irremediably tainted, argued the lawyer. “You cannot fix this by simply removing a supplementary juror. Also, if he was playing a video game, when he was meant to be following a trial by jury, I don’t know what that says about him.”
 Lawyer Michael Sciriha said he was sympathetic to the court’s efforts to save the trial, “but it is unsalvageable.” He insisted that continuing with the trial would lead to constitutional proceedings, which he said, would unfairly cast a shadow over the judge.
 “I think the juror did not tell the registrar the truth or was, let’s say, ‘imprecise.’” was lawyer Arthur Azzopardi’s diplomatic suggestion. “Whatever this man says from here on, I cannot have peace of mind that he would be telling the truth. If you are playing a video game you shouldn’t have noticed that the jurors are being called. And if he did notice, why did he come back to the courtroom?”
 “The defence understands the court’s desire to have this case decided as soon as possible, but the risk is palpable,” concluded the lawyer.
 “This morning we already had one juror ask to be excused and a supplementary juror take her place,” said Azzopardi. “These three men behind me have been waiting for 16 years for this trial, but to continue with this trial today would be an injustice.”
 The judge has now retired to chambers to deliberate on how to proceed. 
 What is the trial about?
 The defendants had been arrested in September 2008 after a consignment of ecstasy pills which the prosecution said Micallef was to hand over to Tabone and Vella in a Birkirkara garage belonging to Vella.
 Text messages intercepted by the authorities indicated that the latter two were to then sell the drugs on to a number of third parties and reap massive profits.
 The police had been following their movements in Birkirkara and on 15 September 2008 the three accused were seen meeting in their cars outside the Butterfly Bar in Birkirkara, before following each other to the garage in Triq il-Knisja l-Qadima.
 It was outside the garage that Micallef realised that they had been followed by the police, ducking behind a parked van and running off, chased by police officers who subsequently arrested him.
 Other officers arrested Vella and Tabone, the latter of whom was found to be carrying €9,330 and an electronic weighing scales in his bag. Traces of cocaine and ecstasy were detected on the scales.
 Two bags containing 1,940 white pills, later determined to be ecstasy pills with a street value of €18,624, were recovered from underneath the van which Micallef had been seen crouching behind. Drugs were also found on Tabone’s person.
 Prosecutors Kevin Valletta, Godwin Cini and Danica Vella are representing the Office of the Attorney General in the proceedings.
 Rio Micallef is being assisted by lawyers Franco Debono, Jose Herrera and Alex Scerri Herrera.
 Lawyers Arthur Azzopardi and Jacob Magri are representing David Tabone. Lawyers Michael Sciriha and Matthew Xuereb are Darren James Vella’s defence counsel.

Twins back in court for threatening elderly parents over drug money,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/twins-court-threatening-elderly-parents-drug-money.1091802,05-01-2024,002271.png,"Twin brothers were remanded in custody on Wednesday after pleading not guilty to violence against their elderly parents, just over a month since being granted bail over similar charges. 
 The two 39-year old siblings, whose names are not being published to protect the identity of their alleged victims, landed back in court after police received fresh information that the brothers were once again pestering their parents for money. 
 The pair, who told the court that they were currently unemployed, allegedly wanted the money to fuel their drug addiction.
 When their parents refused to hand over money, their sons allegedly turned violent. 
 Both siblings had been arraigned over domestic violence charges in March and were subsequently granted bail later that month. 
 But since then, they allegedly returned to bad ways, constantly asking their parents for money and using violence against the elderly couple when their requests were turned down. 
 On Wednesday the brothers were charged with violence against their parents, causing the elderly victims to fear violence, insults and threats as well as breaching bail conditions. 
 They pleaded not guilty. 
 Their legal aid lawyer said that the father had filed a false report and argued that this was a case of revenge. 
 But the prosecution strongly objected to the request for bail, rebutting the defence’s claim that this was a false report. 
 After hearing submissions by both parties the court, presided over by Magistrate Kevan Azzopardi, turned down the request and remanded the twins in custody. 
 The court also issued a Protection Order in favour of the accused’s parents.

Police might still be investigating individuals linked to Vitals scandal,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/129940/vitals_corruption_case_compilation_of_evidence_against_fearne_scicluna_continues_today_,27-06-2024,002274.png,"The compilation of evidence against Chris Fearne, Edward Scicluna and 13 others in relation to the Vitals hospital concession continued on Thursday.
 Here it emerged that the police might still be investigating individuals and their involvement in the fraudulent hospitals concession.
 This emerged in the compilation of evidence against Chris Fearne, Edward Scicluna and 13 others in relation to the Vitals hospital concession. 
  During the sitting one of the witnesses, former Inspector Anthony Scerri, started reading out a list of names which were of interest to the Vitals inquiry. Prosecutor Francesco Refalo interrupted, arguing that reading the list in court might prejudice ongoing investigations. The court upheld the prosecution's request for a ban on names read out by Scerri.
 On Thursday, Inspector Wayne Rodney Borg was cross-examined by the defence, as he explained he assisted the inquiring magistrate and had limited involvement during the search at Steward Healthcare.
 The defence also noted a discrepancy in the provisions under which the accused were charged. Borg indicated this change was decided by the Attorney General. 
 Criminal Court Registrar Franklin Calleja took the witness stand as well on Thursday, as his testimony involved the court experts who worked on the inquiry. 
 The defence asked if Calleja had encountered any documents indicating how the foreign experts were appointed, as none appear in the inquiry. Calleja responds that typically, a magistrate appoints an expert through a decree, which then becomes part of the inquiry. Calleja said that he was unsure about this specific inquiry.
 The next sitting will take place on 2 July at 11:00am, as the expected witnesses are set to include the director of the NAO or a representative, a representative from Jobsplus, as well as the OPM’s Cabinet Secretary.
 Charged alongside Fearne and Scicluna were former permanent secretaries Alfred Camilleri and Joseph Rapa, current permanent secretary Ronald Mizzi, adjudication committee members James Camenzuli, Manuel Castagna, and Robert Borg, financial controller Kenneth Deguara, and five lawyers: Kevin Deguara, Jean Carl Farrugia, Aron Mifsud Bonnici, Deborah Anne Chappell, and Bradley Gatt.
 The 15 defendants are charged with fraud, with Fearne and Scicluna being additionally accused of misappropriation and making fraudulent gain by abusing their position. Money laundering is also amongst the charges facing other defendants.  ",Matthew Farrugia ,court_and_police
Judge orders AG to indicate basis for Vitals freezing orders values,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/130789/judge_orders_ag_to_indicate_basis_for_vitals_freezing_orders_values,19-08-2024,002283.png,"The Criminal Court has upheld a request that it call several experts who assisted the inquiring magistrate investigating the Vitals Global Healthcare deal, to testify in order to understand how the amounts stipulated in the subsequent freezing orders had been arrived at.
 Madame Justice Edwina Grima presided over sittings in two cases which had been filed by Jean Carl Farrugia, Kevin Deguara, Deborah Chappell and Kenneth Deguara, to attack the multi-million euro “seize and freeze” orders imposed over their assets, following the conclusion of the Vitals inquiry.
  The judge also ordered the Attorney General to indicate the passages from the inquiry upon which it had based the amounts in the freezing and seizure orders.
 This morning, the defence lawyers informed the court that they had filed a “voluminous” reply to the prosecution’s written submissions.
 Appearing for the Attorney General, prosecutors Rebekah Spiteri, Francesco Refalo and Shelby Aquilina declared that they had no further evidence to submit with regard to the request and objected to the defence asking the court to hear the inquiry experts. The law does not state that the court had to hear witnesses in such proceedings, argued the prosecutors, and neither did it bind the prosecutors to testify.
 Lawyer Roberto Montalto asked that the court hear evidence in support of the defence’s arguments, “primarily the experts who assisted the Vitals inquiry.” The other defence lawyers also made the request which was entered into the acts as a collegial one. The court allowed the defence to submit a note with a list of the names of the experts concerned.
 Spiteri submitted that the AG did not need to exhibit further evidence and would be resting on the inquiry.
 After lawyer Joseph Mizzi added that the defence could also need witnesses from the Office of the AG or the Police, the court directed him to include the names of the witnesses in question, together with the reasons for which the defence wanted them to testify.
 The judge warned that she did not want “any doubling of evidence.” “If the testimony is new, they will be heard, but otherwise they are to indicate the part of the inquiry referencing the evidence in question.”
 The AG objected, in particular to the request that prosecutors be called to the witness stand. 
 Mizzi explained: “We didn't have an opportunity to ask the AG why this freezing order was requested for Deborah Chappel and the only people who can answer that question are from the AG. It is just not a question of submissions, but one of evidence. The court must be convinced that there is sufficient evidence to support [the freezing order]. To base our reply correctly, we need to understand why the order was needed.”
 “Our colleague said that the AG doesn’t testify,” lawyer Franco Debono added. “But in recent years the AGs role has changed, as had the law, and now the AG is also obliged to take an oath on the charges. They must now testify. Either we are going to live this new reality or stay stuck in the past.”
 Spiteri pointed to the Constitution, where the AG’s independence is entrenched. “If we testify…we are going to be making ourselves subject to direction, thereby placing the entire prosecution in jeopardy.”
 Debono insisted that the prosecutors who took an oath on the charges can testify, arguing that this was the legislator’s intention.
 Adopting a more practical approach, Montalto submitted that the AG was basing its position on the inquiry. “So before we file our note, we are going to ask them to indicate which documents from the inquiry they are basing themselves on.” He reminded the court that it was dealing with a freezing order for €40 million.
 The court appeared to agree, telling the prosecutors that it would be better if they carried out this exercise before the experts were brought to testify.
 It was observed that earlier today the same court had given a decree in a related case involving Shaukat Ali in which it ruled that the place where freezing orders are to be contested “is here, before the Criminal Court.” 
 The court upheld the defence’s request that it hear the testimony of the inquiry experts. The request for the AG to be called to the stand was rejected, but the court ordered the AG to file a note to indicate what parts of the magisterial inquiry she is basing her request on. The sitting was adjourned to September. 
 Freezing order law “can breach fundamental rights”
 In a related case before the same judge, lawyer Franco Debono informed the court that the defence wanted to await the outcome of a pending Constitutional case in the names Repubblika ta Malta v Joseph Muscat et before determining its challenge to the freezing and seizure orders.
 Debono suggested that the law, as it currently stood, could give rise to breaches of fundamental human rights. “When you have several defendants facing [freezing and seizure orders] for a large amount, if it emerges that one defendant’s benefit was minimal, then the joint and severable liability would result in a breach of [that defendant’s] right to property.” 
 The law already limited such orders where there is an incidental involvement, added the lawyer, but said this situation could also arise where the person in question was a central figure but made very little gain.
 The judge upheld the request for a suspension of the 7 working day timeframe in which it must decide the defence’s request and placed the case in abeyance until the Constitutional case is decided. The freezing and seizure order imposed by the compiling court will remain in place during that period.

Ramel Buildings development 'should not even have been considered': court,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/ramel-buildings-development-should-even-considered-court.1102441,13-12-2024,,"A proposed development at a landmark building in Sliema “should not even have been considered,” and was doomed to fail from inception, a court declared, observing that the relative authorities had “turned policies upside down.”
 The case concerned a proposed development within a residential and urban conservation area right on top of an early 20th-century building known as Ramel Buildings on Isouard Street, Dun Karm Psaila Street and Tower Road. 
 NGO Flimkien għal Ambjent Aħjar together with a number of residents put up a legal challenge, filing an appeal in June against a decision by the Environment and Planning Review Tribunal (EPRT) which paved the path for the permit. 
 The application proposed building 15 apartments and a lift shaft over the existing airspace and in the common area of the protected Category A building which is attributed to architect Giuseppe Cachia Caruana.
 According to local plans, the site is classified as a ‘landmark building’ which by definition means that “no additional floors or significant structures will be allowed over [such property].” 
 Structural interventions in such properties were to be limited to the replacement of deteriorated components and were to be carried out in materials and structures identical to the original, or the removal of incompatible accretions from the façade. 
 Yet the EPRT observed that the additional storeys on the landmark building would cover the blank party wall created by other high-rise developments on Tower Road. 
 The Court of Appeal presided over by Chief Justice Mark Chetcuti, observed that there were ""site-specific"" policies which gave extraordinary importance to such building, allowing “no exception” to what may be done in relation to the protected property.
 Prohibiting the construction of additional floors to such a building was “not simply a suggestion but an order imposed by the legislator,” said the court. 
 The Planning Authority and the Tribunal misunderstood the importance of the legislator’s will, turning principles linked to this site “upside down.”
 They tried to reconcile high-rise buildings in the vicinity, described as low quality by the case officer, and lacking similar protection so as to justify the development at the Category A building. 
 The court could not understand their reasoning for allowing additional floors to cover the blank party wall created by these other developments along Tower Road.
 This went directly against the express terms of the applicable policy. 
 Attention ought to have been given to considerations “done or rather not done” when those other developments on Tower Road were granted a permit, creating a negative impact on the protected building. 
 Whatever was done previously without care and attention when issuing those permits was not to serve as reason to destroy further what was left to protect in terms of the local plan, observed the court. 
 “This is a case of two wrongs do not make a right.”
 Generic SPED principles could not justify a development that was prohibited by site-specific policies, went on Chief Justice Chetcuti.
 There could be no conflict with clear policies on building height limitations in Sliema’s UCA.
 Without delving further into the other grounds for appeal the court said that “the development should and must fail from inception and should not even have been considered.”
 The court revoked the Tribunal’s decision and declared that the relative permit was null. 
 In a statement on Friday, the FAA welcomed the victory but expressed frustration that it has fallen on non-profits to pursue planning justice. 
 “NGOs and the public must continually expend time and resources to oppose the Planning Commission's collusion with developers in disregarding heritage preservation and planning laws,” they said. 
 “FAA is committed to safeguarding these historic structures, which have significantly enhanced the character of our towns and villages for centuries, thereby improving the quality of life for all.”

 Okhiulu Eshiemokhai Yakubu, a 43-year-old plasterer originally from Nigeria and living in Buġibba, was charged with making use of false documents in front of Magistrate Astrid May Grima. 
 While the court was hearing submissions for bail, it emerged that the accused did at one point hold valid documents but they were lost after being deposited with the court while the man faced separate criminal charges a year ago.
 Police inspector Karl Roberts said that the man was manifestly a flight risk as he had been caught in the act of trying to abscond.
 He also highlighted that the man had no ties to Malta as all of his family resided in Italy.
 However, defence lawyer Edmond Cuschieri told the court that the reason the man was trying to get to Italy was because he wanted to get a DNA test to prove that he was the father of his children.
 The man was last year found guilty of illegally importing cannabis to Malta 10 years ago.
 As a result, he had to deposit his identity documents with the court.
 After filing several applications trying to get them back, the man was told that his documents had been lost.
 The bail request was denied and the man was remanded into custody.

"Watch: Malta bans HHC products 'to protect children, public health'",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/watch-malta-bans-hhc-products-to-protect-children-public-health.1098676,27-09-2024,002340.png,"Semi-synthetic cannabinoid products will be banned from Malta, the Parliamentary Secretary for Reforms confirmed on Friday.
 Rebecca Buttigieg said the main aim behind the ban was to safeguard the public’s health and reduce children’s accessibility to the usually colourful but harmful products. 
 HHC, short for hexahydrocannabinol, is a semi-synthetic cannabidiol, which is extracted from low-THC cannabis (hemp) and is a popular cannabis substitute. 
 In recent months, products containing HHC - colourful gummy bears, cookies, and lollipops - were sold in stores across the country and on food delivery platforms. Unlike THC, which is regulated by law, there is a legal grey area around HHC.
 Buttigieg said the difference between THC and HHC was that the latter was more harmful as it was semi-synthetic and not a natural product, like THC. 
  She said the decision to ban HHC products was not done overnight.
 The Authority for the Responsible Use of Cannabis set up a technical committee made up of representatives from the Superintendent of Public Health, the police and University of Malta professionals to discuss the way forward.
 “We also looked at the European Union Drugs Agency advice, and like many other countries, we decided it would be best to prohibit these products from the Maltese markets,” Buttigieg told Times of Malta.
 Buttigieg first announced the market ban on HHC products during a Lovin Malta interview.
 “This is for the benefit of the public’s health and to ensure there is no easy access for children. These products are marketed as gummy bears and lollipops, which are very colourful and can attract children’s attention, but they can be harmful,” she said.
 “We believe the best way to regulate these products is by prohibiting them from the market.”
 Buttigieg’s comments come after the health minister raised concern about the impact of vapes and HHC products on youths.
 Church organisations had called on the government to ban the semi-synthetic drug, while the Authority for Responsible Use of Cannabis (ARUC) previously expressed “great concern” that the product was sold openly in shops.
 Buttigieg shot down the proposal of selling HHC products at local cannabis clubs which have been granted a licence to operate, and legally grow and sell the drug.
 “The products are different. The associations provide natural products of a high standard and take into consideration the health of those who use cannabis,” she said, adding there were not enough studies on the effects of the semi-synthetic drug on an individual's health.
 Buttigieg was meanwhile asked if cannabidiol (best known as CBD) products will be fully legalised.
 She said the reform already catered for CBD products, as long as the product had less than 0.2% THC. 
 While THC is what gives cannabis its psychoactive effect, also known as a ‘high’, CBD has no psychoactive properties. It is often used for its medicinal properties.
 CBD is usually sold as a component in oils, edible and cosmetic products. It is also available in flower form. According to the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance Act, cannabinoid products with less than 0.2% THC are legal.

"Teen, 13, 'removed' from school after bullying case ends with stabbing",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/teen-13-removed-school-bullying-case-ends-stabbing.1102172,12-08-2024,002351.png,"A 13-year-old girl who is alleged to have bullied and threatened a 15-year-old in a case which escalated to a gang stabbing has been removed from school, the victim's lawyer said on Sunday. 
 Jason Azzopardi said his client, a teen girl who cannot be named as she is a minor, was returning to St Benedict's school in Kirkop after a three-week absence because her alleged bully is no longer attending it. 
 Azzopardi said the victim's family was informed of that by an Education Department official.
  “We will welcome her at the school gate as she deserves, and she can safely return to her school desk,” the official reportedly told them.
 The bullying case made headlines when the victim was taken to hospital with stab wounds. She told police that she was surrounded by a masked gang made up of individuals who spent the past months forcing her to give them money. 
 Police have pressed charges against a 21-year-old in relation to that incident. A court hearing that case was told that the victim first spoke about the bullying when her father caught her stealing money from him. 
 In his comments on social media, Azzopardi stressed that his comments were solely in reference to the alleged bullying his client suffered at school, not those ongoing criminal proceedings.
 He said the victim's family was upset that their daughter had suffered as much as she had before they were taken seriously. 
 “Why did their 15-year-old daughter have to end up traumatized, injured, assaulted, threatened, blackmailed, and abandoned before those responsible took action, especially when bullying against her was denied until November 29?” Azzopardi wrote.
 The magistrate overseeing proceedings in the criminal case said this week that educational authorities should take ""drastic action"" when faced with serious bullying cases, rather than relying on the “restorative justice” method traditionally employed by the Department for Educational Services.
 The restorative justice policy, previously known as the “no-blame approach,” aims to focus on corrective action instead of punishment.
 Questions have been sent to the Education Ministry.

Murder suspect in Caruana Galizia assassination challenges pre-trial detention,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/131199/jamie_vellas_pretrial_detention_breaching_his_fundamental_rights_lawyer_tells_court,13-09-2024,002354.png,"The courts’ continued refusal to grant bail to accused murderer Jamie Vella was breaching his fundamental rights, his lawyer told a judge this morning.
 He warned that he had “a lot to say” about what he described as the politics behind the Police Commissioner’s 2021 claim that “every person involved” in the killing of Daphne Caruana Galizia had been apprehended and charged.
  Lawyer Ishmael Psaila made submissions to Madam Justice Edwina Grima on Friday, about his client Jamie Vella’s eleventh bail application.
 Vella has spent the last three and a half years in preventive custody, accused, as an alleged associate of the Ta’ Maksar brothers Robert and Adrian Agius, of involvement in the murder of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia in October 2017, besides also being charged, alongside George Degiorgio and Adrian Agius, of involvement in the murder of lawyer Carmel Chircop, who was gunned down inside a Birkirkara garage complex in October 2015.
 The argument was raised on Friday as Madam Justice Edwina Grima dealt with pre-trial pleas in the criminal proceedings against Vella, George Degiorgio and the tal-Maksar brothers Adrian and Robert Agius.
 Lawyer Ishmael Psaila, appearing for Jamie Vella, made submissions on his latest bail request after the other defendants were taken out of the courtroom, at the end of an otherwise uneventful sitting.
 Psaila insisted that there were no legal impediments to Vella being released on bail, with the magisterial inquiry now closed and witness testimony preserved in the compilation of evidence.
 “It is not the first time that our courts have dealt with such crimes,” said the lawyer, warning that further delays in granting Vella bail would be a violation of his fundamental rights.
 The Attorney General had, in the past, given various arguments as to why he should not be released from arrest, Psaila said, before adding “but today it is public knowledge that the case has been concluded and the Commissioner of Police had told a press conference that all the people involved [in the Caruana Galizia murder] have been arrested.”
 “Now if there was a political aspect to this claim, I will not say for now, but I will have a lot to say about this in future,” said the lawyer.
 Prosecutor Anthony Vella from the Office of the Attorney General made his counter-arguments during the Friday sitting.
 “Here we have an indictment for two murders, as well as for participation and promotion of a criminal organisation. These all create public order problems and the court cannot simply grant bail,” said the prosecutor, reminding the court that Caruana Galizia’s murder had caused widespread fear in the country, which had in turn led to “an element of public disorder.”
 Psaila replied that Vella had been on police bail for a long time before his arraignment, noting that the prosecution had made no mention of a criminal record for Jamie Vella, “whom the media has portrayed as a monster. Where does the fear of absconding emerge from?”
 “Do you think police bail would not have been enough warning for him to get on the first powerboat he could find and escape to another country? He wasn’t arrested on a yacht… he was arrested at home. This argument is frivolous,” Psaila remarked. “The problem in this case is not really the crime itself, but that this country ended up grinding to a halt due to pressure from outside this courtroom - and I will bear the responsibility for saying this myself - because of who one of the people killed, was.”
 Judge Edwina Grima informed the parties that she will be issuing a decree on the bail request from chambers.  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police

Ghirxi's lawyer accuses FSWS of violating murder victim's data privacy,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/ghirxi-lawyer-accuses-fsws-violating-murder-victim-data-privacy.1097333,29-08-2024,"002398.png,002399.png","A lawyer representing murder victim Nicolette Ghirxi has filed a data protection complaint against the state-run Foundation for Social and Welfare Services, accusing it of violating his late client's privacy.
 The FSWS published a copy of a declaration Ghirxi gave domestic violence assessors, in which she confirmed that she was refusing a risk assessment. 
 It did so as it sought to refute claims that Ghirxi was talked out of undergoing a risk assessment by FSWS assessors.  
 The Sunday Times of Malta reported that Ghirxi told her lawyer and a friend that assessors told her that messages sent to her by her ex did not qualify as threats. That ex, Edward Johnston, would go on to kill her. 
 The FSWS has stridently denied those claims. 
 Joseph Borda, the Ghirxi family's lawyer said on Wednesday that he had reported the FSWS to the Office of the Information and Data Protection Commissioner for including a copy of the form Ghirxi filled out. 
 ""The publication of this form is in breach of Data Protection regulations and goes against all basic ethical standards,"" Borda said.
 Ghirxi was stabbed to death by Johnston earlier this month and had previously filed reports about him to the police as he continued to harass her after their relationship had ended. 
 Last week, Ghirxi's close friend and her lawyer both told Times of Malta that Nicolette had felt the professionals she dealt with when she filed the report had  discouraged her from taking a risk assessment. 
 However, FSWS strongly refuted this, saying that the two professionals had at no point tried to talk Ghirxi down from the risk assessment and published sworn affidavits from both of them explaining in detail how their interaction with Ghirxi played out. 
 Included with those affidavits was a copy of a sworn declaration filled out by Ghirxi in which she stated in writing that she did not think she was at risk and therefore was foregoing a risk assessment of her own volition. 
  ""So according to FSWS, Nicolette sat for the risk assessment for the fun of it and she somehow came up with that phrase, then after she went out lying to everyone,"" Borda said in reaction to FSWS publishing the document. 
 ""This is so professional FSWS. It is now clearer what happened and corroborates what was reported on Sunday - Nicolette was talked out of the risk assessment.""
 
 Ghirxi’s murder is to be probed by retired judge Lawrence Quintano, as part of an inquiry appointed by Social Policy Minister Michael Falzon. 
 An Independent Police Complaints Board is also to review the police force's conduct in the way the case was handled and the subsequent standoff that resulted in the police shooting Ghirxi's killer dead.
 However, Borda and the Ghirxi family are insisting on the prime minister appointing an independent inquiry that would determine whether the state did everything in its power to prevent the murder.
 They are also insisting that they be consulted on what the terms of reference of such an inquiry may be. 
 Speaking to Times of Malta on Wednesday morning, Justice Minister Jonathan Attard implied the government was open to discussing the inquiry’s remit with Ghirxi’s relatives.
 “We need to talk to the family, to ensure that any aspects requiring an answer, get one,” the minister said.
  The Ghirxi family will meet with Attard and others in the coming days.
 Attard however pushed back against criticism of the inquiry not emanating from the OPM.
 The inquiry is an independent one by a judge enjoying cross-party support, he said, and it made little difference which minister appointed it. 
 ""The government appointed the inquiry. If a minister appointed an inquiry, isn't that the same as the government doing so?""

 Last April, Annunziato Gatt was found guilty of not having a car licence or third-party insurance for his car and was subsequently fined €2,400 and disqualified from holding a driving licence for six months.
 He subsequently appealed the ruling.
 The incident dates back to December of last year when police were doing the rounds in Triq Villabate in Żabbar. There they happened to come across a car that they identified had an expired licence tag and noted that the driver had allegedly been driving without insurance cover.
 In his appeal, Gatt said that there were obvious mistakes in the proof put forward against him and that the only direct evidence was an affidavit signed by a police constable who said that the inspections were being carried out between the night of December 18 and 19 in December 2023.
 However, the fine written out to Gatt referred to the date as “18 December at around 00.08 hrs”. Since the document did not refer to the date as December 19, then it conflicted with the police’s primary evidence, Gatt argued.
 The first court had subsequently clarified that the round check had in fact started to be carried out by the police on December 17 at 10.30pm and continued till around 1.30am on the 18th, not on the 19th as previously stated by the police.
 The Court of Appeal, presided over by Judge Neville Camilleri, noted that there were inconsistencies throughout proceedings about the time and the date of when the inspection in question was carried out.
 The first court had even noted that the police constable could have been clearer about when the operation had taken place.
 As a result, the court accepted Gatt’s appeal and revoked the sentence, declaring him not guilty of the charges and rescinding the punishment.

 But soon afterwards, assisted by new lawyers, he filed proceedings before the constitutional court claiming that the first court should have assured itself that he was in a sufficiently sound state of mind when giving his consent.  
 He had a long history of psychological and medical problems coupled with drug dependence. Medical professionals, when summoned to testify in the constitutional case, described Meli as “very bright” but suffering from “great social anxiety” and “very low self-esteem”. 
 The claims were rejected by the First Hall, Civil Court in its constitutional jurisdiction. Meli filed an appeal to the Constitutional Court.  
 The government, meanwhile, introduced new procedural safeguards to ensure that a wanted person is allowed “adequate time” to reflect before granting consent to extradition. 
 Meli's lawyers immediately filed an application before the Criminal Court of Appeal which quashed the court’s previous decision and ordered Meli’s case to be heard afresh before the Magistrates’ Court.  
 During a hearing last week, the prosecution hinted that they were to summon an FBI representative to testify. But when the case resumed on Monday, the prosecution said that most of the evidence was already in the records of the case.  They had no further evidence to produce except for any clarification that the defence could possibly request. 
 Meli’s lawyers then filed a bail application which is expected to be considered  on Wednesday.  
 Inspectors Mario Cuschieri and Robinson Mifsud prosecuted. 
 Lawyers Arthur Azzopardi and Franco Debono are defence counsel.

‘I feared she would die in my arms’: Victim’s friend recounts Paceville beach stabbing,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/131367/i_feared_she_would_die_in_my_arms_victims_friend_recounts_paceville_beach_stabbing,24-09-2024,002520.png,"A man who witnessed the brutal stabbing of his friend on a Paceville beach testified in court on Tuesday, recalling the moment he feared she would die in his arms.
 The incident, which occurred on 7 August, saw 21-year-old Colombian national Fabian Medina Paira accused of attempted murder and grievous bodily harm.
 Testifying under oath, the witness, referred to as ""Ernesto"" by the alleged victim, described the sequence of events that unfolded early that morning on the beach in St Julian’s.
  He and the victim had been relaxing by the water with another couple when they noticed Medina Paira, a stranger, behaving ""in a manner that was not normal,"" sitting nearby.
 After the other couple left around 8am, Ernesto and the victim decided to go for a swim, chatting in the water. Shortly after, they saw the stranger move toward the victim’s belongings, smashing a glass bottle on the rocks. “It was strange. It didn’t make sense,” Ernesto recounted.
 As the victim rushed out of the water to confront the man, the attacker pushed her and ""jumped on her,"" according to Ernesto's testimony. Realising what had happened, Ernesto gave chase but quickly turned back when he saw his friend covered in blood. He ran to her side, desperately trying to stop the bleeding.
 “Her face changed colour. I feared she was dying,” he said, explaining how he pressed on a chest wound while slapping her face to keep her conscious. The victim eventually started breathing again, and Ernesto frantically called for help from a passerby. “I hope she doesn’t die in my arms,” he recalled thinking at that moment.
 The victim was rushed to hospital for emergency surgery. A doctor who testified said she had a one-centimetre deep laceration to her chest and a smaller superficial wound. Blood had entered her lungs, putting her life at serious risk.
 The accused, Medina Paira, repeatedly interrupted the court proceedings, complaining that “no one is helping me” and that he felt in danger in jail. Despite being warned by Magistrate Donatella Frendo Dimech to remain silent, Medina Paira continued to disrupt the hearing, leading to his temporary removal from the courtroom.
 Prosecuting Inspector Shaun Pawney said the accused appeared to be intentionally trying to disrupt the trial. Despite his interruptions, the court allowed Medina Paira to return for part of the testimony but eventually ordered his removal after more outbursts.
 The case, prosecuted by AG lawyer Kaylie Bonett and Inspector Pawney, continues, with legal aid counsel Mark Busuttil representing the accused.  ",Staff Reporter ,court_and_police
"An inquiry, criminal charges and what’s next for Muscat & Co.",maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/129069/an_inquiry_criminal_charges_and_whats_next_for_muscat__co_,08-05-2024,002542.png,"Former Prime Minister Joseph Muscat, his chief of staff Keith Schembri and former minister Konrad Mizzi are among a group of people to be criminally charged in connection to the hospitals deal.
 Below we break down the next steps in what will happen in court:
 What is the aim of a magisterial inquiry? What does an inquiry do?
 In simple terms, magisterial inquiries are there to do two things: Collect and preserve all evidence and material traces relating to an incident; recommend whether or not the police should press charges and if so, what charges to press.
 Does an inquiry have to be concluded in 60 days?
 Contrary to disinformation in circulation, inquiries do not have to be concluded within 60 days. The law only states that if it is not completed in 60 days, the magistrate shall draw up a report stating the reason for the delay, and this report shall be transmitted to the Attorney General within three working days from the lapse of the 60 days. After that, the magistrate has to send reports, explaining the reasons for the delay, to the Attorney General, at the end of every subsequent month.
 Do suspects under investigation have a right to testify during an inquiry? 
 The Criminal Code doesn’t contemplate such a scenario, much less grant this as a right. However, should this argument be raised, it will probably be based on a fundamental human rights approach, which is more flexible and has a much wider scope. Suspects who are identified in an application filed by a private citizen requesting a magisterial inquiry have a right to be notified with the application and to file an objection. No such rights are enjoyed by individuals who emerge during the course of the inquiry. In the Vitals inquiry, the original request was filed against Konrad Mizzi, Chris Cardona and Edward Scicluna.
  Wait a minute, that doesn’t seem fair on the suspects.
 If the decision is taken to press charges, they will receive disclosure of all the evidence against them after arrest; or if not arrested, during the compilation proceedings. It must be noted that during the compilation of evidence, the court does not establish guilt, but takes custody of the evidence and decides whether there is sufficient evidence for the defendant to stand trial on indictment, or whether further evidence is required.
 Do suspects have a right to release a police statement before being charged? 
 This does not emerge from the law, either. However, a practice has developed whereby suspects are given the opportunity to release statements by the police before they press charges. This takes on added significance in money laundering proceedings, where the burden of proof is inverted. Whereas normally, the prosecution must prove their charges beyond reasonable doubt, in money laundering cases, the prosecution only has to reach a lower level of proof, known as prima facie (in layman’s terms ‘on the face of it’), after which the defendant is required to prove that the funds came from a legitimate source.
 Joseph Muscat is being arraigned by summons. What does this mean?
 Arraignment by summons is the less glamorous sister of arraignment under arrest. Instead of being put in handcuffs and driven to court in a police van, the suspect is ordered to appear in court on a given date and at a given time. The law doesn’t give much in the way of criteria as to whether the prosecution should arraign under arrest or by summons and only says that the latter shall be used “where there are not sufficient grounds according to law for the arrest of any person charged with an offence.”
 The summons has to contain a clear designation of the person being summoned and a brief statement of the facts of the charge, together with other details deemed necessary on a case by case basis. It must also contain a warning to the effect that, should the person summoned fail to appear in court on the specified date, they will be arrested and arraigned under arrest.
 But besides the obvious doing away with the necessity for bail, this method of pressing charges has a number of important implications which aren’t immediately apparent.
 There is a tactical downside to charging suspects by summons, because the law does not oblige the police to send for or interrogate – or even inform – the suspects before deciding to issue the charges. The corollary to this is that, as there is no arrest, there will be no interrogation, and therefore neither does the suspect have the right to be shown what evidence the police have against the individual (commonly referred to as ‘the right of disclosure’).
 Although there may well have been good reasons for the prosecution to have gone down this route it is equally likely that the defence lawyers will now begin filing constitutional cases or constitutional references claiming their clients had suffered a breach of their right to disclosure, and consequently their right to a fair trial.
 Will the accused ask for bail?
 They don’t need to ask for bail. A bail request is made when the defendant is charged under arrest. Since arrests don’t feature in proceedings by summons, there is no need for bail.
 What are the charges?
 Not all individuals are facing the same charges. Joseph Muscat and Konrad Mizzi are being charged with money laundering, fraud and making fraudulent gain, as well as conspiracy to commit an offence punishable by imprisonment for more than four years and participating in a criminal organisation with more than 10 members. They are also being charged with accepting bribes and corruption in public office. Keith Schembri is being charged with offences related to the solicitation of bribes and abuse of his office to exact an unlawful advantage “through threats or abuse of authority”. Other people are being charged with assisting or facilitating the wrongdoing of the politicians involved, while others have been charged with corrupting public officials.
 The names of several people who will be charged are public. What about the rest? 
 The charges are understood to have been issued in batches, the first against 14 people and eight companies. The rest will be charged in another batch.
 Will the magistrate hearing the case be the same as the inquiring magistrate?
 The cases have been divided in two groups and assigned to two different magistrates, neither of whom is the magistrate who led the inquiry. The first batch, which includes Muscat, Mizzi and Schembri, has been assigned to Magistrate Rachel Montebello.
 Will the accused go to jail? 
 This depends on the offences with which they are charged but the more serious offences such as money laundering, corruption, bribery and fraud, all carry prison sentences should guilt be found. There are also other factors and sentencing considerations, which will come into play. Lawyers will no doubt complicate matters further in due course and we don’t recommend you hold your breath. It will be a long time before these cases are concluded.  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police

Cleaner charged with theft after missing jewellery found in her shoe,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/130406/cleaner_charged_with_stealing_jewellery_from_residence,25-07-2024,002594.png,"A woman from Xgħajra was remanded in custody on Thursday after jewellery, stolen from a residence which she had been paid to clean, was found in her shoe.
 Charmaine Farrugia, 31, pleaded not guilty to theft, aggravated by value, person and place, during her arraignment before Magistrate Joseph Gatt.
  Farrugia, who was brought to court dressed in disposable white forensic coveralls, broke down in tears during bail submissions at the mention of her seven month old daughter, currently in foster care.
 Inspector Ian Vella, prosecuting together with public prosecutors Clive Aquilina and Brendan Hewer, told the court that the owner of the house where Farrugia was cleaning had filed a report over the theft at the Marsa police station and had indicated Farrugia and her boyfriend, both of whom were cleaners, as suspects.
 After they were arrested, the stolen jewellery was found hidden in Farrugia’s shoe, said the inspector, adding that the woman had admitted to the police that it was not the first time that she had done this.
 Farrugia also told the police that her boyfriend had no idea that she was stealing things, Vella told the court, adding that the male suspect was later released without charge.
 Lawyer Wilfrid Buttigieg, assisting Farrugia as defence counsel, asked the court to release the woman from arrest, arguing that she had returned all the stolen items, had cooperated fully with the police and had a clean criminal record. The lawyer added that Farrugia was also the mother of a seven month old baby girl.
 The prosecution objected to the bail request, arguing that the alleged victim will testify at the next sitting and that the woman’s daughter was already in foster care.
 Magistrate Gatt denied the bail request, ruling it to be premature, as well as in view of the serious nature of the charge and due to the fact that the witnesses were yet to testify. The court urged the prosecution to bring every civilian witness that it may have at the next sitting.
 The court also issued protection and restraining orders in favour of the alleged victim.  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police
LESA boss 'would welcome' magisterial inquiry into corruption claims,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/lesa-boss-would-welcome-magisterial-inquiry-corruption-claims.1097948,09-12-2024,002606.png,"The head of LESA has declared that he would welcome a magisterial inquiry into an alleged fine-cancelling racket, insisting it would vindicate him.
 Svetlick Flores told Times of Malta he “looks forward to cooperating” with any investigation into allegations made by lawyer Jason Azzopardi last month, if the magistrate decides there is reason to open one.
 Azzopardi filed a court application requesting a magisterial probe into what he claims is a years-long racket involving private car hire companies and top officials within the public agency, which is responsible for enforcing fines.
 
 He alleged tourists driving rental cars while on holiday in Malta were unknowingly fined for traffic contraventions committed by local drivers in a complex racket operated by LESA officials, swindling millions of euros out of public coffers.
 Magistrate Antoine Agius Bonnici is yet to decide whether to initiate the probe but Flores is convinced it would vindicate him.
 He said: “As I have previously stated, I categorically deny all allegations made against me. My reply to the magistrate [which Flores attached to the reply to questions], clearly demonstrates that these allegations are unfounded and based on falsehoods.
 “I have not objected to a magisterial inquiry, and should one be initiated, I look forward to co-operating with the investigation. I remain confident that it will establish the truth regarding my conduct and character, and I look forward to the truth being revealed.”
 In the lengthy court application, Azzopardi claimed the racket had been ongoing for years, at least since 2021, and was fine-tuned to function with the “precision of a Swiss watch”.
 Times of Malta also asked Flores how many LESA officials have access to cancelling or amending fines, in what rank they are and in which cases can fines be cancelled or amended legitimately.
 Flores was also asked whether he can guarantee none of LESA’s officers or officials are cancelling, shifting, delaying, or in any way meddling with any fines and whether he feels he should have stepped down from his post until further investigations are concluded.
 Flores did not provide an answer to these questions.
 LESA has landed in hot water over fine cancellations before.
 In 2021. Times of Malta revealed at least one official had been deleting hundreds of traffic contraventions issued to powerful and influential people.
 Back then, Flores confirmed that the official – who was facing other allegations of misconduct and sexual harassment at work – had been removed from his role and transferred.

Union to 'cover legal costs' of tenant who was threatened by his landlord,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/union-cover-legal-costs-tenant-threatened-landlord.1094352,23-06-2024,"002631.png,002632.png,002633.png","Tenant union Solidarjeta’ on Sunday said it will ""cover legal costs"" for Aleksander Vukoje, whose landlord threatened to kill him and has now shut off his water and electricity supply. 
 The union did not clarify what it meant with ""legal costs"" and would not say whether it is helping the tenant take the landlord to court, or whether the tenant will be facing charges in court himself.
 It only confirmed with Times of Malta that it helped Vukoje open a criminal report.
 Earlier this week, Vukoje told Times of Malta he was forced to call the police after his landlord last week entered his bedroom while he was sleeping and threatened to kill him. 
  Video footage of the incident shows the landlord telling Vukoje he was going to make him bankrupt and “slit your throat”. 
 For over a week, Vukoje has now been living without water and electricity after both supplies were disconnected by the landlord.
  During a solidarity demonstration outside Vukoje’s apartment in Swieqi on Sunday, Gabriel Apap - the union’s secretary-treasurer - said Solidarjeta will be paying for Vukoje’s legal fees and encouraged the public to contribute to its campaign fund. 
 “These financial contributions will not only help us ensure justice is served in Aleksandar’s case, but will serve as an investment in the betterment of workers’ and tenants’ rights in Malta,” he said. 
 He thanked those who showed up to show solidarity with Vukoje. 
 ""Can you imagine feeling unsafe in your own home? Can you fathom that being woken up by death threats by someone you've never met is even a possibility,"" he asked. 
 
 ""And would you even believe you’re not dreaming when the police officers you called take the side of the perpetrator?""
 Vukoje told the demonstration his sense of security had been ""shattered"".
 He said he went to the police hoping for protection and justice, but it was only after his third attempt, with the support of the union, that he was able to file a report. 
 ""No one should have to endure violence and intimidation in their own home. no one should be left in the dark - literally and figuratively - without the support of their community,"" he said.
 ""The reluctance of the authorities to act - to even listen - is a stark reminder that there are still those in our society who are ignored, whose voices are silenced, and whose suffering is invisible. But today, we stand together to change that. We stand here to remind the world that every person deserves to live in safety, with dignity and respect.""
  Johanna MacRae, a representative of the union's tenant section, remarked that this landlord has been getting away with illegal evictions and the interruption of water and electricity supplies. 
 ""What is the point of Article 85 of the Criminal Code if landlords are allowed to continue taking the law into their own hands with complete impunity?"" she said.
 She said she was more disappointed with the police and the Housing Authority than she was with the landlord.
 ""We have a serial rogue landlord bullying his way through the system, making a mockery of the law, and a laughing stock of the police,"" she said.

Identità admits ID fraud complaint was a crime but failed to report it to police,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/identita-admits-id-fraud-complaint-crime-failed-report-police.1097199,30-08-2024,002643.png,"A senior Identità official who received a complaint over misaddressed mail admitted it was a crime that warranted a police investigation but failed to flag it to the police himself.
 Head of the ‘Compliance – Reporting’ unit – Victor Aquilina – was corresponding via e-mail with someone who had complained of receiving mail from telecoms company Epic addressed to people who do not live in their house.
 Scores of people have recently started to fear identity theft and fraud, as they found mail in their letterboxes addressed to people who do not live and have never lived there.
 In one of his e-mails, sent earlier this month, Aquilina told the complainant: “Since this constitutes a crime, the police should investigate. I am willing to cooperate and be called in for questioning if necessary.”
 As Identità’s head of ‘compliance – reporting’, however, he did not mention he would be reporting the illegality to the police himself.  Times of Malta has seen the e-mail of Aquilina, who served as a police superintendent before he was appointed in his current role at  Identità.
 Earlier this week, former Repubblika president Robert Aquilina said Aquilina was the same police officer who was forced to resign following an incident in 2021.
 Robert Aquilina claimed that back then, while he was staging a 72-hour protest in front of the police headquarters, the then-superintendent attempted to “blackmail” him to shut him up.
 In response to questions, an Identità spokesperson said that the format of reply is given to people who feel “an offence has been committed in [their] respect and criminal action can only be instituted by the police on the complaint of the injured party”.
 “Complainants are also being advised by Identità to report the matter to the police, and that officials from Identità will assist the police in their investigations, if so requested,” she said.
 “Identità furthermore informs that following the receipt of a number of complaints regarding correspondence received from private entities which were addressed to third parties and who are not known to the complainant,  Identità has reported the cases to other pertinent authorities for further necessary action, including the Office of the Information and Data Protection Commissioner.”
 She said that in the cases of mail received from private entities, it resulted that Identità had never issued a residence card to the people to whom the letters were addressed.
 It was “an issue with a private entity”.
 She added that in instances where it is suspected that the person provided incorrect information to a private entity (like Epic), Identità advises the complainant to report the matter to the police, the Office of the Information and Data Protection Commissioner and the Malta Communications Authority.
 Identità investigates every complaint it receives, she said.
 But the only instance where Identità goes to the police itself is when it suspects that the person to whom the mail is addressed had submitted false information or provided false documentation to the agency.
 The complaint about misaddressed mail was not the first of its kind.
 Some received mail at their home addressed to people appearing to be third-country nationals – people they never met or heard of.
 Last week, Times of Malta reported how other people discovered that their medical files contained upcoming appointments for serious tests and surgeries they did not need, data about hospital admissions they never underwent, medication they were never prescribed, by doctors they never visited, for illnesses they never had.
 One man who visited a public healthcare clinic in June was even told his medical records listed him as having died in March.
 The reports increased significantly after lawyer Jason Azzopardi claimed earlier this month that Maltese ID card holders were “robbed” of their identities and that several ID numbers were allegedly assigned to other people through corrupt practices at  Identità.
  A court judgment appeared to prove Azzopardi right, when a man was handed a suspended sentence after he admitted fixing letterboxes to residences to provide addresses for residence permits for third-country nationals.
 However, most of the other reported cases largely remain a mystery.
 Investigations by the authorities are ongoing and so far, it is unclear what involvement Identità has in these cases, if any at all.
 It is also unclear whether the different cases are related to each other or are separate, administrative errors which all happen to be surfacing now.
 Sources close to the investigation told Times of Malta it could still transpire that the cases involving mail received from Epic were the result of an error on the company’s side.
 Epic recently sent an e-mail to its employees reminding them to request and verify ID cards when handling client matters and said anyone receiving misaddressed mail should go to the police and state authorities.
 Identità also said people fearing that their property is being used for ID fraud should alert it and the police.

 The case is related to investigations into the issuance of residence permits, which also involved government agency Identità.
  It is being alleged that 18,000 fake ID cards were illegally issued to foreigners against payments ranging from €2,000 to €5,000 for each document. Identità has denied any involvement, stating its Compliance and Expatriates Units had conducted an investigation and passed on information and evidence about “some individuals” to the police so that they may investigate.
 In court, the prosecution, led by Inspector Karl Roberts, explained that in recent days, several individuals were arrested in connection with fraudulent rental contracts that illegally facilitated non-EU nationals.
 He stated that one of the masterminds behind the case worked with Attard, where it was found that several foreign nationals were registered at the accused’s personal address.
 In the sitting presided by Magistrate Nadine Lia, it was revealed that the accused had installed letterboxes with the names of these individuals, who were supposedly residing there, to ensure any correspondence from Identità could be delivered to them.
 The prosecution added that a prime suspect in this case led them to Attard, resulting in an arrest warrant being issued against him.
 It was explained that Attard cooperated with the police, and his testimony was crucial in ensuring the prime suspect in this criminal ring would be brought to justice in the coming days.
 The prosecution suggested a suspended sentence for the man, which his defence agreed with. After hearing all submissions, the court found Attard guilty and sentenced him to two years in prison, suspended for four years.

Care home handyman cleared of sexually molesting a resident,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/care-home-handyman-cleared-sexually-molesting-resident.1101595,26-11-2024,002679.png,"A handyman at a care home has been cleared of sexually abusing a vulnerable resident while driving her to a health centre, and a court suggested on Tuesday that residents ought to be “chaperoned” on such outings.
 Homes offering such services to persons with intellectual or physical disabilities which rendered them vulnerable, would be wiser by taking all necessary precautions, observed the magistrate, adopting a suggestion made by a psychiatrist.
 The court also stressed that the acquittal did not mean that a person with an intellectual disability lacked credibility as a witness. In this case, the acquittal stemmed from the fact that the prosecution failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt.
 It all started five years ago when two brothers accompanied their vulnerable sister to Paola police station to report that on several occasions a maintenance worker/driver at the residential home touched their sister indecently.
 The woman claimed that the 66-year old suspect had slipped his hand under her top and touched her thighs as she sat next to him in the front passenger seat during the ride from the home to the health clinic where she was due for blood tests.
 The man denied the allegation even when confronted by the management at the home in the presence of the alleged victim and her brothers.
 Police investigations resulted in criminal proceedings.
 The manager at the home testified that on the day of the alleged incident the woman appeared to act normally when she returned from her medical visit.
 It was not the first time that the alleged victim was caught lying, but that was the first time she had made such serious claims. The manager said that the victim failed to grasp the notion of boundaries and was attracted towards strangers.
 The manager said that when she was questioned by management, her brothers had “pressured her [the victim]” to confirm her allegations and one of them threatened her physically, saying they did not wish to make fools of themselves when reporting the matter to the police.
 The woman eventually testified in court via video link.
 She claimed that when she told the accused that she would report him to management, he warned her not to tell anyone.
 She said she had not spoken up immediately after she was first molested because she feared that her brothers would physically confront the accused. She decided to report after the fifth time.
 She never experienced any trouble with other staff members at the home.
 The woman confirmed that the accused would buy her sweets whenever she asked him to.
 A psychiatrist tasked to examine the alleged victim said that she was consistent in her version. The woman could distinguish between good and bad and understood the meaning of telling the truth.
 She was angry, nervous and confused after the alleged incident.
 When delivering judgment, Magistrate Claire Stafrace Zammit said that the case pivoted upon the credibility of the alleged victim and whether her version was corroborated by other evidence.
 There were certain inconsistencies in her testimony which rather gave rise to doubt.
 When testifying, the woman first referred to “my hand” then “his hand,” confirming it was the accused’s hand when questioned by the court.
 It seemed rather difficult if not impossible for the driver to slip one hand under the woman’s top while driving.
 The woman also claimed that the accused wanted to show her his private part. She had reacted saying, “I don’t want to see it, how rude.”
 Later, the man told police that even had he wanted to, he could not do what the woman alleged because of a physical disability.
 That factor rather “convincingly” contradicted the alleged victim’s version and “raised some doubt,” observed the magistrate.
 Moreover, the accused said that he had asked the alleged victim to sit at the back but she insisted on sitting in front next to him.
 After assessing all the evidence, the court concluded that the alleged victim’s version was inconsistent and not corroborated. The court therefore could not pronounce a conviction.
 However the court stressed that the acquittal was not due to the alleged victim’s mental disability. Nor was the court saying that such an intellectually vulnerable person lacked credibility.
 Citing a scientific study based on certain intellectual disorders, the court stressed that the accused was acquitted because the prosecution failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt.
 Finally, just as a psychiatrist suggested, the court recommended that such residents should be accompanied by a chaperone when taken for medical appointments.
 By taking such wise precautions, care homes would benefit not only the residents but also those staff members working at such facilities.
 Lawyer Roberto Montalto was defence counsel.

ADPD court challenge to gender correction mechanism thrown out,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/adpd-court-challenge-gender-correction-mechanism-thrown.1102536,16-12-2024,002716.png,"A challenge to the gender balancing mechanism in parliament lodged by ADPD was turned down by a court on Monday after it ruled the challenge contradicted the constitution.
 Malta’s Green Party argued the mechanism introduced three years ago to promote gender parity among MPs was discriminatory and violated fundamental rights to free elections and freedom of association.
 The corrective mechanism means that if one gender gets less than 40 per cent of the available seats in parliament, the number of MPs is increased up to a maximum of six seats for each side.
 But such a mechanism applied only if two parties are elected to parliament, ADPD said, arguing that a female candidate must run on a PL or PN ticket to benefit from the rule – a situation they argued was discriminatory.
 Moreover, voters who cast their vote in favour of a candidate running for a third party had their choice completely ignored, the party said.
 It argued the mechanism also breached two articles of the constitution.
 ADPD challenged the mechanism on the basis of the constitution, the European Convention on Human Rights and the Charter of Fundamental Rights, filing their action against the State Advocate and the Electoral Commission.
 The State Advocate raised several pleas including that the charter did not apply to matters which fell within the exclusive competence of Member States, such as general elections.
 Those pleas were upheld by Mr Justice Ian Spiteri Bailey, who heard the case in the First Hall of the Civil Court.
 The European Convention on Human Rights and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union are different legal instruments created by different institutions.
 Although every EU Member State was a signatory to the Council of Europe, that did not mean that the two institutions were one and the same, the court ruled.
 When making submissions, the applicants had ignored completely the charter, basing their arguments only on the European Convention, it said.
 The court had no doubt that the organisation of general elections fell within the exclusive competence of each particular Member State and were not regulated by European law.
 Moreover, the Maltese constitution was supreme, the court ruled.
 In light of all evidence and considerations, the court turned down the applicants’ claims.

Abela's cabinet secretary found guilty of drunk driving,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/abela-cabinet-secretary-ryan-spagnol-guilty-drunk-driving.1097110,23-08-2024,002724.png,"Updated 2pm
 Robert Abela’s cabinet secretary has had his driving licence suspended for six months after being found guilty of driving while drunk.
 Ryan Spagnol was found to have alcohol levels almost twice the legal limit when police breathalysed him at a 1.30 am roadblock on December 22, three days before Christmas.
 Police subsequently pressed charges against him and asked the court to suspend his driving licence for any period the court deemed fit.
 Spagnol appeared before Magistrate Jean Paul Grech on May 24 and was found guilty of three of the four charges he faced.
 The case only came to light on Friday, however, after it was highlighted on Facebook by lawyer and former PN MP Jason Azzopardi. 
 Azzopardi, who is currently embroiled in a libel case with Spagnol, alleged that the judgment, handed down in May, was only published on the court's online repository on August 14, the day before the Santa Marija public holiday.
 Court judgements are usually made public on the same day they are handed down. 
 Azzopardi alleged that the delay was “on Robert Abela’s orders” and demanded resignations. 
 A spokesperson from Abela's office told Times of Malta that it ""categorically denied"" Azzopardi's claims.  
 Spagnol’s drink-driving case dates back to December 22, when he was stopped at a roadblock in Żejtun. A police officer noted that Spagnol’s eyes were red and that he looked drunk.
 A breathalyser confirmed that – his breath alcohol level was 43.7 micrograms. The legal limit is 22 micrograms.
 Spagnol’s defence sought to have the case dismissed by presenting three key arguments: they questioned the reliability of the breathalyser equipment used, argued that prosecutors had failed to present the original copy of his statement renouncing legal rights, and said medication that Spagnol was taking could have influenced breathalyser test results.
 The court dismissed all three lines of defence.
 It found Spagnol guilty of drunk driving, driving in a public place while not in a state to do so and driving while not in control of his vehicle. It cleared him of being drunk and unable to look after himself in a public place, saying testimony only showed that his eyes were red and that police suspected he was drunk.
 The magistrate ordered the accused to pay a €1,800 fine and suspended his driving licence for six months.
 The PN called for the resignation of Spagnol or his removal by the prime minister.
 In a statement, the party said it was ""scandalous"" that Spagnol retained his position: ""Spagnol's behaviour is illegal, irresponsible and dangerous"".
 It was also ""scandalous"" that Robert Abela had allowed Spagnol to retain his role when he knew the man was being charged in court.
 ""The country needs serious, mature and responsible public officials, and not people who drink-drive at night,"" the party said in a statement.

 They are among a list of 15 people set to be charged with fraud amounting to €5,000 in connection to the hospitals inquiry findings. They also face charges of misappropriation and having made fraudulent gains.
 They will be charged a day after former Prime Minister Joseph Muscat will appear in court over fraud and corruption among other charges.
 The individuals charged alongside Fearne and Scicluna include former permanent secretaries Alfred Camilleri and Joseph Rapa, current permanent secretary Ronald Mizzi, adjudication committee members James Camenzuli, Manuel Castagna, and Robert Borg, financial controller Kenneth Deguara, and five lawyers: Kevin Deguara, Jean Carl Farrugia, Aron Mifsud Bonnici, Deborah Anne Chappell, and Bradley Gatt.
 Former deputy prime minister Chris Fearne tendered his resignation from the Labour cabinet last week, saying it was the right thing to do, despite maintaining his innocence. The Prime Minister tried convincing him otherwise, but Fearne did not budge.
 Last Saturday, following a Labour parliamentary group meeting, Abela announced Fearne would stay on as deputy leader for party affairs.
 The Central Bank on the other hand has refused to answer to media questions on whether Scicluna will stay on as governor. Questions sent to the Central Bank by this newspaper have remained unanswered.

Man filmed smashing car and wielding a knife is handed suspended sentence,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/man-filmed-smashing-car-wielding-knife-handed-suspended-sentence.1097889,09-10-2024,002732.png,"A man who was filmed smashing a car and wielding a knife has been handed a suspended sentence and ordered to stay away from his victim. 
 Fabien Mifsud was arrested on Sunday after the violent incident on a Żabbar street where he lived. 
 He appeared in court on Tuesday, when he admitted damaging the victim’s car, carrying a knife outside his home without the necessary police permit as well as wilfully breaching the public peace.
 Mifsud had apparently long been having trouble with the victim, who disapproved of his daughter's friendship with Mifsud, who is 20 years her senior.
  Matters apparently came to a head on Sunday when Mifsud spotted the woman’s father outside his home. 
 He allegedly confronted the victim with a knife. The victim fled to safety. 
 But Mifsud grabbed a metal rod and proceeded to smash the windows of the victim’s Nissan March that was parked on the street. 
 Footage of the incident was subsequently posted on social media.
 Officers from the Żabbar police station, alerted about the violent incident, came across Mifsud in an agitated state and arrested him. 
 Defence lawyer Franco Debono argued that the incident was triggered by the victim’s attitude. 
 When making submissions on punishment the defence underlined the accused’s early guilty plea and his willingness to reimburse the victim for the damages caused. 
 Prosecuting inspector Antonello Magri agreed with the defence’s suggestion for a suspended sentence but requested a restraining order in favour of the victim and his wife. 
 The court, presided over by Magistrate Caroline Farrugia Frendo, condemned the accused to a six-month jail term suspended for one year and ordered him to pay €980 in damages within six months. 
 A restraining order was also issued in favour of the victim and his wife. 
 Inspector Antonello Magri prosecuted. Lawyers Franco Debono and Charles Mercieca were defence counsel.

Court orders police action against lawyer over suspected car transfer fraud,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/court-orders-police-action-lawyer-alessandro-lia-car-transfer-fraud.1098157,16-09-2024,002746.png,"A Magistrates’ Court has instructed the police commissioner to press charges against lawyer Alessandro Lia over suspected complicity in the fraudulent transfer of a vehicle that was meant to be scrapped.
 The court said that while Lia made no financial gain in the case, he may have been an accomplice to fraud. 
 The issue stems from challenge proceedings filed in March against the police commissioner by Victor Sant seeking criminal action against his former son-in-law, lawyer Alessandro Lia, for suspected complicity in fraud and falsification.
 Lia is also Commissioner for Justice and a Broadcasting Authority member.
 When testifying at length in the proceedings, Sant explained the issue began when he expressed his thoughts about parting with his Renault Megane.
 He had broached the subject in the presence of his close family members who, at the time, included Lia.
 His then son-in-law had promptly pointed out that the vehicle was scrap material and offered to handle the matter for Sant.
 Sant took up that suggestion, handing over the car and logbook to Lia.
 Time went by and Sant received no further update.
 Quite a long while later, when he asked Lia about the car, the lawyer informed him that all he managed to get for the vehicle was €100.
 Suspicious, Sant emailed Lia for further details but the email went unanswered.
 Then he called Transport Malta.
 That was when Sant found out that the car had actually been transferred to a third party rather than being scrapped.
 Sant’s ID card and signed declaration were necessary for the transfer.
 Yet Sant insisted that he never signed the declaration and the signature on the form handed to Transport Malta was not his.
 Since Lia never explained exactly what happened to Sant’s car and the events that followed, the court hearing the challenge stated that it was worried about the “mens rea” (criminal intention).
 Lia made no monetary gain, observed Magistrate Claire Stafrace Zammit who was assigned the case by the Chief Justice.
 However, the lawyer might have been an accomplice in the fraud.
 As for the falsification in the TM document, that could only be determined through criminal proceedings by a court-appointed calligraphy expert who would examine the signature on the document.
 The court thus upheld Sant’s challenge and ordered the registrar of the law courts to serve a copy of the judgment upon the police commissioner and the Attorney General.

Yorgen Fenech’s prison meeting ‘caught on CCTV’,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/yorgen-fenech-prison-meeting-caught-cctv.1094676,30-06-2024,002751.png,"Yorgen Fenech spent “a considerable amount of time” talking with a top prison official and a businessman in a meeting caught on CCTV, Times of Malta can confirm.
 The man awaiting trial in connection with Daphne Caruana Galizia’s murder met with prison supplier and Easygas director Reuben Farrugia in the office of prison’s head of strategy Svetlana Muscat last week, sources close to prison have confirmed.
 The meeting was caught on CCTV and the footage – which was later handed to police – shows the three spent “a considerable amount of time together talking”, one source said.
 It remains unclear whether the footage also includes audio of the conversation.
 Sources said the issue was immediately flagged by a whistleblower who filed a report in writing about the meeting, sparking an internal probe and police investigation.
 “It’s a messy situation, but if there’s a silver lining it’s that proper protocol was followed from the moment somebody noticed the meeting,” a source said.
  Muscat, who holds one of the most powerful positions at the Corradino prison, was interrogated by police last week, after she allowed the two men to meet in her office.
 A former ONE reporter and ministerial aide, Muscat has now been put on forced leave.
 So, what was wrong about it?
 The problem was not that Fenech met people while he is in prison. All inmates – including Fenech – are allowed to have visitors, and anyone can visit them, not just family members.
 But while the process for visiting a prisoner who has already been sentenced is relatively straightforward, visiting an inmate like Fenech, who is held at Corradino under arrest and whose case is still undecided, is a different ball game. An inmate whose court case is still ongoing must get the approval of their prosecutor – the police inspector or the office of the Attorney General – before meeting anyone. Approval is only granted if the person visiting is not linked in any way to the ongoing case, to ensure the meeting does not influence court proceedings.
 None of the three people in the meeting – Fenech, Muscat or Farrugia – obtained such approval before the meeting, multiple sources confirmed.
 Times of Malta is informed police have not yet decided whether to press charges against Muscat, but sources confirmed that the lack of approval is at the centre of the alleged crime and which distinguishes it from being an internal disciplinary matter.
 “The alleged crime is less serious than what many people may have thought when they heard Yorgen Fenech’s name, although it could have been consequential nonetheless,” one source close to prison said. “This was simply a matter of getting approval. In fact, I believe that had they asked for approval from the police for this meeting, they would have probably got it.”
 But another source said the issue was made complicated due to Muscat’s senior position with­in the prison administration.
 “She knows what the protocol is. She knew that the meeting needed prior approval. So why did she allow it to take place?” they said.
 Another source familiar with the investigation said Farrugia, Fenech and Muscat have insisted that the meeting happened by chance when one man was exiting Muscat's office as the other was entering. All three maintain that the conversation only involved small talk.
 What about the office?
 Muscat regularly meets with prison inmates as well as suppliers as part of her job.
 The fact she hosted Fenech and Farrugia in her office would not have raised questions had she met with them separately, sources said.
 Prison officials summon inmates to their offices for all sorts of reasons related to their behaviour, care plan and to address ongoing issues.
 Investigators have also asked questions about Muscat sitting in on the meeting between Fenech and Farrugia.
 Sources close to prison said officials sometimes do accompany inmates on visits, but “should not do it in their office”. It is unclear whether there is a specific rule precluding it, but sources said such practices were frowned upon and prohibited under past prison leaderships.
 “It’s unethical, especially in a delicate setting like prison,” one source said.
 Another source, however, said Muscat is being unjustly and disproportionately criticised.
 “I wouldn’t have done what she did, but the attacks being levelled at her seem to me like there are people who are doing this out of spite and who possibly want to see her out of there,” they said.
 Farrugia and Muscat could not be reached for comment.

Vitals appellants ask for recusal of judges hearing freezing orders challenge,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/vitals-appellants-ask-recusal-judges-hearing-freezing-orders.1097586,09-03-2024,002764.png,"The Chief Justice and two judges presiding over a constitutional appeal by Keith Schembri and other high-profile defendants challenging the current legal regime on freezing orders were faced with a request for recusal. 
 The case revolves around a challenge fronted by the former OPM chief of staff and former minister Konrad Mizzi who requested a constitutional reference during criminal proceedings where they stand accused, alongside former prime minister Joseph Muscat and other top public figures, over their alleged involvement in the fraudulent Vitals deal. 
 All defendants were targeted by millions worth of freezing orders, with only seven working days to contest such seize and freeze orders before the criminal courts. 
 Schembri and Mizzi’s lawyers, subsequently joined by the other defendants’ counsels, argued that the current laws resulted in a situation of inequality of arms since the prosecution had an unlimited term to request a variation to such freezing orders. 
 In July, the First Hall, Civil Court in its constitutional jurisdiction dismissed the applicants’ claims. 
 Mr Justice Mark Simiana concluded that any review of freezing orders “fell entirely within the discretion of the Criminal Court.” 
 The applicants filed an appeal before the Constitutional Court and the case was appointed for a first hearing on Tuesday, for oral submissions on preliminary pleas. 
 Prior to today’s sitting, the appellants requested the court to authorize the presentation of the acts of the parallel criminal case against Pakistani businessman Shaukat Ali Chaudhry and his wife Shaukat Aasia Parveen. 
 However, the court turned down that request, stating that the end result of these appeal proceedings concerning Schembri and the other co-defendants did not depend on other criminal proceedings to which the appellants were not parties. 
 When the case was called today, lawyer Edward Gatt, assisting Schembri and Mizzi, informed Mr Justice Mark Chetcuti together with Justices Giannino Caruana Demajo and Anthony Ellul, that all the appellants’ lawyers were requesting the recusal of the judges. 
 The main reason was that the three judges presiding over the Constitutional Court today were the same judges who handed down the final judgment that definitively annulled the hospitals concession. 
 And that judgment had gone a step further than the decision by Mr Justice Francesco Depasquale who delivered the first decision annulling the concession on the grounds of fraud. 
 The Constitutional Court subsequently confirmed the annulment, declaring that there was collusion between the concessionaire and high-ranking government officials. 
 That decision meant that the judges had already expressed an opinion about the parties who were now facing criminal charges over their alleged involvement in the annulled deal. 
 Faced with that argument, the court ordered the appellants to file this recusal request in writing within four days, notifying the Attorney General and State Advocate’s lawyers who would also have four days to reply. 
 The court will decide upon the issue later this month. 
 Lawyers Edward Gatt, Mark Vassallo and Shaun Zammit assisted Schembri and Mizzi. 
 Lawyers Julian Farrugia, Miguel Degabriele and Francesco Refalo represented the State Advocate and AG.

 The case involves a Renault Megane once owned by Lia’s father-in-law, Victor Sant, with Lia suggesting it be scrapped during a family discussion.

 Lia offered to handle the task for his father, and later informed him that all he managed to get for the scrap material was €100. However, when Sant subsequently checked with Transport Malta, he discovered that the car had actually been transferred to someone else rather than being scrapped. Sant insisted that he had never signed a declaration form for such a transfer to be done and claimed that the signature on the relative document presented to Transport Malta was not his. 

 Sant initiated legal proceedings challenging the Police Commissioner to take criminal action against Lia. In September, the Magistrates’ Court ruled in favour of the challenge, noting that while Lia did not profit financially, there were prima facie grounds for prosecution.

 The alleged falsification of documents could only be verified by a court-appointed calligraphy expert during criminal proceedings. The Police Commissioner appealed the magistrate’s decision, seeking its reversal. 

 Sant’s lawyers argued the Attorney General’s appeal, filed on behalf of the commissioner, was late. However, the Criminal Court rejected this claim, noting that while legal time limits were to be “scrupulously” respected, the delay was not the AG’s fault but resulted from the late transmission of the case records by the court.

 The court noted that challenge proceedings act as a judicial review to assess whether police inaction on a reported crime is justified. It found prima facie evidence of Lia’s suspected complicity, citing his alleged role in providing a copy of the owner’s ID for the vehicle transfer.  

 While Lia’s email to the insurance company indicated the car’s transfer, Sant’s court testimony raised doubts about the AG’s claim that Sant was aware of the transfer rather than its scrapping. Sant maintained he never signed the transfer documents, despite being copied in Lia’s email. The transfer occurred the following day.  It was also noted that no calligraphy test was done to eliminate Lia’s suspected involvement in that transfer.

 Judge Neville Camilleri affirmed the First Court’s ruling, saying that the suspected signature falsification could only be determined through a calligraphy test in criminal proceedings.

 The court stated that since the police had failed to conduct the required examinations during their investigation, Lia’s involvement could only be excluded through the criminal process. It found no reason to overturn the initial court's decision, emphasising that this conclusion was reached solely on a prima facie basis, relying on the court records.

 “In no way was this court implying some form of guilt by Dr Lia in respect of charges to be pressed against him,” the court clarified, directing that both judgments be served “immediately” upon the Police Commissioner for the necessary action.

Vitals case against Muscat moves forward as Sciacca Grill cleared,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/live-blog-joseph-muscat-back-court-vitals-hospitals-criminal-case.1094415,26-06-2024,"002772.png,002773.png,002774.png","Updated 1.32pm
 A company with past ties to Keith Schembri was cleared of all criminal charges related to the Vitals deal to privatise three state hospitals on Tuesday.
 Sciacca Grill, which operates eponymous restaurants, was discharged from proceedings after Magistrate Rachel Montebello concluded that prosecutors had failed to present enough evidence to justify the company’s inclusion in criminal proceedings.
 The company was the only one of the 14 defendants discharged. The criminal case against all others, including former prime minister Joseph Muscat, his minister Konrad Mizzi and chief of staff Keith Schembri, must continue, the magistrate ruled.
 Sciacca Grill was previously known as Kasco Foods and owned by Keith Schembri, Joseph Muscat’s former chief of staff. But Schembri sold the firm in 2014, the court heard last week.
 Prosecutors argued that the company had skimmed money off contracts it received to supply state hospitals privatised by Vitals Global Healthcare and that Schembri still played a hidden role in it.
 But the company, represented in court on Tuesday by lawyers Franco Debono and David Bonello, argued that the prosecution did not produce a shred of evidence to substantiate its claims. 
 Following deliberation, the magistrate concluded that the defence was right.
 Even if the company truly benefited from contracts linked to the hospitals concession, no proof was presented to link it to Schembri or any criminal activity, the magistrate said as it discharged Sciacca Grill Ltd.  
  Defendants stand accused of having played major parts in a national, multimillion-euro fraud as part of a 30-year deal to privatise three state hospitals.
 That deal was awarded to Vitals Global Healthcare, a firm with no business history or experience in the healthcare sector, by the Muscat-led government. The concession was then transferred to US healthcare firm Steward Health Care before a civil court annulled it last year on the basis of fraud.
 Muscat and other defendants were arraigned on criminal charges on the back of a years-long magisterial inquiry into the deal.
  During Tuesday’s hearing, defence lawyers representing various companies and individuals charged with crimes took turns to poke holes in that magisterial probe.
 They all argued that the inquiry made allegations without backing them with evidence.
 “Never let the truth get in the way of a good story,” quipped lawyer Chris Cilia in defence of his client MTrace Ltd.
 One defence lawyer, Jason Grima, argued that his client Jonathan Vella was just an accounts clerk employed by auditor Chris Spiteri. He had no special role and was just an employee, but ended up facing criminal charges alongside all the others including Spiteri, he noted.
 
 Another lawyer, Arthur Azzopardi, argued that his client Brian Bondin was only linked to “potential” fraud and that the inquiry made no effort to substantiate those claims.
 Azzopardi made similar arguments for companies he is representing in the case – Technoline and Gateway Solutions. Court-appointed experts, he argued, were unable to agree on what exactly Technoline did wrong, he said, and everything Gateway did was always above board and vetted.
 The case continues on August 1.
 1.11pm The magistrate quickly reads through her decree’s final section. It notes that various banking records are required to determine the links between the defendants and alleged wrongdoing, but ultimately concludes that all defendants except for Sciacca Grill should face trial on indictment. 
 Sciacca Grill is therefore discharged from proceedings. The company’s owners will be uncorking a special bottle this evening. 
 The case will resume on August 1.  
 1.32pm This live blog ends here. We've update the top of this article with a summary of the court hearing's key points. Thank you for having joined us. 
 1.08pm After seeing the evidence, relevant acts and evidence, on prima facie basis, everything points to all defendants having allegedly played a part in some wrongdoing, bar one - Sciacca Grill. 
 1.05pm Magistrate Montebello is back in court, and she comes with a warning. 
 The decree she's about to read is ""rather voluminous,"" she tells those present in court. But, she adds, she will only read the final part in court. 
 12.24pm We mentioned it earlier, but it bears repeating: a prima facie decree is a court decision that there is enough evidence against a defendant for the case against them to proceed.
 As one of the defendants’ lawyers was at pains to note during today’s court hearing, the standard of proof at this stage is [obviously] fairly low. Still, various defendants facing criminal charges here have argued that prosecutors have failed to clear even that low bar of evidence. 
 If Magistrate Montebello agrees, she could decree that some of those defendants do not have a case to answer, and free them of any criminal liability. 
 12.14pm And with that, Magistrate Rachel Montebello suspends the hearing for 45 minutes. When she returns, it will be with a prima facie decree. 
 12.08pm Azzopardi says that while Ivan Vassallo was not contesting the prima facie case against him, his company Technoline was. 
 “If a company shareholder was naughty, then he should answer for it, not the company. This company employs 57 people and supplies one-third of the country’s medical equipment,” Azzopardi says of Technoline. 
 Eurybates, unlike Technoline and Gateway Solutions, is not contesting the prima facie case against it. 
 12.02pm Azzopardi raises questions about the inquiry experts’ credibility. 
 These experts spent four years working together, and they couldn’t even agree on Technoline’s criminal liability, he says. Different experts drew different conclusions about the company’s alleged illegality, he notes.
 11.59am Azzopardi can now make submissions on behalf of Gateway Solutions [the company that Vassallo used to buy Technoline, his previous employer].
 Gateway was not set up to acquire Technoline, its lawyer argues, and everything it did, it did legally. The loan it got to buy Technoline shares was paid and vetted by a major law firm, he says. The inquiry does not produce any evidence that the company did anything wrong, Azzopardi adds.
 11.48am The court switches gears and refocuses onto the issue of lawyer Arthur Azzopardi getting paid for his work by three of the companies facing charges. 
 The crux of the issue is that one of the firms, Technoline, usually covered the legal expenses of the other two, Gateway and Eurybates. But Technoline, like the other firms, is subject to a freezing order. And the administrator appointed to run the companies has decided that company money should not be paid out. 
 That means Azzopardi might not be getting paid for his work to represent the firms, prompting him to denounce the brief. But it appears the magistrate has found a solution: Azzopardi will file an application requesting payment, and Eurybates and Gateway will file a court application of their own. 
 And with that, the three companies get their lawyer back. 
 11.36am Grima goes on: As an accounts clerk, Vella had no professional duty to flag anything to the inquiry. And yet he’s being charged in his personal capacity. 
 Vella resigned as Bluestone company secretary in November 2016 and was replaced by [Vitals director] Ram Tumuluri. “And yet Tumuluri has not been charged as far as I know,” Vella’s lawyer notes. 
 Emails cited in the inquiry involving Vella had nothing to do with negotiations or contracts. And the only audit concerning Bluestone happened in 2018, when Vella was no longer involved, his lawyer argues. 
 11.30am Lawyer Jason Grima, representing Jonathan Vella, makes similar points regarding his client. The prosecution has presented no evidence of his criminal wrongdoing and the inquiry included no appendices regarding him, Grima argues. 
 Vella worked for auditor Chris Spiteri, but he was just doing his job, his lawyer said. 
 It was reported that Vella was a lawyer or auditor. But that was not correct, his lawyer argues. 
 “He’s simply an accounts clerk at Spiteri’s office,” Grima says, adding that Vella was tasked with serving as company secretary to Bluestone Investments [Vitals’ parent firm]. 
 “Vella didn’t choose to act as secretary. He did the job and was not paid as secretary,” Grima says. All Vella got was his regular salary.
 And the inquiry did not bother to hear him out. “No one sent for him, no one questioned him. Nothing at all. When a person is stopped over a driving offence, a lawyer is consulted,  even at 3:00am. Yet no one sent for Vella or gave him a hearing.”
 11.23am Bondin was a former MTrace employee who quit the company in January 2018. Azzopardi notes that his client then “filed court proceedings” [presumably against MTrace itself]. 
 The magisterial inquiry links him to “potential fraud” in 14 sentences but does not provide the financial data to back up those claims, he says. Prosecutors say they will need some time to reply. 
 11.16pm Azzopardi makes his points: experts in the inquiry concluded that there was the “potential” that Bondin had committed fraud. “Potential” was too low a bar for the court, his lawyer argues – at the prima facie level, the court must conclude that defendants’ level of guilt lies between the “possible” and the “probable”. 
 There was no appendice to the inquiry regarding Bondin, Azzopardi notes, despite one court expert attributing a €600,000 payment to him. 
 “She said it, but never backed up her argument,” he says. “The experts only focused on MTrace.” 
 11am The hearing resumes, and we're at a similar stage to where we are when it was suspended.
 Lawyer Arthur Azzopardi makes it clear that he renounced his brief as lawyer of Technoline, Eurybates and Gateway because he's concerned he will not get paid for work he did. 
 He says that if he won’t be paid for the criminal proceedings, he has no option but to renounce. ""No one does work for nothing. Even the court marshals in the corridor get paid,"" he says. 
 Azzopardi wants the court to reverse a decree it issued, to allow him to get paid. 
 The magistrate, who seems quite unimpressed by the matter, orders a copy of that application to be served to prosecutors. And now the case can proceed - Azzopardi will make submissions on behalf of Brian Bondin. 
 10.45am We're still here! The case is still suspended. The live blog will resume as soon as the magistrate returns. 
 10.35am Lawyer Arthur Azzopardi wants to make submissions on behalf of Brian Bondin. But the magistrate gives him a telling off first. 
 He quit a client without informing the client about it, she says. That’s not the way to treat a client – professional ethics require otherwise.
 The magistrate suspends the hearing for a few minutes, telling Azzopardi she is doing so to give him time to discuss the matter with Ivan Vassallo, whose companies Azzopardi no longer wishes to represent. 
 10.22am Lawyer Chris Cilia says the inquiry created a “narrative” surrounding the company he’s representing, MTrace Ltd. “It’s a narrative they invented,” he says. 
 The inquiry concluded that [Saint James Hospital owner] Josie Muscat was a front for Shaukat Ali and that MTrace was set up to control the Cyclotron project in 2015. But Josie Muscat testified that the idea for the project came much earlier, Cilia says, noting that the magisterial inquiry had never asked Josie Muscat to testify.
 Instead of hearing him out, investigators told a ""fairytale,"" the MTrace lawyer argues. 
 He then uses a Mark Twain witticism to hammer his point home.
 ""Never let the the truth get in the way of a good story,"" he says. 
 10.17am Prosecutors Francesco Refalo makes some arguments regarding another company facing charges, Sciacca Grill. The company was formerly Kasco Foods, owned by Keith Schembri.
 Refalo says the company got multiple public contracts, including one to supply the privatised hospitals. The company skimmed money from the hospitals concession, the prosecutor says.
 Defence lawyers have argued that Keith Schembri quit the company in 2013. But the prosecutor argues that just because he was not part of the company structure, it does not mean the company was not under his control. The magistrate also ordered charges to be filed against Sciacca Grill, he says.
 The company’s lawyer, Franco Debono, immediately objects. The prosecution did not produce a shred of evidence to substantiate its claims, he says, citing case law in which charges were dismissed at the prima facie stage due to a lack of evidence.
 10.10am Dalli says Taomac was instructed by Malta Enterprise to move out of the Cyclotron project. The company then had two options: lose its €62,500 investment or transfer its ownership to another company.
 Malta Enterprise told it to transfer its shares to Vitals Global Healthcare, Dalli says. Why should the company have second-guessed or doubted Malta Enterprise? Why should Taomac have suspected anything untoward? 
 10.06am Lawyer Veronique Dalli, whose client Taomac Ltd is contesting the prima facie case against it, tells the court that the only mention of Taomac in the inquiry was by court-appointed expert Miroslava Milenovic. 
 Milenovic has played a key role in various complex inquiries in Malta: in 2023, one of the defendants in this case, Keith Schembri, argued that she was biased as she held a political role in an anti-corruption party in her native Serbia. 
 10.02am There’s some irritation by defendants about what they feel is a double standard at play.
 Lawyer Chris Cilia says that while defendants have been very carefully respecting the magistrate’s order to not comment on the case, the same cannot be said of Jason Azzopardi, who has been busy commenting on Facebook. 
 Magistrate Montebello says he should file a court application about that. 
 Cilia is prickly about it: OK, he says, we will file one. But the person who wrote on social media went ahead without a court application. “This cannot go on,” he says.
 9.56am Well, this is awkward. Ivan Vassallo, who is intrinsically linked to the three companies that Azzopardi no longer wishes to represent, says his lawyer's decision to quit that brief has caught him by surprise. 
 He tells the court he does not have the means to appoint a lawyer to represent the companies. So now they will be represented by a legal aid lawyer.
 9.53am The hearing begins, and it starts with lawyer Arthur Azzopardi informing the court that he is renouncing his brief as lawyer of Technoline, Gateway and Eurybates - three of the companies facing charges.
 He will remain involved in the case as the lawyer representing Ivan Vassallo and Brian Bondin. 
 9.51am The first stage of the case was the arraignment, when defendants pleaded not guilty to criminal charges and the court imposed freezing orders on their assets. 
 We've now moved to the pre-trial stage, where the magistrate is hearing evidence collected against the defendants and deciding whether it is sufficient for the case against them to proceed. 
 By law, the court has 30 days to do so. And that deadline is getting awfully close in this case. 
 If Magistrate Rachel Montebello decides that the case should proceed, she will issue what is known as a prima facie [at first glance] decree - essentially a legal statement that there are sufficient grounds for defendants to undergo criminal proceedings. 
 We might get a prima facie decree today. 
 If/once the court does so, the compilation of evidence stage continues as normal. And then a second, albeit longer, clock starts ticking: prosecutors have 20 months to finish presenting their evidence against the accused and file a bill of indictment.
 9.47am Good morning and welcome to this live blog. It's a packed courtroom, and how could it be otherwise? There are 14 defendants, their lawyers, prosecutors, journalists and onlookers all crammed into the room, which is the largest courtroom in Malta.

"Marsaskala man used barber's shop for drug deal, court told",maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/129732/marsaskala_man_used_barbers_shop_for_drug_deal_court_told,14-06-2024,002779.png,"A 25-year-old man from Marsaskala was remanded in custody Friday, on charges related to the trafficking of cocaine and cannabis, while Drugs Squad investigations continue into information discovered on his mobile phone.
 Police Inspectors Mark Mercieca and Jonathan Cassar charged the man, whose name was banned from publication, to protect ongoing investigations into third parties, with trafficking and aggravated possession of both cocaine and cannabis, as well as with recidivism.
  Lawyer Kathleen Grima, assisting the defendant, informed the court that her client would be pleading not guilty and requested bail.
 Inspector Cassar objected to the latter request. He explained that when the man was arrested, together with the drugs, the police had also seized his mobile phone, the contents of which, he said,  “opened a Pandora's box as it showed there was a whole business operation going on.” The police couldn't exclude further arraignments at this stage, he added.
 The defendant would use a barber’s shop for drug deals, where a weighing scale with a suspicious residue had also been found, added the inspector.
 Grima counter-argued that the drugs hadn’t been found in the shop but in the defendant’s pockets and pouch and that the defendant had provided the police with the mobile phone's password, and had also given them the weighing scale himself.
 “The alleged traces on the scales, he is saying, is residue from bleach he uses for hair treatments.”
 Together with bail, Grima requested a temporary order of supervision.
 ""The mobile phone is there. The messages are there. So if there is a message saying Cikku Peppi did something, nothing he can do is going to change this.""
 “The prosecution has not identified any third parties, so we cannot detain my client because the police have not carried out investigations,” argued the lawyer, also telling the court that the recidivism charge was about a €40 fine which had been imposed four years ago.
 ""The amounts are relatively minimal. 14g cocaine and even less cannabis, “ Grima said. “They fit the criteria for a drug court, perfectly.""  Inspector Mercieca confirmed the amounts were small, but added the defendant was ""not a novice."" Besides the block of cannabis resin, several sachets of cocaine had been found, ready for distribution, together with other sachets containing cannabis which were also ready for distribution, he said. ""The risk of evidence being lost is real. Preventive arrest is a tool that can be used to protect ongoing investigations, and further arrests are a possibility.
 Grima used this last bit of information as a springboard to request a ban on the publication of the defendant's name. The prosecution agreed with the request for the publication ban, due to ongoing investigations into third parties who might also be witnesses in these proceedings. The court upheld the request and imposed the ban.
 On bail, The defence argued that a trend was forming where people were being arraigned before police investigations were finished. “God forbid that we deny an individual their freedom in order for the police to carry out investigations. I know the two police officials in front of me are very experienced and have, in all likelihood, already started these investigations into third parties.”
 ""I am saying that this blessed mobile phone which my client gave the password to, cannot be used as a rod on my client's back...We cannot remain at the mercy of the investigating police officers.""
 After hearing the parties' submissions on bail, the court moved to reject the request for the man's release from custody due to the real risk of tampering with evidence. Magistrate Critien, however, instructed the prosecution to bring their witnesses without delay.  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police
Court decrees Melvin Theuma's phantom job testimony inadmissible,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/132348/court_decrees_melvin_theumas_phantom_job_testimony_inadmissible,18-11-2024,002783.png,"A court has ruled that Melvin Theuma's testimony on his phantom job is inadmissible after he refused to face cross-examination.

 The decision follows a request from the defence of the individuals facing charges linked to providing Theuma with a phantom government position. Theuma’s refusal to testify has raised questions about  his legal protections under a presidential pardon.

                     A court has ruled that all of Melvin Theuma's testimony related to a case involving a phantom job is inadmissible after he refused to undergo cross-examination.

 This decision followed a request made by the lawyers representing Keith Schembri, Yorgen Fenech, and three other individuals, who are facing criminal charges for their alleged roles in providing Theuma, a self-confessed middleman in the murder of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, with the fictitious position.

 In separate proceedings, Theuma testified that he was given a government job five months before Daphne Caruana Galizia’s assassination and later met with Keith Schembri, the former chief of staff at the Office of the Prime Minister, at Castille. Based on his testimony, police filed charges against Schembri, along with Yorgen Fenech, who is awaiting trial as an alleged accomplice in the murder.

 Also facing charges are Sandro Craus, former head of customer care at OPM, Anthony Mario Ellul, ex-private secretary to the family ministry, and Anthony Muscat, the former CEO of the state-owned Housing Maintenance and Embellishment Co Ltd. All five are pleading not guilty to theft and misappropriation of public funds.

 When called as a witness in the proceedings, Theuma refused to undergo cross-examination by the defendants’ lawyers. After being warned by the court about his right not to answer self-incriminating questions, he chose not to respond to any inquiries. This led to uncertainty over whether he was still protected by the presidential pardon granted to him in relation to the Caruana Galizia murder case.

 On the witness stand, Theuma opted to exercise his right not to incriminate himself and declined to testify. Theuma, who had previously admitted in separate criminal proceedings to having played a role in the murder of Daphne Caruana Galizia, claims to have done so at Fenech’s behest. He had been granted a presidential pardon in return for his testimony against Fenech in criminal proceedings related to the murder.

 During those proceedings, Theuma had told the court that five months before the murder took place, he had been given a job by Schembri at the Housing Maintenance and Embellishment Co Ltd, for which he drew a salary, despite never actually showing up to work.

 The situation persisted when Theuma was summoned back to the witness stand on other occasions, with the latest being in May last year. Upon taking the witness stand before Magistrate Monica Vella, Theuma had kept replying that he would not answer the questions he was being challenged with.

 On 13 November 2024, Magistrate Monica Vella delivered a detailed decree stating that Melvin Theuma’s refusal to undergo cross-examination violated several legal principles, leaving the court with no choice but to grant the defence’s request to exclude his testimony.

  

 In her ruling, Magistrate Vella emphasised that cross-examination is a ""sacrosanct right"" of the defendant, and that Theuma had a duty to testify. She further noted that his lawyer should have clarified that there was no reason for him not to do so.

 As the court could not confirm whether Theuma was protected by the pardon, any uncertainty was resolved in favour of the accused. Theuma’s refusal to testify breached several legal principles, including the defendant’s right to cross-examination, equality of arms, and full disclosure.

 Consequently, the court declared his testimony inadmissible. The court further ordered the removal of this testimony from the case records, including those from the magisterial inquiry, which had been submitted as evidence.

Carer denied bail after alleged sexual assault on ex-partner,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/130815/carer_denied_bail_after_alleged_sexual_assault_on_expartner,20-08-2024,002800.png,"A 25-year-old carer has been remanded in custody after he was arraigned in court Tuesday, accused of sexually assaulting his ex-partner and mother of his children.
 The Filipino defendant, who lives in Msida, pleaded not guilty to charges of rape, holding the alleged victim against her will, committing a non-consensual act of a sexual nature, causing her to fear violence and subjecting her to sexually degrading acts,  as well as attacking and slightly injuring her.
  Police inspector Colin Sheldon, prosecuting together with lawyer Cynthia Tomasuolo from the Office of the Attorney General, told Magistrate Rachel Montebello that the defendant had been in a five-year relationship with the alleged victim, and had fathered her two infant children.
 Last month, the man had ignored the woman’s refusal when he had tried to initiate sex with her and had raped her. The court was told that on another occasion, when the woman had also refused to have sex with the defendant, he had groped her instead.

'Tomorrow it could be anyone': Lawyers' warning on Vitals' freezing orders,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/tomorrow-anyone-lawyers-warning-vitals-freezing-orders.1094308,21-06-2024,002806.png,"The prosecution is “strongly resisting” a call by the defence to substantiate its request for millions-worth freezing orders stemming from the Vitals inquiry, and then relying on “rubber stamping” by the court, lawyers argued on Friday. 
 “We’re living in a country where the prosecution is requesting freezing orders, then when asked to support that request, they object,” lawyer Franco Debono said in the closing stages of Friday's four-hour-long hearing.
 Former health minister Chris Fearne, Central Bank governor Edward Scicluna and 12 other individuals facing criminal charges allegedly linking them to the fraudulent hospitals concession were back in court today. 
 Parallel proceedings against former Prime Minister Joseph Muscat and other top figures took place on Wednesday and Thursday.
 A number of those charged alongside Fearne and Scicluna, namely Deborah Anne Chappell, Kevin Deguara, Kenneth Deguara, Jean Carl Farrugia and DF Advocates, were being targeted by freezing orders in the range between €14 million and €40 million. 
 The prosecution’s request for those orders is still being hotly debated and more arguments are expected before a final decision is taken by Magistrate Leonard Caruana in the coming weeks.
 As Friday’s session drew to an end, defence lawyers assisting those accused targeted by such freezing of assets minuted a request to have one of the prosecution team who filed criminal charges on oath to face questions about how they reached a decision on such freezing orders. 
 But that request prompted objections by the prosecution. 
 Attorney General lawyer Rebekah Spiteri argued that the law does not call for evidence to support the prosecution's request for freezing orders. 
 Following recent amendments to the law on proceeds of crime, the prosecution is now bound to quantify the amount to be frozen. 
 But that request sufficed and the legislator did not impose any further obligation on the prosecution to support its request with evidence at this early stage of the proceedings, argued the AG lawyer. 
 That objection sparked some animated arguments by the defence. 
 “This could happen to anyone. Today it’s these,” rebutted Debono, gesturing towards the accused seated at the back of the hall.
 “Tomorrow it could be anyone out there,” warned the lawyer.
 Lawyer Stefano Filletti said that after the recent amendments, the court must no longer be a rubber stamp, taking up his colleague's argument. 
 “Let’s hope that they [the prosecution] assessed the matter carefully and are morally convinced of their request. Now they must carry responsibility for this request,” Filletti said.
 The defence could not even understand how the prosecution reached such conclusions nor why different amounts were being sought in respect of different co-accused. 
 Such freezing orders “crucified” the persons targeted.
 The prosecution had to face questions to indicate what transactions led them to issue such a request and how they calculated the amounts to be frozen. 
 Maltese law was mainly modelled on the UK Proceeds of Crime Act introduced in 2002, pointed out further Debono, citing case law on the subject.
 Before upholding such request for a freezing order, the court must perform a test.
 Applied to the Maltese context and specifically to the Vitals case, the court had to assess the prosecution’s request and “we expect a detailed decree,” argued Debono, as one of the lawyers assisting DF Advocates. 
 “These are most serious matters that cannot be taken lightly… if a person’s assets are frozen for a year or more, the prejudice is irremediable.” 
 Drawing a comparison to warrants of seizure or garnishees issued in civil proceedings, lawyer Franco Galea noted that nowadays the courts request evidence in support of such warrant requests. 
 “And that’s in civil proceedings, let alone in criminal proceedings.” 
 “If we simply throw such requests in the court’s lap, and the court simply upholds the request, we would be reducing the court to a mere rubber stamp,” argued Galea, stressing that courts are “the shield of citizens and the accused.”
 “The bottom line is that the prosecution is asking for a €20 million freezing order and resisting forcefully our request to put questions. That’s the grave situation before this court,” reiterated Debono. 
 “And have we forgotten the principles of natural justice and fundamental rights?” added Filletti. 
 More arguments on this subject are expected in the coming sessions.
 On Thursday, the court informed the parties that a formal request for an extension of the time limits for the compilation of evidence had been put to the President of the Republic in terms of law. 
 That allowed some breathing space for the court to hear more evidence as requested by both parties before delivering a decision on whether there was a case to answer based on that prima facie evidence.
 The case continues next week.

Trespasser who left note and cannabis outside Helena Dalli's home jailed,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/trespasser-left-note-cannabis-outside-helena-dalli-home-jailed.1102210,12-09-2024,002817.png,"A trespasser who left a threatening note and parcel of cannabis on Helena Dalli’s doorstep has been sentenced to a one-year jail term. 
 Travis Francis Xuereb, 30, from St Venera later told police that he had gone to the former European Commissioner's home by mistake, thinking it was the residence of Irish mixed martial artist and boxer Conor McGregor. 
 Xuereb said that he simply wanted to deliver a gift and meant no harm. 
 He was subsequently charged with trafficking cannabis and possession of the drug under circumstances denoting that it was not solely for personal use. 
 He was also charged with trespassing at the Dalli's private residence.
 Other charges related to previous incidents when he harassed a female TV personality, misuse of electronic communications equipment, breach of bail and recidivism. 
 Xuereb, who was filmed depositing the note and cannabis thanks to CCTV cameras, registered an admission. 
 His lawyers requested a pre-sentencing report.
 Following that report and upon the accused’s own admission the court, presided over by Magistrate Yana Micallef Stafrace, condemned Xuereb to a one-year effective jail term.
 The court also imposed a three-year treatment order and protection order in favour of the Dalli couple and the TV personality for an equal term.

Court raps mother for 'manipulating' minor daughter into making sex abuse claims,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/court-raps-mother-manipulating-minor-daughter-making-sex-abuse-claims.1100448,11-01-2024,002825.png,"A court deplored a woman’s vengeful attempt at ruining her ex-partner’s life by manipulating her young daughter into claiming that he had sexually abused her.
 The man was cleared of non-consensual sexual acts in respect of the minor, following four years of court proceedings triggered by a report that his former partner lodged weeks after the couple broke up on Christmas Eve 2020. 
 The woman later turned up at the Ħamrun police station claiming that her ex, Vinc Sammut, used to make unwanted and inappropriate advances towards her minor daughter, kissing her face and touching her legs. 
 The woman said that that was why she decided to end their six-and-a-half-year relationship. 
 The report was relayed to the police Vice Squad and investigations kicked off. 
 Sammut denied the allegations, saying that he kissed the girl’s face and only touched her knee when she insisted on sitting in the front passenger seat of his car.
 But he never had any bad intentions and treated the girl “as though she were his own daughter.” 
 The man also claimed that he was the one who broke off the relationship with the girl’s mother who continued to pester him for weeks. 
 Sammut pleaded not guilty to committing non-consensual sexual acts with the minor. 
 When delivering judgment the court concluded that there was no “tangible and concrete evidence” to support the accusation.
 Evidence put forward by the prosecution had “several inconsistencies and shortcomings.”
 The case rested on the credibility of the minor and her mother who testified, corroborated by the scarce evidence put forward by the prosecution. 
 The court questioned why the mother had filed the report after her years-long relationship with the accused had ended if she had been aware of these acts happening to her daughter. 
 Would a mother tolerate such abuse without filing a police report immediately, the court asked.
 When questioned by the defence, the woman admitted that she had filed the report weeks after the breakup after getting to know that her ex’s new girlfriend had filed another report against her.
 The court presided over by Magistrate Claire Stafrace Zammit, observed that the former couple had a “turbulent” relationship.
 The woman was jealous of her partner because he treated her own daughter better than she did. 
 When all was considered the court held that the versions of the minor and her mother, although consistent throughout “down to the minutest detail,” were not credible. 
 The accused had tried to establish a paternal relationship with the girl.
 Over four years of court proceedings, the prosecution could have summoned other witnesses to corroborate the alleged victim’s version and that of her mother.
 The victim’s sister, aunt and social workers could have shed light on the case.
 Did the prosecution know that its case lacked the essential elements to succeed and thus did not produce those witnesses, the court questioned. 
 The court pronounced an acquittal, stating that it “deplored the fact that the child’s mother decided to use her daughter to take revenge against the accused in an attempt to ruin his life.”
 Lawyer Roberto Montalto was defence counsel.

Court orders Vitals inquiry experts to testify about freezing order amounts in Shaukat Ali Vitals case,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/130509/court_orders_inquiry_experts_to_testify_about_freezing_order_amounts_in_shaukat_ali_vitals_case,31-07-2024,002859.png,"Two of the forensic accounting experts who assisted the magisterial inquiry into the fraudulent concession of three public hospitals to Vitals Global Healthcare are to testify about how they arrived at the multi million euro figures subsequently frozen from the defendants.
 The Criminal Court, presided by judge Edwina Grima, heard submissions on the case filed by Pakistani businessman Shaukat Ali Chaudhry and his wife, Asia Parveen Shaukat, in which they are challenging the “seize and freeze” orders in criminal proceedings emerging from the magisterial inquiry into Vitals Global Healthcare.
  One such order freezing €30 million had been imposed on Shaukat Ali Chaudry and another €20 million freezing order imposed on his wife when they were arraigned on charges of money laundering, trading in influence, misappropriation, promotion and active participation in a criminal organisation and corruption, earlier this month.
 On Wednesday morning the court rejected his request for a constitutional reference, with the judge describing it as ""vexatious."" The judge asked about the defence’s request that she hear evidence to justify the amounts frozen. “Regarding the values there appears to have been no contestation on your part,” remarked the judge.
 Lawyer Shazoo Ghaznavi, assisting the couple together with lawyer Jessica Formosa, replied that the way the law was drafted meant that the respondent could not contest the amount at that stage. “The court is bound to issue either a temporary or a permanent freezing order and clearly sets out that if you want to contest you have to go to the Criminal court.” 
 He asked that the court hear testimony from key individuals involved in the financial aspect of the inquiry, naming forensic accountants Miroslava Milenovic and Joan Rice, as well as experts Jeremy Harbinson and Dr. Samuel Sittlington.
 Prosecutor Shelby Aquilina from the Office of the Attorney General, opposed this request, arguing that the law does not allow for further evidence to be brought at this review stage. Aquilina argued that the freezing order is a provisional measure meant to prevent asset dissipation and that the appropriate stage for challenging evidence is during the compilation of the case, not the review.
 But, noting that the Proceeds of Crime Act granted the Criminal Court the power to decide whether or not to issue the seizure and freezing order requested by the prosecution, the judge partially upheld the defence’s request, allowing Milenovic and Harbinson to testify at the next sitting. The judge clarified that their testimonies would be limited to the determination of the amounts involved and would not be allowed to stray into the merits of the case.

Court rejects Romanian arrest warrant for 'prince' arrested in Malta,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/129292/court_rejects_romanian_arrest_warrant_for_prince_arrested_in_malta,20-05-2024,002883.png,"A court has rejected Romania’s extradition request for a disputed member of its royal family, who was recently arrested in Malta on a European Arrest Warrant, ruling that there was a real risk of his fundamental rights being breached if he were to be returned.
 75-year-old Prince Paul Philip Al Romaniei, also known as Paul Lambrino, who lives in Italy, had been visiting Malta to attend an international ceremony organised by the Knights of St. John, only to be arrested in the middle of it, in front of international dignitaries, his lawyer Jason Azzopardi told the court. 
 Lambrino fled Romania in 2020 after being sentenced to three years and four months in jail by a Romanian court, which had found him and 17 other defendants guilty of having, together with a gang of con-artists, guilty of corruption-related offences, including trading in influence, as well as aiding and abetting a crime, when he attempted to “recover” properties which he claimed ownership of as heir to the Romanian royal family.
  The Romanian State argued that Lambrino had no right to the properties, and estimated the damages caused to the State to be in the region of €145 million.
 Last November, a French court also refused to extradite him, ruling that he was at risk of political persecution. 
 Then-Communist Romania had expelled its royal family in 1947, with all its properties being confiscated by the State. Lambrino’s uncle Michel, the last king of Romania, did not acknowledge him as part of the royal family and died in 2017. He claims that the real motivation behind his prosecution are his attempts to reclaim his royal inheritance, consisting of property, land and classic artworks.
 Magistrate Leonard Caruana declared that there was “a real risk” that the prince would suffer a breach of his fundamental rights if he were sent back to Romania and rejected the EAW. Lambrino will remain in custody for the next three days, until the Attorney General decides whether or not to file an appeal.  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police

 The court dismissed the FIAU’s argument that the decision could not be reviewed since it happened while Ferris was under probation. 
 The FIAU was appealing a decision by an industrial tribunal, which concluded in Ferris’s favour last October. It argued that both employer and employee have the right to terminate employment without giving any reason during the term of probation and that the tribunal, therefore, had no jurisdiction to review the matter.
 However, that argument was shot down by the Court of Appeal which declared that at all stages of employment, including in the early period of probation, a worker had the right not to suffer any discriminatory treatment. 
 Interpreting the law in any other way would “give rise to a worker’s abuse at the hands of his employer,” observed Mr Justice Lawrence Mintoff when handing down judgment on Friday.
 That meant the tribunal’s decision awarding Ferris €20,000 in compensation for the discrimination suffered upon dismissal from his managerial post at FIAU in 2017, was wholly confirmed. 
 The former police inspector, whose name was synonymous with several major financial crime investigations, took up the position of Head of Unit at the FIAU on November 1, 2016. 
 On June 16, 2017, he was fired following a unanimous decision by the FIAU Board of Governors on the recommendation of the FIAU director.
 In a statement issued after that dismissal, the FIAU claimed the decision was “based solely on an objective and comprehensive performance assessment.”
 But Ferris claimed otherwise, insisting that that decision was politically motivated and that such discriminatory treatment in his regard was not acceptable in a democratic society. 
 Trouble for Ferris brewed when FIAU reports about suspected financial wrongdoing at the now-shuttered Pilatus Bank were leaked to the media. 
 That was when the investigator was no longer trusted, unlike fellow officials, including three new analysts, who shared the same password as Ferris. 
 In fact, the whole team shared that password, although the system could detect any login and any changes effected. Yet, all suspicions fell on Ferris as the one who had leaked those reports. 
 On May 2, 2017, two days after seeing the Pilatus report drawn up by the compliance analyst, Ferris was instructed to steer clear of any investigations concerning the bank. His superiors claimed he had a conflict of interest since he had investigated and arrested former Pilatus employee, Maria Efimova, for alleged fraud against the bank.
 However, he was still to retain his position as Head of Unit, Ferris was told. 
 But after that date, he was sidelined in all FIAU discussions concerning politically exposed persons. Other members of the team were not. 
 Upon dismissal, Ferris filed proceedings against the FIAU before the Industrial Tribunal. His former employer claimed that Ferris’s arguments were frivolous and not proved, and that since termination took place during probation, that decision could not be reviewed in terms of law. 
 However, the tribunal observed that during probation an employer cannot do as he pleases simply because the employee is still on trial. 
 As for the applicant’s claims of discrimination, the tribunal observed that Ferris’s colleagues at the FIAU had not faced the same fate. 
 The tribunal failed to understand how the FIAU claimed not to be satisfied with Ferris’s performance, yet at the same time kept him on as Head of Unit, even when the leaks began. 
 It concluded that there was no proof that Ferris was responsible for those leaks. 
 In its appeal, the FIAU argued the tribunal had ignored its preliminary plea on jurisdiction.
 Ferris had linked his allegations about discrimination “expressly and limitedly” to the issue of dismissal. He had never filed any other proceedings about discrimination at the workplace but only raised that argument when fired. 
 But Ferris was still on probation and during that term either party could terminate the contract without having to give any reason. 
 Jurisprudence on this point was clear and the law was “unequivocal” too, argued the FIAU. 
 For this reason, the tribunal was wrong in rejecting its plea and also on the merits because it failed to explain why it ultimately gave more weight to Ferris’ version, saying that it was more credible. 
 Ferris rebutted both arguments.
 The court said Ferris’s claims were clearly based on discrimination, not unfair dismissal. 
 A reading of the law clearly showed that the worker has a right not to suffer discrimination and that right is not limited in any way, said the judge. 
 There was no doubt that the legislator wanted to ensure that the worker would suffer no discrimination at any stage and that included during the probationary period. 
 If those provisions were to be understood in any other way, it could give rise to abuse of workers at the hands of employers.
 An employer could impose discriminatory conditions on the worker who would have to bear up with them simply in hope of securing his job once his probation was over, but instead, the worker is fired. 
 Such discrimination would reflect the discrimination the worker endured during employment, observed Mr Justice Mintoff, throwing out the FIAU’s argument as “unjustified.”
 As for the appellant’s second argument on the merits, the court declared that Ferris was correct in saying that such appeal was limited to points of law. 
 The court abstained from taking cognizance of this second argument, and confirmed the tribunal’s decision in its entirety. All expenses were to be borne by the FIAU. Lawyers Jason Azzopardi, Eve Borg Costanzi and Andrew Borg Cardona assisted Ferris.

Arrest connected to 700g heroin bust declared invalid by court,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/arrest-connected-700g-heroin-bust-declared-invalid-court.1091685,28-04-2024,002915.png,"A 39-year-old man who was arrested in connection with a 700g heroin bust has had his detention by the police declared null after a court determined that police had not met the sufficient requirements to arrest him. 
 Stefano Montebello was one of three men arraigned on Sunday over a drug bust the police made after stopping a car in Buġibba that turned out to be full of sachets that looked like they had been packaged ready to be sold. 
 The car was being driven by 50-year-old Pierre Cremona.
 Montebello was in the car with him at the time. 
 The vehicle was searched and yielded what was suspected to be cocaine and heroin. 
 With Cremona and Montebello in tow, police went on to search a residence in Mosta, where they also found the older man’s 24-year-old son, Owen Cremona. 
 At the Mosta home police discovered a bag thought to contain some 700g of heroin, a Les Baer pistol, bullets and other drug-related paraphernalia. 
 All three men were charged with heroin possession not intended for their personal use, unlicensed possession of a firearm and recidivism. 
 Pierre Cremona and Montebello were also charged with cocaine possession, while Pierre was separately charged with breaching previous bail conditions. 
 All three pleaded not guilty to the charges. 
 Defence lawyers Franco Debono and Adreana Zammit objected to Montebello’s arrest, because, they argued, his arrest at the time did not adequately satisfy all the requirements as stipulated by the law. 
 While police had obtained a warrant for the arrest of the father and son, one had not been obtained for Montebello, they said.
 Additionally, Montebello claimed that police had not informed him of the reason why he was being arrested, something that is also evident from the police body cam footage that was exhibited in the disclosure. 
 The criminal code, they added, stipulates that a person must be explicitly informed that they are being arrested and why they have been placed under arrest in order for the detainment to be considered valid. 
 After hearing arguments from both sides, Magistrate Rachel Montebello ruled in favour of the defence and declared that by virtue of not disclosing the reasons for the arrest, then Montebello’s arrest must be declared illegitimate. She ordered his immediate release. 
 Requesting bail for Owen Cremona, the defence said that while the heroin had been found at the Mosta residence, the police had yet to sufficiently prove whom it belonged to. 
 Save for a couple of traffic fines, the young man had an otherwise clean criminal record, they said, adding he was willing to live at a separate address with his mother. 
 The prosecution objected to bail due to the nature of the crime and because Owen Cremona was also charged with recidivism. 
 The court granted Owen bail against a deposit of € 2,000 and a personal guarantee of € 10,000. He was also ordered to observe a curfew and not approach civilian witnesses. 
 A bail request for Pierre Cremona was summarily rejected by the court, which cited his criminal record as the primary reason why. 
 Inspector Jonathan Pace prosecuted.

Worker injured after dumper truck overturns in Qala residence,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/132801/worker_injured_after_dumper_truck_overturns_in_qala_residence,16-12-2024,002934.png,"A 49-year-old man was taken to hospital with grievous injuries after an accident with a dumper truck in Qala.

 At around 11:15am on Monday, the police were informed of an incident at a private residence on Triq l-Imġarr, Qala.

 The police immediately went to the scene, and preliminary investigations revealed that the man was carrying out work with a dumper truck in the garden of the residence. He lost control of the vehicle, which overturned.

Man denies assaulting policeman but tearfully recants after bail is denied,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/man-denies-assaulting-policeman-tearfully-recants-bail-denied.1094574,27-06-2024,002939.png,"A man who initially denied charges of assaulting a policeman who tried to give him a ticket, tearfully recanted and admitted to the charges on Thursday after being denied bail.
 Greek national Theodoros Vrakas was arraigned before Magistrate Gabriella Vella, over a spat he had with a police officer on Wednesday.
 Police Inspector Roderick Attard told the court that St Julian’s police had received a call about a white van that was parked irregularly, obstructing traffic. A police sergeant was dispatched and found Vrakas in the van. When he attempted to issue him a ticket an argument broke out.
 Attard said that while the incident was captured on CCTV, it was unclear whether Vrakas had punched the officer in the face or pushed him away aggressively. He was subsequently arrested.
 When asked how he was pleading to the charges, Vrakas’ legal aid lawyer, Brandon Kirk Muscat, entered a guilty plea. But protestations from the accused, who claimed that he had never been arrested and was not guilty, caused concern from the court, which asked him to be sure. “Are you sure he’s pleading guilty?” Magistrate Vella asked. “I cannot ignore what is happening right in front of me,” she said when Muscat told her the client had earlier informed him he intended to admit.
 Vrakas was given time to reconsider and consult with his lawyer, with the pair returning to the courtroom to plead not guilty.
 The prosecution objected to a request for bail, citing chiefly that the area where the altercation occurred was too close to Vrakas’ place of work and that some of his workmates had witnessed the incident. This Attard said, posed a manifest risk of tampering with evidence.
 The defence rebutted that these risks were not tangible and could be sufficiently curtailed by the court imposing restrictions on the accused. Should he be remanded in custody, it would severely impact his ability to work, the lawyer said.
 The court agreed that the risk of tampering with civilian witnesses was credible and denied the request for bail.
 This, however, did not sit well with the accused, who, as he was being handcuffed and escorted out of the courtroom, became visibly upset as he tried to reason with both Attard and his lawyer.
 As the court continued to hear other cases, Vrakas could be heard sobbing outside the courtroom as the two men tried to placate him.
 Sometime later, the inspector and the defence lawyer reappeared before the magistrate and asked if it would be possible to reopen the case, as Vrakas had decided to plead guilty.
 In between her other cases, Magistrate Vella acceded to the request and annulled the minutes. This time, she found Vrakas guilty on his own admission. Considering his clean conduct and his early admission, Vrakas was sentenced to a one-year jail term suspended for two years and fined €1,000 to be paid in four instalments.

"Trafficked sex workers saw over 2,000 clients in three months, court hears",maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/131014/trafficked_sex_workers_saw_over_2000_clients_in_three_months_court_hears,03-09-2024,002941.png,"Over 2,000 men had visited a flat in Msida that was being used as a brothel, between March and June this year, a court was told today, as the compilation of evidence against seven Maltese men and a Romanian man and woman, accused of human trafficking continued.
 Inspector John Spiteri from the police Vice Squad continued his testimony, telling Magistrate Donatella Frendo Dimech how a further 200 clients had attended another brothel in Gżira between July 30 and August 12. 
  Luke Farrugia (36), Clint D’Amato (36), Denzil Farrugia (19), Alexandra Suhov Procora (32), Nicolae Efimov (37), Kane Vassallo (22), Luca Emanuele Corito (21), Dylan McKay (30), and Gordon Cassar (44), are accused of money laundering, promoting or setting up a criminal organisation, forcing individuals into prostitution, holding persons as bonded debtors, and knowingly living off the earnings of prostitution.
 Some of them are also charged with human trafficking for exploitation, assisting in trafficking, and running a brothel. Luke Farrugia and Dylan McKay are further charged with using services from trafficked individuals, with McKay facing further charges related to committing crimes during a suspended sentence and recidivism. D’Amato is also accused of possessing cocaine with intent for distribution.
 Cross-examined on the stand today, inspector Spiteri confirmed that McKay would regularly visit one of the sex workers as a paying client.
 August 12, targeting multiple locations across Malta, including properties in Birkirkara, Gżira, St. Paul’s Bay, Siġġiewi, Fgura, Gudja, Raħal Ġdid, Ħaż-Żebbuġ, and Isla. The police operations were a result of ongoing investigations into human trafficking and prostitution rings operating within the country.
 Spiteri told the court that the women found in the various properties across Malta had all given the police the same account of how they ended up in Malta. They claimed to have met a woman who encouraged them to come to Malta, and work as escorts. The work was described as keeping men company, during social events or meals, and they had been told that it would be up to them to decide whether they wanted to provide additional paid services of a sexual nature to those men.
 That same woman had given her mobile phone number to the victims and instructed them to save it as a contact under the name 'Ghost'. Investigators noted that Farrugia himself had given that contact number to the police with respect to previous cases. WhatsApp chats between Kane Vassallo and Luke Farrugia were also found on the device, he said.
 Farrugia would use the pseudonym 'Thiago', he said, adding that the police had found conversations between the trafficked women and 'Thiago' informing him how many clients they had seen and how much money they had made in a night. 
 Inspector Spiteri told the court that Dylan Mckay had organised a promotional photoshoot at a hotel, in St. Julians. The police had questioned the photographer in question, who informed them that McKay had engaged him to take a set of photos of the woman, which were to be uploaded to a website advertising their services.
 In one text conversation between one of the victims and Clint D'Amato, the woman had asked D'Amato for guidance about how to handle a client who wanted to have unprotected oral sex. The woman did not want to go along with the request, but in his reply, D'Amato had angrily replied that her job was to “keep the customers happy.”
 The police investigations revealed that Luca Corito and Denzil Farrugia would sometimes take the women to the customers, and that Nicolae Efimov and Alexandra Pocora would keep an eye on live feeds from cameras installed both inside and outside the property. 
 The defence objected when Inspector Spiteri told the court that during her arrest, Pocora had admitted her involvement in the organisation and had indicated Luke Farrugia as the mastermind.

Family of murder victim Chantelle Chetcuti demand justice amid trial delays,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/132612/family_of_murder_victim_chantelle_chetcuti_demand_justice_amid_trial_delays_,04-12-2024,002946.png,"The family of Chantelle Chetcuti has filed a judicial protest to what they describe as intolerable delays in the trial of her alleged murderer, Justin Borg.

 Chantelle, a 34-year-old mother of two, was killed in February 2020 in a brutal attack that shocked the nation. Four years later, the trial has yet to begin, leaving her grieving family struggling to find closure.

                     Chetcuti's relatives, including her father, siblings, and two young daughters, have filed a judicial protest against the Attorney General, the State Advocate, and the Registrar of the Criminal Court. In their filing, they expressed their frustration over the stalled proceedings and accused the authorities of neglecting their duty to uphold justice.

 The family revealed that Borg had been granted permission by the court to travel abroad four times a year and to take weekend breaks. They also noted reports of domestic violence by other women against Borg during the intervening years. The family argued that these decisions showed a lack of consideration for the pain endured by victims and their families. 

 The protest notes that Miriam, her mother, was a key witness to instances of abuse and violence that Chantelle suffered at Borg’s hands before her death.

 The judicial protest also shed light on the traumatic experiences faced by Chantelle’s children. Her daughters, the filing states, have suffered severe emotional and psychological distress due to the prolonged legal process and the lack of resolution in their mother’s case.

 The family has called for immediate action to address the delays, safeguard the wellbeing of Chantelle’s children, and ensure justice is served. They also criticised the intimidating court process, which often required them to wait in the same space as the accused.

 The protest was filed by lawyers Lara Dimitrijevic and Stephanie Caruana on behalf of Chantelle’s family.

 Visits to inmates at CCF are normally subject to strict controls and always take place in designated halls, under the watchful eyes of prison warders.
 MaltaToday wrote to the Minister for Home Affairs, Security and Employment, Byron Camilleri, on Saturday requesting an update on the investigation into the Correctional Services Agency’s Head of Strategy, Svetlana Muscat.
  Muscat remains on forced leave, a month after being called in for questioning by the police over allegations that she had allowed her private office at Corradino Correctional Facility to be used for meetings between individuals, described as “businesspeople,” and inmate Yorgen Fenech, who is awaiting trial, accused of masterminding the murder of Daphne Caruana Galizia.  
 Given the extensive CCTV coverage inside the facility, establishing whether or not an individual was in a particular place at a particular time would not appear to be a complex matter to investigate, yet the police investigation is still ongoing, more than a month after the issue came to light. No charges have yet been filed, either. 
 In reply to MaltaToday’s questions, an advisor from the Ministry For Home Affairs, Security And Employment said that the CSA had done what was expected of it, by reporting the claims to the police and suspending Muscat from her duties.  “Upon the initial discovery of the situation, the matter was immediately flagged to the police for their investigation, and this was before any reports in the media. Since then, the person in question has been on forced leave from her job at the Correctional Services Agency.” 
 The advisor denied the suggestion that the matter had been swept under the carpet in the hope that the issue would be forgotten or superseded by other events.
 “If someone wanted to sweep anything ‘under the carpet,’ a report would not have been filed in the first place,” he said, adding that “the Permanent Secretary within the Ministry shall be provided with the relevant outcome of the investigations from the Malta Police Force once the investigations are concluded from their end, as per standard practice.”  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police

 A 26-year-old plumber, Elton Zammit, was arraigned on Wednesday to face over 20 charges related to money laundering, drug trafficking, fraud, breaching trademarks and misuse of electronic equipment.
 The police said that investigations kicked off after an anonymous tip-off about an advert on TikTok where the seller was advertising fake branded watches, with payment requested only in cash, allegedly for money laundering purposes.
 The investigations revealed that the suspect was also advertising the illegal installation of beacon lights and sirens on private vehicles.
  Zammit was arrested while at the wheel of a motorcycle equipped with beacon lights and an activated siren. The vehicle was unregistered and unlicensed.
 A search of his residence yielded fake watches, bags and jewellery, beacon lights and sirens.
 The police also found cans of pepper spray prepared for sale, and €16,350 in cash locked in a safe.
 They also seized what appeared to be fake credit cards and counterfeit euro banknotes, payment for which was being made by cryptocurrency.
  The suspect was also involved in dark web sales of drugs in Malta and abroad.
 During the arraignment before Magistrate Rachel Montebello, Zammit pleaded not guilty.
 The defence requested bail, to which the prosecution did not object as long as appropriate conditions were imposed on the accused.
 Magistrate Montebello granted bail, subject to a deposit of €3,000 and a personal guarantee of €5,000, while also ordering Zammit to sign the bail book three times a week. The magistrate also imposed a freezing order requested by the prosecution.
 Lawyer Alessia Schembri and Yvette Borg Cardona from the AG’s office, together with police inspector Clive Abela prosecuted. Lawyers Matthew Xuereb, Alex Scerri Herrera and Jose Herrera appeared for Zammit.

Man charged with raping ex-fiancé remanded in custody,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/128916/man_charged_with_raping_exfianc_remanded_in_custody_,29-04-2024,003052.png,"A 27-year-old Norwegian man has been remanded in custody, accused of the rape of his ex-fiancé.
 The man, who resides in St. Julians, was arraigned before magistrate Caroline Farrugia Frendo, charged with rape, detaining the woman against her will, committing non-consensual acts of sexual nature, slight bodily harm, insulting and threatening her and with causing her to fear that violence would be used against her.
 Inspector Nico Zarb, who is prosecuting the case together with inspector Audrey Micallef and lawyer Cynthia Tomasuolo from the Office of the Attorney General, told the court that the woman had visited the St Julian’s police station at 4pm on April 27 to report that the defendant, her ex-fiancé, had raped her in his apartment the night before, after refusing to let her leave.
  The couple had been engaged for two years, but had broken off the engagement. In spite of this, they had been having consensual sex “on and off” for the past six months, the court was told.
 The woman told the police that they had agreed to meet at his apartment so that she could collect the engagement ring and return a small amount of money that she had borrowed from him.
 The man was arrested yesterday by police officers from the Domestic Violence Unit.
 Lawyer Franco Debono, defence counsel, together with lawyer Marion Camilleri, asked the inspector whether the man had denied the allegation during his interrogation.
 In his first statement, he had refused to answer any questions, replied the inspector, but had released a statement during his second round of questioning, after changing his lawyer.
 A plea of not guilty was entered and a bail request was made, to which the prosecution objected on the grounds of the serious nature of the charges and the man’s capacity to abscond, as well as due to the fact that the main witness had not yet testified. It was an “extremely premature stage,” in the proceedings, argued the prosecution.
 Debono pointed out that his client had resided in Malta for the past three years, had a fixed address and was gainfully employed, telling the court that he begged to differ on the point of insufficient ties for bail purposes.
 “He gave his explanation and is strongly denying the charges, and had already done so in his second statement,” said the lawyer. Debono insisted that the encounter between his client and the alleged victim had been consensual, telling the court that after ending their committed relationship, the pair had agreed to be “friends with benefits.”
 “At one point in time she decided that there was no consent,” said the lawyer. “She took this decision after he informed her that he did not want to see her anymore because she was also seeing other men,” Debono told the court.
 “You can’t come here and say there is a risk of tampering with evidence without even giving a reason why,” argued the lawyer, stressing that a magisterial inquiry had already collected and preserved the evidence, including the woman’s testimony.
 The court rejected the bail request and ordered the man to be remanded in custody, sending the acts of the case to the registrar with the instruction that it be assigned to a magistrate as soon as possible.
 A ban on the publication of the names of both the victim and the defendant was also imposed.  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police
Two men charged over Swieqi hammer attack,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/130617/two_men_charged_over_swieqi_hammer_fight,06-08-2024,003056.png,"Two men have been charged over a hammer attack on a man in Swieqi, which was allegedly preceded by an argument over money for a vacuum cleaner.
 Prosecutor Nicole Sladden and Inspector Michael Vella, arraigned 33-year-old Nebojsa Glavnik and 32-year-old Filip Bakocevic Alissa, both of whom are from Serbia and who reside together in Swieqi, before magistrate Abigail Critien on Tuesday afternoon.
 Glavnik told the court that he worked as a part-time waiter, barman and occasional water delivery driver. Bakocevic said he worked as a cleaner. Both men pleaded not guilty.
  In a press statement issued earlier on Tuesday, the police said that officers had been dispatched to Triq il-Modd in Swieqi in response to a call for assistance at around 11:30pm on Sunday, August 4.
 At the scene, they were told that an argument had broken out between two Ukrainian men and two Serbs, that a hammer had allegedly been used and that the Serbs had fled the scene. An ambulance had taken the Ukrainians to hospital where one of them, a 27-year-old man, was found to be grievously injured. The other man’s injuries were classified as slight.
 The alleged assailants were arrested at a residence in Swieqi, from which the police seized a number of items as evidence.
 Lawyers Shazoo Ghaznavi and Jessica Formosa assisted the two defendants.
 After establishing who had arrested the men and the time at which the arrests had taken place, Ghaznavi did not contest the validity of the arrest.
 It is understood that the fight was about a dispute over money for the purchase of a vacuum cleaner, although this did not emerge in court. In view of the objections, Ghaznavi gave the defence’s account of what had led to the incident. “The two accused were at their residence. The alleged victims had been told not to come there. The alleged victims attacked the accused outside their house.
 The accused have injuries themselves and have been living in Malta for a substantial amount of time. Nebosa has been here for seven years and has a clean conduct sheet. They told the police everything about the incident in the statement. The fight stopped because the defendants said ‘enough’ and went up to their apartment. 
 “They had gone to calm the situation down, telling the other men ‘go away, we will talk tomorrow when you are not drunk.’”
 The accused did not have any interest or reason to approach the alleged victims, argued the lawyer. Neither was there any indication as to how or why they could tamper with the evidence. He argued that bail is the norm and incarceration the exception. ‘There is no such thing as too early, as soon as you’re locked up, as soon as you’re arraigned within those 48 hours, you can request bail.”
 “I cannot legally appreciate the reason for which these people can be refused bail.” Fear that they approach the victims? Approach for what? It was the victims who came to beat them up”
 The Court interjected, pointing out that the argument dealt with the merits of the case, which would be handled at a later stage.
 “[It is unfair] To deprive them of their liberty because [the alleged victims] live in Swieqi,” argued the lawyer. “Sliema, Ibraġ…distances in Malta are all relatively short.”
 The court, after hearing submissions by both parties, acceded to the request for bail.
 But before that, the Court first issued protection orders in favour of the two alleged victims, ordering the defendants not to communicate with the alleged victims in any way. “It is as if they do not exist.”
 Bakocevic told the court that he had lost a pouch with his passport and ID cards “at the Beerfest.” “So you have absolutely nothing?” I have to contact my embassy.”
 Because the documents had only allegedly been lost recently, the court ordered, as part of his bail conditions, that as soon as a new residence permit and passport are issued, they are to be immediately filed in the acts of the proceedings.
 Besides the protection order. Each defendant’s compliance with their bail restrictions was secured by a €2,000 deposit and a €3,000 personal guarantee.  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police
MP warns against Andrew Tate for normalising ‘concerning attitudes’ to women,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/mp-warns-andrew-tate-normalising-concerning-attitudes-women.1096792,16-08-2024,"003062.png,003063.png","Equality junior minister Rebecca Buttigieg has spoken out about the impact of social media influencers like Andrew Tate for “normalising highly concerning attitudes towards women”.
 The Labour MP’s comments to Times of Malta come days after  Nicolette Ghirxi was found stabbed to death in her Birkirkara flat, allegedly by her ex-partner Edward Johnston.
 In his last YouTube video, Johnston had spoken out in support of Tate, who has amassed millions of followers for his divisive content and is detained in Romania as part of a human trafficking and rape investigation.
 Buttigieg, who helped usher in changes to Malta’s criminal code that mandated higher penalties for people found guilty of femicide, spoke out against toxic messaging on social media.
  “The new form of very effective viral content is not only normalising highly concerning attitudes towards women but also towards men’s mental health,” she said.
 “This is even more concerning when promoted by public figures, such as Andrew Tate, and politicians who normalise such behaviour.”
 Buttigieg said she was very concerned about how widely disseminated and easily available sexism and misogynistic rhetoric is becoming.
 “We must continue to condemn these attitudes while ensuring that respect and equality remain a priority,” she said.
 “There is a strong need for responsible leadership and effective education to dismantle stereotypes.”
 Tate, a former kickboxer, rose to fame for promoting a hyper-masculine, materialistic lifestyle. He denies charges of human trafficking and being part of an organised crime gang in Romania. In some of his most popular videos, Tate says rape victims must “bear responsibility” for their attacks and that wives are the property of their husbands.
 Johnston, 50, who was shot dead by the police after he pointed a fake gun at them on Monday, saw Tate as “a very successful man” who was falsely accused for speaking the truth.
 In one of the last videos he uploaded, Johnston warned viewers that things had become “real, real serious” with global elites working to oppress “the common man”. He claimed that the few public figures “who are trying to be honest with the world and telling the people how this world is run”, including Tate, British comedian Russell Brand, who faces allegations of rape and assault, and former US president Donald Trump, are being “taken out” by false allegations.
 “Don’t you find it funny that the most heinous of allegations is any kind of sexual allegation so the Tate brothers – human trafficking, sexual abuse, etc, etc. – same with Russell Brand,” he asked his followers.
 
 In the months before the murder, Johnston had been harassing Ghirxi. His behaviour included setting up fake accounts showing pictures of her in lingerie and making allegations about her sex life.
  He posted her address on social media and told her employer, HSBC, that she should be fired.
 Ghirxi had complained multiple times to the police about the harassment.
 In an e-mail exchange made public by her lawyer, Johnston mocked officers who summoned him for questioning last April, telling them he was abroad to “top up my tan” and would be back for some “fun in the sun” in July.
 Ghirxi, who has been described as a “vibrant soul” by her family, was found dead in her apartment on Monday. She will be laid to rest on Saturday.

Couple charged with importing liquid cocaine remanded in custody,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/132796/couple_remanded_in_custody_after_allegedly_importing_liquid_cocaine,16-12-2024,003064.png,"Two individuals were remanded in custody after allegedly importing  more than 6kg of liquid cocaine into Malta.

 Jason Adrian Perez Penafiel, 28, and Jennifer Yadira Intriago Molina, 35, both Ecuadorian nationals, were charged with the importation of drugs as well as the possession of drugs not intended for personal use.

                     Both pleaded not guilty to the charges brought against them.

 The Court was told that on Saturday evening, the drugs squad was informed by customs officials that a number of bottles filled with a white liquid containing cocaine were found in luggages belonging to the accused, who had arrived from Lisbon.

 The couple had also been taken to Mater Dei due to suspicions that they were carrying further drugs in their stomachs. Subsequent tests however returned negative results.

 No request for bail was made at this stage.

 Schembri, Chief of Staff to disgraced former Prime Minister Joseph Muscat, Muscat’s former health and energy minister Konrad Mizzi as well as Muscat himself have individually been slapped with  “seize and freeze” orders.of €30 million each as part of criminal proceedings in which they are charged with a bevy of offences which include money laundering, fraud and making fraudulent gain, as well as conspiracy to commit an offence and participating in a criminal organisation with more than 10 members. 
  They are also being charged with accepting bribes and corruption while in public office. Muscat’s disgraced former Chief of Staff Keith Schembri is accused of soliciting bribes and abuse of his office.
 Konrad Mizzi, Clarence John Conger Thompson, Mario Victor Gatt, MTrace plc, Karl Cini, Nexia BT, Brian Tonna, David Joseph Meli, Keith Schembri, Kasco Engineering Company Limited  and FSV Limited had filed constitutional proceedings, alleging breaches of several rights, amongst them that of equality of arms.
 In a judgement handed down earlier today, Mr. Justice Mark Simiana said that it had not been proven that the defendants would suffer any fundamental human rights as a result of the orders.
 “It is true that [the legal pathway to vary the amounts subject to seize and freeze orders] does not appear to grant the accused the right to contest the legal basis for the order, but it is a remedy which leads to variation in its extension and all of its effects. One has to wait and see, in the actual case and not hypothetically, whether this remedy…is an effective remedy to the person accused.” said the judge, rejecting the argument that the amounts frozen were disproportionate, while pointing out that the defendants could request a variation at any stage of the proceedings. 
 It is understood that the defendants intend to file an appeal.

Pilatus Bank inquiry to be presented at Muscat’s libel against Caruana Galizias,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/pilatus-bank-inquiry-presented-muscat-libel-caruana-galizias.1092742,20-05-2024,003083.png,"A court has upheld a request by Daphne Caruana Galizia’s heirs for a copy of the proces verbal drawn up in the Pilatus Bank inquiry to be presented in evidence in Joseph Muscat’s libel  proceedings against them.
 That document was the last piece of evidence sought by the assassinated journalist’s husband and sons in their bid to defend themselves against the defamation claims filed by the former Prime Minister over a story published by Caruana Galizia in 2017. 
 In that article first published in her Running Commentary blog, the journalist alleged that the secret offshore company Egrant belonged to Muscat’s wife, Michelle. 
 That story had prompted Muscat to request a magisterial inquiry to investigate those claims. 
 The inquiry, conducted by then-Magistrate Aaron Bugeja, concluded that there was no documentation linking Muscat’s family to the Panama secret company, with the UK-based forensic accounting firm appointed to assist in the inquiry, also failing to find any evidence linking the Muscats to Egrant Inc on the servers of the now-shuttered Pilatus Bank. 
 Following Caruana Galizia’s murder in October 2017, Muscat testified in the libel proceedings, stating that he would drop the cases filed against the journalist and her son Matthew, if the heirs accepted the conclusions of the Egrant inquiry. 
 The Caruana Galizia family refused to do so, saying that they would not bow to “extortion from our public servants”.
 Last year, the journalist’s son testified that they were unable to defend themselves against Muscat’s libel claims since the main witness was dead and her heirs did not have access to her sources. 
 “We’d need a miracle or my mother to come back to life to break free of that prejudice,” Matthew Caruana Galizia had said.
 The family’s lawyer, Joseph Zammit Maempel, then filed a request for the proces verbal drawn up by Magistrate Ian Farrugia at the Pilatus inquiry to be presented in evidence.
 Muscat’s lawyer, Pawlu Lia, had objected, arguing that the request was simply intended to further prolong the proceedings. 
 The court, presided over by magistrate Victor George Axiaq, delivered a decree in chambers upholding the defendants’ request and ordering the Registrar of the Civil Courts to be summoned to produce the document. 
 Since “evidence may have been gathered” during the Pilatus inquiry which could be relevant to the subject matter of the libel, the proces verbal was to be produced, decreed the magistrate. 
 On Monday, Muscat’s lawyer questioned that decision and made reference to a recent decision delivered by Mr Justice Toni Abela in the Opposition’s Vitals case wherein the judge reserved strong criticism for the leaking of criminal records.
 Such leakage of secret court documents was liable to prosecution, Lia stressed, quoting Judge Abela on the subject. 
 Criminal records were only accessible to the public when read out in open court.
 “This proces verbal [about Pilatus Bank] has not been read out in any courtroom to date, as far as I’m aware,” argued Lia, drawing a comparison to the Egrant inquiry. 
 In that case, the conclusions were made public and those were related to Muscat’s libels against Caruana Galizia. 
 “The other proces verbal [about Pilatus Bank] has no relation to this story.” 
 Moreover “the person making the allegations had testified three times before the magistrate in the Egrant inquiry, saying all she had to say about this. So the proces verbal should not shed further light on what she said back then,” went on Lia. 
 “That’s your view. The court does not agree,” said Magistrate Axiaq. 
 “What is the reason for this request? What is the purpose of proof, ”asked Muscat’s lawyer. 
 “Be reasonable,” said the magistrate. “After all, this case was filed with urgency. It’s also in the interests of your clients. It could be that evidence emerges from the Pilatus Bank proces verbal.”
 Lawyer Joseph Zammit Maempel, assisting the defendants, pointed out that the Pilatus inquiry was to be presented in ongoing civil proceedings filed by NGO Repubblika against the Attorney General.
 Madam Justice Doreen Clarke upheld Repubblika’s request to that effect and the inquiry was to be presented at the next sitting in mid-June. 
 Meanwhile, the defendants summoned former Repubblika president Robert Aquilina to testify about the Pilatus inquiry. 
 “Notary Aquilina is present outside,” Zammit Maempel informed the court. 
 But Muscat’s lawyer again cited Judge Abela.
 “Legally speaking, he [Aquilina] cannot testify because if he states that he got them [his information] from [the Pilatus inquiry] then that means that he breached the law,” said Lia. 
 “Now the person who divulged that information comes across as a hero,” went on the lawyer, promptly rapped by the magistrate who pointed out that such comments were not tolerated. 
 “Why is this proces verbal relevant to this case,” reiterated Lia. 
 “Because what happened at Pilatus Bank reflects on Egrant,” retorted Zammit Maempel. 
 The court deferred the case to July for the registrar to present a copy of the Pilatus report on a USB pen drive. 
 Lawyer Peter Caruana Galizia also represented the defendants.

"Man escapes out of police station window, is promptly re-arrested",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/man-escapes-police-station-window-promptly-rearrested.1102401,13-12-2024,,"A wanted man caught by Żejtun police gave them the slip by escaping through a window at their police station last week, a court has heard.
 Ian Zammit, a 35-year-old Żejtun resident currently unemployed, was quickly apprehended and detained once again following a tussle with officers. 
 He was taken to court and charged in connection with that escape on Thursday.
 The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon, when police acted on a magistrate's instructions to arrest Zammit for failing to attend a court sitting.
 Zammit was out on four sets of bail conditions at the time.   
 At around 3:00pm, he was arrested and detained at the Żejtun police station. Officers explained the reason for his arrest, presented him with the warrant and read out his legal rights. 
 But soon after, he opened a window, slipped through and made a run for it, police chasing at his heels.
 Two officers ordered Zammit to stop and he did, but put up a struggle.
 In the tussle that followed, one of the officers suffered slight injuries. His uniform trousers were also ripped in the struggle to arrest the fleeing man. 
 On Thursday, the now-calm and composed Zammit was escorted to court and charged with violently resisting the two policemen, slightly injuring one of them, wilful damage to third party property, escaping from police custody as well as relapsing. 
 He was further charged with breaching four sets of bail conditions. 
 He pleaded not guilty.
 Defence lawyer Franco Debono made a request for bail, arguing that in this case the main witnesses were police officers and thus there was hardly any fear of tampering with evidence. 
 Besides, the incident was preserved on the officers’ bodycams.
 However prosecuting Inspector Wayne Bonello countered that a civilian who was present at the police station and witnessed the incident was still to testify. 
 Moreover, the defendant had an unruly character as indicated by his criminal record and the four sets of bail. There was no guarantee that he would obey court conditions if he were to be granted bail again, argued the prosecutor.
 After hearing submissions the court, presided over by Magistrate Yana Micallef Stafrace, upheld the prosecution’s arguments and remanded the accused in custody. 
 Inspector Wayne Bonello prosecuted. Lawyers Franco Debono and Marion Camilleri were defence counsel.

Cleaner charged with vandalising walls at Grand Master’s Palace granted bail,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/132726/cleaner_charged_with_vandalising_walls_at_grand_masters_palace_granted_bail,11-12-2024,003120.png,"A court has granted bail to a cleaner accused of vandalising the Grand Master’s Palace, with strict conditions imposed on his whereabouts and a substantial amount of money to cover his bail deposit and personal guarantee.

 Amrit Bhatta, a 23-year-old cleaner, was accused of using chemicals to create permanent markings on the walls and stone slabs of the Grand Master’s Palace has been released on bail under strict conditions, despite objections from the prosecution.

                     The Police Inspector said in Court that the people who manage the Grand Master’s Palace submitted a report to the police station on 10 December 2024. They said the accused, who carries out cleaning services at the palace, drew on the walls and stone slabs using cleaning chemicals. 

 In court, the accused admitted that it was indeed him who did the drawings but was not aware that the drawings would be permanently visible. The Court considers that he pleaded not guilty “for all intents and purposes”.

 The defence asked that the accused is released on bail.

 The prosecution objected because the crime happened at the place of work and there might be the risk of the tampering of evidence. Furthermore, there is an issue with the residence permit since it expires on Wednesday (today). The inspector said in Court that he was informed that the accused was asking his employer to renew his residence permit, but his employer did not renew it yet.

 The prosecution added that, should the man be granted bail, his employment status is still uncertain and might lead to the accused committing more offences to sustain his lifestyle.

 The defence argued that the man is not employed with the Grand Master’s Palace, but with a separate cleaning company that cleans various locations. Further to this, his lawyer said that the man has been here for a year and has not had any issues with the law. 

 The Court acceded to the defence’s bail request on the grounds that the man does not approach the prosecution’s witnesses, and that he reports daily to the police station closest to where he resides.

 He must also not leave his residence between 10:00pm and 6:00am, along with depositing €2000, and a €5000 personal guarantee.

 The prosecution was led by Inspector Gabriel Micallef, lawyers Giuliana Magro Conti and Nicholas De Gaetano on behalf of the Attorney General, and Kenneth Cauchi as the Superintendent for Cultural Heritage.

Man charged with trafficking cocaine... while on bail for trafficking cocaine,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/130598/man_charged_with_trafficking_cocaine_while_on_bail_for_trafficking_cocaine,05-08-2024,003152.png,"A man who had been accused of killing a pedestrian while driving under the influence of alcohol and cocaine three years ago was remanded in custody today on charges of cocaine trafficking and money laundering, allegedly committed while already on bail for similar offences.
 Police inspectors John Leigh Howard and Jonathan Pace arraigned Wayne Buttigieg, 44, before magistrate Jean Paul Grech on Monday, accusing the man of trafficking cocaine and possession of the drug in circumstances which indicated it was not solely for his personal use. Buttigieg was also accused of money laundering and breaching previous bail conditions.
  Buttigieg, who had been residing at Xemxija in St. Paul’s Bay at the time, pleaded not guilty to the charges.
 Buttigieg had already been on bail in connection with the discovery of half a kilogram of cocaine in 2021, which he was charged with trafficking, together with another man.He is also charged, in separate proceedings, with  running over and killing a woman who had been crossing the road, while driving under the influence of cocaine and alcohol. There was no bail involved in that case, however, as he had been arraigned by summons.
 The court was told how the police had received information about drug trafficking, in which Buttigieg, who was already known to the police, was alleged to be involved. He was arrested at his home in Xemxija, which was then searched by the police, as was his garage.
 One hundred grams of white powder, suspected to be cocaine, weighing scales, resealable bags and a small amount of suspected cannabis were found. In addition to the drugs and associated paraphernalia, officers found €27,000 in cash, as well as several gold watches and rings.  The defendant had admitted to the police that he would occasionally sell drugs, but had insisted that this was only to finance his own addiction to drugs.
 Lawyer Josette Sultana, assisting Buttigeig, told the court that her client effectively had no bank account because of the freezing order and requested that he be granted bail. 
 The prosecution objected to that request, arguing that although there were no civilian witnesses to be protected, the case was still a serious one. It was argued that although the man had cooperated with the police, he was already on bail for similar charges which, together with the fact that the investigations were still at a very early stage, militated against bail.
 Magistrate Grech rejected the request, noting the serious charges against the defendant and expressed serious doubts about whether he could be trusted to stick to further bail conditions, while being charged with breaching others.  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police

 36-year-old Simon Camilleri from Zabbar appeared in the dock before magistrate Lara Lanfranco on Wednesday, accused of hunting a protected species during the closed season, without a hunting licence, as well as using a firearm without a licence.
  Camilleri was further charged with inflicting slight injury to another man through negligence, and recidivism. The court was also requested to confiscate the weapon and revoke any licence that had been issued to the defendant.
 A protection order for the victim was also requested.
 The defendant was observed to break down in tears a number of times throughout the sitting and was consoled by his mother, who was sitting next to him.
 Camilleri, who told the court that he was employed by the Cleansing Department, admitted the charges.
 When asked by the court whether he wished to confirm his plea he did, tearfully, asking the court to “go easy on me.”
 Inspector Kitcher in his submissions on punishment said the defendant had cooperated with the police and admitted guilt at an early stage. He told the court that he had no objection to a “punishment at the minimum of legal parameters.”
 Lawyer Yanika Barbara Sant, defence counsel, told the court that her client had been snail- picking with his father. “Although hunting is his passion, he didn’t intend to go out hunting. He knew that he can’t hunt anymore but at that moment, for a split second, his brain thought otherwise.”
 Barbara Sant said the defendant was very sorry for his actions and hadn’t intended to hurt anyone. “He happened to be in a field which is owned by his family and spotted a turtle dove, shooting at it instinctively. He didn’t know that anyone else was in the vicinity.”
 The shotgun was not his, but was registered to his father, added the lawyer, saying that this showed that the incident was unplanned. “He had no intention of causing damage to anyone,” insisted the defence.
 In between bouts of pitiful sobbing in the dock. Camilleri told the court that his sister was getting married in a few weeks and that he was very worried about missing it.
 The defendant had also been hit with seven pieces of birdshot fired by the other hunters, added the lawyer. “They shot at him to kill him” piped up Camilleri’s mother from the back of the courtroom.
 The magistrate asked the lawyers to approach the bench to discuss the case privately, in view of the man’s many previous brushes with the law.
 In 2013, a court had banned Camilleri from holding a hunting licence for life, upon his admission to several charges relating to illegal hunting.
 He had been fined €3,000 in 2020, after being found guilty of having hunted birds during the closed season, five years before.
 That same year Camilleri and his father, Carmelo, had also been convicted shooting at three other hunters with a shotgun registered to the father.
 The court of appeal had told Camilleri that it was going to give him his last chance and reduced his three-year prison sentence to two years imprisonment, suspended for two years, together with a €2,000 fine and a lifetime ban on holding a hunting licence.
 The defendant is understood to have also been arrested on suspicion of cocaine possession at the Zejtun’s village feast last month, although no mention of this was made in open court.
 Finding no legal reason not to accept the man’s admission of guilt, Magistrate Lanfranco, the court sentenced Camilleri to imprisonment for 20 months, together with a fine of €7,000, which he may pay in monthly instalments
 The court also ordered that the shotgun used be confiscated and noted that the man’s licences had already been revoked. A two-year restraining order in favour of the victim was also issued.
 The court explained to the defendant that he could not contact or approach the victim or engage third parties to do so in the next two years, on pain of further charges which carried with them a potential two-year prison sentence and €7,000 fine.
 “Can’t be helped,” Camilleri said before being led out of the courtroom, seemingly having made his peace with the prospect of incarceration.
 “Is there a treatment for hunting addiction? I would go for that,” were his last words to the court.

Man remanded in custody after breaching protection order,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/132381/man_remanded_in_custody_after_breaching_protection_order,20-11-2024,003160.png,"A man has been remanded in custody after breaching a protection order by messaging his ex-partner.

 The accused is a 23-year-old man from Syria living in Marsascala.

 Testifying in court on Wednesday, a police inspector recalled how on 18 November at around 11:30 pm a woman, the victim, went to a Domestic Violence shelter on the basis of a report filed by the victim against her ex-partner.

 The victim’s ex-partner, the accused, was reported for allegedly breaching a protection order in favour of the victim by a judgement on 30 October 2024.

 According to the inspector, the accused started messaging the victim on WhatsApp. Among the messages he had sent her was a message saying he still loved her, the inspector said.

 The police went to the man’s residence in Marsaskala but he was not there. Later, he was found and arrested near a Mosque.

 The inspector said the accused cooperated with the police and the defence is not contesting the validity of such arrest.

 Following the arrest, police took a statement from the accused in the presence of the his lawyer. During this statement he said that three days prior to the arrest, the victim had actually sent the accused messages, despite the restraining order.

 The accused pleaded not guilty to the charges brought against him, with the defence requesting bail.

 The prosecution countered the defence’s request for bail and told the Court that the accused has no legitimate document tying him to Malta. Whilst he was given notice to stay in the country until 12 March 2024, according to the prosecution, no permission appears to have granted the accused to remain beyond this date.

 The defence also noted that certain messages were automatically deleted by WhatsApp, suggesting that the victim breached the protection order first.  “Who went against the protection order first? The accused, or the victim?”, the defence asked, arguing that the pending status of the accused is not a sufficient enough reason to state that bail should not be granted in his favour owing to a lack of fixed ties to Malta.

 The Court decided to issue a protection order in favour of the accused, prohibiting him from contacting the victim in any way.

 The accused’s brother took the stand, stating that he has lived in Malta for the past six and a half years, presenting his driving license as proof of identity. He further testified that he is self-employed and willing to aid his brother financially if the Court granted him bail. The accused’s brother also confirmed that the accused was not listed on the lease agreement.

 Defence lawyer Nicholas Mifsud argued that the alleged victim lit a fire by contacting the accused, then complained about the smoke produced by the fire she herself had lit.

 He argued that the pending status of the accused is not a sufficient enough reason to state that bail should not be granted in his favour owing to a lack of fixed ties to Malta.

 The Court, presided by Magistrate Rachel Montebello, denied the request for bail due to the reasons cited by the prosecution. The accused was remanded in custody.

 Lorraine Vella, 52, from Bormla, was arraigned before Magistrate Noel Bartolo by Inspector Sarah Kathleen Zerafa, accused of recidivism and a number of offences relating to dangerous and reckless driving, in addition to the drugs charges.
  The inspector told the court that during the night between Sunday and Monday, a police patrol in Marsa had noticed a Skoda breaking the speed limit and had tried to pull it over. But when the driver had noticed the police car, she had increased her speed, while also being observed throwing something out of her window. The police managed to stop the car in Marsa, but the woman behind the wheel had refused to get out of the vehicle and drove off instead. 
 The police gave chase and eventually succeeded in stopping the Skoda once again, in Ħal Tarxien. Weighing scales, a packet of a brown substance suspected to be heroin, as well as €1,400 in cash were recovered from the woman’s car.

 Vella pleaded not guilty to the charges.
 Her lawyers, Ishmael Psaila and Maria Sarah Vella Gafa informed the court that bail was not being requested, instead asking the court to order that the defendant be treated for drug addiction whilst in custody.

Suspended jail term after guilty plea for man who rammed Magħtab house with Mercedes,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/131426/suspended_jail_term_after_guilty_plea_for_man_who_rammed_magtab_house_with_mercedes,27-09-2024,003186.png,"A man who rammed his car into a Magħtab residence gate on Wednesday, was handed a suspended sentence after registering an admission on all charges.
 Michael Camilleri, 41, from Qormi was charged with wilful damage to third-party property, insults and threats beyond the limits of provocation, causing fear of violence, and negligent, reckless and dangerous driving. He was also charged with misuse of electronic equipment.
  Police officers at the Naxxar police station were alerted to an incident on Triq St Klara on Wednesday evening, where Camilleri, driving a Mercedes car, had rammed the vehicle into the gate of a farmhouse. Two shots rang out and the car backed away before more shots were fired.
 The police said investigations as to who fired the shots were still ongoing but the shots “were not fired by Camilleri”.
 Camilleri was arrested at 2am when he turned himself in at the Qormi police station, where he proceeded take the police to the site in Baħar iċ-Ċagħaq where his black car was parked, the front riddled with gunshots.
 While Camilleri named two other people allegedly involved in the shooting, the court was told investigations were still ongoing.
 After confirming his admission, the court condemned Camilleri to a one-year jail term suspended for three years, a €3,000 fine and a three-month driving ban.
 He was also issued a restraining order not to approach the two men and three female relatives who were at the Magħtab house, and ordered to reimburse €500 for the damage caused to their property.
 Two of the alleged victims, a father and son, are likely to face separate charges over the incident.

Shaukat Ali lawyers ask for constitutional reference over €30 million freezing order,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/130423/shaukat_ali_lawyers_ask_for_constitutional_reference_over_30_million_freezing_order,26-07-2024,003190.png,"A Criminal Court judge is expected to rule next week on a request to refer a fundamental rights issue raised by the man alleged to be at the centre of the VGH hospitals scandal, to a court of constitutional jurisdiction. 
 The constitutional reference was requested by lawyers Shazoo Ghaznavi and Jessica Formosa on behalf of Shaukat Ali Chaudry, Mount Everest FZ LLC, Global Assets Holdings Limited, and Shaukat’s wife, Aasia Parveen Shaukat, in a sitting before Madam Justice Edwina Grima earlier today. 
 Shaukat Ali Chaudry had been slapped with a seize and freeze order for the sum of €30 million and another order to the tune of €20 million imposed on his wife when they were charged with money laundering, trading in influence, misappropriation, promotion and active participation in a criminal organisation and corruption, earlier this month.
 The judge was hearing submissions on the Attorney General’s request to convert the temporary freezing and seizing orders already issued by the Court of Magistrates as a Court of Criminal Inquiry, to permanent ones. 
 The couple’s assets had been placed under a temporary seizing and freezing order upon their arraignment. The purpose of a freezing order is to stop a person accused of a relevant crime or the crime of money laundering from disposing of the monies or property which is derived from criminal activity.
 The law allows the Attorney General seven working days after that, to file an application to the Criminal Court, requesting that the temporary order be converted to a permanent one, and this is what the AG has, in fact, done. The defence lawyers are arguing that the Proceeds of Crime Act does not contemplate any contestation of seizing and freezing orders once they become permanent.
 The defence counsel flagged the possibility that Aasia Parveen Shaukat could potentially suffer a violation of her fundamental human rights to property and to a fair hearing, and asked the Criminal Court to refer the matter to the First Hall of the Civil Court in its constitutional jurisdiction. 
 “If this court were to uphold the request for a permanent freezing order, there is no way that she can contest it,” Ghaznavi said. “The law does not envisage the possibility of contesting a permanent Seize and Freeze order.”
 As this potentially breaches the right to a fair hearing, especially the principle of equality of arms, together with the right to enjoy property, the lawyers asked the Criminal Court to refer the matter to a court of constitutional jurisdiction for a ruling. They also asked that an effective remedy be granted if a breach is found.
 The judge adjourned the case to Wednesday for a ruling.  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police

 The defendant was arraigned before magistrate Abigail Critien on Thursday on charges of having caused the woman to fear that violence would be used against her or her property, assault and misuse of electronic telecommunications equipment.  The woman had abandoned her holiday and returned to Malta the next day, with the man being arrested upon his return, a few days later.
 The case was discussed privately by the lawyers for the parties and the magistrate, out of hearing range of the public in the courtroom. 
 After the parties returned to their places in the courtroom, the man pleaded guilty, confirming his plea after being given time to reconsider.
 Bail was requested after the court announced that it would be handing down judgement on Tuesday.
 The prosecution did not object to the defence’s request for bail pending sentencing.
 The man was released from arrest against a €500 deposit and a €2,000 personal guarantee, with the court ordering the man to observe a curfew.

‘The last thing my son saw was the face of a murderer’: mother opens up,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/the-last-thing-son-saw-face-murderer-mother-opens.1096865,18-08-2024,"003201.png,003202.png,003203.png","Four years after her son was murdered at his Sliema home, a “horrible vision” still plagues his mother – the thought that the last thing he saw was the face of a killer.
 Sandra Wild opened up with Times of Malta on the fourth anniversary of her son’s murder, describing August 18, 2020, as “a normal day [that] turned into a nightmare we will never recover from”.
 “I have a permanent ache in my heart. A full night’s sleep is something that happened a long time ago. There is a horrible vision which plays on in my mind. It is a vision I will carry with me forever, along with the terrible sadness that the face of a murderer was the last thing my son was ever to see,” she said.
 “A son who loved the beauty of what was around him and had the great gift of photographing beauty and sharing it with others. I still can’t believe this is real and that Ivor isn’t going to burst through the door with a big smile on his face.”
 Ivor Piotr Maciejowski – a 30-year-old contemporary art dealer – and his partner Christian Pandolfino were murdered in their Sliema home in what investigators believe may have been a botched robbery.
  Both died of gunshot wounds and were found lying on the ground in the upper and lower floors of the house.
 Since then, three men have been accused of the murder and one of them – Danish national Jesper Kristiansen – agreed to plead guilty and was handed a 40-year jail sentence. But the case is far from closed.
 The other two men facing murder charges – Albanian national Daniel Muka and Serbian national  Viktor Dragomanski – still await trial.
 “Four years on and so many court hearings and trial delays later, we are still living this nightmare,” Wild said.
  “I simply cannot tell you what our lives are like as we try to get through each day. The murders, the visions, the endless wait for positive news, they are in our minds all the time.
 “We live in constant hope that we get the justice that is deserved for this heinous double murder soon. Then and only then, can we grieve properly.”
 Wild last spoke with her son the night he was killed.
 “He felt the need to ring,” she said back then. “He looked so beautiful. He was sitting on the sofa and there was this lovely haze in the room.”
 She called him back later that evening, but he did not pick up, only for her other son Tom to inform her of the murder the next day.
 Later, he said it was “the hardest thing” he had ever had to do.
 “What happened on that night is beyond any sane human being’s comprehension,” Ivor’s mother recalled.
  “Ivor was a very special and unique person, wise beyond his years and had a cheeky sense of humour. He and I were extremely close. How I miss him and the lovely friendship we shared. How we all miss him as he left such a big imprint in our hearts. We love him so much.”
 A few months after the murder, Wild told Times of Malta that she immediately felt  something terrible had happened when her son called her that day.
 Four years on, the agony lingers on.
 “And so, it started – an agonising journey that no family should ever have to go through. It’s not only us, Ivor’s immediate family, that are affected. It’s his whole wider family, his friends and everyone he touched with his kindness,” she said.
 “It’s the same for Christian’s family too. There is so much pain in each of us and it’s only the strong bond, love and support that we give to each other that keeps us going.”

"Women allegedly forced into prostitution saw 2,000 clients in three months",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/women-allegedly-forced-prostitution-saw-2000-clients-three-months.1097577,09-04-2024,"003210.png,003211.png,003212.png,003213.png,003214.png","A group of Colombian women who were allegedly lured to Malta as human trafficking victims saw over 2,000 clients in three months, a court heard on Tuesday. 
 Police Inspector John Spiteri testified in the case against Luke Farrugia, 36, Clint Lawrence D'Amato, Denzil Farrugia, 19, Kane Vassallo, 22, Gordon Cassar, 44, Luca Emanuele Corita, 21, Dylan McKay, 30, Alexandra Suhov Pocora, 32, and her partner Nicolae Efimov, 37. 
 They are all facing various charges related to human trafficking and subsequently running several brothels in apartments around Msida and Gżira. All are pleading not guilty. 
 On Tuesday Spiteri described how a case police thought was simply about people who may have overstayed their visa unravelled into suspicions that the women were being used to run a brothel. 
 Spiteri showed a series of videos grabbed from CCTV footage showing several of the defendants coming and going from one of the apartments that housed four of the victims.
 Mobile data was not only integral to track the group's movement but also helped police identify Luke Farrugia as the suspected mastermind.
 Chat logs allegedly reveal Farrugia giving orders to the other members of the group, as well as other important information on how the brothel operation was run. 
 Immigration police first flagged the case on suspicion that some third-country nationals had overstayed their legitimate work permits.  
 When police raided the Msida flat, they found four women and a man, later identified as Kane Vassallo. 
 Items found during the search indicated that the flat was being used for prostitution purposes. 
 But when the women were questioned at police headquarters, a different picture began to emerge. 
  The women said that they had been approached in Colombia by “a person” who told them to save a mobile number under a contact referred to by the Spanish equivalent of “phantom boss.”
 They were sold on the promise that their new bosses would put them up in a luxury St Julian's resort for seven to ten days, where they would be free to meet with male clients. 
 Their initial expenses would be fronted by the bosses, with the women being told that they would be able to repay them through the earnings they made in Malta. 
 However, when they landed at the airport they were met by men who took them to a flat where they were to offer prostitution services to clients booked by their bosses. 
 When the time was up for them to go home, the women discovered that they had not yet made enough money to settle the debt they had accrued with their bosses, forcing them to remain in the clutches of the criminal organisation. 
 Not knowing who was the mastermind behind it all made them fearful, the women told the police. 
 When a neighbour in the Msida apartment block housing the first brothel installed a security camera near the main entrance, D’Amato allegedly warned the other members in a group chat to “pay attention.” 
  He also warned his associates not to take “friends” to the flat, telling them that he “did everything not to annoy neighbours” and to keep the activity at the flat as low-profile as possible. 
 His anger was sensed in certain messages when the other defendants failed to follow suit whenever he was not around, Spiteri explained, making detailed references to the phone data retrieved.
 
 D’Amato even took a picture of the newly installed CCTV camera and posted it in the group chat warning the others to “pay attention.” 
 Police subsequently identified various members in that group chat.
 ‘Andrés’ was D’Amato, ‘Kane’ was Kane Vassallo, ‘L’ was Luke Farrugia, ‘Baby’ was Alexandra and ‘Tyson’ was Denzil Farrugia. 
  Luke Farrugia appeared to issue instructions to the rest of the group, setting out a roster whereby Vassallo surveyed brothel operations on Tuesday morning, Denzil Farrugia on Thursday and Saturday and Alexandra took over on Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Sunday. 
 After the birth of her child, Alexandra's duties were taken over by her partner, Efimov.
 Luke Farrugia had allegedly asked two of the victims, Colombian sisters, to send him photos he could post on escort services sites. 
 His reply was a GIF showing a man splashing cash. 
 An agent who handled travel arrangements for the women’s flights to Malta subsequently confirmed that Luke Farrugia made the bookings and always paid in cash. 
  On April 2 at 8.40 pm, Luke Farrugia drove a motorcycle to the Msida block.
 He was soon joined by D’Amato, McKay, Vassallo and a third party and together they transported a truckload of furniture and appliances into the apartment. 
 Later that month, two of the victims arrived at the apartment accompanied by Alexandra. 
 Footage confirmed that for the next two months, the women never set foot outside the apartment alone, except to pick up food deliveries. 
 One of the women was accompanied to an outcall service by Corito. D’Amato dropped her back at the flat at 3.20 am. 
 The women were also accompanied to a St Julian’s hotel for a professional photoshoot.
 The photographer confirmed that McKay had paid for the service so that the photos could be posted on escort sites. 
 Between March 6 and June 11, “over 2,000 clients” went to the Msida flat, Spiteri said. 
 Another 200 clients are also estimated to have gone to the Gżira brothel between July 30 and August 12. 
 Under cross-examination, the inspector confirmed that McKay was a “paying client,” regularly visiting one of the prostitutes. 
 Each of the women was linked to a mobile number. 
 Mobile phones were kept by defendants according to their roster and used to deliver instructions to the victims.
 Live cams at the brothels allowed the defendants to keep an eye on the goings on, both inside and outside the flats. 
 When one of the women complained about a client who wanted unprotected oral sex, D’Amato angrily replied that “it was important to keep clients happy.” 
 When arrested, Alexandra admitted her involvement in the racket, allegedly pointing at Luke Farrugia as the mastermind. 
 That detail by Spiteri prompted an interruption in his testimony.
 Vassallo cast a sideways glance at Luke Farrugia who was seated beside him in the dock and then turned round to snigger at Alexandra.
 That facial expression and gesture were promptly spotted by presiding magistrate Donatella Frendo Dimech who warned Vassallo that if he repeated such behaviour, he would be ordered out while the hearing continued in his absence. 
 Asked by defence lawyer Franco Debono, the inspector confirmed that two of the alleged victims had come to Malta as prostitutes more than once, but they did so under different circumstances which they allegedly explained to police. 
 Defence lawyer Joe Giglio asked about Cassar’s involvement in luring women to Malta, accompanying them on arrival, organizing the flats and the “menu of services.” 
 Cassar did not feature in that respect ""so far"", Spiteri said, adding that more evidence was still to be put forward. 
 The case continues.
 AG lawyers Ramon Bonett Sladden and Charmaine Abdilla are prosecuting together with inspectors John Spiteri, Joseph Xerri and Dorianne Tabone.
 Lawyers Franco Debono, Marion Camilleri, Charles Mercieca, Roberto Montalto, Kathleen Calleja Grima, Joe Giglio, Michaela Giglio and Nicholas Mifsud assisted various defendants.

"Man accused of texting his ex in breach of court order, he says she initiated it",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/man-accused-texting-ex-breach-court-order-says-initiated.1101269,20-11-2024,003217.png,"A man who was accused in court of breaching a restraining order by texting his former partner, insisted in court on Wednesday that it was the woman who initiated the conversation, and he had replied to say he was not interested.
 The 23-year-old Syrian national was charged with breaching the court's order, misusing electronic equipment and breaching bail conditions related to the same case.
 He had been granted bail after having been accused on October 30 of violence against his ex-wife, who is currently living in a shelter. He had denied those charges.
 Earlier this week the woman went back to the police’s domestic violence unit, reporting that the man was contacting her on WhatsApp, in breach of the restraining order on which his bail conditions hinged.
 Prosecuting inspector Christian Cauchi told the court he had contacted the accused several times ordering him to come to the police station, but he failed to show up and was arrested.
 Cauchi told the court that the accused showed him his phone to insist that it was the ex-wife who had initiated a conversation with him some three days prior to the messages he sent her.
 Defence lawyer Nicholas Mifsud said that it was clear from the messages exhibited that it was the woman who had continued to pester the accused and that when he replied it was to tell her that he had no interest in continuing their relationship and asking her to leave him alone.  Call logs showed that the woman had used a different number to try and call the accused several times, even while she was reporting him to the police on November 18.
 The man denied all the charges brought against him and requested bail.
 The prosecution objected to bail, saying that the alleged victim was yet to testify and that the police investigation indicated that he currently had no legal permission to stay in the country.
 The defence countered that the court should consider that it was clear that his ex was initiating communication with him.
 “With all due respect to the woman, she cannot light a fire and then complain of smoke when it is convenient,” Mifsud said. He added that the woman even turned up at the accused’s brother’s house, where he was living at the time, with the family having to call the police to remove her.
 As for his immigration status, Mifsud said as the man is a Syrian national, his immigration status must be reviewed yearly by the authorities and he cannot simply be sent back to a war-torn country. The man chose not to immediately apply to renew his status due to the legal issues he was having with the alleged victim, but had since begun the process to have his status reviewed and renewed. 
 Magistrate Rachel Montebello considered that the man had been accused of breaching previous bail conditions, a risk assessment had found the woman to be in “severe danger” and his unclear immigration status. Bail was therefore denied.   
 Police inspector Christian Cauchi prosecuted. Lawyer Nicholas Mifsud appeared for the accused.

Judge raps Broadcasting Authority for failing to remedy broadcasting imbalance,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/judge-raps-broadcasting-authority.1092106,05-08-2024,003218.png,"A judge rapped the Broadcasting Authority on Wednesday for failing to provide an effective remedy after PBS did not broadcast footage of the angry scenes in and outside parliament when the vote on the Jean-Paul Sofia inquiry was taken last July. 
 Mr Justice Lawrence Mintoff found that the Nationalist Party’s fundamental rights were breached when the Broadcasting Authority failed to provide a remedy despite having found an imbalance by the state broadcaster.
 Labour MPs had voted down an Opposition motion for the holding of a public inquiry into the building collapse in which Sofia was killed.  
 Mr Justice Mintoff said the footage of what happened afterwards would “certainly have had an impact….on viewers,” and would have put the out-voted motion in a different light.
 The judge threw out the BA's preliminary pleas that the PN had failed to exhaust ordinary remedies and that it lacked juridical interest.  
 As for the merits, the judge said there was no doubt that the BA had failed to ensure impartiality when exercising its constitutional duties.
 It had heard the PN’s complaint on July 17 but then took nine days to deliver its decision, despite its urgency.
 In view of its constitutional duties towards the people, “such a nine-day delay was unacceptable,” said the court. The circumstances merited a more delicate, expeditious and urgent handling.
 “Here we are not dealing with the behaviour of some MP inside and outside the House, but the actions of a mother, father and other relatives of a youth who died when the building under construction at Corradino, collapsed.” 
 Yet the BA dealt with it as “ordinary business of the day,” the judge said.
 And when it finally delivered its decision, the BA provided no remedy “and that resulted in its second gross failure.”
 During the hearing of the case, BA chair Frank Farrugia gave no explanation for that nine-day delay. He testified that “meanwhile many problems crop up in the country and we reached a decision and delivered a decision.”
 The judge said his words reflected “total indifference” by the authority towards its own duties. 
 In circumstances where the BA itself acknowledged the importance of the matter, one would have expected not merely a remedy but a “strong reprimand” by the authority, he said. 
 Instead the BA provided no remedy and did not even explain why it had failed to do so. 
 As for PBS, it too had a duty of impartiality. 
 Yet PBS “tried to hide from public view those instances when a BA decision went against it-at least concerning a PN complaint- but not when such complaint was deemed unjustified,” the judge said. 
 The court concluded that PN’s right to freedom of expression was breached. 
 While the PN did not suffer any pecuniary damages, “non-pecuniary damages were certainly due,” the judge said. 
 The court deemed that €2000 by BA and PBS each would be “just and sufficient compensation” for the PN.
 Moreover, it ordered PBS to report a well-explained and faithful summary of the judgment, allocating a prominent spot during TVM’s 8pm news bulletin by not later than one week after final judgment.
 Lawyers Paul Borg Olivier represented PN Secretary General Michael Piccinino
 PN: Further confirmation that the people were denied the truth
 In a reaction, the Nationalist Party said the judgement was further confirmation that the Broadcasting Authority and PBS breached the people's right to be told the truth. 
 ""This is further confirmation that PBS is Robert Abela's propaganda machine,"" Opposition leader Bernard Grech said in a statement outside the law courts.

Traffic policeman charged with extra duty fraud has acquittal confirmed,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/traffic-policeman-larry-sciberras-duty-fraud-acquittal-confirmed.1098153,16-09-2024,003004.png,"A traffic policeman cleared of involvement in a large-scale racket linked to extra duties during infrastructural works on the Marsa flyover project has had his acquittal confirmed on appeal. 
 Sergeant Francis Larry Sciberras was one of many officers charged in July 2020 with alleged complicity in the massive racket which investigators said took various forms, including claims for payments for extra duties that were never carried out.  
 He was charged with alleged complicity in the fraud to the detriment of Transport Malta, Infrastructure Malta and/or the police corps, making fraudulent declarations as well as committing an offence he was duty bound to prevent. 
 He pleaded not guilty. 
 In January, Sciberras was acquitted by a Magistrates’ Court that concluded that the prosecution had “completely failed” to produce proper evidence of the fraud and of the deceit that was an essential element of the crime allegedly attributed to the defendant. 
 When all was considered, Magistrate Rachel Montebello concluded that the prosecution had failed to prove its case.
 The Attorney General appealed, arguing that the first court had wrongly assessed the law and the evidence was put forward. 
 The court, presided over by Madam Justice Edwina Grima, cited at length the appealed judgment, pointing out that the first court did not only make a “learned exposition” about the legal elements of the alleged offences but also linked those elements to the evidence produced. 
 Sciberras, a sergeant with a 29-year career in the corps, had explained his work schedule over six years at the traffic section when releasing his statements to investigators. 
 He worked shifts according to the work detail that was set by two sergeants, namely Sandra Galea Sillato and Norman Xuereb. 
 Instructions regarding extra duties were relayed to him by Xuereb as the need arose and he also received payment for those extra duties from Xuereb. 
 Although Sciberras kept a diary to record his work hours and payments, he kept no record of the extra duties which involved ‘fixed’ or ‘roaming’ surveillance to assist the flow of traffic in the areas where large-scale infrastructural projects were bound to cause chaos and disruption. 
 The defendant denied doing extra work while on normal duty. He also denied sharing payments with someone else or taking direct cash cuts. 
 Between 2018 and 2019, Sciberras received €13,464 for extra duties, of which €3,711 were allegedly undue. He had subsequently reimbursed that contested amount. 
 When all was considered, the court said that although there was sufficient evidence to show that Sciberras was ‘roaming’ on certain occasions when he should have been on ‘fixed’ duty at the Marsa traffic lights, those instances were few.
 Those few instances were his only shortcoming and his claim that he did not sense anything untoward in his payslip was credible.
 There was no evidence of some form of prior agreement with Xuereb or other police colleagues to carry out the fraud. 
 Text messages retrieved from other police officers’ mobile phones hinted at possible criminal wrongdoing, but those amounted to circumstantial evidence which alone was not enough to prove the defendant’s alleged complicity in the racket. 
 And even if Sciberras might have been aware of what was going on around him, there was not enough evidence to prove that he was actively involved.
 Moreover, Transport Malta and Infrastructure Malta, as the alleged victims, never complained about any payments they had unduly handed out for extra duties. 
 All they did was to draw the Police Commissioner’s attention to the fact that sometimes there were no traffic officers at the site where their presence had been sought.
 That complaint was immediately addressed and the complainants never asked the corps for a refund. 
 Former IM chief Frederick Azzopardi had pointed out that when traffic police assistance cropped up unexpectedly, that assistance was given by the corps for no extra payment.
 The offences attributed to the defendant were not proved, concluded the judge. 
 Failing to inform his superiors about the racket which he might have been aware of, though not involved in, was not tantamount to a criminal offence. 
 At most, he could be liable to disciplinary measures within the corps but no more, said the judge, rejecting the appeal and confirming the acquittal.

 The arraignment took place on Tuesday evening, after Maltese police carried out a series of simultaneous, early-morning raids across Malta in Birkirkara, Gzira, St. Paul's Bay, Siggiewi, Fgura, Gudja, Raħal Ġdid, Ħaż-Żebbuġ, and Isla, making 11 arrests on charges of human trafficking.
 The operation took place early yesterday morning, Monday 12 August, with eight Maltese men and one woman, and a Romanian man and a woman being arraigned the following evening.
 The defendants are: Luke Farrugia, 36, from Birkirkara who told the court that he was self employed in the maintenance and finishes trade; Clint D’Amato 36, from Gudja who works as a driver; Denzil Farrugia, 19, from Marsa a catering industry worker; Alexandra Suhov Procora, a 32-year old Romanian woman residing at St Paul’s Bay, who told the court she was an accountant; Nicolae Efimov, 37 also Romanian and residing in St Paul’s Bay; barber Kane Vassallo, 22, from Siggiewi; Luca Emanuele Corito, 21, from Isla, who refused to state his occupation; Dylan McKay, 30, a taxi driver from Fgura and Gordon Cassar, a 44 year-old maintenance worker from Żebbug.
  All nine are charged with money laundering, promoting or setting up a criminal organisation, forcing individuals over 21 years of age into prostitution, holding persons against their will in a brothel as bonded debtors, knowingly living off the earnings of prostitution and running a brothel.
 Luke and Denzil Farrugia, as well as  D’Amato,  Pocora, Vassallo and McKay are further charged with human trafficking for the purposes of exploitation, or slavery, which crime was committed through violence.
 Cassar, Corito and Efimov were also charged with assisting in the trafficking of persons for the purpose of exploitation or prostitution  ,
 Luke Farrugia and Dylan Mckay also charged with making use of services from trafficked persons. Mckay also charged with committing a crime during operative period of a suspended sentence and recidivism
 D’Amato was further charged with possession of cocaine in circumstances indicating that it was not intended for his personal use.
 Police started investigating brothel
 Police Inspector John Spiteri told the court that the police investigation had started with an investigation into a brothel, but it emerged that four Colombian girls who had been found there had also been trafficked. Initially there were doubts as to who was organising it, but the two-month investigation “showed that every person in this courtroom played an active role in this criminal activity.” 
 After questioning the women who had been trafficked, the police were able to identify who was behind the operation, he said. 
 A magisterial inquiry had also been carried out in parallel with the police investigation. When the police felt that there were sufficient grounds, they obtained search and arrest warrants against 11 individuals, which were executed yesterday. 
 Every person who had been arrested had released a statement and the police found sufficient grounds to charge nine of them, said the inspector, adding that the duty magistrate had been immediately informed of the arrests.
 In reply to a question from defence lawyer Franco Debono, the inspector said the inquiry had started on 13 June.
 “During yesterday’s operation, it emerged that another brothel was also operating and another four people have been identified as witnesses,” the inspector informed the court, adding that just three hours before the arraignment, he had discovered that another trafficked woman had been due to arrive at the airport from where she would be picked up by one of the defendants.
 All the defendants pleaded not guilty. Bail was requested.
 Prosecution objects to bail
 The prosecution requested protection orders be issued in favour of the trafficked women, which were upheld by the court.
 Prosecutor Ramon Bonett Sladden objected to the bail request. “Here we are dealing with a complex, planned, criminal operation. If released on bail, there is a risk that the operation will resume and further crimes be committed. The victims are doubly vulnerable, by the fruit of their being trafficked and the fact they don’t speak any local languages,”  he submitted, adding that some of the defendants are also recidivists.
 “We aren’t talking about a one or two-man operation, but an organisation. There is the possibility that the police will discover further individuals involved.
 “Inspector Spiteri told the court that although every defendant had their own particular circumstances, they formed part of a singular criminal organisation. Releasing any of them from arrest is not only premature, but would put justice at risk.
 Lawyer Franco Debono argued that requests to deny bail needed to be supported by evidence. “I believe that in this case, safeguards must be applied with greater rigour,”  said the lawyer, pointing out that some of his clients had no prior convictions. “When I have a person with a clean criminal conduct, and the AG asks what he would do if granted bail, I would say probably the same thing that he had done for his entire life without conviction.” The lawyer suggested that even in drug trafficking cases, where the punishment is much larger, defendants had been granted bail. 
 Inspector Spiteri countered that there had not been any attempts at suborning the witnesses in the previous months because they had been held at a secure location. The defendants thought they had been deported, explained the inspector.
 “This is a textbook case where every witness is vulnerable to be influenced in every possible way, including through threats to their families back in Colombia, as has already happened in this case.”
 In his bail submissions, lawyer Roberto Montalto asked what the point of bail conditions were if they were apparently so ineffective. Lawyer Kathleen Calleja Grima told the court that her client had only received a small amount of money for driving one of the women around. “I cannot understand how an individual whose alleged involvement was in the lower ranks of the organisation could pose a risk to the evidence if granted bail. Let us put things into perspective.”
 He rebutted the argument that Corito's involvement was minor because he drove the women around. “I don't think it's minimal to receive €400 a month for knowingly helping a person run a brothel.
 Sitting interrupted
 Inspector Spiteri's reply was interrupted by a disturbance inside the courtroom, when a member of the public was taken outside by police officers who suspected him of recording the proceedings on his mobile phone. The court ordered the officers to examine the device immediately.
 The man, Jurgen Cassar, was returned to the courtroom. He told the court that he had “pressed the record button by accident” and insisted that everything was OK because the video hadn't been sent. “There is an exclamation mark next to it. It wasn't sent,”  Cassar said.
 The court informed the man that he had committed a criminal offence and ordered the police to investigate the matter.
 Bail denied
 After hearing the submissions from all the parties, the court denied bail.
 ""The court, after hearing the expressive submissions by all parties begins by pointing out that all the defendants are charged with participating in a criminal organisation. While it is well aware of the presumption of innocence, the court feels that the risk to evidence is a real one,"" the magistrate said. The investigation is at too early a stage and the magisterial inquiry had not heard the testimony of all the witnesses, the court added before proceding to deny the bail request.
 All accused will remain in custody at the Corradino Correctional Facility for the time being. Lawyers Ramon Bonett Sladden and Charmaine Abdilla from the Office of the Attorney General prosecuted, together with police inspectors John Spiteri, Joseph Xerri and Dorianne Tabone.

Lawyer questions why Malta has not introduced electronic tagging system,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/129240/lawyer_questions_why_malta_has_not_introduced_electronic_tagging_system_,17-05-2024,003017.png,"A lawyer has questioned why Malta has not introduced an electronic tagging system for defendants in criminal cases, during a domestic violence arraignment on Friday.
 The issue, which has popped up in court sporadically for at least the past decade, was raised by lawyer Mario Mifsud during the arraignment of a man accused of threatening to kill his partner and her niece while under the influence of cocaine. 
 The issue of electronic tagging has popped up sporadically in court over the past ten years, but so far only the prison authorities have introduced an ankle bracelet tracking system for inmates granted prison leave.
 It emerged again on Friday during the arraignment of the 41-year-old man, a chef from Floriana, before Magistrate Joseph Gatt, accused of having caused his partner to fear violence, insulting and threatening her, as well as causing her slight injuries and relapsing.
  The man pleaded not guilty to the charges.
 Inspector Sherona Buhagiar, prosecuting, told the court that on May 16, the alleged victim had gone to the Domestic Violence Unit to report that the defendant had threatened her life several times in the previous 48 hours. “He told her that he would end her life, kill her and her niece and put them in the ground.”
 “During yesterday’s incident, he had grabbed a broomstick, telling her that he was going to kill her and not leave any visual marks to prevent her from being able to file a police report.”
 The woman’s injuries were certified to be slight.
 The man’s partner was called to the witness stand by legal procurator Colin Galea, who is assisting her as parte civile. She told the court that she wanted to withdraw her police report.
 “Your risk assessment is high,” pointed out the magistrate.
 “When he’s under the influence of drink and drugs, they cause him to act this way, otherwise he is a good man,” she replied.
 Mifsud asked her whether her request had been prompted by threats “made by anyone: him his lawyer, or his family.”
 “There were no threats. I’ve always said that it’s help that he needs,” she replied. “When he’s under the influence of drugs and alcohol he becomes paranoid.  I’m a grandmother and I think that he told me that I would not see my grandson again just to hurt me.”
 A previous incident had already been reported to the police and was the subject of other court proceedings, which were still ongoing. “Summary proceedings,” Mifsud told the court.
 Mifsud argued that the law gave the victim the option not to testify and continue with the proceedings, and also gave the court the freedom to decide to continue with the case anyway. “But if the victim doesn’t testify, this case will be the lamest duck ever, because there is no other evidence of any other type.”
 Making impassioned submissions the lawyer told the court that his client had a drug problem which needed to be addressed. “The country denies that there is a drug problem and has legalised marijuana. This is a huge mistake.
 “By legalising it, first we take some cannabis, then we progress to a line or two of cocaine, then we put it in a drink, and eventually we end up smoking it and the result is absolute paranoia,” said the lawyer.
 Addressing his client in the dock, Mifsud said “the cocaine you guys take here is mostly dust and other poisons, don’t think you’re taking the sort of cocaine you find in Columbia. The added impurities cause even more deleterious effects to the brain than the drug itself.”
 “I am nothing if not a man of my word. If this man chooses to go down this path of so-called drugs, he can take it and leave me and the woman alone,” warned the lawyer.
 Mifsud argued that while the legislator treated domestic violence harshly, “at the same time it wanted the victim to have her say too.”
 “The woman was right to file a police report, but the legislator provides her with this opportunity to withdraw it.”
 Replying to the court’s question about whether the defendant was attending drug rehabilitation, the lawyer said that before undergoing rehab, he needed to first consult with a psychiatrist, then begin treatment for alcoholism and only then would he be ready to address his drug problem.
 Inspector Buhagiar told the court that the victim had told her that she filed the report because she feared for her safety due to the man’s threats. “But now that she has testified in the way she did, I leave it up to the court to decide.”
 Galea submitted that both he and his client, the alleged victim, believed the couple’s relationship was “salvageable.”
 Returning to the courtroom after retiring to chambers for several minutes to deliberate, the magistrate ruled that it was not in the woman’s interests that these proceedings cease. “The report by [social services agency] Appogg is not one that should be ignored in the circumstances of this case, and from what has emerged in court this was not a one-off incident.”
 “The law gives the court discretion [to decide whether or not to uphold such a request] and this court, in view of what it has heard and seen, cannot in good conscience say that it is in her interests to order the cessation of these proceedings.”
 The defence requested bail, which Inspector Buhagiar objected to, arguing that the woman had yet to testify, as well as the risk of another incident. “The woman told us that it was not the first time this happened and there are other domestic violence cases already pending against the defendant.”
 This did not go down well with the defence. “We have the victim telling the court that she wants him to be treated and not go to prison. After the alleged incident she chose to stay with him. At the time of his arrest, she was there. This is an argument between two people in love, but there is also the demonic aspect of drugs,” argued the lawyer.
 On the issue of bail, we cannot have any tampering with evidence, because the principal witness has decided not to testify, although she can change her mind at a future stage.
 Mifsud rued the fact that when he was legal counsel to the Corradino Correctional Facility, he had introduced remotely trackable ankle bracelets, three years ago. “But for some reason this has not been adopted in the wider criminal justice system.”
 “Yes, it is a serious case, even big cases are serious, and people facing serious charges should always be arraigned under arrest, but now we are requesting that he be placed under a treatment order.”
 But the court, in view of the nature of the charges and the fact that it had no peace of mind that he would not reoffend, rejected the request for bail.
 The magistrate asked whether the defence would like it to issue a treatment order, but the lawyer refused. “No, now that he’s going to be in prison, he can carry on making a mess of it.”  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police

"Christian Borg, associates charged over 'multimillion euro fraud', tax evasion, money laundering",maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/130916/christian_borg_back_in_court_over_fraud_tax_evasion_money_laundering_charges,27-08-2024,003029.png,"Christian Borg of No Deposit Cars infamy, his girlfriend Monique Mizzi, and company director Joe Camenzuli have been formally accused, alongside  a number of companies, of defrauding “millions” in VAT and other taxes.
 They are charged alongside companies Princess Construction Ltd, Princess Holdings Ltd, Princess Operations Ltd, Zing Rental Ltd, No Deposit Cars Ltd and Lion Funding Ltd.
  Borg, 31, and Mizzi, 26, appeared in the dock, assisted by Lawyers Stephen Tonna Lowell, Albert Zerafa, and Ana Thomas. Also in the dock was Joe Camenzuli, in representation of the companies.

 Police Inspectors Tonjoe Farrugia and Robert Azzopardi, assisted by prosecutors Francesco Refalo, Rebekah Spiteri, and Mauro Abela from the Office of the Attorney General, charged the defendants with money laundering and criminal conspiracy. Borg and the companies were further charged with defrauding the Tax Commissioner, making fraudulent gain to the detriment of the Government of Malta, false accounting and other fraud-related offences.
 Police Inspector Tonjoe Farrugia explained that the charges were issued following an investigation into VAT fraud and tax evasion by Borg, both in his personal capacity as well as a number of companies that Borg was either a director or shareholder of.
 The police had first been asked to investigate by the VAT department, he said, due to “indications that Borg was filing false invoices for hundreds of thousands of euros” on which he was receiving VAT refunds as they had been classed as expenses.
 There was also an element of money laundering, added the inspector.
 Cross-examined by Tonna Lowell, inspector Farrugia confirmed that a magisterial inquiry had been concluded and arrest warrants had been issued as a result.
 The lawyer challenged the information on the basis of which the arrests had been made, citing discrepancies between the amounts noted by auditors.
 Inspector Farrugia clarified that discrepancies were only for records pertaining to financial records for one of the years under examination, but that the audit had been conducted over records for many more years than that. 
 The Inspector confirmed that the investigation was still ongoing, which led Tonna Lowell to ask why the defendants had been arraigned today “when the case could be resolved administratively.”
 “How can financial crimes be resolved administratively?” replied the inspector. “Our investigation concluded that millions had been defrauded from the VAT department.”
 Inspector Farrugia insisted that, if anything, only part of the issue could be resolved administratively. 
 The defence lawyer suggested that there were “other million euro fraud cases, but this man happens to be named Christian Borg.”
 The prosecution requested a freezing order over all of the defendants’ assets, in view of the money laundering charges. The prosecution said that a specific amount to be frozen would be submitted within 90 days.
 Tonna Lowell acknowledged that the court’s hands are tied once the prosecution requests a freezing order, but said that negotiations had been ongoing for some time. Now that a freezing order over all the assets for at least 90 days was going to be issued, “everything was going to go to pot.”  
 This measure would also overlap other, similar, court orders that were already in place in connection with other proceedings, the lawyer pointed out.
 The defendants pleaded not guilty to the charges and requested bail, which was objected to by the prosecution. 
 “This investigation has been ongoing for several years. It did not start yesterday,” submitted Refalo. Amongst the evidence that the court would eventually be hearing is “testimony from a number of civilians who had assisted Mr. Borg in the commission of these crimes,” said the prosecutor, warning that there was a risk of evidence being lost if the witnesses were to be approached. 
 Not all of the civilian witnesses had testified during the inquiry, added the prosecutor. “Here you have VAT fraud, where a number of receipts had been issued and VAT should not have been claimed by the defendants.” 
 “We don’t object to bail for nothing,” Refalo added. “This is important to protect the proceedings.”
 Tonna Lowell asked whether the people who were mentioned as having assisted Borg would also face charges, or be pardoned, pointing out that otherwise they would be precluded from testifying. 
 “When we say assisted, we mean that they had done so unknowingly.” clarified the prosecutor.
 The defence lawyer argued that Borg and Mizzi had necessarily been aware that they were under investigation “for months if not years,” telling the court that Borg had been under bail conditions for that time and had “never breached them.” 
 “Borg and Mizzi had all the time in the world to tamper with the evidence, but they did not. The prosecution is objecting on the grounds of a phantom fear that exists only on paper,” said the lawyer, adding that Mizzi also had a young son and had never been in trouble with the law before.
 After retiring to chambers to deliberate on the bail request, the court returned to the courtroom to uphold the bail requests, in view of the fact that the evidence was already preserved by the inquiry.
 Mizzi’s bail was secured by a €15,000 deposit a €40,000 personal guarantee, while Borg was ordered to deposit €35,000 and provide a €60,000 personal guarantee as bail security.  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police
"Tribunal awards long-standing teacher €22,500 over non-renewal of fixed-term contract",maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/129030/tribunal_awards_longstanding_teacher_22500_over_nonrenewal_of_fixedterm_contract,06-05-2024,003043.png,"The Industrial Tribunal has awarded a former private school teacher €22,500 for unfair dismissal, after ruling that the repeated renewal of his one-year employment contract meant that it was effectively an indefinite one, and required a good reason be provided for its non-renewal.
 This emerges from a decision handed down on April 19 in the employment dispute filed by Abdulmunaam Albakush against the 24 December Libyan School and the Libyan Higher Vocational Institute.
 Albakush told the court that the trouble started when, for reasons unknown to him, his wife was dismissed from her teaching post at the Libyan Higher Vocational Institute in December 2021. The following March, she had filed proceedings before the Industrial Tribunal against her former employer, claiming unfair dismissal.
  Almost immediately after that, Albakush heard that he, too,  was going to be fired. He contacted the Head of School Abdulfatah Kharwat, who reassured him that there was no problem because his job had no connection to the dispute between his wife and her employer.
 But when, in June 2022, he had applied to renew his Single Permit, he was denied entry to the building which houses the Institute without explanation. The following month, Identity Malta, had written to Albakush to inform him that his residence permit was being revoked because his employer had filed a termination letter.
 The school, through its lawyer Rebecca Mercieca confirmed that although Albakush’s wife had been fired for allegedly misappropriating data belonging to the Institute, about which a police report had also been filed, this had no bearing on Albakush himself. He had been employed on an indefinite contract, Mercieca explained, and it was his separate role as an examiner that had to be renewed every year.
 Upon receiving a legal letter from Albakush, it had “lost all trust in the applicant,”  the Tribunal was told. 
 But the school denied having dismissed him, pointing out that he had worked until the expiry of his contract. At the end of 2022, the applicant had started to insist that he wanted written confirmation as to whether his contract was being renewed or not for the following year, said the lawyer, which was contrary to the Institute’s policy.
 Tribunal Chairman John Bencini said he found it very surprising that the man had not been given a clear explanation for the termination of his employment, particularly in the absence of any verbal or written warnings. “Obviously dismissal from employment must always be the last resort,” pointed out the tribunal.
 Bencini emphasised that the Fixed Term Contracts Directive, first transposed into Maltese law in 2008, a succession of fixed term contracts for a period of four years or more meant that the contract had been transformed into an indefinite one.
 Despite this fact, the defendants had not felt it necessary to provide a reason for the termination of his employment, besides simply stating that it was not being renewed.
 “This is all wrong, because once the applicant satisfied the requirements established in the subsidiary legislation, his employment with the defendants had to be treated as being on an indefinite basis. It follows, therefore, that in order for them to be able to dismiss the applicant, they had to show good and sufficient grounds at law to do so. This they had not done.”

Man claims self-defence in attempted murder trial,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/130410/man_claims_selfdefence_in_attempted_murder_trial,25-07-2024,003046.png,"A man on trial for the attempted murder of the owner of a nearby field has told a jury that he had shot the other man in a bid to defend himself from an unprovoked assault.
 59-year-old Joseph Scicluna is accused of the attempted murder of Mark Farrugia, whom he allegedly shot with Farrugia’s own hunting shotgun during an altercation in 2018.  Scicluna is also indicted for causing grievous bodily harm, possession of a firearm during the commission of a crime and possession of a weapon without a police permit.
  Farrugia testified yesterday, describing the permanent injuries that he had suffered as a result of the shooting, which had peppered his arm with 200 lead pellets and a further 17 in his face.
 Scicluna had known Farrugia for around 20 years before the incident which had occurred in the Ta’ Dnat area of San Ġakbu, in Dingli on October 31, 2018. The court was told yesterday that Farrugia had testified in court proceedings relating to a dispute between the accused and his family over a field.
 The jury was taken to visit the site yesterday and, again, today.
 After today’s site visit, it was the defendant’s turn to take the witness stand. He told the court that he had woken up at 4.30am on the day of the incident and, after saying some prayers had eaten breakfast with his wife and son, before heading off to the field to walk his dog.-
 Scicluna said that while walking towards the fields, he had noticed Farrugia setting up his hunting hide, and that Farrugia had not answered his greeting. Eventually, Scicluna said, he had asked the victim not to shoot at low-flying birds because his shots were hitting and damaging some of Scicluna’s water pipes.
 After a conversation about various topics, and before Scicluna turned to leave, he reminded Farrugia about the pipes and asked him to leave his son alone “because he already has enough problems.”
 The accused said that upon hearing this, Farrugia started spewing blasphemies and pointed the shotgun, which he had been holding at the time, at Scicluna, who then struck Farrugia with a heavy piece of wood in a bid to defend himself.
 In the ensuing altercation, the accused said that the victim had punched him in the eye, causing him to fall to the ground, next to Farrugia’s shotgun. As the fight continued, Farrugia had tried to grab his firearm, but Scicluna managed to get a hold of it first, before firing at the victim, who then ran off towards his father.
 Scicluna had gone back home and informed his wife about the incident. Not long after that, he had received a call from the Rabat police station, asking him to go in for questioning.
 At the police station, the accused had insisted that he had not been at the scene of the crime. He told the jury today that he had said this on the advice of his previous lawyer. Before stepping off the stand, Scicluna said that he then spoke to another lawyer, Arthur Azzopardi, who suggested that he tell the truth.
 After the accused finished testifying, the prosecution asked the court to order the man’s previous defence lawyer to take the witness stand and testify about the witness’ claim. The defence objected to that request, which presiding judge Consuelo Scerri Herrera proceeded to reject, explaining to the prosecutors that lawyers are bound by professional secrecy to not disclose discussions with their clients, and that this obligation could only be waived by the defendant.
 Lawyers Kevin Valletta and Kayleigh Bonnett from the Office of the Attorney General are prosecuting, while lawyers Edward Gatt and Shaun Zammit are assisting the victim as parte civile.

 Inspector Paul Camilleri, who is prosecuting together with lawyer Brandon Bonnici from the Office of the Attorney General, told the court that the officers who responded to the initial report had found the victim on the ground beside his car, bleeding from a facial wound.

 On 29 October 2024, a woman made a report with the Domestic Violence Department where she recalled that on the 28 October 2024 she had an argument with her ex-partner.

                     The pair argued about a number of traffic fines on a vehicle that the accused was driving. The court heard that the defendant had insulted her and stated, ""See you later... I'll shoot you with a shotgun,"" addressing the victim and their two children. This statement had prompted her to file the report. 

 The woman was in a 12-year relationship with the man, though they had been separated for two years. Once her report was filed, a risk assessment was made, and the duty magistrate was immediately informed of the case.

 The accused, stuttering to give his plea and seeming agitated, pleaded guilty. The prosecution and the defense agreed that the defendant should be handed a minimum fine while being released on the condition that he does not commit another crime. 

 The Court, presided by Magistrate Leonard Caruana, acquitted the man on the condition that he does not commit another crime while imposing a fine of €100 against him. The Court also issued a protection order in favor of the victim.

 John Borg, from Birkirkara, who has a number of previous theft convictions, was arraigned before Magistrate Astrid May Grima by prosecutor Giuliana Magro Conti and police inspector Clayton Camilleri, accused of robbing a grocery shop in Birkirkara two days ago.
 Besides a charge of theft, aggravated by means, time and value, Borg was also accused  of causing damage to the shop and recidivism.
 Borg, who told the court that he works in construction, denied the charges in court today, pleading not guilty and requesting bail.
 The manner in which the robbery was carried out is unclear and did not emerge in court, however sources said the man had broken into the shop holding a lit candle in one hand before making off with €600.
 He had broken into the shop via the roof of an abandoned building, jumped across several roof tops before climbing down inside the store. Unable to leave through the front door, which was padlocked shut, Borg had climbed back up the wall, before jumping down from a height of one floor.
 Borg had been injured in the last part of his escape, telling the police that he had picked up the injury while he was working.
 CCTV footage from the shop captured Borg, wearing only one flipflop, limping away from the crime scene.
 Prosecutor Giuliana Magro Conti objected to bail, telling the court that the shop was not far from the defendant’s residence - a problem because the shop owners were yet to testify, during which they would be exhibiting evidence which showed that the accused had indeed broken into their shop.
 Magro Conti stressed Borg’s criminal past and several convictions for theft. “The man is not a newcomer to crime; he knew exactly what he was doing. The accused is not trustworthy,” insisted the prosecutor.
 Court-appointed legal aid lawyer Mark Busuttil countered, citing the recent judgement in the case against Romanian prince, accusing the prosecution of using threadbare arguments to object to bail.
 “Are we afraid of a 63-year-old man on crutches?” Busuttil asked, adding that it would be “draconian” to deny the man bail.
 “He is facing charges, but so far he is presumed innocent. You have yet to prove the case,” the lawyer said, addressing the prosecution.
 But after the lawyers finished their submissions, the Court opted to deny the man bail, in view of his untrustworthiness and the fact that civilian witnesses had not yet testified.

 Times of Malta leads with news that the  freezing order request by former chief of staff Keith Schembri and former minister Konrad Mizzi was upheld. 
 The judicial scrutiny comes in the wake of a ruling delivered by Madam Justice Edwina Grima in proceedings related to the Vitals case wherein former prime minister Joseph Muscat, his former minister Konrad Mizzi and former chief of staff Keith Schembri face criminal charges over their alleged involvement in the fraudulent hospitals concession. 
 The newspaper also reports that a worker died after he suffered an electric shock while assembling scaffolding in St Julian’s. The victim, a 31-year-old Somali resident in Qormi, died in hospital soon after he was admitted. 
 The Malta Independent similarly reports about Schembri and Mizzi's request on the new freezing order law. 
 The newspaper also reports that the Malta Union of Teachers and the government agreed on a second draft of the sectoral agreement. A vote should take place next week. 
 In-Nazzjon meanwhile publishes a statement by the PN about how the government continues to ignore the crises it created at the Malta College of Arts, Science and Technology.
 In recent weeks, the post-secondary institution has been overshadowed by ongoing industrial actions, with the college remaining locked in a dispute with the Malta Union of Teachers over a long-lapsed collective agreement.

Wasteserv corrects reports of court criticism about waste-to energy plan tender adjudication process,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/129851/wasteserv_corrects_reports_of_court_criticism_about_wasteto_energy_plan_tender_adjudication_process,22-06-2024,003132.png,"Waste management company WasteServ has denied reports that the tender adjudication process for a waste-to-energy plant had been criticised in a recent appeals court decision. 
 It was reported, yesterday, that a court had upheld an appeal filed by losing bidders Hitachi, overturning the decision to award a €600 million tender for a waste-to-energy plant, against the decision to award the tender to a consortium made up of French Company Paprec and local businessmen, Bonnici Brothers, after ruling that some members of the contracts department adjudicating panel had conflicts of interest, and ordering the evaluation process to start anew.
  Some news outlets went on to report that the consortium had also complained about irregular procedures by the board, a claim which WasteServ rebutted on Saturday.
 “The Court of Appeal’s judgement on the waste-to-energy plant tender did not take issue with the procedure adopted by WasteServ to rank bidders — which was greenlighted by the best international players in the field — but concentrated solely on what it deemed as perceived conflicts of interest within the Public Contracts Review Board, which heard the losing bidder’s appeal,” said the company.
 A spokesperson for Wasteserv said: “It is unfortunate to note that even though the appellant actually dropped its main ground of appeal against the merits of Wasteserv’s adjudication process for the tender, sections of the media, have either misunderstood or are deliberately misconstruing the court decision so they can cast WasteServ in a bad light.”
 “WasteServ condemns such destructive behaviour, which seems solely intended to further stall and destabilise its efforts to deliver a vital infrastructural project in the hope that a losing consortium — with an offer that would have cost taxpayers €200 million more — will get a second chance.
 The company insisted that the adjudication had been carried out “in full transparency and with the assistance of a world-leading consultancy in solid waste management (COWI A/S), while also relying on an extra layer of quality assurance through the use of an independent UK-based firm (Frith Resource Management) that confirmed the recommendation of award.”
 It added that this could “be easily verified by anyone interested in the truth.”
 WasteServ said that in its concluding assessment, British consultancy firm Frith Resource Management had concurred with WasteServ’s decision and said “the procurement has been undertaken in a timely, efficient and equitable manner”, confirming the recommendation to award the multi-million project to Paprec Energies International – BBL Malta at a bid price of €600 million.
 “At no point did the Court of Appeal question the detailed technical or financial scoring of WasteServ’s adjudication process. The Court, however, annulled the Public Contracts Review Board decision on grounds of perceived conflict of interest,” said the company.
 “WasteServ remains committed to continue driving Malta’s environmental transition, and no false claim or malicious accusation will deter it from delivering a better environmental future.”

Man charged with rape after pregnant partner reports him to the police,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/man-charged-rape-pregnant-partner-reports-police.1102496,15-12-2024,003140.png,"A man who is alleged to have raped his partner and threatened her with a screwdriver while she was five months pregnant has been denied bail.
 The man was arraigned on rape and domestic violence charges on Sunday morning, two days after his girlfriend reported him to the police.
 Neither he nor his partner can be named under court order.
 Prosecuting Inspector Omar Zammit said the alleged victim showed up at police headquarters on Friday to report that her partner had locked her up in his apartment, assaulted her and threatened her with a screwdriver.
 The woman is five months pregnant with the man’s child.
 She also alleged that in June he had raped her on three separate occasions. They had broken up for a few months then got back together.  
 The man also filed his own police report, alleging she assaulted him. He presented a medical certificate stating that he suffered slight injuries.
 When he appeared in court on Sunday, the man pleaded not guilty to rape, holding his partner against her will, committing nonconsensual sexual acts, slightly injuring her and causing damage between €250 and €2,500.
 His defence lawyers requested bail, arguing that he has a clean criminal record, a regular job and fixed address.
 They also cited case law in which a man accused of similar charges was granted bail during the first sitting. In that case, the victim had subsequently opted to drop charges.
 Prosecutors pushed back against that request. Attorney General Lawyer Jurgen Dalli noted that the victim had yet to testify and her evidence has not yet been preserved.
 After consideration, the court chose to deny the accused’s bail request. A domestic violence risk assessment had concluded that the victim was at high risk, it noted, and given that and the fact that she is pregnant, it had to take all precautions necessary until she testifies.
 Prosecutors did not object to a defence request for the names of the accused and alleged victim to be banned from publication. The court acceded to that request.
 Attorney General lawyer Jurgen Dalli and Inspector Omar Zammit prosecuted. Lawyers Franco Debono and Adreana Zammit appeared for the defence.

 At the time Fenech was the owner of the Portomaso Casino.
  Magistrate Ian Farrugia had found Farrugia guilty of unlawfully disclosing information he had obtained by virtue of his office and revealing professional secrets in May, for which he had been handed a three-year conditional discharge.
 Farrugia had resigned in October 2020 following his arraignment over his communications with Fenech, who is awaiting trial for the murder of Daphne Caruana Galizia, and who was also owner of Portomaso Casino.
 The chats had been found during the analysis of Fenech’s phone, after it was seized by police investigators in December 2019 during his arrest in connection with Caruana Galizia’s murder.
 Investigators had examined 24 pages of texts that were exchanged on 23 September, 2019, between 9pm and 10pm, and showed that Fenech had communicated his disappointment with the result of a recent anti-money laundering compliance review at Tumas Gaming to Farrugia.
 Tumas Gaming was the operator of the Oracle Casino and the Portomaso Casino.
 Fenech had complained to Farrugia that the review had given his organisation a bad reputation.
 Farrugia had tried to soften the blow to Fenech in his reply, telling him that he would delay the release of the compliance report, and revealing that another inspection was also going to take place at Casino Malta, owned by Tumas’ business rival, Eden Leisure Group.

 Police Inspector Roderick Attard, prosecuting, told the court that the man had been reported as intimidating passers-by with a glass bottle. Police officers found him holding a bottle, said the inspector.
 Colonese then proceeded to hurl insults at the officers.
 The defendant, who was assisted by legal aid lawyer Julia Micallef Stafrace and an Italian language interpreter, pleaded guilty to the charges.
 He confirmed his admission of guilt after the magistrate explained the possible consequences of his plea: a fine between €800 and €5,000 and even imprisonment.
 Making submissions on punishment, the inspector told the court that Colonese’s statement to police showed that he had taken responsibility for his actions, and described the incident as a one-off mistake.

 Golfer Chloe May Frankish, 25, from Kent in the UK. and John Chinedu Uche, 31 from London were accused of violently resisting arrest, disobeying legitimate police orders, breaching the peace, being drunk and disorderly on a passenger aircraft and disobeying orders to disembark.
  Frankish, alone, was further charged with causing €436 worth of damage to the desk at the airport police station and with slightly injuring a police officer. On Uche’s part, he was separately charged with insulting and threatening a public officer with the intention of intimidating him into not performing his duties.
 Inspector Roxanne Tabone told Magistrate Abigail Critien that after being denied permission to board their EasyJet flight as they were drunk and disorderly, the pair had violently resisted the police, who had to call in the Rapid Intervention Unit for backup.
 The court was told that police officers had encountered great difficulty in subduing Uche who had to be tasered multiple times, and that Frankish had kicked and broken in two a wooden desk at the airport police station. While under arrest, Frankish had also claimed to be pregnant, a claim which was subsequently found to be untrue after a medical examination was carried out.
 While Frankish cooperated fully with the police, police said Uche’s behaviour was “catastrophic”.
 The defendants initially appeared intent to plead guilty, but the eventual fines and damages were going to exceed the combined daily withdrawal limits of all six of the credit cards they had on them, as well as the three working day minimum required for inter-bank transfers to go through. “You need to understand that logistically, we need to confirm that payment has been made,” the magistrate explained to the defendants.
 After being given time to consider their options, the couple first pleaded guilty; after the magistrate observed that they did not appear to understand what the plea meant, the pair pleaded not guilty after consulting their lawyer. Bail was not requested, with the defendants being remanded in custody.  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police
"Tension mounts, police on alert as landmark case starts",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/tension-mounts-police-alert-landmark-case-starts.1093108,28-05-2024,003175.png,"Joseph Muscat will answer to corruption charges today, in what will be a landmark case against a former prime minister.
 The police are set to be on high alert over fears that tension could boil over when Labour supporters are expected to gather en masse to support Muscat outside the law courts.
 Supporters have been told to gather in Valletta at 10am, while the arraignments are expected to start an hour later. Times of Malta will be running a live blog. 
 A strong police presence is expected outside the lawcourts as the former prime minister and 22 others enter the building to face the charges.
 Muscat is facing a raft of charges, including money laundering, corruption, bribery, and setting up a criminal organisation.
 His co-defendants will include his former chief of staff Keith Schembri and former health minister Konrad Mizzi.
 All three deny wrongdoing.
 Apart from the three government officials, a network of 20 other individuals and companies will be charged.
 
 The case revolves around a €4 billion deal signed by Muscat’s government to hand the running of three public hospitals to suspected fraudsters.
 Vitals Global Healthcare was awarded the concession in 2015, on the back of what investigators allege was a rigged tendering process.
 Investigators who pored over thousands of e-mails, documents and banking records have likened the deal to a “Ponzi scheme”.
 Muscat, Mizzi and Schembri are all suspected to have illicitly benefitted from a “political support fund” set up by Steward Health Care, who took over the concession from Vitals in 2018. 
 Steward was booted out of the concession by a civil court last year on  fraud grounds, with the three hospitals being returned to the government.
 The ex-prime minister is being charged by summons, meaning he is not under arrest and will freely make his way inside and back out of court.
 The arraignment will likely be the first salvo in a case that could well drag on for years.
 The gravity of the charges means the ex-government officials will likely face a jury trial.
 Brian Tonna and Karl Cini, two accountants who set up “money laundering structures” for Mizzi and Schembri in Panama will also be charged.
 David Meli, who was a lawyer for both Vitals and Steward, will similarly be in the dock on charges of money laundering and bribing government officials, alongside Vitals’ auditor Chris Spiteri.
 Another key individual facing charges today is Ivan Vassallo, the director of medical supply company Technoline.
 Vassallo is alleged to have been complicit in plans to front Technoline on behalf of Schembri and Mizzi. Former Allied Newspapers managing director Adrian Hillman and businessman Pierre Sladden will similarly be charged in connection with the Technoline plan.
 The arraignments will be heard in Hall 22 – the largest courtroom – with the balcony normally available to the public instead reserved for the press and family members of the accused.
 The area downstairs will be reserved for defendants, prosecution, defence and court staff.
 Insiders who spoke to Times of Malta say Muscat’s supporters have been rallying around to draw a large crowd in Valletta this morning.
 Muscat has repeatedly claimed he was innocent of the accusations.
 The drama leading to today’s arraignment continued yesterday with three top civil servants insisting the Attorney General was with them in talks over the hospitals concession, and therefore has a conflict of interest.
 While Robert Abela insisted yesterday that the institutions should be allowed to do their work, Opposition leader Bernard Grech said the prime minister is complicit in the hospitals scandal.

 The man, who is not being named in order to avoid potentially subjecting the woman to secondary victimisation, was hauled to court after having allegedly dragged his partner by the hair from the upper floor of her mother’s house to his car.
 Inspector Omar Zammit arraigned the 33-year-old car dealer and showroom owner from Paola before magistrate Nadia-Helena Vella, accusing him of causing slight injuries to the woman, who is the mother of his children, giving her reason to fear that he would be violent towards her, assaulting and threatening the woman and holding her against her will.
  The court was told how on May 8, at around noon, the defendant’s partner had filed a domestic violence report at police headquarters in Floriana, in which she claimed that his behaviour towards her over the past three days led her to fear for her safety.
 The couple had previously fallen out and had spent the previous six weeks living apart. On the day of the incident, the defendant had driven to his former mother-in-law’s house in Senglea, where his ex-partner was staying and demanded that she go home with him.
 When the woman refused, the defendant allegedly went upstairs, found the woman and dragged her by the hair, out of the house and into his car. He then drove her to his home.
 In reply to questions from defence lawyer Franco Debono, who is assisting the man together with lawyer Marion Camilleri, the inspector confirmed that the woman’s injuries were classified as slight and that the defendant had cooperated with the police.
 The man was arrested while signing one of his bail books at the police station, added the inspector.
 He pleaded not guilty to the charges. The prosecution objected to the defence’s request for bail, pointing at the grave nature of the charges and the fact that the victim and other witnesses were yet to testify.
 Moreover, the defendant had already been released on bail several times, argued the prosecution. The oldest of those five sets of conditions relate to charges of aggravated drugs possession dating back to 2017; his most recent ones had been issued in August 2023, in connection with an arson attack on a boat. The man had not proven himself to be trustworthy, argued the inspector.
 The court, having heard the submissions on bail, upheld the prosecution’s arguments and ordered the man be remanded in custody.  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police

 “Do you have a family? A mother? A sister?” pleaded the woman, a young Thai working at a Sliema massage parlour on the day when the “tall, dark-skinned” stranger stepped inside asking for a massage.
 That July 3 afternoon at around 4.20pm the employee was seated behind the desk at the small reception area of the Sliema shop when the man, later identified as 32-year-old Gambian construction worker Harona Conateh, rang the doorbell.
 
 She opened the door and in stepped the man she had never seen before, wearing a dark polo shirt, loose-fitting bermudas and a yellow beanie.
 “Is it possible to have a massage?” he asked in heavily accented English. “How much?”
 Since she had another client booked at 5pm, the masseuse explained that she could only offer a 30-minute shoulder and back massage costing €30.
 She handed him a brochure advertising all services available at the parlour.
 The stranger pointed at a 90-minute service but the masseuse explained that she only had 30 minutes to spare.
 “Ok. Thirty minutes ok,” agreed the man, pulling out €20 and €10 notes to pay.
 She led him down a short hallway leading to the massage room and showed him inside, telling him to remove his polo shirt.
 While she waited outside, she texted one of her bosses to let him know that a walk-in client had just turned up for a service.
 When she re-entered the room, the client was still wearing his shirt. So she gestured to explain that he was to take it off.
 She then told him to lie on the couch face down.
 He lay down face upwards and refused to turn over, telling her, “no, no. Massage here,” indicating his chest.
 “No, we don’t do that type of massage,” explained the woman.
 The man quickly got off the couch, visibly irritated.
 “I paid money,” he snapped, standing a metre or so away from the masseuse who refused his request, hastily handing back the cash.
 The man took the money, slipped it into his pocket and stepped closer.
 “No, you don’t understand,” he said and with one swift movement, he grabbed her spectacles and flung them away. The single earpod she was wearing, followed.
 He then tried to grab her wrists.
 She defended herself as best as she could, raising her arms as he advanced, forcing her closer to the wall and farther from the door.
 As her back touched the wall, he pushed her to the floor, landing in a narrow space between the wall and the couch.
 As he held her wrists with one hand, he removed her clothes and raped her with his finger.
 “No, no, no, don’t do this to me,” she screamed as the attack continued.
 “I began to think that I was going to be raped,” the woman recalled, assisted by two interpreters as she testified at length via videoconference from the magistrate’s chambers.
 The witness also clearly identified the accused as her alleged aggressor.
 She said her aggressor then produced out a white rope, less than one centimetre thick, and bound her wrists together, crossing the rope in a figure eight motion.
 “That was when I realised that I could not resist his force.”
 She began to cry.
 “Now I know what you want. I’ll give you what you want. I cannot breathe. Untie me and I’ll give you what you want,” she told the man bending over her, trying to play for time to seek a way out. 
 The man relented and untied her bonds.
 “I cannot breathe. Can I stand up?” she asked.
 The man let her stand and as she got to her feet realising he was aroused.
 He stepped closer, gesturing that he wanted her to touch his chest.
 That was when she appealed to his sense of pity.
 “Do you have a family? A mother? A sister? How would you feel if this happened to your daughter or sister?”
 “You don’t understand,” shouted the man, shoving her angrily.
 She landed face down on the floor. She wriggled and struggled as he lowered himself, trying to penetrate her.
 Then suddenly he stopped.
 He snatched a paper sheath covering the couch, wiped himself and walked out of the room.
 As she looked for her spectacles and pants, she heard the man’s final words.
 He stopped at the main door and turning round told her: “next time don’t do this to me. It’s not good.”
 Throughout the ordeal, which lasted between 15 and 20 minutes, she was alone at the parlour.
 The woman phoned her boss, pleading with him to call in the police because she had been raped.
 Two of her bosses later arrived at the shop. When they called the police they were instructed to accompany the victim to the Sliema police station.
 From there she was taken by ambulance to Mater Dei hospital emergency where her injuries were photographed. A gynaecological examination confirmed a vaginal injury.
 As she wrapped up her testimony, the woman said the ordeal left her “unhappy and unwell”.
 Under cross-examination, she said she had returned to her job after three days but was now working at a different parlour.
 The case presided over by Magistrate Kevan Azzopardi continues.

 The 44-year old Qormi baker, whose name is being withheld to protect the identity of his spouse who was also slightly injured in the attack, was escorted to court under arrest on Thursday. 
 The incident happened on Tuesday evening around 8:30pm at Attard.
 Police received a report about the attack by a man wielding a “hard object,” explained prosecuting inspector Clayton Camilleri. 
 The aggressor was charged with with causing his wife’s new partner grievous injuries, slightly injuring his wife as well as damaging her car mirror on the passenger side. 
 He registered an admission which he confirmed after being warned of the possible consequences by the court. 
 His lawyer, Franco Debono, said that this was “an unfortunate episode"" that followed 25 years of a happy marriage. 
 The accused had a job and never had any trouble with the law, said the lawyer while the bruised victim followed court proceedings.
 Although few details emerged in court, it appears that the accused followed his estranged wife and watched as her new partner got into her car. 
 That was when he attacked, striking out with a hard object.
 Both defence and prosecution agreed that effective imprisonment would not be appropriate punishment in the circumstances of the case. 
 AG lawyer Federico Barbaro Sant said that the parties suggested a suspended sentence of two years suspended for four years. 
 The victim’s lawyer, Lennox Vella, requested an additional protection order and restraining order to protect the victims. 
 He also pointed out the damage to the car mirror. 
 The accused bound himself to cover the costs of those repairs, said his lawyer. 
 After hearing submissions the court, presided over by magistrate Noel Bartolo, handed down a suspended sentence as suggested by the parties and imposed a protection order for one year in favour of his ex and a three-year restraining order in favour of the victim.

 Darren Dimech, 46, and Roderick Camilleri, 44, are being accused of drug trafficking and importation after a 146kg drug bust at the Malta Freeport.

                     Inspector Mark Mercieca took to the witness stand on Monday. He told the court that on 12 November he was informed of a green truck heading out of the Freeport which was suspected to contain illicit contents.

 According to the inspector, Camilleri told Dimech to “drive outside, the security guards know about us” but shortly after, at around 1:30pm, the truck was stopped and a search was carried out.

 Roderick Camilleri had been sitting on the passenger seat, whilst Darren Dimech was driving the truck.

 During the search, three sacks were found inside of the truck, one sack behind Camilleri’s seat, and two sacks behind Dimech’s seat. One of the sacks behind Dimech’s seat was torn open, according to the inspector.

 Mercieca said the police received information on the truck and its contents at short notice. Camilleri and Dimech were arrested and kept handcuffed in an office at the Freeport until the police arrived.

 Inspector Joseph Edward Howard also testified. Upon examining the container unloaded by the truck, the police noticed another container which was opened ajar and contained a sack next to it like that found in the vehicle.

 An inspection was carried out on the container, and it appeared that its seals were not intact. The inspector explained that a container must be sealed from departure to arrival.

 A shelf towards the back of the container led the police to suspect the presence of illicit substances.

 The next day, statements were taken from the accused. Dimech told his lawyer that he worked with a truck company, and had met Camilleri since he was a part-timer with the same company.

 He told his lawyer that Camilleri had offered €5,000 to €10,000 for Dimech to assist him, but, to this day, Camilleri has not given this amount to Dimech. 

 Representing Camilleri were lawyers Jason Azzopardi, Kris Busietta and Alessandro Farrugia while Dimech was represented by Lawyers Franco Debono and George Anton Buttiġieġ.

Man who strangled partner to death loses appeal against life sentence,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/132610/man_who_strangled_partner_to_death_loses_appeal_against_life_sentence,04-12-2024,003303.png,"A court of appeal has upheld a life sentence for Lawrence Abina, who strangled his partner, Rita Ellul, to death while she slept, rejecting his claim that inconsistencies in forensic evidence cast doubt on his conviction.

 A man who strangled his partner to death has had his life sentence upheld, with a court of appeal dismissing his objections as “completely unfounded.” Lawrence Abina was sentenced to life imprisonment last March for the murder of Rita Ellul, who was killed while she slept in February 2022.

                     Ellul had filed two domestic violence reports against Abina prior to her death. Despite initially pleading not guilty, Abina confessed to the crime three times, including during police interrogations. He admitted feeling guilty while strangling Ellul but continued out of fear that she would report him to the authorities if she survived.

 In his appeal, Abina argued that inconsistencies between his police statements and the forensic evidence created reasonable doubt about his guilt.

 He claimed to have used both hands to strangle Ellul, whereas a medico-legal expert testified that the marks on her neck were consistent with one-handed strangulation. The court of appeal, however, dismissed this defence, stating it was “perplexed” by the argument.

 Chief Justice Mark Chetcuti and Judges Edwina Grima and Giovanni Grixti noted that Abina did not deny committing the act, the intent to kill, or the pathologist’s findings, which aligned with his statements.

 The court ruled the appeal baseless and confirmed his life sentence.

 Abina was represented by legal aid lawyer Simon Micallef Stafrace,

Man remanded in custody after allegedly slashing neighbour’s face with knife,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/132749/man_remanded_in_custody_after_allegedly_slashing_neighbours_face_with_knife_,12-12-2024,,"A man has been remanded in custody after allegedly slashing his neighbour’s face during an argument on Wednesday morning.

 The accused, Theodore Spiteri, is a 32-year-old maintenance worker from Marsaxlokk.

 The police were informed by the alleged victim at around 8.10 am that she had been the victim of a knife attack. Upon arrival in Lepanto Street, where the attack allegedly took place, the woman was found with visible wounds marking her face and upper body.

                     The woman was subsequently taken to Mater Dei Hospital, with her injuries being certified as grievous in nature.

 The accused pleaded not guilty to various charges including attempted murder, grievous bodily harm, as well as carrying a knife without the necessary police license.

 Whilst no request for bail was made, defence lawyer Alfred Abela requested that a psychologist be appointed to examine the mental state of the accused. Although the Court held that such assessment should be conducted at a different stage, it simultaneously recommended that the Prisons Director keep such issue in mind in order to protect the best interests of the accused.

‘I wish I could turn back time and hug her’: Bernice Cassar’s sister,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/i-wish-i-turn-back-time-hug-her-bernice-cassar-sister.1101369,22-11-2024,"003340.png,003341.png,003342.png,003343.png","The sister of a murder victim said she wished she could turn back time and give her sister a proper hug, as she recalled the second anniversary of her death on Friday. 
 Friends and family of Bernice Cassar gathered in remembrance of her on the second anniversary of when she was shot and killed by her estranged husband. 
 Alessia Cilia Portelli, Bernice's sister, recalled the last heartbreaking moments she spent speaking to her sister and described how Bernice was riddled with worry. 
 “She was crying and talking about the sense of fear she felt, the fear she carried with her until the last moments of her life,” she said, holding back tears. 
 “Our goodbyes were rushed and both of us had no idea this would be the last time we would hear each other’s voice.”
  Cilia Portelli was speaking to family and friends who gathered in Kordin early on Friday, at the same time and place where Cassar was shot dead on her way to work two years ago. 
 Her estranged husband, Roderick Cassar, has been charged with the murder and is pleading not guilty. 
 On Friday morning, minutes before 8am, the exact time Cassar was shot, family members and friends walked silently to the spot where Cassar was murdered. 
 Cassar’s visibly emotional parents and siblings laid flowers beneath a plaque erected in Cassar's memory and held a minute of silence.
  In a short speech, Cilia Portelli said she knew that during the past two years, those close to Bernice would also reflect on the last time they spoke to her. 
 “Like me, you wish you could turn back the clock to those last few moments with her, to hug her properly, or give her a proper goodbye,” she said. 
 She questioned why her “humble and good-hearted” sister had to go through so much suffering. 
  “Let us never forget that her death could have been avoided. Bernice did not cry in silence but called out for help, and I am not referring to when she was lying here on this road. I am referring to all the times she reached out for help, and found none.”
 Cassar had filed multiple police reports against her ex-husband before she was shot dead. Days before she was killed, her lawyer pleaded with police to take action against her ex-husband for breaching a protection order. 
 
 An inquiry concluded that the state ‘system’ failed the 40-year-old mother of two, particularly because of a lack of resources and a heavy caseload. The inquiry went on to make a number of recommendations that included increasing resources and strengthening protection orders.  
 She said the country must work to ensure there is not another Bernice, and that there is awareness of violence against women. She said it is important to teach children that possession and control is not love, but love is liberty and freedom.”
 “Bernice I am certain that today you are free, like when we were children. Free like when we would play in Buskett, and when we would go out as a family and enjoy each other's company,” she recalled. 
 “We promise to continue fighting for justice, that your name will never be forgotten and that your death was not all for nothing.”
  The anniversary of Bernice's murder falls on the same day the government launched the 16 Days Campaign on Gender-Based and Domestic Violence.
 The anniversary comes months after Nicolette Ghrixi was stabbed to death in her apartment in Swatar, Birkirkara. Her ex-partner Edward Johnston, who had been harassing her for months, was later shot dead by police after a three-hour stand-off in St Julian's. 
 Ghrixi's family have called for an independent inquiry after they complained of failures by government agencies in the run-up to the murder.

Woman admits to breaking court-imposed bail conditions,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/131002/woman_admits_to_breaking_courtimposed_bail_conditions,02-09-2024,003346.png,"A woman who had failed to sign her bail book for weeks was found hiding under her bed by police officers executing an arrest warrant at her home, a court was told on Monday, with her defence lawyer calling for a wider implementation of electronic tagging.
  47-year-old Graziella Debono from Msida, who is on bail pending her appeal against a conviction for stealing valuables from the house she had been paid to clean, is to be sentenced later this week after pleading guilty to having failed to sign her bail book.
 During Debono’s arraignment on Monday, police Inspector Paul Camilleri told magistrate Nadia Helena Vella that the woman was on bail, pending an appeal that she had filed herself.  “On 22 March this year, she stopped signing her bail book and for some reason or another, she had not informed the police that she had changed her address.” When the woman failed to attend an appeal sitting because she could not be notified, the judge presiding over the appeal had directed the police to search for her.
 After it was noticed that her mobile phone was pinging cellular network masts in the Żabbar area, plainclothes officers had conducted surveillance and identified the address she was residing at, observing her entering a residence. The undercover officers called in uniformed colleagues who arrived and knocked on the residence’s front door. Nobody answered the knock on the door, which was subsequently broken down by the police. Debono and her partner were found hiding under a bed inside the property, said the inspector.
 When the woman was asked to enter a plea, her lawyer, Mario Mifsud informed the court that the defendant would be pleading not guilty to the charges.
 A police sergeant stationed at Paola was the only witness in the case. He was called to the stand and testified that he had gone, together with other officers, to the residence indicated on the warrant.  “We knocked on the door several times but she never answered.” The officers identified themselves as the police and warned that force would be used to open the door, also without response.
 The officers had then proceeded to break down the door, he said. “We found her and her partner hiding under the bed,”  added the officer.
 Mifsud asked whether the woman had cooperated with the police. She had, replied the witness, also confirming that the woman had appeared to be lip reading during her arrest, after the lawyer asked whether he was aware that the woman had hearing problems.
 Making final submissions, Inspector Camilleri said the woman’s bail book clearly showed that she had not signed it for a month. Both the inspector and the woman’s lawyer had gone beyond the call of duty in their efforts to help her, he said,  adding that when she had moved to Marsascala without informing the police, he had even transferred her bail book to Marsascala. 
 As she was not residing at her registered address, she was not being notified with the dates of sittings in her appeal, explained the inspector, requesting a custodial sentence. “Everything shows that she was attempting to escape justice…and besides, she had already been jailed for six months for the same offence.” 
 Defence reiterates call for electronic tagging of nonviolent offenders
 For the defence, Mifsud pointed out that over the years, Malta had made progress on many fronts, recalling how he and the then prison director Col (retd). Alexander Dalli had been local pioneers in the use of electronic tagging of offenders.
 He solicited the government to implement the tracking bracelet system that is currently being trialled, on a wider scale.
 “The intention of having a signature on the bail book is more to confirm to the court that she has been notified,” submitted the lawyer. Debono’s first conviction had been for stealing a rabbit, he pointed out, stressing the minor nature of her crimes. “She’s not Maria Goretti, granted…but she didn’t sign her bail book once and her brain, instead of telling her to advise her lawyer so we could sort something out [told her to do this]…”
 Doctors reluctant to issue certificates for court after sickness certificates scandal - defence lawyer
 The lawyer said that another emerging problem was doctors’ reluctance to issue white certificates to people on bail, telling the court that this was “because after it emerged that so many were being falsified, the risk outweighed its worth.”.
 “This lady has gone through a lot in her life…she unfortunately made a mistake once, and now the court is being requested to confiscate her €5,500 bail security. The punishment is greater than what she would have received for the original crime.”
 “She does not have €5,500. I know that she is struggling, but nonetheless, she has not resorted to theft after her conviction,”  Mifsud submitted.
 He said he wanted to reassure the judge who ordered her arrest that she would be present for judgement on Thursday, adding that if she didn’t turn up, her appeal would be deemed abandoned and her original sentence confirmed anyway.
 The prosecution did not object to the lawyer’s request that the woman be sentenced after the judgement in her appeal on Thursday. The court upheld the request and adjourned the case to Thursday at 12:00 for sentencing.  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police
Court okays extradition of Romanian prince convicted of corruption,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/court-okays-extradition-romanian-prince-convicted-corruption.1094430,25-06-2024,003347.png,"The Magistrate’s court has ordered Prince Paul-Philippe al Romaniei to be extradited to Romania after the Office of the Attorney General appealed an initial decision to deny the request. 
 In 2020, the 75-year-old prince was convicted in absentia of corruption in connection with the illegal restitution of real estate near Bucharest, over which he was accused of falsely claiming ownership. Al-Romaniei was sentenced to almost 3.5 years in prison. He denies the accusations. 
 Some two years later, he was apprehended in Paris, but a Court of Appeal refused to extradite him to Romania. 
 He currently resides in France, but while in Malta for a conference in April, he was detained on the strength of a European Arrest Warrant. 
 In his initial judgement, Magistrate Leonard Caruana said that there was a real risk the prince could suffer a breach of rights if sent back to Romania, with the court hearing during proceedings how a French court had rejected a similar extradition request. 
 The Attorney General, however, appealed that decision while al Romaniei also went back to court to fight for his release, arguing that his continued detainment at the Corradino Correctional Facility while the outcome of the appeal was decided constituted a  breach of his fundamental rights. 
 The first court heard how after the fall of the communist regime, Prince Paul and his father returned to Romania to reclaim family property. 
 However, they were met with the argument that, even if they had been entitled to this land, it was the Nazis who had confiscated it and not the communist state. 
 In her judgement, Magistrate Donatella Frendo Dimich noted that the defence argued that the EAW is only a pretext for prosecuting and punishing al Romaniei for his political opinions and asked that the court refuse the extradition request for these reasons. 
 However, the court also pointed out that the terms of the EAW mean that the requested person can only face charges or action for the offences listed in the order. 
 Based on this, she ordered Prince Paul-Philippe al Romaniei to be returned to Romania. 
 The court also ordered that the prince not be returned to the country until seven days pass from the date of the order and informed al Romaniei that he may appeal the judgement with the Court of Criminal Appeal.

﻿€20 million freezing order against Sciacca Grill dropped,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/20-million-freezing-order-sciacca-grill-dropped.1094604,28-06-2024,003350.png,"A €20 million freezing order against Sciacca Grill has been dropped by court order, after it was cleared of all criminal charges related to the Vitals concession deal earlier this week.
 Sciacca Grill, which runs a chain of eponymous restaurants, had been named in criminal charges filed against Joseph Muscat, Keith Schembri and Konrad Mizzi, chiefly because of its previous associations with Schembri. 
 But as proceedings continued on Monday, Magistrate Rachel Montebello ruled that prosecutors had failed to provide sufficient evidence to justify the company’s continued inclusion in criminal proceedings. 
 Lawyers Franco Debono, David Bonello and Marion Camilleri challenged the freezing order against the company, arguing chiefly that once criminal proceedings against the entity had been dropped, then so should the freezing order.
 The challenge was filed within the seven-day time limit imposed by law, almost a month ago and in between then and the actual date of the hearing, Sciacca Grill had since been acquitted of wrongdoing in this case.
 The company said in its filing that it had no involvement whatsoever in the hospitals concession and that Keith Schembri had sold the company, which had once been called Kasco Foods, to the restaurant’s current owners in 2014.
 In its rebuttal, the prosecution said there was still a possibility that the Attorney General could appeal the decision and order Sciacca Grill to be arraigned afresh. Should this come to pass, without a freezing order in place, the funds would not be protected and this is why the order should continue to be upheld, they said.
 In her decision on Friday, Madam Justice Edwina Grima said that while the AG did indeed have a right to appeal the decision to acquit Sciacca Grill, it had not filed an application seeking a warrant for the arrest of the discharged entity.
 This means that at present, Sciecca Grill must be considered acquitted of all the charges levelled against it.
 “The Court is not given the privilege of waiting for the Attorney General to decide whether or not to contest the decision to discharge and request this court to arrest the discharged person anew,” the judge said, noting that the one-month timeframe in which freezing orders can actually be challenged is “quite short”.
 While the law did not envisage the current situation Sciacca Grill found itself in, it still held at its core that the company should not remain subject to a freezing order when it had been acquitted of criminal wrongdoing.For these reasons, the court revoked the freezing order issued against Sciacca Grill.

‘There was an entire campaign against my son’: Yorgen Fenech’s mother testifies in Simon Mercieca libel case,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/132045/there_was_an_entire_campaign_against_my_son_yorgen_fenechs_mother_testifies_in_simon_mercieca_libel_case_,30-10-2024,003356.png,"Patricia Fenech, mother of Yorgen Fenech, gave an account of her friendship with blogger Simon Mercieca, testifying in court about her limited interactions with him amidst ongoing accusations against her son.

 She said she has met Mercieca and his family for four times.

 Yorgen Fenech has been indicted for masterminding the 2017 assassination of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia.

                     She was testifying in the libel case Simon Mercieca had filed against blogger Mark Camilleri, who had accused him of having been paid to publish blogs on Fenech.

 Patricia Fenech was scheduled to testify at a prior sitting, but due to illness, Simon Mercieca was called to the stand instead. Mercieca had confirmed his communication with Patricia and disclosed two meetings but denied ever receiving payment for his blog posts concerning the Fenech case.

 The plaintiff, Mark Camilleri, attended the court session, accompanied by lawyers David Bonello and Joseph Mizzi. Mizzi opened his cross-examination by asking Patricia about her relationship with Mercieca. Patricia explained that Mercieca initially reached out via Facebook Messenger, seeking information about Raħal Ġdid for his research, as her grandfather was well-known in the area.

 In her testimony, Patricia stated that she met Mercieca around four times. Their first meeting, in 2020, involved a Christmas invitation from Mercieca and his family. On another occasion, Patricia reciprocated by inviting Mercieca’s family to her home. They also met briefly for coffee by a pool in St Julian’s, where Mercieca covered the bill.

 “There was an entire campaign against my son; everything was against him at that time,” Patricia recalled, mentioning that she wanted him to write a blog post in his defence.

 Besides discussing blog posts, their conversations touched on current affairs, although Patricia noted that Mercieca’s busy schedule limited their exchanges. She also clarified that she did not discuss the ongoing libel case with Mercieca, aside from a summons paper she received and did not fully understand until reading about it in an article by Mark Camilleri.

 Adding to this, she mentioned that her name “was very popular on Mark Camilleri’s website”.

 Patricia recounted reading Mercieca’s blog regularly, often beginning their conversations by asking about his wife. However, she maintained that she rarely commented on his blog posts about her son, simply telling Mercieca that she had read them.

 During cross-examination, Mizzi suggested that Patricia wanted to get Yorgen’s side of the story published, presenting text messages between Patricia and Mercieca. To emphasise his point, he quoted one message from Patricia, saying: “or we go to Saviour. Are we going to remain silent?”

 She told the Court she knew Saviour Balzan well, as he used to teach her children.

 She concluded her testimony by saying she had not discussed the case with other media outlets and only met Mercieca on the four occasions she previously mentioned.

Businessman wanted in Sweden VAT fraud case granted bail once more,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/businessman-wanted-sweden-vat-fraud-case-granted-bail.1092053,05-07-2024,003358.png,"A Maltese businessman who is challenging proceedings for his extradition to Sweden in relation to a Europe-wide investigation into a €195 million VAT fraud case, has been granted bail for a second time.
 Mohan Bharwani, 57, from Sliema was targeted by a European Arrest Warrant issued by the Swedish authorities and was charged in February.
 He did not consent to extradition and was remanded in custody. A week later, he was granted bail by a court that imposed stringent conditions, including third-party surety by Bharwani’s wife and three children.
 The case stemmed from an alleged fraudulent racket spanning 17 countries.
 Bharwani is one of some 15 suspects whom Europol believe to have orchestrated the racket and their arrests followed over 180 searches conducted simultaneously in different countries, including Malta, by the European Public Prosecutor’s Office.
 Bharwani’s bail was revoked when the court ordered his return to Sweden, upholding the request for extradition.
 That order was confirmed by the Court of Criminal Appeal on April 16.
 He was remanded in custody pending his surrender after the prescribed time limit in terms of law.
 Pending that term, Bharwani’s lawyers filed constitutional proceedings claiming that his right to a fair trial was breached throughout the extradition hearing because he was never given access to the devices and data seized by investigators during the search.
 Notwithstanding an order by the court to make that information available to the suspect, Bharwani was never granted access and was thus unable to defend himself.
 Thus the order to extradite Bharwani was null, argued his lawyers.
 While his breach of rights case continues, Bharwani’s lawyers filed a fresh application for bail arguing that the 60-day legal timeframe for wrapping up extradition proceedings had lapsed on April 23. Yet, Bharwani was still being detained at the Corradino Correctional Facility while challenging his extradition to Sweden before the constitutional courts.
 Citing similar circumstances in the cases of John Spiteri, Paul Attard and Emmanuel Spiteri, defence lawyers Stefano Filletti, Giannella DeMarco and Maurice Meli pointed out that the courts had granted bail in those cases after the extradition request was upheld.
 Moreover, there were no legal grounds for denying bail.
 After hearing submissions by the defence and the Attorney General the Court of Criminal Appeal, presided over by Madam Justice Consuelo Scerri Herrera, upheld the request for bail.
 Bharwani could be granted bail pending conclusion of his constitutional proceedings which are to determine the “final decision to surrender,” decreed the judge.
 The prosecution objected mainly because of the risk that Bharwani might abscond.
 However the court observed that the wanted person was a Maltese national, with strong ties on the island. All his family and work roots were based in Malta.
 Moreover his wife and three children had stepped in as third party guarantors.
 The fear of absconding should not be an abstract one based merely on the gravity of the alleged offence but was to be assessed in light of other factors which presented a real risk.
 If necessary safeguards existed to ensure that the wanted person would attend all court hearings, there was no reason to deny him bail.
 Bharwani had abided by all conditions when previously granted bail.
 And those conditions, including the third party guarantee by his family and twice daily signing of the bail book, were satisfactory.
 The court thus upheld Bharwani’s request under the same bail conditions previously imposed by the Magistrates’ Court presiding over the EAW proceedings.
 Lawyers Stefano Filletti, Giannella DeMarco and Maurice Meli are assisting Bharwani.

Fresh Vitals arraignment delayed by a week after AG lawyers leave it too late,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/fresh-vitals-arraignment-delayed-week-ag-lawyers-leave-late.1093775,06-10-2024,003359.png,"The fresh arraignment of a group of people and companies in connection with the hospitals scandal has been delayed by a week after the Attorney General’s office left it too late to seek the revocation of a decree that annulled the first sitting. 
 Two former senior ministers and three permanent secretaries and a group of other individuals and companies were due to appear in court on Tuesday but the case was deferred to Monday, June 17. 
 An eleven-hour marathon Vitals sitting was annulled two weeks ago after defence lawyers pointed out that one of the persons charged had not been duly notified. 
 Former deputy prime minister Chris Fearne and Central Bank Governor Edward Scicluna, together with three permanent secretaries and nine officials, had pleaded not guilty to fraud and other crimes allegedly linking them to the now-annulled hospitals privatisation deal. 
 But as the session entered its tenth hour late in the evening on May 29, lawyers defending DF Advocates, as the only ‘non-natural person’ on the charge sheet, argued the name was not a juridical entity but just a “trade name.” 
 Furthermore, three of those charged in court, namely chief financial officer Kenneth Deguara, and lawyers Kevin Deguara and Jean Carl Farrugia from DF Advocates were present in court but had been notified of the charges in their personal capacity not as representatives of the entity, argued the defence. 
 Faced with those arguments and after checking the notices of summons, Magistrate Leonard Caruana decreed that DF Advocates had not been duly notified, spelling nullity of the hearing. 
 However, last Thursday, prosecuting lawyers from the Attorney General’s office filed an application requesting the court to reverse that decree and proceed with the hearing at the point where it was left off. 
 That meant the court was to proceed with the personal details of DF Advocates as represented by Kenneth Deguara, Kevin Deguara and/or Jean Carl Farrugia, argued the prosecutors. 
 In fact, all three had been charged in their personal capacity and on behalf of DF Advocates and that meant that the entity was actually represented in court, argued the prosecution. 
 DF Advocates had also been registered in terms of article 88A of the Code of Organization and Civil Procedure since April 2022. 
 That registration gave it a distinct and separate juridical personality. 
 They argued that the court was wrong in declaring that one of the persons charged was not duly notified. Everyone was served with notice of summons and each person was told what charges they were facing, whether in their personal capacity or as representing DF Advocates. 
 All were present at the sitting. 
 The court minuted that “DF Advocates represented by Dr Kevin Deguara, Dr Jean Carl Farrugia and Dr Kenneth Deguara assisted by lawyers Ezekiel Psaila, Franco Debono and Jonathan Thompson.” 
 However, the application calling for the revocation of the decree was filed on Thursday, on the eve of a public holiday and weekend, leaving the presiding magistrate with no time to deal with the request before Tuesday’s sitting. 
 The magistrate was not happy with the situation, saying “It would have been far better for the administration of justice” had such a request been filed earlier, allowing the court sufficient time to work on it. 
 He said it was ""humanly impossible"" to work on the request and decide upon it till Tuesday's scheduled hearing (because of late filing).
 Warning all parties that it would not tolerate a repeat, the court deferred the hearing to Monday and ordered notification of the decree to all persons charged, the Attorney General and the Police Commissioner.

Worker charged with threatening Karl Stagno Navarra over unsettled debt,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/charged-threatening-karl-stagno-navarra-unsettled-debt.1097443,31-08-2024,003368.png,"A maintenance worker raising his young daughter single-handedly, was remanded in custody on Friday for allegedly threatening ONE TV host Karl Stagno Navarra over an unsettled debt. 
 The issue allegedly revolved around a car which 47-year old Jean Pierre Schembri from Żebbuġ, had sold to Stagno Navarra and for which he was still owed money. 
 Matters apparently came to a head on Wednesday when Stagno Navarra reported at Qormi police station that he was allegedly being harassed by Schembri who was sending him threatening and insulting messages over the past months. 
 The complainant also claimed that he had noticed Schembri in the vicinity of his home and workplace. 
 The police summoned the suspect for questioning. 
 But shortly afterwards, Stagno Navarra called again to report that Schembri had turned up at his home.
 A violent episode ensued during which Schembri allegedly smashed a vase with a crash helmet he was carrying and also attacked his alleged debtor, causing slight injuries. 
 The alleged aggressor subsequently obeyed police orders when summoned to the police station. He was taken into custody. 
 On Friday, he was charged with harassment, causing his alleged victim fear of violence, insulting and threatening him, slightly injuring him, causing wilful damage to third-party property as well as misuse of electronic communications equipment. 
 He pleaded not guilty. 
 A request for bail was objected to mainly because the alleged victim was still to testify and there was thus a real risk of tampering with evidence. Moreover, the defendant had allegedly breached a conditional discharge handed down in 2022. 
 Defence lawyer Lennox Vella countered that this trouble stemmed from an unsettled debt in respect of which the defendant had even filed a judicial letter, securing an executive title over the vehicle he had sold to Stagno Navarra. 
 Apparently, the purchaser had long been taking him for a ride, telling the defendant to collect the money from different places. But the money was never handed over. 
 Moreover, the lawyer claimed that Stagno Navarra had threatened “to have [the defendant’s] daughter placed in state care.” 
 Schembri had sole care and custody over the minor and if his request for bail were to be turned down, he would face consequences that were far more serious than the offences he was being charged with, argued the lawyer. 
 After hearing submissions, the court, presided over by magistrate Giannella Camilleri Busuttil, turned down the request after observing that the defendant had a previous conviction on his record for a similar offence. 
 The court also upheld a request for a protection order, warning the defendant not to approach or communicate with Stagno Navarra in any way. 
 The defence objected to a request by the prosecution earlier in the hearing for a ban on the alleged victim’s name w because it was legally unfounded. It was subsequently rejected by the court. 
 The defendant voiced his concern over the fate of his minor child once his request for bail was turned down. 
 Inspector Doriette Cuschieri prosecuted. Lawyer Lennox Vella was defence counsel.

Ex MCAST principal challenges dismissal in front of Industrial Tribunal,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/ex-mcast-principal-challenges-dismissal-front-industrial-tribunal.1098610,26-09-2024,003371.png,"Former MCAST principal Joachim James Calleja has taken his former employer and education authorities to the Industrial Tribunal, claiming his dismissal as college head was “totally unjust and unfounded”. 
 The court action comes in the wake of a damning report by the Education Commissioner within the Ombudsman’s Office which concluded that the dismissal was “both unreasonable and unjust”.
 
 Calleja has now taken his case a step further by filing his grievances before the Industrial Tribunal. 
 He had been appointed college principal and CEO for a fixed term according to the Education Act. In March 2021, his contract was extended by MCAST’s Board of Governors until May 31, 2026. 
 But last June he was informed that his post was being terminated, with the end date set for August 31. 
 Calleja is arguing that his post did not fall within the remit of the Public Administration Collective Bargaining Unit but was subject to the college’s own Board of Governors. 
 Such a measure was intended precisely to ensure that the college would be academically and administratively independent.
 When his contract was extended in 2021, MCAST’s board members were well aware of the principal’s “advanced age”. 
 His contract of employment - both in its original form and when extended - made no reference to any required approval by the Minister or his permanent secretary.
 That contract was governed exclusively by the Employment and Industrial Relations Act. No other conditions applied, argued Calleja, claiming that his dismissal was illegal and unjust. 
 That was also the conclusion reached by the Education Commissioner in his final opinion delivered in August. 
 In his claim, filed against the Education Minister, the permanent secretary, MCAST and the State Advocate, Calleja called upon the tribunal to declare his dismissal “totally unjust and unfounded”.
 He also requested the tribunal to order the respondents to pay any sum awarded as compensation in this employment dispute.

 The companies had sought court action following the Health Ministry’s termination of the Paola Health Hub contract following a number of missed deadlines.
 The Vincent Moran regional health hub in Paola is ready, but corruption-hit Technoline has so far failed to deliver the medical equipment.  Photos showing several clinical rooms, corridors and waiting areas suggest that works on the regional health hub are completed.
  However, despite having fully functional electrical and water connections, the building seems to lack the medical equipment, which was supposed to have been supplied by Technoline.
 In a ruling on Friday, Judge Ian Spiteri Bailey refuse the companies’ request to prevent government from taking possession of the Paola Health Hub building, noting that the building in question was already government property.
 The court also threw out a request to prohobit government from making alterations to the hospital and to start making use of the building. Judge Spiteri Bailey noted that it would reflect poorly on any company that enters into a multi-million euro public tender if said company runs into difficulties in giving a breakdown of its work and incurred costs.

One in 10 SLAPPs filed in Europe between 2010 - 2023 targeted Maltese: report,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/one-10-slapps-filed-europe-2010-2023-targeted-maltese-report.1102194,12-09-2024,003376.png,"Nearly one in 10 SLAPP cases filed in European courts in 14 years targeted people in Malta, most of whom were journalists, according to a new report.
 Of the 1,049 SLAPP cases filed in the years spanning from 2010 and 2023, a total of 91 (9%) targeted defendants in Malta, data by the Coalition Against SLAPPS in Europe (CASE) shows. Most of these were filed against slain journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia.
 SLAPPs (strategic lawsuits against public participation) are court proceedings intended to harass and intimidate people involved in protecting the public interest, such as journalists.
 In a recent case, a Sofia court of appeals threw out a SLAPP action by Satabank’s Bulgarian co-owner Hristo Georgiev against Times of Malta, over an article the court held to be substantially true.
 The action stemmed from an article published on January 27, 2019, with the headline ‘Billions of euros in Satabank transactions deemed highly suspicious,’ with particular reference to a quote from a source who said, “This makes previous money laundering cases look like child’s play”.
 In July, the Maltese government said it had become the first EU member state to transpose anti-SLAPP law. 
 But the Institute of Maltese Journalists warned the measure transposed by the government was only part of a much-needed wider reform.
 The Daphne Caruana Galizia Foundation, which drafted the 2024 Report on SLAPPs in Europe for CASE, said on Monday Malta’s anti-SLAPP legislation was ""inadequate"", as the transposition of the EU directive did not provide comprehensive and effective protection.
 ""Among other problems, it provides no protection against abusive litigation in domestic civil cases or criminal cases, it disregards the EU Recommendation that formed part of the same anti-SLAPP package as the directive, and it fails to meet the standards set by the Council of Europe Recommendation on countering the use of SLAPPs.""
 166 SLAPPS in 2024
 CASE's report for this year shows that 166 SLAPPs were fired across Europe in 2023 alone. 
 Released on Monday to mark International AntiCorruption Day, the report found that journalists are the most frequently targeted defendants, followed by media outlets, editors, activists, and NGOs.
 Of the newly documented  SLAPPs in 2023, one in three relate to corruption and more than 15% to environmental issues.
 Most were filed by businesses and politicians.
 The countries with the largest numbers of new cases were Italy (26), Romania (15), Serbia (10), and Turkey (10).
 For the first time, the CASE report also recorded SLAPPs in Monaco, Lithuania, Azerbaijan and Denmark, bringing the total number of European countries in which SLAPPs have been identified to 41.
 In 14 years, 64.3% of SLAPPs filed across Europe were civil lawsuits but the statistics collated for the CASE report show an increasing proportion of cases based in criminal law.

Teacher in alleged rental contracts racket told Identità he was illiterate,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/teacher-accused-providing-tcns-fake-addresses.1101543,25-11-2024,003378.png,"A teacher who stands accused of providing third-country nationals fake rental agreements to acquire residency in Malta, tried to explain the exaggerated number of TCNs registered at one of his properties by claiming to investigators that he could not read or write well and was not so computer literate.
 Harold Mamo also claimed that all his income was derived from private lessons and rents generated by several properties he owned.
 That snippet of information emerged on Monday when the compilation of evidence kicked off against the 56-year old who was charged ten days ago over his alleged involvement in a racket wherein he provided TCNs with fake addresses and “highly likely forged rental agreements” enabling them to apply for a residence permit.
 Police first got a whiff of some underhand criminal activity through a Facebook post by former MP Jason Azzopardi who said that a woman had told him about a strange discovery at the Msida residence where her mother used to live.
 She had come across a black mailbox affixed to the house façade. Inside it she found a number of documents from Identità addressed to third country nationals who were supposed to live there.
 The woman had also filed a report at Sliema police station.
 That information triggered investigations by the Immigration police, explained Inspector Karl Roberts who testified on Monday about how he pieced together evidence leading up to Mamo’s arrest.
 He started off by speaking to the woman who had filed that report.
 The correspondence she found in that mailbox consisted of letters sent by Identita’ for the addressees to collect their residence permits.
 A compliance officer at Identità's Msida offices told her that there were four TCNs registered at that address.
 Over one hundred TCNs were registered at another address at The Strand. That property belonged to Mamo.
 When questioned by a compliance officer at Identità about all those persons registered at the same address, Mamo said, “I don’t know how to read and write much, nor to use the computer.”
 Identita’ subsequently tracked down another property at Siġġiewi where many TCNs were likewise registered.
 They summoned the property owner. His son, Anthony Attard, turned up at Identità with Mamo.
 Attard subsequently told police that he had simply “done Mamo a favour.”
 He said he used to visit Mamo’s barber shop at Guardamangia. Mamo had tasked him to do some ‘work,’ which consisted in fixing mailboxes at a number of properties at Msida and other locations.
 The favour was “to register TCNs at [Attard]’s parents’ residence at Siġġiewi.”
 Attard was also charged and was handed a suspended sentence upon admission.
 One of the twenty or so TCNs questioned by the police, a Pakistani national, said that he had contacted a property rental agency he came across on Facebook. The person he contacted put him in touch with Mamo.
 The Pakistani man did not want a residence but simply an address.
 That third party from the rental agency was also criminally charged and handed a probation term.
 Each of the TCNs said that they got a lease agreement from Mamo who promised them a bed space “but they got nothing.”
 All identified Mamo when shown a photo and all said that they spoke to him at the barber shop.
 When police searched those premises, they seized €8,940 in cash and a “sheaf of rental agreements” as well as a substantial number of notifications sent by Identita’ to TCNs and utility bills.
 However, the majority of rent agreements named third parties rather than Mamo as lessors, indicating that those documents were “likely forged,” explained Roberts.
 FCID inspector Tonjoe Farrugia also testified that between 2019 and 2023, Mamo had declared tens of thousands of euros in rents he received on his properties.
 In 2023 alone, there were 540 rental agreements all registered with the Housing Authority for varying duration, some also short lets.
 Mamo insisted that he “lived alone” and led “a normal life” getting by on private tuition fees and rents.
 He said that his accountant handled his tax returns.
 Mamo said that his lessees “had no high expectations. They only wanted water, electricity and a bed.”
 When Mamo’s lawyer exited the FCID interrogation room, the suspect had asked police, “how much can the fine be for such a case? Could I get away with a fine?”
 “Mamo insisted that others had done much worse than him,”[haddiehor ghamel hafna aghar minnu], Farrugia told the court. 
 The accused’s lawyers made submissions on bail. The issue will be decided after the next sitting when the prosecution is expected to produce the TCNs and other civilian witnesses. 
 AG lawyers Andrea Zammit and Manuel Grech prosecuted together with inspectors Farrugia and Roberts.

No bail for motorist accused of pointing fake gun at bus driver,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/129703/no_bail_for_motorist_accused_of_pointing_fake_gun_at_bus_driver,12-06-2024,003379.png,"A motorist who allegedly threatened a bus driver with an imitation handgun last month was charged on Wednesday, after being tracked down by the police.
 Simon Leyton Rachid, 23, from Valletta was arraigned under arrest before magistrate Rachel Montebello on Wednesday, charged with causing the Filipino bus driver to fear for his safety, breaching two sets of previous bail conditions and recidivism.
  Inspector John Sammut, prosecuting the case, gave an account of what had led to Rashid’s arrest. 
 He told the court that the driver of the bus in question had gone to the Żurrieq police station at around 7:30pm on May 28 to report that earlier that day, while he had been driving his bus in Triq il-Barrieri, Żurrieq, a Toyota Vitz coming in the opposite direction had come alongside his vehicle.
 While passing the smaller car, he said, its driver had pointed what looked like a handgun at the bus driver, who upon seeing this, stepped on the accelerator and drove away. The other vehicle did not follow or give chase.
 The police had requested footage from the public transport operator, and upon examining it had noticed that the incident had been captured on video in its entirety. However, the Vitz’s registration number could not be made out from the onboard footage, so investigators had approached residents in the area who might have recorded the car’s number plate on their home security cameras.
 The police were able to identify the registration details from CCTV footage retrieved from one of the residents, and had called in the Toyota’s registered owner for questioning. 
 The owner had released a statement to the police, explaining that although the car was hers, she had lent it to her daughter on the date in question.
 It emerged that Rashid had been using the car at the time of the incident. 
 In court today, Rashid pleaded not guilty to the charges and was remanded in custody.

 Psychiatrists Rachel Taylor-East, Nigel Camilleri, and Christian Sant testified, where they confirmed that in the testing that was conducted at the hospital, the accused tested positive for mephedrone, and a host of other substances.

                     In their testimony, the psychiatrists looked at the accused’s development from the very moment he was born, they recalled that they took note of his full development, such as the fact that he has autism spectrum disorder, personality disorder, and psychosis. 

 They noted that Brincat’s psychosis could have been the result of his drug use. The psychiatrists concluded their testimony by confirming that Brincat, at the time of the offence, was in a state of “insanity”.

 The court, presided Magistrate Kevan Azzopardi, has ordered the defence and prosecution to better examine the reports presented by the testifying psychiatrists. The Court concluded by ordering Brincat to be kept in custody in Mount Carmel Hospital. 

 Brincat had been charged with a list of offences relating to terrorism and the illicit manufacture of explosives last month, following a police investigation into the discovery of an explosive device placed in a dustbin outside the Labour Party building, which traced it back to Brincat.

 Police reportedly found TATP - a volatile homemade explosive that has been used in terrorist attacks overseas- inside the garage where Brincat was residing.

 It is understood that the police investigation also revealed that Brincat had plans to produce and plant more explosive devices with specific targets in mind.

 The complaint is connected to the ongoing criminal case against Joseph Muscat, Konrad Mizzi, Keith Schembri, and other individuals currently being heard in front of Magistrate Rachel Montebello.

 The lawyers representing the accused claim that Miroslava Milenović misrepresented her credentials, demanding an official investigation into her qualifications and fees.

                     The complaint, addressed to the Commissioner of Police, questions Milenović's qualifications and role, particularly following her testimony during a court session on 13 November, where she was subjected to cross-examination.

 In the complaint, the accused’s lawyers said that Milenović is neither an accountant nor qualified as a forensic accountant, contrary to her previous assertions.

 This came after Milenović faced heated scrutiny over qualifications and methods for her role in uncovering complex financial links.

 The defence team contends that Milenović consistently misrepresented her qualifications, swearing under oath that she is a “Chartered Accountant” and a “Forensic Accountant”, further adding that her false claims have led to her repeated appointment by the courts and magistrates in high-profile inquiries.

 The complaint seeks an investigation into the payments made to Milenović for her alleged services, questioning their validity given her purported lack of qualifications.

 The complaint asked for a detailed list of evidence to be presented and that individuals be summoned. This includes all court decrees appointing Milenović as an expert, records of payments made to her by the judiciary, and other documentation related to her residency and tax status. The defence also called for police inspectors, members of the Police investigating this case and a representative from the Accountancy Board.

 The lawyers for the accused argue that Milenovic's alleged misrepresentation of her certificates and qualifications may have significantly impacted multiple legal proceedings. They request that the authorities pursue legal action against her under the applicable laws.

 Repubblika condemns 'vile intimidation' against expert

 In response to Milenović’s testemony and the proceedings in Court, NGO Repubblika stated said “we cannot afford to see criminal organisations use their resources to intimidate state officials working to lock them up”.   

 Repubblika denounced what it describes as “vile intimidation” against forensic expert Miroslava Milenović, claiming the actions are intended to discredit her work, which could implicate Joseph Muscat and his associates in serious wrongdoing.

 The NGO argued that since Muscat cannot undermine the evidence collected, he is instead seeking to discredit and intimidate the individual responsible for gathering it.   

 Repubblika added that Milenović had previously been appointed as a forensic accountant during the Egrant inquiry. At that time, her credentials were not contested, which Repubblika suggests that current efforts to challenge her qualifications are a targeted attempt to shield Muscat and his allies from accountability.   

 The organisation also referred to threats allegedly issued by Jason Micallef, spokesperson for Muscat’s organisation, warning of retribution against those contributing to Muscat’s prosecution.  

 Repubblika said that such intimidation tactics aim to silence conscientious state officials and hinder their ability to perform their duties in accordance with the law. “We will never leave the state forces alone to fight organized crime and promote legality,"" the group said.

"€69,500 damages for MRSA infection confirmed on appeal, 17 years later",maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/129688/award_of_695k_damages_for_2007_mrsa_infection_confirmed_on_appeal_17_years_later_,11-06-2024,003448.png,"A 17-year court saga ended yesterday with the Court of Appeal confirming an earlier award of €69,561.65 in damages to a patient who was left a paraplegic after contracting the MRSA “superbug” during a 2007 hospital stay.
 In a decision handed down yesterday, the Court of Appeal presided by Chief Justice Mark Chetcuti and judges Giannino Caruana Demajo and Anthony Ellul dismissed the Government’s Principal Medical Officer’s appeal against the 2019 judgement and found the defendants liable in damages to the Carmela Bouharis and her husband,Abdelkrim, who had originally filed the case against the Director General of the Health Service.
  Sadly, the patient who had suffered the infection, Carmela Bouharis, did not live to see her court victory, having passed away while the proceedings were still ongoing. 
 Bouharis had been 48 when she was referred to the emergency department at St. Luke’s Hospital on 9 February 2007, suffering from nausea, dizziness and dehydration.
 Medical staff had placed her on a drip and before long, a dark, round bruise had formed around the needle insertion site, where a yellowish liquid had also started to accumulate. 
 On 24 February 2007, the woman had collapsed while attempting to get out of bed to go shower, after her legs gave way. She told doctors that she had noticed a yellowish liquid coming out of her arm after she fell and was found to have been infected with the MRSA superbug, with the infection having already spread to her spine.
 She had been rushed into surgery and operated upon on the same day, but surgeons discovered that the infection had already established itself in her body. Bouharis spent a month in a hospital bed, unable to move and was told that she would spend the rest of her life using a walking frame, incontinent and unable to traverse stairs unaided.
 In 2019- 12 years after the case was filed, the First Hall of the Civil Court, presided by Mr. Justice Joseph R. Micallef had upheld her claim for damages, awarding her €69,561.65.
 From the testimonies of several medical doctors and consultants, it emerged that such was the speed of its spread, it was difficult to ascertain when Bouharis had originally contracted the infection and whether she had caught it while in the hospital or previously, from the community.
 However, the Court also noted that in their testimony, as well as that given by the court appointed medical expert, it was apparent that hospital staff had failed to take timely action when pus was observed on her arm. It was also noted that MRSA had been reported several times at the overcrowded hospital whose conditions would have facilitated the spread of the MRSA bacteria.
 One doctor told the court that, at the time, St. Luke’s had a higher incidence of MRSA when compared to other European hospitals. Another had testified that the bacteria tended to spread more easily in hospitals than in the community.
 In their judgement confirming the liability established by the previous court, the judges said that although the date and place of Bouharis’ initial infection with MRSA could not be definitively established, it could not be disputed that she would have been diagnosed much faster- and would have suffered far less severe consequences as a consequence - had a blood test been carried out at an earlier stage.
 The plaintiffs were represented by lawyers David Camilleri and Jose Herrera.  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police
Jason Azzopardi asks magistrate to probe 'racket' in Gozo,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/an-essential-lead-corrupt-end-azzopardi-files-inquiry-gozo-racket.1102488,15-12-2024,003451.png,"Updated 5.50pm with Transport Malta statement
 Former PN MP Jason Azzopardi has filed an urgent request for another magisterial inquiry into an alleged criminal racket spanning the Gozo Ministry and Transport Malta, featuring Minister Clint Camilleri and his wife. 
 Azzopardi claims that government jobs and/or greatly sought-after mooring spots at the Mġarr harbour are being handed out fraudulently, and has asked the court to seize electronic devices to preserve evidence they contain before it is irretrievably lost. 
 In a brief statement, Transport Malta said it would ""cooperate fully"" with any inquiry should a court order one. 
 Prime Minister Robert Abela reacted furiously to Azzopardi's allegations, saying the former MP was abusing the system of magisterial inquiries and vowing to reform it. 
 A resident, of Qala, Toni Caruana, nicknamed Żbibu, allegedly features at the heart of the racket.
 In his court application, Azzopardi claims Caruana regularly met third parties in the village square or local band club, promising them jobs in the public sector or the mooring spaces down at the Gozo harbour, against monetary kickbacks or other gifts. 
 Mooring spots were secured even to persons who were not fishermen, he claims. Other people on the waiting list for the highly demanded spots, were assisted by jumping the queue on the waiting list, he further alleges.
 According to the claims, Caruana would then pass on the relative requests and information to his son, Christoph, until recently serving as the head of Customer Care at the Gozo Ministry and a member of Minister Clint Camilleri’s private secretariat. 
 This public officer would contact fellow public officer, Marcel Meilaq, at Gozo’s Transport Malta office, Azzopardi alleges. 
 Meilaq also hails from Qala and was likewise “very close” to the minister, said Azzopardi. 
 He said Meilaq was the “essential link” which enabled this ""racket"" to reach its “corrupt end”.
  And all along Gozo Minister Clint Camilleri was aware of the goings-on and was thus an accomplice, claimed Azzopardi, stressing however, that he did not have any evidence that the Minister derived any monetary benefits out of the criminal activity. 
 He did however get political mileage by securing electoral votes. 
 Father and son Caruana’s actions took place “with the blessing and approval” of the Minister, Azzopardi said.
 In a brief statement on Facebook on Sunday afternoon, Camilleri said he ""categorically"" denied the allegations. 
  Azzopardi also said the minister’s wife, lawyer Deborah Camilleri, was breaking the law. 
 Although she was a full-time manager at Transport Malta in Gozo, Camilleri regularly exercised her private legal profession before the Gozo courts, often attending morning sittings when she should be at her TM office.
 That meant that on a prima facie level, Camilleri was liable to face prosecution for money laundering. 
 As a Transport Malta official, Camilleri was allegedly aware of the racket, said Azzopardi.
 Azzopardi has asked a magistrate to investigate the suspected persons for suspected criminal organization, trading in influence, false declarations, fraud and forgery, money laundering and bribery of public officials. 
 He also asked the court to investigate the minister’s wife for embezzlement and misappropriation, with her husband as an accomplice. 
 Azzopardi presented court documents proving that at least on 11 different occasions, Camilleri was assisting private clients before the Gozo court during office hours at Transport Malta. 
 Court minutes attached to his application showed that Camilleri appeared before two different magistrates on the same day and even before the same magistrate in two separate cases on the same day. 
 Lawyer Jason Azzopardi signed the sworn application. 
 In a post on his Facebook page, Prime Minister Robert Abela said Azzopardi was abusing the existing system of magisterial inquiries to ""drag people through the Calvary of judicial proceedings for nothing"". 
 Clint Camilleri's wife, he said, only worked on private cases outside of office hours or while on leave, with the permission of her superiors. 
 ""The extremist faction of the PN, through Jason Azzopardi, wants to throw an innocent mother-of-two in jail,"" Abela said, adding that Labour would be taking a harder line against such claims in the future. 
  ""Since 2013 the Labour Party reasoned it would allow these sorts of cruel and baseless attacks without pushing back against them. It was a mistake. The line has now been completely crossed,"" the prime minister wrote. 
 He said Azzopardi was abusing of the system of magisterial inquiries and that he has asked the Justice Minister, Jonathan Attard, to expedite a planned reform of the system ""so that this sort of abuse is cut out once and for all"".

 Four Colombian women were cross-examined on Wednesday on their account of how they had ended up working in the sex trade in Malta.  From the stand, one witness identified D’Amato, whom she said she knew as ‘Andreas,’ and Luke Farrugia as one of her clients who went by the name ‘Tyson.’ She added that she had been present in the apartment when Farrugia had paid another Colombian girl, who later left Malta, for sex.
 One of the women had told the magisterial inquiry that her mother had received threatening phone calls - one from Colombia and another from Malta, during which the callers had ordered her to tell her daughter not to speak to the police and to feign ignorance if asked who her pimp was.
 In her testimony today, the woman said that her mother had also received a visit from the girl who had put her in contact with the Maltese organisation at her home. The girl had told the mother that nothing was going to happen to her daughter and that she would get her money back, but that it was important that she didn’t talk to the police. The witness said her mother had subsequently warned her to keep her mouth shut.
 Besides having never been paid for her work, she said that she had been subjected to verbal abuse, and recalled being called a “stupid bitch who came to Malta just to satisfy men.” 
 She said that she had been misled into believing that she would be staying at a hotel “but instead I ended up living in a brothel.” 
 The case will continue in September.
 The prosecution is being led by Inspectors John Spiteri, Joseph Xerri and Dorianne Tabone together with Lawyers Ramon Bonett Sladden and Charmaine Abdilla from the Office of the Attorney General.
 Lawyers Franco Debono, Marion Camilleri, Adreana Zammit, Mario Mifsud, Nicholas Mifsud, Charles Mercieca, Roberto Montalto, Joe Giglio, Michaela Giglio and Kathleen Calleja Grima are appearing for the accused while Lawyer Lara Dimitrijevic is appearing for the victims.

Court revokes planning permission for Sliema hotel project,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/132732/court_revokes_planning_permission_for_sliema_hotel_project,11-12-2024,,"The Court of Appeal has ruled in favour of residents and NGOs opposing a controversial hotel development in Sliema, revoking the planning permission previously granted by the Environment and Planning Review Tribunal (EPRT). 

 The decision, issued by Chief Justice Mark Chetcuti, emphasised the protection of residential zones and adherence to local planning policies.

                     The appeal, spearheaded by Moviment Graffitti alongside residents and environmental activists, challenged a decision permitting the development of an 11-storey hotel in a residential area between Sliema and Gżira.

 The proposal included the demolition of an existing structure and construction of an 11-storey building comprising a hotel, spa, gym, restaurant, and parking facilities.

 Central to the appellants’ argument was the assertion that the project violated the North Harbours Local Plan, which prioritises residential use in the area. They argued that the hotel would significantly impact the neighbourhood’s residential character, contravening guidelines aimed at preserving local amenity and quality of life.

 Additionally, the site in question was not designated for hotel development. The court examined whether the flexibility policy, which allows deviations from local plans under exceptional circumstances, could justify the project. 

 The tribunal had previously argued that the proximity of the site to the seafront and existing commercial activity in the vicinity constituted “overriding reasons” for approving the development. 

 However, the Court of Appeal found this interpretation flawed, stating that such reasons must be extraordinary and dominant. It highlighted that the surrounding area lacked the substantial commercial commitments necessary to warrant applying the flexibility policy.

 Furthermore, the court criticised the tribunal for overstepping its mandate by suggesting that the development could be reconsidered as a hostel, an alternative use that complies with local policy. 

 Judge Mark Chetcuti said that planning decisions should evaluate the proposal as submitted by the applicant and not propose substantive changes. Ultimately, the court annulled the tribunal’s partial approval of the project, revoking the planning application entirely. 

 In a statement, Moviment Graffitti said: “Today, the court agreed with us that a hotel cannot legally be constructed in the area and that the EPRT had no right to revert the application for reassessment by the PA as a hostel.”

 Lawyer Claire Bonello represented the appellants on this case.     ",Jordan Pace ,court_and_police
Engineer who died after falling down Sliema lift shaft named as Robert Schembri,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/man-64-dies-falling-lift-shaft-sliema.1096272,08-03-2024,003505.png,"A man who died after falling down a lift shaft in Sliema has been named as Robert Schembri.
 Police confirmed Schembri's death on Saturday afternoon, saying that the 64-year-old engineer from Santa Luċija fell around four storeys in a private residence.
 The incident occurred at around 12pm on Triq Stella Maris. 
 It is understood Schembri was working on the structure of a lift in an apartment owned by his son when he fell down the shaft. 
 At some point, the victim took a step inside the lift shaft, possibly unaware that the lift had descended to a lower floor, according to sources.  
 In a Facebook post on Saturday afternoon, Foreign Minister and former Infrastructure Minister Ian Borg paid tribute to the late engineer, describing his ""great sadness"" at the news. 
 Schembri had worked alongside former Infrastructure Malta boss Frederick Azzopardi and contributed to projects for the Water Services Corporation (WSC) and Enemalta during his career.
  In a separate post, Justice Minister Jonathan Attard called news of Schembri's death ""shocking"", describing him as a friend and a ""dedicated member of the BCA [Building and Construction Authority] board"".
 Writing on Facebook, the authority said it was ""shocked and troubled"" by the board member's death.
  Lands Minister Stefan Zrinzo Azzopardi said he was shocked by news of Schembri's death, who he said he had known through the late engineer's work in the profession.
  The Chamber of Engineers said it ""mourns the tragic loss"", calling Schembri a ""very experienced engineer with a career spanning various roles.""
  Magistrate Joe Mifsud has opened an inquiry into Schembri's death. 
 A joint investigation by the police and the Occupational Health and Safety Authority is ongoing.

Ta’ Xbiex couple deny assaulting man after alleged groping incident,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/130928/ta_xbiex_couple_deny_assaulting_man_who_allegedly_groped_the_woman_,28-08-2024,003507.png,"A Dutch couple living in Ta’ Xbiex have denied assaulting a man following an alleged groping incident in a street in the seaside town.
 Jerome Jaoad Yousfi, 37-, and 30-year-old Jasmine Gerardina Jalila Louati, both residents of Ta’ Xbiex were arraigned under arrest before magistrate Elaine Rizzo on Tuesday. Yousfi alone was accused of slightly injuring a man on August 3 and damaging his car.
  Louati alone, was charged with the aggravated theft of the man’s mobile phone.
 Both defendants were accused of causing the man to fear that he would be subjected to violence, as well as breaching the peace, assault, insulting and threatening the victim, who Jerome was also accused of pushing.
 Police inspector Michael Vella, prosecuting together with lawyer Brendan Hewer from the Attorney General’s Office explained how, at 8pm on 3 August, officers had been dispatched to bystanders’ reports of an argument involving 3 individuals.
 Officers found the three individuals at the scene, and noted a vehicle with damage to its windscreen and side windows. All three were initially detained, but after examining mobile phone footage, the police subsequently arrested the defendants.
 Yousfi told the court that was a business owner, while Louati described herself as a homemaker.
 Prosecutor Brendan Hewer, from the Office of the Attorney General, said that although the couple did reside in Malta, the prosecution had been unable to establish what the man’s business was.
 The lawyer representing the alleged victim, Charles Mercieca, described the attack as unprovoked and said that there was a substantial risk of further incidents or attempts to intimidate his client before he testified.
 “My client was doing his job. The police had to use force to restrain these two individuals. Had it not been for my client’s cool head, the court would not have been seeing only slight injury charges,” said Mercieca, calling for the court to restrict the defendants’ movements and impose an “onerous deposit which reflects the seriousness of the crime.”
 One of the defendants’ lawyers, Wilfrid Buttigieg, underlined that his clients’ trustworthiness was demonstrated by the absence of any prior run-ins with the law. They were in Malta for the long haul, he said, telling the court that Yousfi was a representative of the Belgian government, whom he was assisting in a commercial matter concerning contracts with a Dutch company, dealing in the health sector.
 The alleged victim had already released a statement to the police and so his account was already preserved as evidence, added the lawyer.
 Lawyer Ingrid Zammit Young, who also assisted the defendants, argued that the incident had come about due to provocation and that the defendants were considering filing a criminal complaint, themselves.
 It is understood that the beating was provoked by a groping incident involving the alleged victim.
 After hearing the parties’ submissions, the court released both defendants on bail, ordering them to each deposit €3,000 and provide a personal guarantee of €5,000, also requiring them to sign a bail book daily.  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police

 Igaming employee Chariton Papadas, a 33-year-old Greek citizen living in Swieqi was arraigned before magistrate Victor Axiak on Wednesday, charged with knowingly making a false accusation before a competent authority as well as giving false evidence in criminal proceedings for a crime punishable by over two years in prison, making a false oath before a court and fabricating evidence in order to get someone unjustly charged with an offence which they had not committed.
  Papadas pleaded not guilty to the charges.
 Police Inspector Mark Anthony Mercieca told the court that on 23 February, 2022, the defendant and another man had been arrested in connection with the bulk importation of drugs into Malta. The men were arrested after a package containing three kilos of cannabis was discovered at the UPS hub in Luqa.

Forensic ward unlikely to be transferred to Corradino,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/forensic-ward-unlikely-transferred-corradino.1096789,21-08-2024,003536.png,"The Correctional Services Agency is in talks with the health authorities for the transition of the forensic ward at Mount Carmel Hospital to new premises but it is almost certain it will not be incorporated within the Corradino Correctional Facility, as suggested by a magisterial inquiry five years ago.
 The forensic ward, opened in 2005, caters for inmates in need of special psychiatric care. 
 A 2019 magisterial inquiry into the death of inmate Johan Pace, led by Magistrate Joe Mifsud, had recommended the closure of the forensic ward in Attard and its transfer to Corradino.
 But, five years later, Chris Siegersma, CEO of the Correctional Services Agency, underlined the importance that any such centre would remain in the vicinity of a mental health facility because this would improve its logistical running.
 The relocation of the forensic ward may become an issue in the months ahead as the government has pledged to close down Mount Carmel psychiatric hospital within four years. While the forensic ward is situated on the grounds of Mount Carmel psychiatric hospital it is technically part of the Corradino Correctional Facility. 
 Should the government follow through with its promise of closing Mount Carmel altogether and agree with the recommendation by a committee of experts that mental health services should be provided in the same place where physical health services are provided, then the forensic ward would probably have to be relocated to Mater Dei Hospital.
 Speaking to Times of Malta, Siegersma assured that, apart from the physical relocation of the forensic ward, “all the recommendations from the magisterial inquiry [into Pace’s death] have been implemented”.
 Pace collapsed in his cell at the forensic ward but died on arrival at Mater Dei on June 23, 2018. 
 The Mifsud magisterial inquiry had found a series of shortcomings in the forensic ward, raising issues of overpopulation, lack of security and transparency.
 The inquiry was adamant that there should be a clear distinction between Mount Carmel and the forensic unit and recommended the creation of a separate entrance to the latter with similar security controls to the ones in place at Corradino.
 The inquiry also suggested that there should be complete transparency regarding the admission of individuals to the unit.
 The inquiry into Pace’s death had revealed the presence of a number of weapons “which certainly do not belong in a facility where individuals need special attention due to some mental condition”.
 Magistrate Mifsud had also called for a thorough review and the need for the constant watch of inmates at the forensic ward because it was evident that Pace “had been behaving abnormally for a long time and was given help very late and not in time”.
 The magisterial inquiry had found the forensic ward to be overpopulated with 48 inmates in living space that was meant to hold 18 individuals.
 Finally, it concluded that “there should be a building within the Kordin Correctional Facility complex that serves as the Forensic Unit”.  
 Siegersma told Times of Malta that access to the forensic ward is now through a separate entrance, which has improved accessibility and security.
 “Enhanced security controls have been implemented, aligning with those at the Corradino Correctional Facility to ensure safety and maintain order,” he said. 
 On the monitoring of inmates, Siegersma said this has been improved “to ensure individuals displaying risky behaviour are kept under constant watch, preventing any lapses in supervision”.
 Besides, “the forensic ward is now only catering for the originally intended number of individuals and all admissions are carried out according to the Mental Health Act”.
 Siegersma also said that processes have been put in place to improve transparency on how individuals are admitted, which include “clearer documentation and communication protocols”.
 Over the years, this has been “abused” with defence lawyers requesting that the courts recommend their clients be sent to the forensic unit at Mount Carmel rather than prison at Corradino.  
 In 2019, one such request was turned down by the presiding magistrate, who also happened to be Mifsud, ruling that the forensic ward was not a prison in terms of law. 
 The improvements in the running of the forensic ward have not prevented the death of another inmate a few weeks ago, however. Jesmond Gatt, 54, was found unconscious with head injuries in a pool of blood last July. He succumbed to his injuries 19 days later.
 Although the exact circumstances of the incident remain unclear, the official version of events states that Gatt had slipped and hit his head.
 Times of Malta had quoted sources indicating that Gatt had been sharing a room with two other inmates, raising questions about the safety of such arrangements in the case of patients with mental health problems.

'Police to press charges against landlord who threatened tenant’s life': union,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/police-press-charges-landlord-threatened-tenant-life-union.1094726,07-01-2024,003546.png,"The police are pressing charges against a landlord who threatened to kill one of his tenants before shutting off his water and electricity supply, a union said on Monday. 
 Aleksandar Vukoje’s water and electricity supply has also been restored, Solidarjetà said in a statement. It said the case is expected to be heard in court in September.
 When contacted, Vukoje said he felt things were “going in the right direction” while hoping for a resolution as soon as possible.
 Last month, Vukoje was forced to call the police after his landlord entered the property and threatened to “slit your throat” in a dispute over a rental contract, before cutting off his water and electricity a few days later.
 He had claimed matters were made worse when the police officer on duty at St Julian’s police station neglected to file a report, forcing him to return a few days later to report the incident to another officer.
 The shocking incident prompted a solidarity demonstration by Solidarjetà, who are assisting the 37-year-old Serbian national and pledged to cover his legal costs.
 The union on Monday said the restoration of utilities to Vukoje’s apartment had only been made possible “because of the solidarity shown by the public and by union members"".
 The union said the incident involving the landlord and the subsequent cutting off of utilities showed how “precarious tenants' lives are in Malta... with the state unable or unwilling to intervene.”
 It demanded the law be changed to allow tenants to restore access to utilities “without legal repercussions”.
 Vukoje told Times of Malta his water and electricity supply was restored on Friday: “It feels amazing, I can’t describe it; after two weeks I can finally live a normal life again"".
 Asked if he still intended to stay at the apartment with the court case looming, he reiterated his intention to stay until the end of his contract which automatically renewed earlier this year. But he admitted he still did not feel fully comfortable at home.
 “It’s a different feeling, the worry is still there... it’s not like before,” he said.
 Questions sent to the police two weeks ago remain unanswered at the time of writing.

 “It would be premature to publish such reports, so as not to hinder that [police] investigation. We leave it to the authorities to do their work and investigate where necessary,” a Transport Malta spokesperson told Times of Malta in a reply to questions.
 “An internal board of inquiry has concluded there was no evidence of tampering of fines. The report has been promptly shared with the police to facilitate their inquiries. Transport Malta is fully collaborating with them in their independent and distinct investigation.”
 Malta Today reported that senior Transport Malta officials are at the centre of a corruption racket in which they allegedly dropped maritime fines in exchange for bribes.
 It said at least three officials within the Maritime Enforcement Unit had tampered with the fines and that in 2021 alone, 59 per cent of Transport Malta fines issued to sea vessels were “lost”.
  The transport authority, that has been riddled with corruption allegations in the past, says an internal investigation found no evidence of abuse, but the Nationalist Party is not buying it.
 The PN says “it has evidence that proves otherwise” and is reliably informed that figures of “lost” fines in 2022 and last year “are even worse”.
 That is why it has demanded that Transport Malta publish the internal investigation, along with how it was carried out and the names of the investigators on the board.
 “We don’t trust this investigation and we have reason to believe it was compromised. We have evidence showing officials were forced to lie under oath and that the board of inquiry members were in contact with witnesses who were testifying before them,” PN shadow ministers said.
 The PN have accused the police of “lethargy” on the case and claimed the government cannot clamp down on abuse as it is being kept hostage by some Transport Malta officials.
 In its reply to questions, the transport authority said it “takes all allegations seriously and is committed to collaborating with law enforcement agencies to ensure a thorough and transparent process”.
 But it offered no explanation to the allegation that 59 per cent of all maritime fines issued in 2021 were “lost”.
 Meanwhile, the police have confirmed they are investigating the case.

Judge revokes €20 million freezing order following Sciacca Grill’s Vitals criminal case acquittal,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/129965/judge_revokes_20_million_freezing_order_following_sciacca_grills_vitals_criminal_case_acquittal,28-06-2024,003572.png,"A judge has revoked the €20 million freezing order imposed on Sciacca Grill, in view of its discharge from criminal proceedings related to the fraudulent hospitals deal.
 Lawyers Franco Debono, Marion Camilleri and David Bonello, representing Sciacca Grill - formerly named Kasco Foods Limited - had challenged the freezing order after a magistrate ordered that the company be discharged from proceedings related to the fraudulent hospitals concession to Vitals Global Healthcare, in which it had been one of the defendants.
  The contestation to the freezing order had been filed within the seven day time limit imposed by law. But in the period between the  filing of the contestation and the sitting in which the challenge was meant to be heard, on Wednesday, Sciacca Grill had been discharged.
 In its decree on Tuesday, magistrate Rachel Montebello ruled that the acts of the case showed no links between the disgraced former OPM Chief of Staff - who remains one of the other defendants in the criminal case - and the company and that there did not appear to be a case for the company to answer.
 The prosecution had insisted that the Attorney General could still appeal that decision and order Sciacca Grill’s re-arraignment and therefore the freezing order should remain in force until that issue was conclusively resolved.
 In her decision this morning, Madam Justice Edwina Grima began by pointing out that a compiling court’s decision to discharge a defendant is definitive and brings the compilation of evidence against that person to an end “on those acts and with that evidence which the court had before it, if nothing else is done subsequently.”
 While it was true that the AG had the right to request a revision of the decision to discharge a person accused, it had not filed an application asking the Criminal Court to issue a warrant for the arrest of the person discharged by the Court of Magistrates. This meant that Sciacca Grill was currently in the position of a person acquitted of the charges against it.
 The procedure set out in the law through which freezing orders can be challenged showed that the legislator intended them to be summary proceedings, as the one month timeframe which applies is “quite short”, noted the judge. “The Court is not given the privilege of waiting for the Attorney General to decide whether or not to contest the decision to discharge and request this court to arrest the discharged person anew…”
 The law did not envisage the particular situation faced by Sciacca Grill, noted the court, but said that it undoubtedly meant that the company could not remain subject to a freezing order when the criminal proceedings against it had concluded with its acquittal.
 For these reasons, the court revoked the freezing order issued against Sciacca Grill with immediate effect.

Another alleged racket: LESA fined tourists for contraventions by locals,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/tourists-unwittingly-fined-lesa-officials-funnel-millions.1097413,30-08-2024,003611.png,"Tourists driving rental cars while on holiday in Malta were unknowingly fined for traffic contraventions committed by local drivers in an alleged complex fraudulent racket operated by LESA officials, swindling millions of euros out of public coffers.
 Details were divulged on Friday by lawyer Jason Azzopardi, in a court application requesting a magisterial probe into what he claims is a years-long racket involving the public agency, its top officials and private car hire companies. 
 He alleges that one of the key beneficiaries of this scheme was WT Global, which operates Malta's largest fleet of Y-Plate cabs. Azzopardi claims hundreds of penalty points incurred by its drivers were “pardoned” in such a manner.
 In a court application, Azzopardi claims tourists were lumped with traffic fines for contraventions committed by Labour-leaning locals. He has also claimed that fines that car rental companies charged unsuspecting tourists were never paid into LESA’s coffers, effectively defrauding the state of millions.
 Azzopardi claims that the racket had been ongoing for years, at least since 2021, and was fine-tuned to function with the “precision of a Swiss watch.”
 In a statement issued through its CEO Svetlick Flores, LESA denied Azzopardi's claims and said it was willing to ""fully collaborate with any investigation"" into them.  
 It is not the first time that LESA has been alleged to have tampered with its software systems to shield contravenors from fines and penalty points. In 2021, multiple sources had told Times of Malta that  LESA had forgiven fines for politicians, top businessmen and other top officials.
 In a lengthy court application, Azzopardi laid out the alleged racket.
 LESA, the Local Enforcement System Agency, is responsible for levying fines for traffic contraventions such as double parking, speeding or driving the wrong way. It also deducts penalty points from contravenors’ licences.
 Azzopardi alleges that in some cases, specific contravenors who broke traffic rules were helped to avoid fines and penalty point deductions by LESA CEO Svetlik Flores and customer care official Neville Camilleri.
 Camilleri is also a Paola local councillor on Labour’s ticket.
 Through their privileged “backdoor” access to the agency’s servers, these two officials allegedly manipulated data to transfer fines and penalty points onto tourists who happened to be driving rental cars that day.
 Azzopardi claims LESA had access to car rental agreements signed between tourists and rental firms.
 Azzopardi claims that Flores and Camilleri forged tourists’ signatures on fake agreements to make it seem that the tourist had agreed to the transfer of penalty points under his or her name.
 Those tourists were none the wiser as penalty points did not affect their driving licence in their home countries.
 But in this case, the tourist would not even be aware of the points added to his name.
 The local driver who committed the traffic contravention would therefore be spared those points and hang onto their driving licence.
 Azzopardi has also alleged that Flores and Camilleri received payments in exchange of their work on this racket. Camilleri, he has claimed, also received gifts.
 Car rental companies are authorised to charge customers’ credit cards for any fines accrued during their vehicle rental period.
 Fines levied through this alleged racket often went uncontested as tourists could not be bothered to contest them from overseas.  Azzopardi alleged that the money ended up being allegedly pocketed by the car hire company rather than LESA. 
 He claims thousands of unsuspecting tourists were allegedly ripped off this way.
 His court application states that the allegations are based on the testimony of various people, including sources within LESA and the Labour Party, who approached him with information about the claims from October 2023 onwards.
 Sources from car hire firms are also willing to testify on oath, he has claimed.
 LESA’s Camilleri, Azzopardi claims, offered his services to people in Paola’s square, telling them he could have their fines and penalty points “forgiven” [ħalli naħfirhomlhom]. 
 Only a magisterial inquiry could delve into this racket, ordering investigations into LESA servers, argued Azzopardi.
 He wants Flores and Camilleri to face charges of criminal conspiracy, trading in influence, document fraud, making gains through fraudulent means, computer misuse, money laundering, bribery of public officials and embezzlement.
 Azzopardi claims that Prime Minister Robert Abela and Home Affairs Minister Byron Camilleri are both aware of the racket but have done nothing to stop it.
 He furthermore alleges that Camilleri’s niece was engaged as a summer worker at LESA but instead spent the summer at her uncle’s ministry in Valletta, with Flores’ approval.
 Two other full-time LESA officials have not clocked in for months, sources told Azzopardi.
 They only turned up once a month with their timesheets to claim wages, with inside sources wondering why they were getting paid at all.
 Flores, LESA's CEO, said both he and the agency he leads ""categorically deny"" the allegations.  
 He said penalty points were issued following ""various checks"" and that the agency requested police reports when faced with any documents it suspects are tampered. 
 Flores said the agency had taken legal action against various companies and entities that failed to pay fines on time.  
 ""LESA is willing to fully collaborate with any investigation,"" Flores added. 
 Robert Abela and Byron Camilleri also denied Azzopardi's claims, with both politicians issuing separate statements to distance themselves from them. 
 Abela accused Azzopardi of abusing of the legal system as a way of making false allegations ""in the hope of some mud sticking"". 
 Camilleri, whose ministry is politically responsible for LESA, said he welcomed an investigation into Azzopardi’s claims, which he said were ""baseless"". 
 “This coordinated and desperate attack against me continued today with totally baseless and unfounded allegations,” he said in a terse Facebook post. 
 “These are aimed at tarnishing my reputation and attacking my integrity. Those who know me know how I've always acted and so I look forward to these allegations being investigated.”
  On Friday afternoon, the Malta Vehicle Rental and Lease Association deplored the alleged practices which it said shed a bad light on those who have always operated in the industry professionally.
 ""The MVRLA has always encouraged best practices with its members and has pursued various reforms to instil improved operating standards under the Operators License.
 ""One of these reforms related specifically to how traffic contraventions and points are processed, as it is currently a very cumbersome process which holds the individual - under whose name the vehicle is registered - accountable and at times criminally responsible"", it said in a statement.
 The association added it held various discussions with LESA, TM and the Transport Ministry pushing for the implementation of reforms that would ensure service providers operate within a regulated market in line with an agreed legal framework.

Construction worker acquitted in Valletta tool theft case,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/130614/construction_worker_acquitted_in_valletta_tool_theft_case,06-08-2024,003623.png,"A construction worker from Qawra has been acquitted of theft charges related to the disappearance of expensive tools from a construction site in Valletta, after the court ruled that the evidence presented was insufficient to support a conviction.
 Patrick Cassar, 44, stood accused of aggravated theft following the disappearance of two jiggers, valued at over €2,800, from a construction site on St Paul Street, Valletta, in October 2020. The case hinged on CCTV footage and the testimony of a police constable who claimed to have recognized Cassar as the suspect seen in the footage.
  But Cassar walked out of court a free man, after defence lawyers Mario Mifsud and Nicholas Mifsud, successfully argued that the evidence presented did not substantiate the charges against their client.
 The prosecution's case was built on a series of events that began when the construction tools went missing. CCTV footage from the site showed a man entering a room where the tools were stored and leaving shortly thereafter carrying what appeared to be two bags. Further footage from other security cameras along St Paul Street captured the same individual walking down the street, holding suitcase-like objects.
 Investigators identified the suspect as Cassar, who should have been at home during the time of the alleged theft, due to an 8pm curfew that had been imposed on him as part of bail conditions in separate proceedings. Cassar's home was subsequently searched, but the missing items were not recovered, and neither did the officers find any clothing matching those worn by the man in the footage.
 Cassar was subsequently charged with multiple offences, including aggravated theft, breaching bail conditions, committing the alleged crime while under probation, breaching the terms of a conditional discharge, and recidivism. He denied all charges.
 The key issue in the case was the identification of the suspect seen in the CCTV footage. The prosecution relied heavily on the testimony of a police constable assigned to extra-duty watch at the construction site, who claimed to recognize Cassar as the man in the footage. The constable told the court that he had identified the man as Cassar from his gait and tattoos, stating that he was familiar with Cassar as one of the workers at the site.
 However, Magistrate Elaine Rizzo, who presided over the case, scrutinised the reliability of this identification. The court noted that for such identification to be valid, it must be corroborated by other evidence, particularly forensic evidence, and must be based on clear and distinctive characteristics. The magistrate questioned whether the police constable had adequately compared the suspect to other workers or identified him independently of his association with the construction site.
 The court further analysed the CCTV footage and still images from Valletta's Controlled Vehicular Access (CVA) system, which recorded the entry and exit of vehicles from the city. While the footage showed a man with a similar stature and gait to Cassar, the court noted that key identifying features, such as tattoos and facial details, were not visible in the footage. This lack of clarity cast doubt on the reliability of the identification.  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police
Joseph Muscat to appear in criminal court on May 28,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/joseph-muscat-appear-criminal-court-may-28.1092275,05-10-2024,003633.png,"Updated 3.45pm
 Joseph Muscat will appear in court to answer criminal charges on May 28,  Times of Malta can confirm.
 Magistrate Rachel Montebello has set a Tuesday, May 28 court date for Muscat and others charged with crimes in connection with the hospitals privatisation deal to appear in court.
 Muscat, his former lieutenants Konrad Mizzi and Keith Schembri, and several others stand accused of bribery, trading in influence, money laundering and various other crimes.
 Only Muscat – who has said that the charges are a “hatchet job” – and another of those charged alongside him,  auditor Chris Spiteri, have spoken out about the prosecutions.
 A second tier of defendants facing charges includes Chris Fearne, who resigned as minister on Friday, and Central Bank Governor Edward Scicluna. 
 The case against those defendants will be heard by Magistrate Leonard Caruana, who must now set a date for their arraignment. 
 Magistrate Montebello was initially due to hear the case against Fearne, Scicluna and others too, but abstained from the case on Friday.  
 Prosecutors filed charges against all those they allege played a part in the criminal conspiracy earlier this week.
 Muscat and his co-defendants have been charged under court summons, rather than arrest. That means they will walk into court and be allowed to return home after entering a [presumably not guilty] plea.
 The criminal charges stem from a magisterial inquiry into the now-annulled  30-year, €4 billion deal that Muscat's government signed to privatise three state hospitals. 
 That inquiry report - which Prime Minister Robert Abela has decried as biased despite saying he has not read it - is being held at the Attorney General's office and has not been made public. 
 However, on Thursday a civil court ordered that Muscat be given access to all documents in the inquiry report that refer or relate to him. Muscat is seeking to convince the court that the magistrate who led the probe was prejudiced against him. 
 Civil society group Repubblika, which triggered the probe back in 2019, said on Friday that Attorney General Victoria Buttigieg is ""sabotaging"" the case against Muscat.
 Buttigieg, Repubblika alleged, has ordered the State Advocate to not file an objection to the decision to grant Muscat access to parts of the inquiry.

Police found cannabis ‘everywhere’ when raiding apartment of alleged trafficker,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/131059/police_found_cannabis_everywhere_when_raiding_apartment_of_alleged_trafficker_,06-09-2024,003642.png,"A man from Mellieha was remanded in custody on Friday, accused of drug trafficking and money laundering, with his lawyer calling for a specialised facility for the detention and treatment of substance abusers.
 21-year-old Jordan Gafá from Mellieha was arraigned under arrest before magistrate Marseanne Farrugia on Friday morning, accused of possession of cannabis grass and resin, as well as ecstasy pills, in circumstances which indicated they were not only for his personal consumption.
  Gafá was also accused of laundering the proceeds of criminal activity.
 Inspector Mercieca told the court that the defendant’s car had been stopped by RIU and Drugs Squad officers in Mellieha, on suspicion that he had weapons inside.
 No weapons were found in the vehicle, but the police discovered around 100 grams of cannabis. In a search that was carried out at his residence after his arrest, police found another 200 grams of cannabis as well as digital weighing scales, which the defendant claimed were for his personal use.
 Inspector Mercieca explained that several addresses were linked to Gafá’s name. The suspect was escorted to another apartment in Mellieha, where after the police broke down the door Gafá asked the officers not to taze the two American Bully dogs inside, which the suspect said were his.
 The police found some three kilograms of drugs Inside the apartment, said the inspector.
 “There was cannabis everywhere you look. Bags on the counter… next to the TV… on the kitchen table.” A number of ecstasy pills that did not appear to be for Gafá’s personal use were found in the fridge, he said. Digital weighing scales and a cardboard box of resealable bags containing a green substance were also found on the premises, as well as around €50,000 in cash.
 Gafá, who told the court that he was unemployed, pleaded not guilty and requested bail.
 Inspector Merceica objected to the request, telling the court that the man had an “acute drug problem” that could draw him to further trouble. The inspector also pointed out that despite the defendant’s relatively young age, he had managed to be involved in a crime of this magnitude.
 The circumstances which resulted in Gafá’s arrest were “slightly unusual,” added the inspector. “The suspect was observed being followed around in his car by another person who is also well known to the police,” he said, adding that investigators were still currently trying to establish what had been happening and that the person following the suspect is yet to be questioned by the police.
 Another obstacle to bail was the fact that Gafá’s place of residence is currently a crime scene, the inspector pointed out.
 In brief submissions on bail, lawyer Franco Debono, assisting Gafá together with lawyer Adreana Zammit, pointed out that the man had no previous convictions.
 Were he to be granted bail, he would reside at another address in Mellieha with his mother. Inspector Mercieca confirmed that the mother lived there, but added that her address had also come up in the investigation and that cannabis had also been found there.
 Debono highlighted Malta’s need for a “halfway house” for the treatment of drug addiction.
 “Unfortunately, in this country there is no place that is not a prison, in which a person can be treated for drug addiction and not allowed to leave voluntarily.”
 In a similar case a few months ago, magistrate Elaine Rizzo had also called for this type of specialised institution to be set up, added the lawyer.
 “At 21 years old, it would be better to help straighten this man’s path than allow it to twist further,” Debono said.
 The court denied bail due to the risk of jeopardising the ongoing investigation.
 Magistrate Farrugia noted that the mother’s residence had been given as a potential address for bail but the mother herself was not present in court to declare her acceptance.
 Besides this, the court said, the defendant’s acute drug problem risked leading him to commit another offence on bail.
 The prosecution’s request for a freezing order over all of Gafá’s assets was also upheld.
 Police Inspectors Mark Merceica and Warren Galea prosecuted. Lawyers Franco Debono and Adreana Zammit assisted the defendant.  ",Karl Azzopardi ,court_and_police
WW2 'bomb' retrieved by AFM divers turns out to be pottery,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/ww2-bomb-retrieved-afm-divers-turns-pottery.1097300,28-08-2024,"003653.png,003654.png","Excitement over a newly-discovered bomb shell quickly died down this week, after the bomb experts who retrieved it determined that it was a piece of pottery rather than a wartime relic. 
 Veċċja Point in St Paul's Bay was a bustle of activity on Monday evening when swimmers spotted what they believed could be an unexploded bomb sitting on the bottom of the seafloor. 
 They quickly reported the find to the authorities, and members of the police and specialised AFM divers were quickly diverted to the area to investigate. 
 Witnesses told Times of Malta that members of the AFM carried out a dive to retrieve the suspected bomb. 
 A police spokesperson later confirmed with Times of Malta that on Monday evening, around 7.30 pm, the Armed Forces of Malta Explosive Ordnance Disposal team was dispatched to Xemxija. 
  The object retrieved, a long, cylindrical and hollow thing, was initially suspected to be a bomb, possibly a shell dating back to World War 2, given that it appeared to be hollow. 
 However, after members of the EOD had time to examine the find, it transpired that it had not been a bomb at all. 
 ""Upon investigation, it was determined that the object was made of pottery and did not contain any explosive material,"" an AFM spokesperson told Times of Malta in reply to questions. 
 It is not the first time that explosive devices have been discovered around Malta's waters. 
 In 2021 a beach in Marsaxlokk had to be evacuated after what turned out to be an unexploded war bomb washed up on the sand. 
 Just a year prior, a 15-year-old boy caused panic in Birkirkara after he found two small World War 2 bombs and took them home.

Police deny interference from Prime Minister in hospitals inquiry,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/police-deny-interference-prime-minister-hospitals-inquiry.1097245,26-08-2024,003679.png,"The police have “categorically denied” the allegation that Prime Minister Robert Abela ordered senior police officers not to interrogate some of those named in the magisterial inquiry into the Vitals and Steward hospitals deal.
 In a statement on Monday, the police said it “assisted the Attorney General's office in the prosecution"" according to legal procedures based on the conclusions of the inquiry.
 ""The Police Force categorically denies any allegation of interference”, it said.
 The statement came in response to a MaltaToday story on Sunday, which reported claims by unnamed Labour insiders, including senior cabinet ministers, that Abela had ordered senior police figures not to interrogate some of those named in the inquiry.
 Shortly after the article’s publication, rule-of-law NGO Republikka called on Abela to the accusations in the MaltaToday article or resign by the end of the day.
 Responding on Sunday evening, the Prime Minister’s office (OPM) said in a statement that Abela “categorically"" denied the allegations.
 It said he “denies categorically and in the most absolute way that he has ever given any direction similar to what has been maliciously reported.”
 OPM said the fact that the claims had been published ""without verifying with the Office of the Prime Minister before publishing the report, which shows how much the intention was not to report factually and truthfully.”
 MaltaToday reported claims by insiders that the alleged order not to interrogate those named in the inquiry into the hospitals deal was aimed at “cushioning the impact of the conclusions on Joseph Muscat” - an alleged decision one insider called a “big and serious mistake.”
 The claims appeared alongside assertions that the Prime Minister’s leadership was angering those within the government and the party.
 In a dramatic judgement delivered in February last year, a court annulled a “fraudulent” privatisation deal for the running of three state hospitals signed during under the Labour administration led by Joseph Muscat.
 The deal saw Vitals Global Healthcare and later Steward Health Care take over the running of Gozo General, St Luke's and Karin Grech hospitals – institutions the court ordered should be returned to the government within three months.
 An appeal against the decision lodged by Steward Health Care was thrown out later that year, with the court of appeal saying it also believed there was ""collusion between Steward and senior government officials or its agencies"".

 At approximately 10pm last night, police were alerted to an altercation between several individuals on Triq il-Kavallieri ta’ Malta, Marsascala.
 Upon arrival, officers discovered traces of blood at the scene, though the involved parties had already fled. Further investigation revealed that four individuals had driven themselves to the hospital following a dispute with others at a residence on the same street.
 It was determined that sharp, pointed weapons were allegedly used during the confrontation.
 Among the injured was a 47-year-old Syrian man from Mosta, who was certified to have sustained serious injuries. The other three men, aged 19, 20, and 21, also from Mosta, were treated for minor injuries.

 Dylan Magro, 27, is accused of a violent outburst that took place at his partner's Marsascala home, where a ""trivial argument"" escalated into physical violence.
  Magro allegedly struck his eight-week-pregnant partner on the head with her mobile phone, damaging the device, before dragging her by the hair, beating her, and taking her car keys.
 The woman, despite her injuries, managed to walk to the police station to file a report. Meanwhile, Magro fled the scene. Investigations revealed that the address listed on Magro's ID card was for an abandoned house, and police searches of a close relative’s home were also fruitless.
 Magro was subsequently placed on the police wanted list, with authorities publishing his photo and requesting the public’s assistance in locating him. Following the notice, Magro’s social media profile was taken offline, further complicating efforts to track him down.
 Several months later, police received information suggesting that Magro had returned to his partner’s home. Officers from the domestic violence unit visited the residence, where they found the wanted man.
 Initially, Magro attempted to prevent the officers from entering by claiming he had dogs inside, but police pressed ahead with their warrant. Magro fled the scene, escaping through a construction site after jumping over a wall.
 On Tuesday, Magro finally turned himself in at the police depot. He was arraigned in court the following day, facing a series of charges including causing slight injuries to both his partner and two police officers, as well as violently resisting arrest.
 Magro pleaded not guilty to the charges. His legal aid lawyer, Brandon Kirk Muscat, attempted to raise an insanity plea, requesting the appointment of three psychiatrists to assess his mental state at the time of the alleged offences and determine his fitness to stand trial. Muscat explained that Magro had been diagnosed with “certain conditions” and warned that his condition could deteriorate.
 However, prosecuting inspector Audrey Micallef objected, stating that Magro “knew very well what he was doing” during the incidents. Micallef also pointed out that during interrogation, Magro apologised to the officer involved in the attempted arrest, saying, “sorry for the trouble and hassle I caused”.
 Moreover, no mention of any condition was made when Magro was taken to the Floriana health centre following his arrest.
 Magistrate Nadia Helena Vella denied the request for a psychiatric evaluation, citing a lack of evidence at this stage of proceedings. The court also denied Magro’s request for bail, highlighting the serious nature of the charges, his lack of a fixed address, and concerns over his trustworthiness.
 The court imposed a ban on the publication of the victims' names. Inspector Audrey Micallef led the prosecution, while Brandon Kirk Muscat acted as legal aid counsel.

Airport shoplifters plead guilty to stealing €535 worth of duty-free goods,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/129593/airport_shoplifters_plead_guilty_to_stealing_535_worth_of_dutyfree_goods,06-06-2024,003719.png,"Two Liverpudlian youths received suspended sentences after they admitted to stealing perfumes, cigarettes and rolling tobacco from a duty-free shop at the airport.
 James Mahon, 19, a gas and electrical worker and bricklayer James Rooney, 22, both from Liverpool in the UK, appeared in the dock before magistrate Giannella Camilleri Busuttil on Thursday on charges of aggravated theft.
  Police Inspector Roxanne Tabone explained what had led to the arrests, telling the court that yesterday, the Malta International Airport police station was informed by the Duty-Free manager that two individuals had shoplifted items from a shop at the departure lounge.
 The two defendants were identified and were subsequently found to be in possession of the stolen items. They were then arrested.
 The charges were aggravated by number of items stolen, Punishment Maximum of three years imprisonment
 Rooney and Mahon both admitted the charges and apologised in court. “I’m guilty. I take responsibility for my actions and apologise for taking everyone’s time,” Rooney told the court.
 The prosecution exhibited the stolen objects in court, explaining that they would not be presented in court but would be returned to the victim, against a receipt. The total value of the stolen objects was €535, the court was told.
 Making submissions on punishment, prosecutor Brendan Hewer said that due to early guilty plea, the defendants’ full cooperation and their contrition, the prosecution was not insisting on an effective prison term. Defence counsel Maria Karlsson fully concurred with the prosecution’s submissions, telling the magistrate that it “was a mischievous childhood error on their part.”
 While waiting for the sentence to be compiled, Rooney earned himself a rebuke for yawning loudly in the courtroom. The magistrate reminded the defendant that the charges against him were “no joke”.
 After reviewing the relevant sections of the law, a few minutes later, the court condemned both defendants to imprisonment for six months, which were suspended for two years.

FSWS sounds alarm about court backlog of domestic violence cases,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/all-magistrates-needed-handle-domestic-violence-case.1101531,25-11-2024,"003726.png,003727.png","All magistrates should be trained to deal with domestic violence cases and assigned to preside over them at least once a week to address the current backlog, the head of the Foundation for Social Welfare Service has warned.
 Last year a second magistrate, Abigail Critien, was tasked with helping Magistrate Lara Lanfranco with the work in a move the justice ministry said would help end the backlog. 
 But Alfred Grixti said that in reality, there was ""one and a half magistrates"" - since one of the magistrates divided her time between handling domestic violence, as well as juvenile and child protection cases. 
 “Child protection deserves a magistrate on its own. Sharing a magistrate between child protection and domestic violence is neither fair to child victims, nor to domestic violence victims.
 “Why is it only just two magistrates? There are about 1,500 active [domestic violence] cases and 30 magistrates – perhaps they should be given more training and tasked to do domestic violence cases once a week. We cannot just blame the government when other institutions should be doing their bit.”
 He was speaking during a conference held to mark 30 years since the setting up of the domestic violence services within the foundation. 
 Grixti said the demand for the services kept increasing.
 Domestic violence knows no boundaries and was even impacting people over the age of 60 in their homes, he said.
 In 2012 the total spend of the foundation on domestic violence was just under €500,000 and this year spending shot up to over €3.2 million. There were 22 people working in domestic violence in 2012, that increased to 66 today.
 As he thanked all staff for their dedication, he called on defence lawyers not to use tactics that involved knocking down the credibility of professionals or risk assessment tools. He also called for the depoliticizing of the subject. 
 Graziella Castillo, director at Appogg, said that 30 years ago society turned a blind eye to victims and silence was the norm. When the domestic violence services were set up they were not simply about offering shelter and assistance, but about changing the hearts and minds of people to build a culture of respect and create a society where violence in any form is never tolerated.
 Ruth Sciberras, who runs the Multi-Agency Risk Assessment Meeting (MARAM), which was established in June last year following the femicide of Bernice Cassar, said ther have been 836 cases since them.
 MARAM is a specialised team dedicated to evaluating high-risk domestic violence cases.
  Yvonne Mallia, director of Fondazzjoni Sebh that runs a shelter, said people still questioned why victims stayed and what they did to deserve being abused. 
 Sylvana Gafa, who heads the victim support services within the police force, said that one of the main challenges was that most victims chose not to testify once the case went to court. This led to an acquittal and also gave the perpetrator more power - as he labelled the victim as a liar. 
 Domestic Violence Commissioner Samantha Pace Gasan also spoke about the need for more resources. People who worked in the system were burnt out, she said. She spoke about the need to shift focus more on perpetrators – to send out a clear messagethat violence was unacceptable and they will not get away with abuse. 
 Elaine Compagno, from the Women for Women Foundation, said that people had to understand the reality that women in abusive relationships faced – situations where any decision-making power was taken away from them.
 The survivor of domestic violence spoke about the need to involve victims along the way adding that many did not testify against their abuses out of fear: the courts did not always make use of video conference facilities. 
 Opposition spokesman for family affairs Albert Buttigieg spoke about the need for better enforcement and a change in the current practice whereby the victims left the matrimonial home, while the perpetrator stayed home. 
 Anne Marie Grech, the wife of Opposition leader Bernard Grech, called for a national campaign to address misconceptions and taboos. She said there was the need to address barriers, such as financial dependence - that kept victims trapped. 
 Lydia Abela, wife of the prime minister, said there was a need to intensify efforts with perpetrators to stop their abuse once and for all. She too spoke about the importance of education that included teaching children about the values of love and respect. 
 Parliamentary Secretary for Equality Rebecca Buttigieg and Social Policy Minister Michael Falzon spoke about the government's commitment to address domestic violence.
 President Myriam Spiteri Debono, who concluded the conference, said that despite the advancements in the sector, the domestic violence cases in Malta were on the increase with over 2,000 filed last year. 
 She urged all women facing domestic violence to make use of the services as they provided a path to healing and independence. ""Reaching out can be the first step towards safety and a life free from abuse,"" she said.

 The woman was summoned as a prosecution witness in the case against Mohamed Ali Ahmed Elmushraty who is pleading not guilty to reckless driving, driving without a licence and insurance cover as well as breaching several sets of bail conditions. 
 The alleged victim was also expected to testify but did not do so. 
 Elmushraty was arraigned under arrest on August 10, two days after what at first appeared to be a traffic accident turned out to have allegedly been a deliberate crash by the driver of the black Mercedes Benz. 
 His arrest was declared invalid because the duty magistrate had not been informed of the arrest.
 The investigating officer relied on a provision of law which was successfully challenged by the defence. 
 
 Elmushraty walked out of court after the arraignment but meanwhile the criminal action against him continued. 
 The court heard how police were first alerted to a car blocking the road opposite Bay Street in Paceville and an injured man lying on the ground. 
 Word got round that “il-Lilu” was somehow involved. 
 Knowing that Elmushraty was under various bail conditions, the inspector covering the St Julian’s and Sliema districts that night, kickstarted investigations. 
 Footage from the scene after the crash appeared to indicate that it had been deliberate. 
 Elmushraty was seen stepping out of the Mercedes and speaking to the buggy vehicle driver and a woman, later identified as Elmushraty’s ex-girlfriend. 
 A verbal exchange followed but as the voices grew louder, the altercation continued off camera. 
 The woman later told police she “saw no one”.
 The injured driver was taken to hospital for treatment but “chose to leave” the moment he got to the Mater Dei Hospital foyer. 
 When the case continued on Wednesday, a doctor at a private hospital who issued a medical certificate for the purpose of filing a police report, testified that the patient had facial bruising and swelling. 
 He also suffered nasal fractures and was advised to see an ENT specialist. 
 Asked whether he had explained the cause of his injuries, the doctor said that the patient “did not wish to speak about what had happened”.
 On Wednesday, the alleged victim was expected to testify but did not do so.  The court issued a ban on publication of the victim’s name as well as the reasons given by the prosecution for his absence. 
 The woman, who was allegedly present at the time of the incident, was also summoned to testify. 
 Prosecuting Inspector Eman Hayman informed the court that since then, the woman was also being investigated by the police. 
 In light of that information, presiding Magistrate Ann Marie Thake cautioned the witness about her right not to testify so as to avoid self-incrimination. 
 The woman said that she would opt not to testify. 
 
 She stepped off the witness stand and walked out of the courtroom, right past the accused, not making any eye contact with the man seated in the dock. 
 As the sitting drew to an end, the court decreed that there was sufficient prima facie evidence for the accused to stand trial on indictment. 
 Inspector Eman Hayman is prosecuting. Lawyers Franco Debono, Adreana Zammit and Martina Herrera are defence counsel.

More details about Drugs Squad's successful 1kg heroin bust emerge in court,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/130727/more_details_about_drugs_squads_successful_1kg_heroin_bust_emerge_in_court,13-08-2024,003758.png,"An inspector from the police’s Drugs Squad has outlined in court how one of the men arraigned last week over the discovery of a kilogram of heroin in a Kirkop apartment had provided crucial assistance to their investigation.
 42-year-old Christian Grech from Birgu is pleading not guilty to charges of conspiracy to traffic heroin, supplying the drug and being in possession of it in circumstances denoting that it was not intended for his personal consumption. Grech is also accused of being a recidivist. 
 Police inspector Jonathan Cassar from the Drugs Squad took the witness stand to give his account of the investigation that led to the man’s arrest.
 The police had been carrying out surveillance on Ferdinand Onovo, a Nigerian national who is also currently in preventive custody in connection with the drug bust, he said.
 Onovo, who had already been sentenced to imprisonment for 10 years for cocaine trafficking in 2017, was observed going in and out of an apartment block. The police decided to stop him in his vehicle once he left.
 Onovo and another person were in the car, said the inspector. Although no drugs were found in the vehicle, the police officers’ suspicions were raised by the man’s demeanour. Police inspector Mark Mercieca informed the duty magistrate and a search warrant was issued for the apartment in question. 
 After breaking down the door to the apartment, the police found Grech inside. He told the police that he knew why they were there, assuming full ownership and responsibility for the kilogram of heroin and telling officers that his girlfriend had not been aware of its presence.
 Grech, who was questioned first, told his police interrogators that he was prepared to collaborate with them. He issued a statement confirming that the heroin belonged to him, explaining that he had met Onovo in prison and that the man had pestered him into helping him move the heroin.
 Despite not liking the sample given to him, Grech had agreed to meet Onovo, said the inspector. When the two met, the drugs had not been in Onovo’s backpack. Instead, after he phoned someone up, a car arrived with the drugs under the seat.
 While Onovo was warning Grech not to try and trick him, the police had moved in and arrested the men, the court was told today.
 Grech had confirmed his statement both on video as well as on oath before duty magistrate.
 Grech’s girlfriend had told the police that she had seen Onovo at the apartment, but did not know why he had been there.
 The police had also questioned the driver of the car which had arrived carrying the drugs, and established that he was a taxi driver. He told the police that Onovo had asked him for a ride to the airport and that on the way, he had asked him to stop at the flat to pick something up. A short while after he had done that, he had received a call from Onovo, asking to be picked up again because he had forgotten something. This time, Onovo was carrying an orange rucksack, the driver had told the police.
 Onovo had also been interrogated, being assisted by lawyer Charles Mercieca, said the inspector. The Nigerian had exercised his right to silence and limited himself to telling the police that Grech was lying. 
 Inspector Cassar added that Grech’s DNA had been found on the rucksack, but not on the inner bag where the drugs were found. Onovo’s DNA was found on the inner bag, he said. 
 As part of the investigation, the police had also seized mobile phones from both Grech and Onovo, neither of which were locked. On the devices, the police found correspondence between the men. 
 Cross-examined by lawyer Franco Debono, the inspector confirmed that Grech’s assistance to the police’s investigation into Onovo had proven to be very helpful.
 In view of this, the court was asked to apply the maximum diminution of punishment contemplated in the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, should it find Grech guilty.

 Moses Efraim Gudmundsson, 31, and Ronja Marie Ekenryd, 33, both Swedes who have no fixed address - apparently residing in a tent pitched at Riviera Bay, were charged in separate arraignments before Magistrate Donatella Frendo Dimech.
  Both defendants were charged with grievously injuring each other and breaching a suspended sentence. Ekenryd alone was further charged with carrying a knife in public without a permit and using it to wound the other defendant.
 Inspector Christian Cauchi, prosecuting together with lawyer Etienne Savona from the Office of the Attorney General, explained that in a recent district sitting the pair had been handed three-month prison sentences suspended for 1 year, ordered to pay €500 in damages and as well as being fined €800 each.
 This after they were found guilty of insulting police officers and disobeying their legitimate orders.
 The court was told that an argument had erupted after Gudmundsson told his girlfriend to pay his fine, together with hers.
 The man had suffered a broken nose and a cut on his hand, allegedly inflicted with a Swiss army knife wielded by his girlfriend, explained the inspector.
 But Ekenryd had evidently not emerged unscathed from the altercation, either, and appeared in court with her face evidently bruised, cradling her right shoulder.
 Both defendants pleaded not guilty to the charges but did not request bail as they were unable to provide a fixed address to the court.

"Jury convicts man of attempted murder, sentencing on Thursday",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/jury-convicts-man-attempted-murder-judgement-thursday.1102230,12-10-2024,003769.png,"A jury late on Monday convicted a man of attempted murder after he threw brick tiles at a neighbour's father as he stood on a ladder.
 Paul Borg, 68 of Żebbuġ, was found guilty of trying to kill Mario Grech in 2020 and of causing him grievous bodily harm in a separate incident a year earlier. 
 The jury returned a guilty verdict on all charges except causing wilful damage to third-party property. The jurors voted 8-1 on the attempted murder charge.
 Sentencing will take place on Thursday after lawyers' submissions on punishment.
 The trial started last week.
 The court heard how in September four years ago the accused flung two brick tiles at Grech after spotting him working on a neighbouring property belonging to Grech’s son.
 A technical expert and a medico-legal expert appointed by the court subsequently reported that had Grech not reacted swiftly, shifting position and steering clear of the bricks, the force of the impact would doubtlessly have killed him. 
 Those bricks were followed by two jerry cans of burnt oil which Borg flung down from the rooftop, the liquid content of the containers splashing over the paving and staining a pool area.
 Trouble had apparently brewed between the parties during works carried out at the property which allegedly resulted in damage to tiling at Borg’s residence.
 Those events followed a violent incident involving Borg and Grech a year earlier.
 The first incident in 2019 saw Borg allegedly force his way inside the property on Triq Frans Sammut and, using a broken broom, assault Grech who was scraping a wall at the time.
 Borg was soon joined by his wife and son, leaving Grech with facial scars and bruising.
 The trial is presided by Madam Justice Consuelo Scerri Herrera.

 The incident took place on July 30 at 3am on J Quintinus Street in St Paul's Bay.
 Police tracked down Hasam Samuel Ezzeldin - a 24-year-old Maltese National from St Paul’s Bay  - who was currently out on bail, as the suspect. 
 He later admitted to breaking a friend's windscreen of a BMW vehicle and stealing a tablet and a perfume worth €150 out of “revenge”. 
 He was charged with wilful damage to third-party property and aggravated theft as well as breaching bail conditions and committing the alleged offences while under a three-year probation order. 
 The accused pleaded guilty upon arraignment, confirming his admission after the court granted him time to reconsider.
 He was remanded in custody pending judgment. 
 When meting out punishment the court, presided over by magistrate Caroline Farrugia Frendo, took note of that “clear and unequivocal admission” by the accused at a very early stage of the proceedings. 
 The court declared Ezzeldin guilty and condemned him to an 18-month effective term of imprisonment.
 Since the accused admitted to breaching previous bail conditions, the court also ordered partial confiscation of his bail deposit (€500).

 A 43-year-old Colombian man was arrested in Msida in connection with the murder of a man who was found in a suitcase off The Strand, the police have said.

 Another suspect, a 39-year-old man from Portugal, who was residing at the Msida property where the Colombian was apprehended by the police, was also arrested.

                     The police confirmed reports that around 100 capsules with a substance suspected of being cocaine was found in the victim’s stomach. The victim’s identity is yet to be established, the police said.

 Sources close to the investigation told MaltaToday the autopsy revealed that the victim died of asphyxiation. Further tests are being conducted to determine more details about the death.  

                         Investigators believe the victim was a drug mule who had come to Malta from elsewhere. 

 Sources refuted claims the victim died because drugs found inside the cadaver had burst and leaked into his system.

 They also said the man, believed to be a foreigner, died less than 12 hours before the suitcase was found. He is also believed to have tattoos.

 The suit case was found floating off the Gzira promenade on Monday afternoon at around 1:30pm.

 When the suitcase was recovered, the police were met by a macabre scene. Inside, was the dead body of an unidentified person. The suitcase and body were wrapped in plastic by the police's Forensic Unit and taken away for further examination.

"State Advocate has a duty to sue for return of hospital funds, PN says in appeal",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/state-advocate-duty-sue-return-hospital-funds-pn-says-appeal.1096504,08-08-2024,003799.png,"The Nationalist Party has appealed a court decision that had dismissed its call for the State Advocate to sue for the recovery of funds handed to Vitals and Steward Global Healthcare as part of the state hospitals concession.
 It insisted on Thursday that the State Advocate was bound in terms of his constitutional office to safeguard the public interest, and all that was needed was 'courage'.
 Mr Justice Toni Abela, presiding the First Hall, Civil Court last month ruled that democracy would be undermined if the State Advocate acted independently to recoup the €400 million handed to Vitals/Steward Healthcare. 
 The appeal was filed by PN and Opposition leader Bernard Grech and Adrian Delia, shadow minister for health.  
 They also appealed two previous decisions whereby Mr Justice Abela rejected their request for the Vitals magisterial inquiry report by Magistrate Gabriella Vella to be produced as evidence in these civil proceedings, and their request to produce in evidence the records of the compilation proceedings against former prime minister Joseph Muscat, his chief of staff Keith Schembri, former minister Konrad Mizzi and a number of other top public officials. 
 Grech and Delia pleaded in their appeal that although the government had filed a claim for the funds as part of international arbitration proceedings against Steward, that was not enough to safeguard public interests.
 The evidence that was now emerging in the criminal proceedings against former top public figures placed a greater burden on the State Advocate whilst making the Opposition’s claims more enforceable and true. 
 The State Advocate had no excuse not to take action to safeguard the state. He could not argue that those involved in the collusion in defrauding the state could not be identified. 
 “All that is needed is courage to institute civil action” Grech and Delia said. 
 Referring to decisions taken by the first court dismissing their request for certain evidence, the appellants argued that “it is as though no one, not even the court, felt the need and wielded authority to protect the state.” 
 Although facts about the deal emerge “by the hour,” the first court did not want to know about such information, and that went against the interests of justice.""
 When handing down judgment, the first court lacked information showing why the State Advocate was compelled to take action.
 And that was even more so when Cabinet and government evidently did not want to act against the topmost public officials, both past and present, who colluded with Vitals/Steward to the detriment of the State. 
 Lawyers Edward DeBono and Nicholas DeBono signed the appeal application. 
 PL: PN is trying to intimidate the government
 In a reaction to the appeal, the Labour Party in a statement said the PN was persisting with a 'vindictive' court case.
 It said that the PN was seeking to hold public sector officials personally responsible for €400 million allegedly handed to Vitals/Steward.
 It said the PN was trying to hinder and intimidate the government and seeking to change the role of the State Advocate.  
 The PL said the government was rightly suing Steward and defending the public interest in international arbitration, assisted by the state advocate himself as well as international law firms.

Pembroke labour deputy mayor charged with threatening mother in drug-fuelled rage,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/128836/labour_deputy_major_charged_with_threatening_mother_in_drugfuelled_rage_,25-04-2024,003832.png,"Pembroke’s deputy mayor was remanded in custody on Thursday, accused of threatening and intimidating his mother in what the court was told was a drug-fuelled rage.
 Omar Elaref Arab, 32, from Pembroke, pleaded not guilty to charges in connection with an incident at the victim’s home in Pembroke, where the defendant also resided.
 Police Inspector Omar Zammit told magistrate Claire Stafrace Zammit that on April 24 at about 6.30pm, the defendant’s mother had called the police about her son, who she said, had a drug problem. “She was terrified of him,” said the inspector. Although residing with his mother, Arab was found by the police at his girlfriend’s house in Valletta.
 He told the court that he worked as a “business consultant” but was currently out of work.
  Defence lawyer Etienne Calleja did not contest the validity of the arrest but questioned the manner in which the arrest was carried out. Calleja said police had “made a show” of the arrest, sending 20 police officers to Arab’s girlfriend’s house “to arrest a man in his pyjamas watching a movie.”
 Calleja requested a ban on publication of his client’s name, arguing that he was a public figure and a political candidate, and that the charges dealt with a personal matter which could cause prejudice to his campaign. Arab is the deputy mayor of Pembroke, elected on a Labour Party ticket.
 The inspector replied that being a public figure was not a legally valid reason to impose a ban on publication.
 The magistrate agreed with the inspector, and added that as a public person, he was subject to a higher level of scrutiny.
 The defence requested bail, which Inspector Zammit objected to, arguing that the defendant lived with the alleged victim, who is yet to testify. “His drug dependency renders him more likely to end up in further trouble with the law,” said the police inspector.
 Lawyer Etienne Calleja told the court that his girlfriend was present in the courtroom and had no objection to having him live with her. “It is true that he has a substance abuse problem, which led him to react in the way he reacted in these circumstances.”
 The court denied bail, ruling that it was “far too premature a stage” to grant him bail. A protection order was issued for the man’s mother, prohibiting him from contacting her, following her around or going to her home, place of work or places she normally frequented.
 Arab was remanded in custody, with the court recommending that the prison authorities provide him with assistance to address his drug addiction while he was being held in preventive custody.
 Pembroke mayor reaction 
 Contacted by MaltaToday, Pembroke mayor Dean Hili said he and the council had not been aware of Arab’s drug use and had not received any official information in this regard, but added that Arab had not attended council meetings for several months and that it was clear that something was wrong.
 “On our part, as per procedure, if you miss a certain number of meetings the council must take a decision on whether your absence is justified or not. Month on month we weren’t receiving explanations and the council had made a recommendation to the Department of Local Government that his post be declared vacant.” Asked whether this decision had been taken, Hili said it didn’t appear to have been as it had also been raised at the last meeting.
 Running on a Labour ticket, Arab had been elected to the council on his first attempt in 2019. 
 When Arab had been approved as a candidate for the last local council elections, there weren’t any indications at the time that he had a drug problem, Hili said.  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police
Friend of Paceville beach stabbing victim feared she would die in his arms,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/friend-paceville-beach-stabbing-victim-feared-die-arms.1098506,24-09-2024,003864.png,"The friend of a woman who was stabbed on a Paceville beach screamed for help and feared she would die in his arms, he testified on Tuesday. 
 The witness, who was previously mentioned by the alleged victim as her friend “Ernesto,” testified in a sitting that was marked by constant interruptions by the accused, Fabian Medina Paira, who loudly complained “no one is helping me.” 
 The 21-year-old Colombian national is currently facing prosecution for attempted murder and grievous bodily harm over the violent incident that occurred early morning on August 7 on a St Julian’s beach. 
 While his lawyer cross-examined the prosecution’s witnesses, the accused repeatedly jumped up, interrupting the proceedings, rambling on about how he felt that everybody was attacking him and no one was defending him.
 
 Speaking through his interpreter, the youth first signalled his wish to address the court. 
 Presiding magistrate Donatella Frendo Dimech calmly heard him out as he tried to explain that on the day of the incident, he was “at home or at work”.
 Then as he protested how he felt that he was not being adequately defended, the magistrate explained that the proceedings were still at a stage when the prosecution was presenting its evidence. 
 His lawyer was doing a sterling job, said the court, explaining that the accused’s chance to testify would come at a later stage. 
 But the youth would not relent, not even when he was ordered twice over to sit down and follow in silence. 
 Prosecuting inspector Shaun Pawney said the defendant appeared to be behaving this way to deliberately interrupt the hearing. 
 “I’m feeling in danger in jail. They locked me up with criminals,” piped in the defendant again, causing the umpteenth interruption in a police officer’s testimony. 
 The court ordered him to sit down and be quiet. 
 But no sooner had the defence lawyer resumed his cross-examination than the defendant stood up and took a step towards the lawyers’ bench as his CCF escort reached out to stop him. 
 “I’m not going to entertain more outbursts from you,” snapped the magistrate, ordering the defendant to be escorted down to the lockup while the hearing continued in his absence. 
 The court relented as the defendant promised not to “talk again” but his promise was short-lived. 
 After further outbursts in Spanish, translated by the court interpreter, the court finally ordered him out of the room. 
 He clung to the swinging doors, loudly protesting, until he was forcibly led away. 
 He was escorted back later when the victim’s friend was about to testify. 
 “Ernesto” recalled how he and the victim had been at the beach with another couple in the early hours of the day. 
 They had long noticed the stranger who seemed to behave “in a manner that was not normal.” 
 But he sat at a safe distance away, appearing to watch the sunrise. 
 When the other couple left at 8am, Ernesto and the victim went for a swim, chatting in the water for an hour or so. 
 Then they suddenly saw the stranger approach the spot where his friend had left her bag. 
 The man then smashed a glass bottle on the rocks. He bent down, seeming about to snatch the bag
 “It was strange. It didn’t make sense,” thought the witness.
 His friend scrambled out of the water and he tried to follow.
 Then he suddenly saw the stranger push his friend and “jump on her.” 
 The witness chased after the aggressor who quickened his pace. Then turning round, he saw the blood-covered victim and went to her side. 
 He tried to help her into a seated position, pressing his finger on the cut on her chest. 
 “Her face changed colour. I feared she was dying. I pressed on the wound with one hand, slapping her face with the other to keep her awake.” 
 The victim seemed to start breathing again. 
 “Help me, please! Call an ambulance,” he cried to a female passerby. 
 “I hope she doesn’t die in my arms,” he thought. 
 Soon an ambulance arrived and the victim was rushed to hospital for emergency surgery. 
 A doctor who also testified said the patient had a one-centimetre deep laceration on her chest and another smaller more superficial wound. 
 There was blood in her lungs and she was in danger of dying, said the emergency doctor. 
 A police sergeant testified that when a search party spotted the suspect in Pembroke and approached, he appeared agitated from the start. 
 He resisted arrest and ended up in a tussle on the ground with the arresting officer. He suffered slight injuries and was later treated a Floriana health centre.  
 The case continues.

 The decision was handed down on Wednesday, one day after the blogger and activist made the request through an application to the Criminal Court. 
 Delia had asked the court to treat the case with urgency as the annual anniversary of Caruana Galizia’s October 16, 2017 murder is just weeks ago. 
 Delia said that he wanted to make sure that the civil society protests could go ahead as usual in a few weeks’ time. 
 The applicant said that he had full respect for the court’s work and never meant to breach any court orders. But the recent ban was “too wide and not necessary in a democracy,” he argued. 
 That ban was handed down by Madam Justice Edwina Grima following Delia's video blog, which was reproduced on Newz.mt's Facebook page. It was aired on the same day that the judge had banned similar comments by Caruana Galizia’s lawyer, Jason Azzopardi. 
 Azzopardi was ordered to remove those comments from his Facebook profile, while Lovin Malta was ordered to retract part of an interview with Azzopardi featuring the comments. 
 All comments and publications outside court hearings related to Yorgen Fenech’s murder case were prohibited, the judge said as she observed there are “people who feel they may breach court orders with impunity”. 
 On Wednesday, the judge decreed that Delia’s request to reconsider the ban was rejected.

 Muscat is accused of having acted in collusion and deceit with principals from the Vitals and Steward companies that ran a concession to operate three state hospitals, and is now charged with money laundering offences.
 Grech accused AG Victoria Grech of having passed on a copy of the inquiry report to Prime Minister Robert Abela, and protested the ‘imbalance’ in being “deprived of the necessary tools to perform his constitutional role of overseeing the executive, creating a serious political imbalance in favour of the government and the Labour Party to the detriment of the Opposition and the Nationalist Party, and the right of the citizens to know how and what led the highest officials in the Maltese government to defraud them and misappropriate their property to the extent that they are also accused of money laundering.”
 On 6 May, Grech requested a copy of the inquiry in its entirety, claiming the Attorney General had already passed on a copy of the inquiry report to the Prime Minister and the Members of the Cabinet of Ministers.
 “You have yet to respond to the request of the Leader of the Opposition and much less provide a copy of the inquiry report to the Leader of the Opposition despite the importance and gravity of this inquiry,” Grech’s lawyer, Edward Debono, said.
 “Since this magisterial inquiry raises issues of public interest, to the detriment of the State, you are being urged to pass a copy of the report of the inquiry to the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Nationalist Party while you, at your discretion, can publish it through the Department of Information as you have done on other occasions.”  ",Matthew Vella ,court_and_police

 The warning was issued by means of a judicial protest filed by XNT Limited which earlier this week was the subject of a landmark ruling by Malta’s top court.
 The Constitutional Court declared that although the FIAU was not an independent and impartial court or tribunal, the administrative fines it issued did not breach the right to a fair hearing provided that those fined had “access to full review” before a court of law. 
 That decision overturned a previous ruling whereby the first court had upheld XNT’s claims that the  €244,679 administrative fine imposed by the FIAU against the firm breached its fundamental right to a fair hearing. 
 That court had revoked the fine and ordered that the case against XNT was to continue only after the State enacted legislation to set up an autonomous and independent entity to hear and decide the matter with all the safeguards to a fair hearing. 
 But all that was overturned by the Constitutional Court upon appeals by the FIAU and the State Advocate as respondents in the suit. 
 Following that final ruling, lawyers representing the firm told Times of Malta they intended to contest the “retrograde” decision at the European Court of Human Rights. 
 In the latest twist to the legal dispute, XNT Limited has taken the FIAU to task over its immediate response to the judgment, namely that of putting back in the public domain information that was causing “irremediable prejudice” to the firm. 
 The issue concerned certain information featuring the name of the firm, the date when it was slapped with the fine as well as the relative articles of law and regulations breached by the firm. 
 That same information had been published in 2022, a day before XNT Limited filed proceedings before the constitutional courts to contest that legislative framework permitting the FIAU to issue such administrative fines which the firm claimed ran counter to its fundamental rights. 
 Other firms also filed similar cases in court. 
 While proceedings were pending before the First Hall, Civil Court in its constitutional jurisdiction, XNT Ltd requested an interim measure, requesting that the information published by the FIAU be pulled down pending the final outcome. 
 Following the top court’s decision, the FIAU “rather surprisingly” immediately published once again the information related to it, argued XNT, accusing the unit of throwing “caution and sensitivity” to the wind.
 The firm is protesting that such behaviour was causing it “great damage” possibly running into millions of euros and placed its commercial operations at risk. 
 XNT Limited is now calling on the FIAU to withdraw the published material with immediate effect, warning that it would be held responsible for damages and reserving any action to that effect should its claims be upheld by the ECHR.
 Lawyers Jose’ Herrera, David Camilleri and Martina Herrera signed the judicial protest.

"Brazilian women brought to Malta as maids ended up in prostitution, court told",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/brazilian-women-brought-malta-maids-ended-prostitution-court-told.1092842,22-05-2024,003911.png,"Two Brazilian women and an Italian man were arraigned on Wednesday and accused of involvement in human trafficking which saw women brought to Malta to work as cleaners, only to end up in prostitution.
 Inspector John Spiteri said that investigations by the Vice Squad were triggered by a report about the suspected rape of two persons. When speaking to the police, the alleged victims hinted that this might be a case of human trafficking. 
 Police surveillance and further information gathered from third parties led to the arrest of the two women, who are sisters, and the husband of the younger sibling. They are Luca Tavolaro, 50, his wife Jarleide Silva de Lima, 38, and Michely Silva de Lima, 39, all residents of St Paul's Bay. 
 The married sister, appeared to be the spokesperson in bringing Brazilian nationals to Malta to work as cleaners. 
 But when they arrived in Malta, they were exploited and ended up working as prostitutes. 
 Further investigations showed that funds obtained through the illegitimate activity were laundered.
 All three, who were also accused of living off the earnings of prostitution. pleaded not guilty. 
 A Brazilian woman who was called to testify on Wednesday before being expelled from Malta as an irregular migrant, said that she travelled to Malta from Belgium four months ago on a tourist visa and worked here as an escort.
 She said that she found this job on her own steam, on the Internet.
 “I sell sex. I offer my services,” she explained through an interpreter. 
 She said she had lived with one of the accused sisters and was put in touch with the other for money transactions. 
 One of the sisters used to change euro currency to Brazilian currency to facilitate payments to the witness’s account.
 The witness did not recall the exact amounts but said that sometimes she gave her some €1000 and got the equivalent in Brazilian currency. The transactions took place throughout April. There were two or three transactions. Some €1000 to €1500 in all. The witness then transferred the funds to her account in Brazil.
 The accused knew that all the money that was channelled to Brazil came from her work as escort.
 The witness said that she was now returning to Brazil.
 Magistrate Elaine Rizzo ordered her to supply her number, email address and home address to the prosecution before leaving. 
 During considerations of bail for the accused,  Inspector Spiteri said Jarleide was found guilty of similar crimes in Italy and that was why she came to Malta to continue what she was doing here. The fear of absconding, the fact that the case is still at an early stage and vulnerable victims still had to testify were all reasons for bail not to be granted. 
 Defence lawyer Lennox Vella countered that the accused live in Malta and have children who are currently being cared for by the state while the parents are under arrest. 
 Michely, he said, has a four-month old child. Jarleide and her husband have a child with special needs.
 “This is unjust,” defence lawyer Ilona Schembri argued. 
 And they were still presumed innocent, argued the lawyer. 
 But the inspector said that one of the alleged victims had a severely disabled child and the money she earned through prostitution which was meant to be sent to her child, were kept by the accused. 
 The court turned down the request for bail in light of the fear of tampering with evidence. The prosecution was urged to produce witnesses at the earliest opportunity.

Man jailed for 18 months after near-fatal assault on friend who spotted him on Grindr,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/130516/man_jailed_for_18_months_after_nearfatal_assault_on_friend_who_spotted_him_on_grindr,31-07-2024,003914.png,"A 27-year-old man from San Ġwann has been jailed for 18 months for committing a vicious assault that left a young man, whom he had encountered on a popular gay dating platform, in danger of dying. 
 Kurt Amato had been charged with causing the victim to suffer grievous bodily harm as well as with committing a hate crime motivated by the victim's sexual orientation.
  The case was brought to the attention of the police on 11 January 2022 by doctors at Mater Dei Hospital, who reported that a patient had been admitted the night before, in a critical condition and was in danger of dying.
 Initially, the victim had told officers that he had tripped over a dog’s leash while walking along Triq Ġorġ Borġ Olivier in Sliema that evening, but later confessed to having made up that story out of fear of telling his mother about his sexual orientation.
 “The real version [is that] I was walking home from having a coffee with my friend. I walked down Triq Oliver Borg Street, opposite the hospital. I heard my name get called, I turned around and it was Kurt, he ran towards me and he started kicking and pushing me towards the floor.”
 “After someone stopped the attack, I managed to walk myself home, I was thinking it was my arthritis pain, then I could hear like tripping inside, so I phoned my mama, asked her to take me to the hospital. When I got to the hospital they rushed me into surgery. I woke up in the surgery, [told] that I had minutes to live…I told the police that I tripped over my dog at the beginning because I was scared of what happened.” 
 In his testimony, the victim said that he had knew Amato “through a colleague of a friend of a friend” and that he had been assaulted by him before while giving Amato a lift, but had not reported it. 
 The man recalled that he had encountered Amato on Grindr, a dating app for the LGBTIQ+ community, and had asked him about his presence on the platform, as he had been under the impression that Amato was not gay. 
 “I asked him why he was on the application because [he was] straight. And he told me he was curious … then after about five minutes he blocked me, first he told me not to tell anyone about it, then he blocked me and then about two hours later he came on to Facebook saying, ""Do you want to meet and everything?"" and I said no.”
 Amato had assaulted the victim in Sliema while the latter had been walking home after visiting a coffee shop with a friend. The court was told that the defendant had run up to him, then kicked him repeatedly, before pushing the man to the ground and continuing to kick him until a passerby intervened and stopped him.
 A doctor who had treated the victim in hospital told the court that the injuries, which included a serious laceration to his liver, were life-threatening and had to be operated on immediately.
 One of the defence witnesses was a gay friend and former housemate of Amato’s, who insisted that the defendant was not homophobic.
 After evaluating the evidence, Magistrate Victor Axiak found Amato guilty of grievous bodily harm, but did not convict him of committing a hate crime, due to a lack of evidence. The magistrate observed that the apparent motive behind the assault was Amato’s fear of public embarrassment were the victim to disclose Amato’s presence on Grindr, rather than any particular hostility towards the victim’s sexual orientation.
 Amato was sentenced to imprisonment for 18 months, with the court taking into account the fact that Amato already had previous convictions for violent theft and violation of probation orders. A three-year restraining order was also issued to protect the victim after Amato’s release from prison.
 Inspector Colin Sheldon led the prosecution, with lawyer Alfred Abela was defence counsel. Lawyer Wilfred Buttigieg assisted the victim as parte civile.  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police
Serial fraudster behind bars after raft of new charges on property rentals,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/serial-fraudster-back-behind-bars-raft-new-charges.1094401,24-06-2024,003937.png,"A convicted fraudster is back behind bars after facing fresh charges of swindling a string of unsuspecting victims in property rentals that never materialised.
 Alexia Cross Micallef, 45, who claimed to be homeless and unemployed, pleaded not guilty to a raft of charges linking her to some 25 police reports lodged against her between March and this month.
 All alleged victims reported that the woman offered them property for rent but once she had taken the deposit on the lease, she disappeared.
 
 They found out too late that the property did not belong to the ‘landlady,’ but was inhabited by third parties and was not for rent.
 Those reports triggered criminal investigations and an arrest warrant against the suspect who, however, was not found at her registered address.
 Her name was put on the wanted list.
 Then on Sunday, a woman turned up at the Rabat police station to enquire about a report that someone had filed against her. A check on the police system soon rang the alarm bell and the suspected fraudster was arrested on the spot.
 She was escorted to court, facing multiple charges of fraud as well as misuse of electronic communications equipment.
 She pleaded not guilty.
 The prosecution explained that the total sum allegedly defrauded was €24,000 but some €6000 had been reimbursed by the accused, who would return deposits whenever she got to know that her alleged victim had gone to the police.
 Her lawyer did not request bail at arraignment stage, but requested a ban on the woman’s name so as to safeguard her daughter.
 Magistrate Jean Paul Grech turned down that request as legally unfounded and remanded the accused in custody.
 Inspectors Clayton Camilleri and Joseph Mallia prosecuted.

 Viktor Markovic, a 41-year old Serbian who described himself as a “professional security officer,” was arrested on Tuesday after the police tracked the movements of his car.   
 Police Inspector Lydon Zammit said the police were alerted to the robbery at around 6am on October 6. The robber entered the bar on St Rita Street through a service door and came face to face with a cleaner who was alone at the time. He demanded cash but the cleaner did not know anything about the money kept at the establishment and could offer no cooperation.
 The thief then entered an office and helped himself to cash he found in a cupboard, making off with some €6,500.
 Investigations showed that the suspect had arrived at the crime scene in a Honda Fit which was parked a short distance away.
 Police traced the vehicle’s route from and back to a Bahar ic-Cagħaq residence where two other persons were arrested.
 Further investigation pointed to Markovic’s involvement in the crime. He was arrested on Tuesday in Gozo.
 On Thursday he pleaded not guilty to aggravated theft, slightly injuring the cleaner, causing him fear of violence and holding him unlawfully against his will.
 He also denied carrying a weapon and wearing a mask during the alleged crime, as well as breaching four different sets of bail conditions, the latest one issued in May.
 His lawyers did not request bail at the arraignment stage.
 Magistrate Victor George Axiak, upheld the prosecution’s request for a protection order in favour of the cleaner and the bar owner, warning the defendant of the legal consequences if he were to violate that order.

 Zven Azzopardi, the 21-year-old driver from Cospicua and his girlfriend, Shaznay Cassar, 25 from Birkirkara, landed in hot water over the incident which took place on Monday afternoon at around 5pm.
 Gozo police received a call from the Xewkija service station about a young couple who had tendered fake currency when topping up their Corvette.
 Police officers rushed to the site.
 The red Corvette was still parked some way off down the road from the service station.
 A woman was heading towards the station, a €50 banknote in hand. She was apparently going to pay for the fuel previously paid for with the counterfeit currency.
 Police searched the Corvette. Other fake banknotes were found.
 The couple were arrested and charged before the Gozo courts on Tuesday evening.
 They were jointly charged with fraudulently possessing and putting into circulation false currency.
 Azzopardi was separately charged with breaching bail as well as driving the Corvette without a licence and insurance cover.
 Both registered an admission which they confirmed after being given time to reconsider.
 When making submissions on punishment, defence lawyers Franco Debono and Marion Camilleri highlighted the accused’s early guilty plea and their full cooperation with investigators.
 Moreover, the woman had an untainted criminal record.
 The court, presided over by magistrate Simone Grech, condemned Azzopardi to a two-year jail term suspended for four years and a 12-month driving ban.
 The court also ordered forfeiture of €3,000 out of Azzopardi’s bail money but not his personal freedom.
 As for Cassar, the court handed down a 15-month jail term suspended for three years.

Man charged with stealing scooter remanded in custody,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/132734/man_charged_with_stealing_scooter_remanded_in_custody_,11-12-2024,003957.png,"A man accused of stealing a scooter has been remanded in custody after changing his plea to guilty, then expressing confusion about his decision.

 The man, Christian Faranda Gnao, 34, was charged with stealing a scooter from an apartment block in St. Julian's is remanded in custody after initial denials, a guilty plea, and subsequent uncertainty over his plea.

                     On 28 October 2024, the St Julian’s Police Station received a report that the accused had stolen another man’s scooter from his apartment block. The police viewed CCTV footage and revealed that the man had put the scooter on his shoulders and left with it. The police had searched for the man but had failed to locate him. 

 On 6 December 2024 information was received of the man’s whereabouts, and on 9 December 2024 the inspector issued an arrest warrant to which the man was arrested at his residence in St Paul’s Bay. Subsequently, the inspector recalled in Court, the police searched Gnao’s residence and the very clothes that he wore whilst stealing the scooter were found in his residence.

 Further to his arrest, during a subsequent interrogation, the inspector told the Court that the man admitted to police questioning about the acts that he had committed.

 In Court, the man pleaded not guilty. 

 However, shortly after, Gnao changed his plea to a guilty one. Upon the Magistrate telling the man of the possible consequences of his guilty plea, namely the maximum prison sentence, and the fines that he is facing the man was shocked, visibly gasping in disbelief.

 The man said: “I’m confused, I don’t know”.

 The Court noted what the man responded, that the man looks emotional, and that the man does not know how to plea. 

 The Court, presided by Magistrate Elaine Rizzo, was of the opinion that, in light of the man’s change in plea, the accused is pleading not guilty, and the defence did not request the release of his arrest. The man was thus remanded in custody.

 This is an ongoing case.

 The police officer revealed that the man had committed a previous offence, to which he was currently serving a suspended sentence.

 Police confirmed that the incident occurred at around 11pm in the area of Triq tat-Tabija in Rabat when the driver lost control of the motorcycle they were both on and crashed into an electricity pole. 
 The two women involved in the collision are Colombian nationals. The deceased was a 33-year-old woman who lived in Mtarfa and was a pillion passenger while the driver is a 31-year-old woman residing in Marsascala. 
 When police arrived on the scene they found a Honda motorcycle lying on its side and the two women strewn across the street looking visibly injured. 
 The 33-year-old was pronounced dead on the scene, but the driver was rushed to Mater Dei Hospital where she was found to be suffering from serious injuries.

Spike in harassment reports following Ghirxi’s murder,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/spike-harassment-reports-following-ghirxi-murder.1096852,17-08-2024,"003966.png,003967.png,003968.png","The police have experienced a spike in harassment reports days after Nicolette Ghirxi was stabbed to death by her ex-partner, Police Commissioner Angelo Gafà said.
 Ghirxi was murdered by Edward Johnston on Sunday night. Hours later, Johnston was shot dead by police officers in St Julian’s after he brandished a weapon which turned out to be a replica gun.
 “The two days following this murder, the reports exploded again. We expected it. As this is what happens, such cases motivate people to act.”
 Gafà was speaking to Times of Malta during an interview held at the Domestic Violence Hub in Santa Luċija on Friday. Superintendent Johann Joseph Fenech from the Domestic Violence Unit and Rachel Farrugia, a risk assessor with  Aġenzija Appoġġ, were present during the interview.
  At the time of the interview, the official statistics of how many harassment reports were filed this week were unavailable.
 “No one takes pleasure in such cases (murder of Nicolette) and unfortunately to bring the number to zero would be  utopian. I know no country that has done so, but  we doing everything possible to prevent other similar cases,” Gafà said.
 “I believe that over the years, we have prevented other cases, and it is difficult to provide numbers, as it is hard to quantify preventions.”
 Ghirxi had filed harassment reports – in April and May – but turned down the offer to undergo a risk assessment as she did not feel her life was at risk at that moment in time. On Thursday of last week, four days before her murder, she informed the police that Johnston was in Malta.
 Women’s rights experts have said Ghirxi’s femicide is a “wake-up call” about underestimating the risks and dangers victims face. They called for improved risk assessment training and for the reporting system to be more sensitive to the realities of women who feel harassed or threatened.
 While Gafà said the police are always open to recommendations, he said the fact the number of domestic violence reports continue to increase is a sign there is more awareness in society.
  According to police figures, in the first seven months of the year, the Domestic Violence Unit received 1,264 reports. The unit received 1,979 reports in 2023 and 1,753 reports in 2022.
 Gafà praised the increase, attributing it to a shift in the way society discusses the sensitive topic and also reflects an improvement in police services.
 “Before, there was an attitude where people did not bother to file a police report if they were facing domestic violence,” he said.
 “Now, we are more sensitive towards it, and it is one of our main priorities.”
 He said training on how to interact with victims is not only provided to members of the Gender-Based and Domestic Violence Unit but all members of the police force.
 “It is easy to point the finger at the police, but does anyone ask how many lives we save?” Gafà asked.
 “Imagine we did not experience this increase in reports. Unfortunately, there is a 99 per cent chance that Ghirxi would not have filed a police report if there was not this shift in the services we provide and no rise in awareness.”
 When a victim wants to file a domestic violence report at the hub, they are offered a risk assessment, carried out by professionals from Aġenzija Appoġġ. 
 The risk assessment determines the level of risk – low, medium or high.
  Fenech explained that while offering a risk assessment is mandatory, the victim has the right to refuse to undergo a risk assessment.
 He explained if a victim goes to file a report and finds several other individuals waiting, a preliminary risk assessment is carried out by a police officer to assess the severity of each case and to prioritise accordingly.
 The questions include whether the victim was physically assaulted, if the alleged aggressor is under the influence of alcohol or substances, or has a registered gun. If the victim scores as high risk, the victim ‘skips the queue’ and is seen immediately. Yet, the preliminary risk assessment is only carried out in this scenario.
  When asked if filing a risk assessment should become obligatory, the suggestion was shot down. Farrugia said all victims are offered a risk assessment, and if they refuse, risk assessors continue to encourage victims to carry out the risk assessment.
 “We cannot force a person to file one, the decision is always in the hands of the individual,” she said.
  Farrugia said it is “very rare” that a risk assessment is not carried out. While providing no figures, she said that from her own experience, a majority of victims sit down with a risk assessor to establish the level of associated risk they are in.
 
 Her comments echo a statement made by the Foundation for Social Welfare Service earlier this week, which said the number of risk assessments carried out on victims who filed domestic violence reports has increased.
 Fenech confirmed the refusal of a victim to have the risk assessment is “mimimun”.
 Farrugia said sometimes victims do not file a risk assessment because it would be their first time, or they wish to file a police report as a “warning”.
 Gafà said whether a risk assessment is carried out or not, once a police report is filed, the police are bound by law to investigate, and possibly charge the alleged perpetrator in court.
 “It is important to emphasise that even if there is no formal risk assessment, it does not mean that by default the case is seen as ‘low risk’,” he said.
 “The score informs our officers what risk the victim is at, but we also carry out our investigations to understand the threat the victims face.”
 “If they do not want to do it (risk assessment), what do we do then?” Gafà asked.
 He said the service has improved over the years, as previously risk assessors were on call, while now they form part of the team found at the Domestic Violence Hub in Santa Luċija.

‘I’m not used to being arrested’: Prince Paul-Philippe al Romaniei,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/i-m-used-arrested-prince-paulphilippe-al-romaniei.1096895,19-08-2024,003970.png,"A Romanian prince who was recently released from custody after being detained in Malta on the strength of a European Arrest Warrant (EAW) has spoken out about his arrest and time behind bars.
 Prince Paul-Philippe al Romaniei, 75, said he travelled to the country in April for an event organised by the Knights of Malta, when he was approached by police at the Westin Dragonara hotel in St Julian’s and taken into custody.
 “I’m not used to being arrested, so when you come to Malta for an important event where you’re becoming a grand master and the guest of honour, and you’re accosted by four people saying you’re under arrest, it’s not very pleasant,” he said.
 In April, the Sovereign Military Order of Malta – which claims continuity with the original Knights Hospitaller – told  Times of Malta the prince was not a member of the organisation, nor had he been invited to any of its events.
  The prince was arrested as he returned to the hotel after a day out with his wife Lia Georgia Triff, who described the arrest as “professional” but “suspect” because it took place on a Sunday – speculating that “few lawyers” would have picked up the phone that day.
 “They didn’t manhandle my husband. It was startling because it was plainclothed police and in an unmarked car, so we were not sure what was going on... luckily, it wasn’t in front of the dignitaries that flew in; it would have been a circus at that point,” she said.
 The prince was denied bail due to the seriousness of the corruption charges levelled against him in his homeland, and spent more than two months in prison while battling an extradition order.
 Describing the conditions, he said he was kept with seven others in “quite a large room” with a courtyard for exercise.
 “It wasn’t too bad. The people were decent, quite correct with me... but it’s very unnerving coming to a beautiful place like Malta and finding yourself enclosed in a prison,” he said, adding that having to give his name in the morning and evening felt “like military service”.
 Details of his case “had come out on television, so everyone seemed to know who I was... [but] it didn’t go against me, that was the lucky thing. I suppose I made the best out of something very unpleasant,” he said.
 The prince was speaking to Times of Malta by video call from Paris, where he returned to shortly after winning his fight against the extradition request in Malta.
 He was less gregarious of the arrest warrant that landed him in jail, however, describing it as having been “used politically” by some politicians and “security people... relics of the time of Ceaușescu”.
 Nicolae Ceaușescu was a totalitarian communist leader who ruled Romania with an iron fist for almost 25 years before being overthrown and executed during a revolution in 1989.
 “They [those behind the warrant] are not understanding what it is to be part of the European Union... They’ve arrested people for political reasons, and they try to influence foreign governments,” said the prince.
 “They thought maybe they could manage with Malta, because Malta had problems, corruptions... They put Malta in an awkward situation, and I’m very ashamed of what Romania did. I think it’s pretty disgusting, actually.”
 Prince Paul was sentenced to three years and four months in prison by a Romanian court in December 2020 after being found guilty of corruption charges related to real estate that authorities said he falsely claimed ownership of near the capital Bucharest.
 Asked about the charges, Prince Paul-Philippe denied them, accusing the authorities of “sabotaging” his legitimate claims to properties that had once belonged to his family.
 Although the law in Romania, like other former communist states, allows persons to reclaim land confiscated by the communists, when the prince and his father attempted to reclaim family property, they were refused and told it had been seized by the Nazis instead.
 “Basically, it’s a question of greed. Many politicians wanted these properties, and they were not happy that we wanted to claim them back, even though we had all the rights as any Romanian citizen,” he said.
 The prince maintains that when he returned to the country in 1990, it was not to reclaim properties but “because I wanted to see if we could help the orphans”, pointing to the “terrible situation” in the country’s orphanages and schools.
 “Nobody got properties for the first 17 years until Romania got into the European Union. So, that was not my reason, but I inherited a piece of land which is Băneasa Royal Farm, which is worth between €150 and €200 million.”
 And he denies trading in influence, claiming he steered clear of being involved in reclaiming properties, instead leaving the job to a lawyer he said was cleared of the same charges.
 “If you have a top lawyer negotiating the return of properties and you’re not involved in that, how can you be accused of traffic of interest?”
 Responding to claims he is not the legitimate heir to King Carol II, who ruled Romania from 1930 to 1940, Prince Paul-Philippe called the idea “ridiculous”, stressing his claim had been recognised by the country’s Supreme Court in 2012.
 “They recognised it themselves, and it was recognised in five countries in Europe in the 1950s and 60s. So, it’s clear that there was political involvement in that decision [to reject the claim],” he said.
 Asked if he was scared to face prison time in Romania – in jails described as “harsh and overcrowded” by the US embassy in the country earlier this year – the prince said, “anybody would be scared of [such] conditions”.
 Explaining that he had visited Romanian prisons with his wife as sponsors of the gendarmes [military police], he said they had been “shocked” by what they saw.
 “Knowing that, of course I was rather worried about being put there, but I was more worried about being put there when I’m innocent.”
 Asked if he was concerned he could be targeted by political opponents while in prison, the prince admitted he was, pointing to what he claims appeared to be an assassination attempt in 2000 when he said a car drove into his, attempting to push him off a cliff.
 Considering his recent experiences, would the prince return to Malta in the future?
 “I will return. I need to digest what has happened, but I don’t blame totally Malta; I blame the Romanians trying to corrupt Malta,” he said.
 Describing the recent arrest as having put a strain on his family, he said they were recovering but still wanted to return to their homeland eventually: “It’s our home.”
 Accusing bad actors in the Romanian government of having tried to “take advantage” of Malta, the prince said he was “grateful the Maltese got it together”.

Angelo Gafà: This is why police never investigated the Vitals deal,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/angelo-gafa-police-investigate-vitals-deal-no-access.1094434,25-06-2024,"003974.png,003975.png","Police could not investigate the Vitals deal because they had no access to financial documents seized as part of a magisterial inquiry into that concession, Angelo Gafà testified on Tuesday.
 The police commissioner said that whenever his officers asked the magistrate for access to those documents, they were told by the inquiring magistrate that she still did not have them. 
 “Without the expert analysis and reports, the police could do nothing,” Gafà said. “There were financial and cyber experts who pieced the whole picture together, but we never had visibility [of the documents] until we got the proces verbal,” the commissioner testified.
 He emphasised that the magistrate told police to ""follow her directions"". 
 Dozens of individuals and companies stand accused of fraud, money laundering and other crimes in connection with the 30-year deal the Joseph Muscat-led government signed with Vitals Global Healthcare to privatise three state hospitals.
 All defendants are pleading not guilty.  
 Police officers have testified in those criminal cases, saying that they had little to do with the Vitals inquiry and never investigated the deal themselves, prompting criticism of Gafà and his police leadership. 
 Testifying on Tuesday, Gafà noted that officers were extremely cautious to not interfere in the inquiry’s work and always sought warrants from the magistrate whenever documents needed to be seized.
 Officers had sought the magistrate’s direction when Times of Malta reported on  links between Joseph Muscat and Dragonara Casino boss Johann Schembri, the commissioner said, and again when reports concerning former  Foundation for Medical Services CEO Carmen Ciantar and former Health Minister Chris Fearne emerged.
 When the magistrate told the police that neither of those two issues concerned the inquiry’s subject matter, the police investigated and found no criminal wrongdoing, Gafà said.
 Gafà's testimony came as part of Muscat's constitutional case to have Magistrate Gabriella Vella removed from the magisterial inquiry. Muscat is claiming that his rights were breached by having the magistrate, who he claims is biased, at the helm. 
 Gafà also testified about leaks concerning the magisterial inquiry and confirmed that lawyer Jason Azzopardi knew ahead of time that Joseph Muscat’s home was to be searched.
 Azzopardi, a former PN MP who also represents NGO Repubblika, had contacted a court-appointed expert in the days ahead of the search, Gafà testified.
 That was confirmed under oath by Superintendent James Grech, who testified that court expert Keith Cutajar was “bombarded” by phone calls from Azzopardi one day before police planned to search Muscat’s house in January 2022.
 Cutajar was ""out on his motorbike"" when Azzopardi was trying to reach him and did not answer the calls, Grech testified.
  When he saw the calls, Cutajar texted the lawyer to tell him “speak directly to the magistrate”.
 He then informed the inquiring magistrate about Azzopardi’s calls himself, Grech said. That triggered a meeting that same day involving Magistrate Gabriella Vella, police commissioner Angelo Gafà, inspector Anthony Scerri, Cutajar and himself, Grech recalled.  
 The magistrate was “very angry” that information about the planned search had been leaked, the superintendent testified.
 Despite that, the police did not carry out any investigation into the leak, Grech said.
 Testifying, police commissioner Gafà recalled that he was first alerted about the suspected leak by then-assistant commissioner Alexandra Mamo, who sent him a cryptic Facebook post that Azzopardi had published. Then they had met with the magistrate, he said. 
 It was the only leak from the inquiry he knew of, the commissioner testified.
 After the magistrate learnt that the plans had leaked, the search of Muscat’s home in Burmarrad was shifted to Wednesday rather than Monday as originally planned.
 It began at 7am and foreign court-appointed experts were present, accompanied by the police, superintendent Grech recalled.
 Third parties [a Times of Malta journalist] showed up at 10am, Grech testified.
 A foreign expert told Muscat what they were looking for.
 The former prime minister then led them to a bedroom and pulled a document out of a chest of drawers. Grech then moved on to search Muscat's office in Sa Maison, while inspector Anthony Scerri remained in Burmarrad. 
 The case resumes on September 24, when Jason Azzopardi will testify. Lawyers Vincent Galea and Charlon Gouder assisted Muscat.

Charge sheet mishap leads to immediate release of man accused of people smuggling,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/129329/charge_sheet_mishap_leads_to_immediate_release_of_man_accused_of_people_smuggling,22-05-2024,003976.png,"A court has ordered the immediate release from arrest of a company director charged with migrant smuggling and computer misuse, after the prosecution added new charges by filing a fresh charge sheet, as opposed to amending the original one, thereby rendering the warrant, under which he was being held under arrest, invalid.
 Andrea D’Amato, 37, from Mosta, an ICT professional and company director pleaded not guilty to the additional charges of money laundering and making false declarations to a public authority when the case against him continued before Magistrate Donatella Frendo Dimech on Wednesday. 
 Lawyer Franco Debono, assisting D’Amato together with lawyer Alfred Abela, asked the prosecution to justify the man’s re-arrest, arguing that the new charge sheet stated that D’Amato was being arraigned today under arrest.
  “So these proceedings are starting again. He has been under arrest for a week and instead of adding new charges and arrainging him by summons, they opted to start all over again.”
 Debono asked whether the defendant had been questioned about the new charges and whether he had received disclosure of the relevant evidence, warning the court that the case was “treading on dangerous ground.”
 Inspector Karl Roberts explained that the defendant’s alleged money laundering had emerged when he had already been charged. “During his statement he mentioned trafficking of persons and forgery which are all proceeds of crime,” added the inspector, to which the court replied that receiving the proceeds of crime was not the same as money laundering.
 The issuing of new charges meant that the old charge sheet no longer applied, argued Abela.  Both sides engaged in heated argument about whether the charges were new. Bonett Sladden bristled when Debono accused him of misleading the court.
 The court, too, told the prosecution that it was “a legal obscenity” to charge people without disclosure of the evidence against them. 
 “There is a difference between simply adding charges and issuing new charges with today’s date, filed on today’s date. Therefore saying that they had added charges was misleading the court,” Debono insisted. “Once the old charges have been substituted, what is the defendant’s status vis-a-vis arrest in proceedings which are now extinct?” he asked.
 After retiring to chambers for over an hour, the magistrate resumed the sitting to hand down her decree about the validity of the arrest. There was no doubt that until the moment the new charges were presented today, the defendant’s arrest had been valid in terms of a warrant of arrest which had been issued on May 6.
 “Now the prosecution has opted to, instead of requesting an addition to the existing charges which would allow the arrest to continue, chosen to present a new case, as the wording of the charge sheet attests. 
 “This means that the defendant’s arrest is no longer sustained by the original arrest warrant, on the basis of which he was arraigned to face charges on May 14. In the light of this, the Court is ordering the defendant’s release.” The case against D’Amato will now be assigned to be heard like other cases where the defendants are charged by summons.

More than one in seven Maltese admit to streaming sports illegally,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/more-one-seven-maltese-stream-sports-illegally.1093891,13-06-2024,003979.png,"More than one in seven Maltese said they streamed sports matches illegally - just slightly more than the European average, according to a recent study by the EU intellectual property office.
 Last year, 13% of Maltese citizens said they had streamed sports content from illegal sources in the 12 months leading up to the IP [intellectual property] Perception Study 2023.
 This was one per cent above the EU average and put Malta in eleventh place out of the 27 countries from across the bloc. The biggest offenders were Bulgaria (21%), Greece (20%) and Spain (19%), with Hungary (6%) watching the least pirated sports content.
 The proportion of young Maltese streaming sports illegally was more than double the country average, with more than a quarter (28%) of those aged 15 to 24 admitting to the practice – a trend reflected across the bloc.
 But while more than one in seven Maltese seem happy to stream sports content illegally, far fewer are willing to purchase fake sports gear, the study found.
 Just 4% of Maltese said they had knowingly bought fake sports equipment in the previous year – the lowest across the bloc and less than half the EU average (10%) – while just 3% of Maltese said they had done so unwittingly.
 The European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) said around half a million euros were lost in Malta each year to counterfeit sports goods, representing just over 12% of all sales in the sector. On an EU level €851 million accounted for losses of 11% of the total.
 Calling the trend of illegal streaming “concerning”, the EUIPO said it was a “substantial threat to the financing of sports,” with revenues from broadcasts “critical” to supporting the sector.
 The release comes just days before the UEFA European Championship kicks off in Germany, which in its last outing in 2020 generated almost €1.9 billion, according to data from statistics website Statista.
 And while the recent EUIPO study focuses on sports streaming, a separate study from the same organisation in September found that overall digital piracy in the EU had increased by just over 3% in 2022, reversing a downward trend seen previously.
 The September report found that TV shows were the most heavily pirated content, accounting for nearly half of all piracy, while noting that illegal streaming of live sports events was also on the rise, having risen by almost a third between 2021 and 2022.
 Meanwhile, more than 1,800 pieces of fake luxury brand jewellery were seized at Maltese borders in 2022 as part of Europol’s 'Operation Fake Star’ targeting counterfeit goods.
 The operation has netted more than 500,000 fake footwear items, 1.1 million sportswear items and almost 5.5 million fake brand labels across the bloc, leading to the arrest of more than 250 people.
 The IP Perception Study 2023 surveyed almost 26,000 people in January and February last year, with just over 500 Maltese quizzed in the survey carried out online.

Mizzi and Schembri used Vitals link to set up secret Dubai companies,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/key-figure-vitals-deal-set-secret-dubai-companies-schembri-mizzi.1092679,20-05-2024,003980.png,"A key player in Vitals Global Healthcare set up secret companies in Dubai for Keith Schembri and Konrad Mizzi, investigations have found. 
 The existence of these companies has never been publicly exposed. 
 Shaukat Ali, who together with his family is suspected to have siphoned off over €10 million from Vitals, set up the secret companies for Schembri and Mizzi in 2015, while they were still in government. 
 Investigators have raised suspicions that some of the money allegedly siphoned off from Vitals and channelled to Dubai and other locations was intended for the former OPM chief of staff and health minister. 
 No proof was found, however, to back this assertion, as investigators were unable to establish the onward flow of the funds in Dubai, which is notorious for its financial secrecy.
 Ali was one of the Vitals shareholders who signed a secret memorandum with government, which acted as a precursor to the hospitals contract. 
 He started setting up the structures for Schembri and Mizzi in July 2015, just one month after the government officially signed off the running of the St Luke’s, Karin Grech and Gozo hospitals to Vitals.  Documents indicate Ali initially sought to help the government officials open bank accounts for their then-secret Panama companies. 
 Sources said Ali sent Schembri a list of requirements needed to set up a bank account for his Panama company. 
 At the time, Schembri’s ownership of the Panama company was not public knowledge, leading investigators to note how the government official apparently trusted Ali with “critical and private information,” which occurred at the time the hospitals contract was awarded. 
 Investigators said the deep trust that appeared to exist between Ali and Schembri was the nexus for the whole hospitals concession.
 In August 2015, Dubai companies by the names of Akash and Intercare were incorporated for the government officials, according to investigators. 
 
 Although Schembri’s and Mizzi’s ownership of the Panama companies was outed by journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia in February 2016, their link to companies in Dubai was never publicly declared. 
 The Dubai companies were dissolved in March 2016 upon the request of Shaukat Ali, investigators found out. 
 Along with former prime minister Joseph Muscat, Schembri and Mizzi are due to face charges relating to the hospital deal of money laundering, corruption, bribery and setting up a criminal association. 
 If found guilty, they could face up to 18 years in prison. 
 When contacted, Schembri, Mizzi and Ali all denied wrongdoing.

"Man wanted by FBI for selling malware 'appeared normal', prosecutors tell court",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/man-wanted-fbi-selling-malware-appeared-normal-prosecutors-tell-court.1091950,05-04-2024,003986.png,"A Maltese man who says he should not be extradited to the United States because he was in a mentally poor state when he was first charged appeared to behave “normally”, police prosecutors have testified. 
 Daniel Meli, 27, is wanted by the FBI for allegedly selling illegal malware on the dark web between December 2012 and June 2022. 
 He was arrested in February at his home and initially agreed to be extradited to the US to face criminal charges there. 
 But he subsequently appealed the decision, claiming that the court did not assure that he was in a sufficiently sound state of mind when expressing consent. 
 His lawyers are arguing before the First Hall, Civil Court in its constitutional jurisdiction that his right to a fair hearing was breached.
 A number of medical professionals were summoned to testify about his mental health issues throughout the years. 
 A documented history of mental health struggles emerged, with doctors describing Meli as a “very bright 26-year old” who had long suffered “great social anxiety.” He had a past history of drug abuse and more recently, had turned to abuse of prescription drugs. 
 When the case resumed this week, two police officers testified about Meli’s behaviour in the hours preceding his arraignment. 
 Superintendent and lawyer Mario Cuschieri from the police International Relations Unit first spoke to Meli on the day of his arraignment at around 11:15am. 
 His involvement was limited to executing the arrest warrant issued by a magistrate for extradition purposes. 
 “He appeared normal. Quiet. When asked several times if he understood, he said ‘yes’,” said Cuschieri, when asked to describe Meli’s behaviour. 
 When police explained to him the implications of the US international arrest warrant “ he never flagged any problem in understanding what we were saying.”
 He spoke to his lawyer before facing charges and upon arraignment, indicated more than once that he was consenting to the extradition. 
 “He [Meli] appeared to understand what was going on,” said Cuschieri. 
 Questioned by Meli’s new lawyer lawyers, Arthur Azzopardi and Franco Debono, Cuschieri clarified that he was not involved in tracking down and arresting the suspect. He had only executed the arrest warrant at police headquarters. 
 Meli was given his legal rights both verbally and in writing and was given documentation sent by the US competent authorities. 
 The wanted man was arrested on February 7, but Cuschieri spoke to him the following day. 
 “What did you do to make sure that he was not under shock and conscious?” asked Azzopardi. 
 “I didn’t interrogate Meli,” replied Cuschieri, pointing out that cybercrime officers had arrested and interrogated the suspect. 
 “At no point did he express doubt about not understanding. We spoke Maltese,” said Inspector Robinson Mifsud, Interpol liaising officer who also executed the international arrest warrant.
 “We assured that he understood why he was wanted in the US.” 
 Meli’s behaviour was “basically normal” even during his arraignment.
 “The court gave him time to reconsider but at no point did he appear anxious or tearful….he was clear.”
 Asked by Meli’s lawyer whether he was specialized in psychology or psychiatry or any other medical field, the inspector’s reply was, “no.”
 Logs of Meli’s ‘movements’ while in police custody were exhibited in court. 
 He was arrested on February 7 at 7:45am and taken to the custody centre at 5:00pm.
 According to routine procedure, his personal details were recorded and he was given all rights, including the right to see a doctor and a lawyer. 
 Meli declined the right to medical assistance but told officers that he was due for a visit at the detox centre.
 He expressed the wish to speak to a close relative and later spoke to his personal lawyer on the phone between 8:02pm and 8:32pm.
 Later that evening, he was accompanied to the Floriana health centre.
 The next day, he paid another visit to detox and then faced interrogation between 9:00am and noon. 
 Meli was released for arraignment at 2:25pm, said inspector Antoine Cilia who gave an overview of the police logs which were presented in evidence. 
 State Advocate lawyer Julian Farrugia drew attention to a story published by MaltaToday on February 10, titled, ‘FBI wanted Maltese hacker extradited over sale of Pegasus, Warzone Trojans.’
 Meli’s former lawyer was reported as stating that the wanted person “was motivated by a mindset of cooperation and facing down the charges…,” summing up his client’s attitude as “‘since we’re going to have to face it, let’s get it done.’”
 The author of that story was summoned by the State Advocate. 
 He could not recall whether Meli's former lawyer had sought his client's permission before giving them those comments to the media.
 The case, presided over by Madam Justice Doreen Clarke, continues.
 State Advocate lawyer Julian Farrugia represented the respondents. Lawyers Franco Debono and Arthur Azzopardi are assisting Meli.

"MFSA ordered to pay €414,000 to unfairly dismissed official",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/mfsa-ordered-pay-414000-unfairly-dismissed-official.1098487,24-09-2024,003753.png,"Updated 2.50pm with MFSA reply
 The Malta Financial Services Authority has been ordered to pay almost €414,000 in damages to a former top official who was unjustly fired by then CEO Joseph Cuschieri.
 Reuben Fenech, the chief operations officer of the authority since 2018, sued his former employer before the Industrial Tribunal after he was dismissed with immediate effect in September 2019.
 
 Just three months previously he had received a letter of appraisal from the head, People and Culture, stating that his performance was “meeting expectations.”
 Cuschieri had added an attachment to that letter, listing a number of areas which he wanted Fenech to improve.
 In July 2019, Cuschieri sent Fenech “additional feedback,” again highlighting those areas and promised to send further feedback in August.
 But during a face-to-face meeting in September, Cuschieri told Fenech that his job was being terminated with immediate effect.
 Fenech contested that decision but to no avail.
 He then took his grievances before the Industrial Tribunal.
 The Tribunal, chaired by Joseph Gerada, found that Fenech’s dismissal was “premeditated” and unfair since Cuschieri did not follow the procedures set out in the Staff Handbook. That was an integral part of the employment contract.
 When testifying before the Tribunal, Cuschieri said that he could not appoint a disciplinary board since it was the COO who normally chaired such a board.
 The Tribunal observed that although an executive official like Fenech was to be scrutinised by a higher organ, that did not diminish his right to disciplinary measures that were transparent, objective and just, like all other employees.
 
 The CEO could have appointed a disciplinary board headed by the Director of Human Resources and Development or some other official purposely appointed for the task by the Board of Management and Resources.
 Instead Cuschieri placed himself in the “precarious position of prosecutor and judge.”
 As for the allegations that Fenech’s performance was lacking, that too should not have been handled any differently from poor performance by other fellow employees.
 There had been several conversations between Cuschieri and Fenech in the build-up to the dismissal. Yet the Tribunal said it could not know what was discussed since no records were kept.
 The tribunal said letters of feedback were no substitute for warning letters. Indeed, Fenech never received any warning about poor performance.
 While Cuschieri’s comments were “rather generic”, Fenech rebutted with concrete examples and asked for the opportunity to discuss and clarify further, the Tribunal observed.
 It was evident that the two parties had  “diametrically opposed” views on the situation.
 The tribunal said Fenech alone had been blamed for an early voluntary retirement scheme that was introduced by the Authority after discussions with the CEO and other top officials.
 No one flagged the need to include a clause in the scheme to  prevent a ‘revolving door system.’
 When the scheme attracted criticism by the media, Fenech was blamed for not having suggested such a clause.
 He was also criticised for not communicating. But evidence showed that Fenech was always accessible to his colleagues, roped in everyone and sought solutions that would ultimately bear results.
 Yet his work ethic did not match that of the CEO.
 Cuschieri claimed that his style was “pragmatic and result-oriented” whereas Fenech was “pedantic and picking on details.”
 Fenech, on the other hand, said that he based his work practices on public sector rules.
 Cuschieri had an “arbitrary” style, ignoring established procedures, claimed Fenech.
 Among several examples cited, Fenech said that Cuschieri would first sign direct orders then get angry after being told that the necessary approval for such orders had not yet been issued.
 The COO insisted on abiding by the rules when introducing changes to vacation leave, travel, recruitment, procurement, risk management, performance system and budgets.
 He complained that Cuschieri would often alter a decision which would have been taken at top level, and would do so unilaterally.
 When Cuschieri dismissed Fenech, the move triggered disagreement at Board level with various members voicing concern that the disciplinary action was not in line with the Staff Handbook, the Tribunal noted. 
 Faced with such a situation, “a typical principal” would have reconsidered his decision “even if only as a sign of respect towards the Governors of the Public Institution.”  
 Instead, it was evident that Cuschieri had already decided to dismiss Fenech when he sent him the second additional feedback in July.
 When all was considered, Fenech’s work style was no attempt to hinder the CEO in attaining corporate objectives.
 Fenech worked in a competent and professional manner to achieve those objectives according to the rules, in the best public interest and in a sustainable manner.
 Being fired from such a high-profile post had serious and far-reaching repercussions on Fenech’s career. He never lost the trust of the MFSA’s Board of Governors who should have better scrutinised Cuschieri's actions.
 The Tribunal concluded that the dismissal was therefore unfair and awarded Fenech €413,688, of which €50,000 are moral damages, payable by the Authority by the end of this year.
 Fenech was also to get back his seniority and his Jobsplus records were to be amended to show that his dismissal was unjustified.
 Lawyers Kathleen Calleja Grima and Mark Muscat assisted Fenech.
 MFSA has not yet said whether it intends to appeal the tribunal decision. When contacted, an MFSA spokesperson said the authority ""is evaluating the outcome of the Industrial Tribunal’s decision and will take the necessary decisions in due course.”
 In a statement after the industrial tribunal's decision, the Nationalist Party called on the prime minister to remove Cuschieri from his current post as CEO of Project Green, saying he had committed an injustice and ruined an employee's career. 
 ""Following this decision, which took five years to be delivered, Joseph Cuschieri’s position as CEO of Project Green is no longer tenable. (Environment) Minister Miriam Dalli must immediately remove Cuschieri, and if she does not, Prime Minister Robert Abela must dismiss him himself,"" the PN said. 
 ""If he is not removed, Robert Abela will be perpetuating a culture of impunity in the country. He would be rewarding those who do wrong, break the law, and ruin people’s lives.""
 The party said the MFSA must immediately take the necessary legal action to ensure that the damages rightly owed to the employee are not paid out of public taxes but by those who blatantly and shamelessly committed this illegality.

Businessman to be deported after sexually molesting women in hotel lift,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/businessman-deported-sexually-molesting-women-hotel-lift.1097655,09-05-2024,003754.png,"A man who sexually molested two tourists in a hotel lift while on holiday in Malta is to be deported to Libya.
 Shallouf Ahmed Mahamoud, 32, a Libyan national, admitted to committing non-consensual sexual acts when he was arraigned before a magistrate on Thursday morning.
 The arraignment took place just hours after the incident in a hotel in St Julian's.
 Prosecutors said two young British women were in the lift going to a rooftop pool when the stranger, later identified as the accused, reached out and touched one of them inappropriately in various parts of her body before walking out.
 The women immediately reported the incident at the hotel reception and asked for CCTV footage. While they were there the man walked through the hotel lobby. One of the women filmed him on her phone and filed a police report. He was arrested shortly after.
 On arraignment, Mahamoud admitted to committing non-consensual sexual acts, causing the women to fear violence as well as committing an unwelcome act of intimacy.
 During submissions on sentencing, the defence argued that a suspended sentence was ""no walk in the park."" Once deported, the businessman would be closely scrutinised should he ever try to return to Malta.
 Magistrate Claire Stafrace Zammit handed down a two-year jail term suspended for four years and issued a protection order in favour of the victims, warning Mahamoud not to contact them in any way. 
 The court also ordered the accused’s immediate deportation to his country of origin.

Man accused of raping ex granted bail as judge finally gets court transcripts,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/man-accused-raping-ex-granted-bail.1093612,06-10-2024,003761.png,"A man who stands charged with raping his ex-partner when she went to his apartment to collect her engagement ring after their break-up has finally been granted bail after a judge received court transcripts she had ordered.
 The bail hearing had to be postponed twice last week because the transcripts were not ready in time.
 Madam Justice Consuelo Scerri Herrera last week fined the court administration €250 after finding it in contempt when it ignored an order to produce transcripts of the victim’s testimony so that the court could rule on a request for bail.
 The judge yesterday accepted an appeal by the registrar of the criminal courts after noting that the transcripts were eventually filed and the defendant could be granted bail.
 A 27-year-old Norwegian i-Gaming employee, whose name cannot be published by court order, was granted bail against a €10,000 deposit and an additional €10,000 personal guarantee. The man denies the charges.
 Madam Justice Scerri Herrera ordered the man not to speak to any of the witnesses and sign the bail book daily and be home between 9pm and 7 the following morning. She also ordered him not to change his address or leave his job until the termination of the court case.
 According to his bail conditions, he also “cannot board any boat and leave the shores of the Island of Malta for no reason whatsoever”.
 The man had been refused bail when he was first arraigned on April 29. The woman testified in detail before Magistrate Lara Lanfranco during the first hearing of the compilation of evidence two weeks later. The defendant was, however, again refused bail.
 The man’s lawyers, Franco Debono, Marion Camilleri and Adreana Zammit, requested the superior courts to grant their client bail once the prosecution’s main witness had testified and her version was confirmed on oath in court.
 But when the application was called by Madam Justice Scerri Herrera, the bail hearing could not be heard because the court did not have the transcript of the alleged victim’s testimony.
 The judge put off the hearing, ordering that the court administration be notified that the transcripts were required for the bail hearing. However, when the case was called, the judge was told that no transcripts had been received.
 This angered Madam Justice Scerri Herrera who said this behaviour was “unacceptable” and “tantamount to contempt of court”. She said she was not in a position to consider the application “due to these administrative hiccups which are unacceptable for the administration of justice”.
 The judge also complained about what she said was “lack of cooperation between the administration of the courts and the criminal court”, which she said was causing “severe disturbance to the administration of justice”.
 All audio recordings of court sittings are transcribed and inserted into the case file. The issue of transcripts of court sittings has been a recurring problem in court in recent years. Delays in transcribing testimony have caused serious administrative shortcomings breaching defendants’ fundamental rights because they had to remain in preventive custody for additional days.

 The Industrial Tribunal, chaired by John Bencini, found that the dismissal of teacher Abdulmunaam Albakush from the 24 December Libyan School and the Libyan Higher Vocational Institute constituted unfair dismissal.
 Albakush had been employed as a teacher since November 2014 and his contract was renewed annually. Then in December 2021 his wife, who also worked at the school, was dismissed from her teaching post. The following March, she filed proceedings before the Industrial Tribunal against her former employer, claiming unfair dismissal.
 Almost immediately after that, Albakush heard that he, too was going to be fired.  Head of School Abdulfatah Kharwat reassured him that there was no problem because his job had no connection to the dispute between his wife and her employer.
 But in June 2022 he was denied entry to the building which houses the institute without explanation. The following month, Identity Malta, informed him that his residence permit was being revoked because his employer had filed a termination letter.
 The school, through its lawyer Rebecca Mercieca, argued that although Albakush’s wife had been fired for allegedly misappropriating data belonging to the Institute, about which a police report had been filed, this had no bearing on Albakush himself. The school denied having dismissed him, pointing out that he had worked until the expiry of his contract.
 Tribunal Chairman John Bencini noted that according to the Fixed Term Contracts Directive, transposed into Maltese law in 2008, when an employee was engaged on a fixed term contract for a period of four years or more, then the contract was deemed to be an indefinite one.
 Despite this fact, the defendants had not felt it necessary to provide a reason for the termination of his employment, besides simply stating that it was not being renewed.
 “This is all wrong, because once the applicant satisfied the requirements established in the subsidiary legislation, his employment with the defendants had to be treated as being on an indefinite basis. It follows, therefore, that in order for them to be able to dismiss the applicant, they had to show good and sufficient grounds at law to do so. This they had not done,” the tribunal said. 
 Lawyer Andrew Grima assisted Albakush.

 The figure was announced in a press release on Monday, following an informal discussion held with Home Affairs Minister Byron Camilleri and people who used the Victims Support Agency. 
 The agency provides free of charge legal guidance and emotional support to victims of crime. It provides information and follow-up about the victim cases and guidance about what to expect in court. The agency also raises awareness and advocates for victims’ rights to encourage other victims to report and seek support. 
 Among the people who were present for the discussion were domestic violence victims. The press release went into detail about what happens if a domestic violence victim files a report.
 As soon as the person makes a police report, the agency contacts them. Once the victim accepts help, a therapy programme is drawn up by professionals, who would also accompany the person to testify in court. 
 Camilleri reiterated the government’s commitment to continue strengthening the agency’s services. He also referred to other services, such as the Gender-Based Domestic Violence Unit in Santa Luċija, the first hub where multidisciplinary services are offered to victims.
 The Agency’s CEO Brian Farrugia and Head of Services of the Agency, Sylvana Gafà, were present at the meeting.

 Judge Neville Camilleri ruled that Meli should be given the chance to contest extradition proceedings despite having already consented to be sent to the US to face charges there.

                     The ruling was possible following a legal amendment approved unanimously by parliament allowing lawyers for Meli to appeal proceedings despite him first consenting to the extradition.

 Meli’s case will have to be reheard in the lower courts.

 His extradition had been requested by the Northern District of Georgia following his indictment in December 2023, for computer access, damage and interception-related offences. US prosecutors accuse Meli of having offered malware products and services, amongst them the Pegasus remote access trojan (RAT), for sale to cybercriminals through online computer-hacking forums “since at least 2012.” 

 Earlier this year, in an interview with MaltaToday, Meli’s parents appealed to the authorities to intervene in the case. The family had found out that their son’s consent to the extradition meant he could face a lifetime in an American prison, a far cry from what Meli’s lawyer had told him when advising him to agree to extradition.

Woman who claimed her ex had raped her gets suspended jail sentence,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/woman-claimed-ex-raped-gets-suspended-jail-sentence.1100365,11-01-2024,003813.png,"A woman who lodged a false report against her former partner claiming that he had violently raped her, was handed a suspended sentence after admitting that “it was all a lie.”
 The incident occurred five years ago when Loretta Vella, now 44, turned up at Qawra police station on October 14 to report that her former partner had held her against her will and raped her at a St Paul’s Bay apartment.
 That report triggered a magisterial inquiry and police investigations leading to the suspect’s arrest.
 The man was interrogated and subsequently released on police bail.
 But the investigating officer was suspicious. 
 The woman’s version did not tally with the suspect’s version, which was corroborated by CCTV footage. Her version did not appear to make much sense.
 The investigator informed the inquiring magistrate about his suspicions that the alleged victim’s version was not true.
 Vella was called back for further questioning and she admitted that there had been no rape.
 “It was all a lie.”
 The woman was then charged with reporting her ex for committing a crime when she actually knew that he was innocent. She was also charged with taking a false oath.
 The case was assigned to a new magistrate earlier this year.
 The court noted that last year Vella’s ex had declared that he had no interest in the proceedings. Nor did he insist that the accused should be punished.
 However, the charges could not be withdrawn by the victim since the offences were prosecutable by the police ex officio.
 Vella registered an admission.
 The parties agreed that in the circumstances, effective imprisonment was not an adequate punishment.
 When delivering judgment, Magistrate Nadia Helena Vella agreed that although the accused deserved punishment, effective imprisonment was not adequate in the circumstances.
 However the charges were serious and her false report had triggered a magisterial inquiry which involved experts and expenses.
 In light of such considerations the court condemned the woman to a 21-month jail term suspended for three years. She was also to shoulder court expert expenses.
 Inspector Godwin Scerri prosecuted.

 Following that arraignment, the defendant uploaded four videos making criminal allegations against the officers.
 He was charged with insulting and threatening Inspector Camilleri and two of his subordinates, causing them fear of violence and misuse of electronic communications equipment. He was also charged with breaching bail.

 Schembri had filed his lawsuit against National Orchestra Limited in 2018 for breach of contract, claiming his employment contract, which automatically renewed after three years, was unlawfully terminated by the defendant.
 He argued that the defendant attempted to impose unfavourable contract amendments that would have diminished his role and rights and sought three years' worth of salary (€168,431.96) as stipulated in the contract's termination clause.
  NOL countered that Schembri had neglected his contractual obligations, leading to the contract's termination. They cited his alleged failure to attend a concert on June 24th, 2017, forcing them to find a substitute conductor at significant cost.
 Furthermore, the defendant claimed Schembri had harmed the orchestra's reputation, prompting sponsors to withdraw their support, resulting in damages. They sought a ruling holding Schembri solely responsible for the termination and liable for damages.
 The court found that the defendant's attempts to impose unfavourable contract amendments after the automatic renewal amounted to a breach of contract.
 Evidence suggested that the defendant deliberately undermined Schembri’s authority, affecting his ability to fulfill his role. Additionally, the court considered the defendant's claim of Schembri abandoning his duties as opportunistic, noting that the termination based on this claim was made after the defendant realised their liability for three years of salary.
 The court ruled in favour of the Schembri, saying that the defendant’s counterarguments and claims of damages were dismissed due to a lack of substantial evidence. The court upheld the plaintiff's claim for three years’ worth of salary (€168,431.96). Costs associated with the lawsuit were also awarded to the plaintiff, with the exception of those related to a jurisdiction challenge, which were borne by the plaintiff.

Winning students suspended from contest as police probe is delayed,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/winning-students-suspended-contest-police-probe-delayed.1095976,28-07-2024,003846.png,"Three computer science students who won a national cybersecurity competition have been told they cannot continue to the international stage of the contest because of a police investigation.
 Michael Debono, Giorgio Grigolo, and Luke Bjorn Scerri participated in the National Cyber Security Challenge, a competition organised by the Malta Information Technology Agency (MITA) in May, and placed first, second and third.
 All three won vouchers, and Debono, who placed first, automatically qualified for the European Cybersecurity Challenge (ECSC) in Turin, Italy.
 The other two were meant to join a local boot camp where the top 10 participants would also be selected to join the Maltese delegation for the European competition.
 Yet, their celebrations were short-lived when MITA recently called them in for a meeting to inform them they were suspended from the competition until police investigations were concluded.
 The investigation dates to October 2022, when Debono, Grigolo, Scerri and another student were arrested after they found and exposed a security weakness in Malta’s largest student application, FreeHour.
 No charges have been filed against the trio.
 The students had e-mailed FreeHour to inform the company of the security flaw and requested a reward – or ‘bug bounty’ – a common practice in ethical or ‘white hat’ hacking. But instead of a payoff, the University of Malta students were arrested, strip-searched and had their computer equipment seized.
 At the time they told Times of Malta they were only trying to help the app improve its security, and FreeHour, which initially filed the police report, said it was “ exploring ways to help” the students.
  In the competition, in May, the trio were rewarded for their skills in solving cybersecurity challenges linked to web and mobile security, crypto puzzles, and forensics.
 MITA said it decided with “great responsibility” to suspend the three winners until the police investigation is concluded.
 Debono said he was “devastated” when he found out he would not be representing Malta in Turin, especially since he was looking forward to meeting other international computer science students.
 “It’s a wish of mine to see a flourishing community of cybersecurity enthusiasts in Malta. However, I’ve begun to lose hope,” the 21-year-old told Times of Malta. “I’m seriously considering opportunities abroad as it feels suffocating to do what I love in Malta.”
 Despite no charges being filed, the investigation remains open and their equipment is still in the hands of the police, which has distressed the students.
 “We have not heard anything back from the police about investigations, and there is no open case against me or any of my friends,” he said. “I don’t think we did anything wrong, so why am I being excluded?”
 He added that the ongoing investigations could potentially prevent them from participating in future competitions due to the age limit for ECSC being 25.
 Grigolo, participating for the second time in the national competition, voiced his frustration, particularly for Debono.
 “It’s not fair, especially for my friend Michael,” he said. “He was guaranteed a spot, while for Luke and me, the authorities could argue that they are not going to shortlist us during the boot camp as they would be ‘abiding’ by the regulations of the qualifying process. This still does not make sense, as we are the top three.”
 He said the idea of having a court case hang over their shoulders has impacted them mentally.
 “I was slightly in disbelief and very disappointed in them, although I thought I should have seen it coming,” Bjorn Scerri said, adding that the trio should have been informed before the competition began. “There isn’t even an open case against me or my friends. I thought the principle of ‘innocent until proven guilty’ would apply here,” the 23-year-old continued.
 MITA to reconsider suspension once investigation is complete 
 Replying to questions, an MITA spokesperson said the agency will reconsider the suspension once the investigation is complete.
 “Our ethical values, which we embrace every day, were upheld in the case of the three winners. A meeting between the agency and the individuals involved was held first.”
 She explained a decision on whether MITA will send a Maltese delegation to the international event would be taken at a later stage and would make a final decision after the local boot camp.
 Police did not respond to questions about the investigation.

Man denied bail after being accused of threatening to kill his ex over text,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/man-denied-bail-accused-threatening-kill-ex-text.1098019,09-12-2024,003870.png,"A manipulative man who warned his ex not to go out with other men threatened to kill her if she reported him to the police. 
 Neville Abela, a 38-year-old Marsa resident who is currently unemployed, persisted in bombarding his former partner with messages in an apparent attempt to keep her under his thumb.
 He was remanded in custody after pleading not guilty to harassment 
 When the two split up, they remained on friendly terms, explained prosecuting inspector Audrey Micallef, who pressed charges against Abela on Thursday. 
 The defendant kept sending messages to his ex even after she told him to leave her in peace.
 But he allegedly upped the ante between Monday and Wednesday when his messages took on a more ominous tone. 
 “He exerted control over her,” explained the prosecutor.
 The defendant would allegedly order his ex to “make sure to answer his calls” and warned that she was not to go out with other men “before three months had lapsed.”
 “Go to the police, no problem. I’ll spend a couple of days [locked up] inside. As soon as I step out, I’ll kill you,” read one of the messages, prompting his alleged victim to report the harassment at the domestic violence unit. 
 The investigating officer ordered the man’s speedy arrest.
 He was arrested at his home and cooperated during interrogation, said Micallef. 
 Today he pleaded not guilty to causing his alleged victim fear of violence, harassment, insults and threats as well as misuse of electronic communications equipment. 
 He was also charged with relapsing. 
 The prosecution objected to bail not only because of the gravity of the charges and the fear of tampering with evidence but also because Abela had faced domestic violence charges previously. 
 Legal aid counsel Mark Busuttil countered that when considering bail, the fundamental rights of the defendant were to be taken into consideration.
 He cited the recent pronouncement in the case of the Romanian prince.
 Moreover, a death threat uttered in the heat of the moment was not necessarily to be put into effect. 
 The accused and his ex had known each other for years and this was a normal row, “some fireworks,” between the two, went on the lawyer. 
 The alleged victim “went the extra mile” by reporting him to the police.
 After hearing submissions the court, presided over by Magistrate Rachel Montebello, turned down the request in view of the nature of the charges and the fear that the accused would not abide by court conditions. 
 The alleged victim was to testify without any interference. 
 The court took note of the risk assessment report which had classified the case as one of “extreme danger.”

 The accused, who works in plumbing and maintenance, was caught advertising fake luxury items on TikTok.

                     Testifying on Wednesday, an inspector recalled how the police received an anonymous tip regarding the accused’s TikTok account.

 The inspector continued by saying that the man was also allegedly advertising sirens and beacon lights for private vehicles. Following a surveillance operation, the man was allegedly found to be driving a vehicle fitted with beacon lights and a siren that were switched on, as the vehicle was also found to be unregistered and without the proper license. When the accused was stopped, he was arrested and given notice of his rights and informed that his house would be searched to see if there were more beacon lights.

 After searching his home, police found a number of fake watches, bags, and jewellery, and €16,350 in his safe.

                     They also seized pepper spray ready to be sold as well as cash and cloned cards used for credit card fraud. The police’s investigation also allegedly found that the suspect was advertising counterfeit cash, and would be paid for such products in cryptocurrency.

 The Police had said that their investigations uncovered a business on the dark web, where illegal substances would be sold from China and would then be shipped to be sold in another country.

                     The defence did not contest the validity of the arrest, with the Court concluding that the arrest was lawful. The Court reminded the accused that he was facing a number of accusations, 20 in total, principally relating to money laundering, fraud, violation of trademarks, misuse of electronic equipment as well as other offences relating to trademarks and drug trafficking.

 The accused pleaded not guilty to the charges brought against him, and the defence requested the release of the accused from his arrest, which the prosecution did not object to.

 The Court, presided by Magistrate Rachel Montebello, handed down a freezing order against the accused. The Court accepted the defence’s request for bail on the grounds that the accused must sign a bail book, a deposit of €3,000 and a personal guarantee of €5,000.

 Darren Dimech, 46, and Roderick Camilleri, 44, are being accused of drug trafficking and importation after a 146kg drug bust at the Malta Freeport, with criminal proceedings against them resuming on Monday morning. According to the police, the cocaine intercepted had a street value of €20 million.

                     Police officer Johann Xuereb first took to the stand. He testified that when on 12 November 2024, he and inspector Mizzi arrived at the Freeport, there were already police officers on site as well as two arrested persons, namely the accused, who, it was noted, had requested medical assistance. He further recalled how he and Inspector Mizzi kept a close eye on the DAF truck in order to prevent any unauthorised entries into the vehicle.

 A drugs squad official, Yana Caruana, also testified, informing the court that a person who had been spotted taking photos of the operation was arrested. It also transpired that these photos had also been electronically distributed.

 Throughout proceedings it was furthermore revealed that searches on the person of Camilleri resulted in the taking of keys pertaining to a container, as well as a Freeport pass and a wallet.

 Two Freeport security controllers also testified. David Fabri informed the court that orders were given to carry out random searches and checks on trucks within the third lane of the Freeport. He testified that upon searching a green DAF truck, three sacks were identified. When asked what these sacks were, the driver and passenger, identified by both security staff as the accused, did not answer. It was at this moment that the staff informed their chief about the sacks and requested his assistance.

 Whilst Fabri told the court that he ‘did not like’ the sacks, he also confirmed, when cross-examined, that he could not confirm the actual contents inside the sacks.

 An official from the haulage company that employs the two accused also testified. The court ordered that the company name not be reported.

 Investigators believe the two men are part of a wider criminal conspiracy involved in cocaine trafficking from Ecuador to Malta. The drug bust was significant because unlike similar interceptions in the past, the cocaine in this case was intended for the Maltese market.

 A third man, Kurt Scicluna, who owns a car dealership in Ghaxaq, has also been charged in connection with the same case. He is undergoing separate proceedings.

 The incident happened in Triq Santa Klara at around 10:30pm following an argument between residents and a man.
 Preliminary investigations showed that a 41-year-old man from Qormi allegedly drove into and smashed a gate with a vehicle, got out, and allegedly fired some shots towards the residence.
 Afterwards, he fled the scene in the vehicle. At the time, there were two men and three women in the residence, none of whom were injured.
 A search for the vehicle, a Mercedes, and the person involved immediately began. At around 2:30am, the man who was being sought turned himself in to the police after going to the Qormi Police Station, where he was arrested.
 There, he alleged that shots had been fired in his direction by the two men who were in the mentioned residence, but he was not injured.
 Further investigations later that night led to the discovery of the 41-year-old man's vehicle, parked on the Naxxar Coast Road. The vehicle had sustained several damages, including marks consistent with gunshots. A search of the vehicle was conducted, but no firearm was found.
 Consequently, the police returned to the residence in Naxxar, and after a search, a shotgun was seized, and the two men, aged 64 and 35, were arrested.

Full police reports can now be filed online,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/full-police-reports-now-filed-online.1095998,29-07-2024,"003897.png,003898.png,003899.png","A revamp of the Malta Police Force’s online reporting system now means the public can file a complete police report without having to go to a police station.
 Speaking to Times of Malta, police inspector David Bugeja said in the new system the police will help guide people to file a police report remotely.
 While the police did have an online reporting system for some time, reports that came through it were often of an incomplete nature and missing crucial information that would force officers to ask people to go in person to complete the report.
  However, with the new system, a police officer will guide people every step of the way, in such a way that once the report is completed, it is filed directly into the police system and can then be referred for further action.
 Bugeja explained how there is now a new feature on the police’s website that prompts people to file a  remote police report.
 The first thing you will find is a pathway that explains the whole process of filing a remote report before you begin. Whereas before you would fill in a simple form, in the new system you will be asked to provide some details about the report you wish to file and then indicate a date when the police can call you back.
  Then, at the time of your choosing, you will be contacted directly by a police officer, who will be able to ask you specific questions about your report and file it directly into the police’s systems.
 At the end of that interaction, you will receive a copy of your completed report via e-mail.
 And it doesn’t have to be a regular phone call, the police can now reach you through WhatsApp, Skype, Microsoft Teams, Google Meet and even Facetime.
 “About 10 minutes before we’re scheduled to call you, we will send you a text on your chosen platform to confirm that the police are going to call you at the time of your choosing and then you will receive that call,” Bugeja said.
 “The advantage of this is that the police will input your report directly into the system and there is that interaction. Whereas before people would be a bit doubtful about what to include in the online report, with this new system the police will be asking you specific questions about it.”
  He said that those who go abroad and need to file a police report, such as for a lost wallet or missing identity document, will also be able to do so without having to return to the country unexpectedly or incur costly call charges.
 While the system is largely envisioned for smaller-stakes crimes that do not require the immediate presence of a police officer, Bugeja said that as long as it’s not an emergency – in which case the site itself immediately prompts you to call the 112 emergency number – all types of reports can be filed through the system, even serious crimes.
 “Let’s say you experienced fraud or cybercrime or God forbid you were attacked and didn’t initially want to report it but changed your mind later, we would still be able to take your report,” Bugeja said.

 In an open letter to Robert Abela, the bird conservation NGO also drew his attention to the reputational damage – as well as legal fees - Malta had incurred by defending its position over the years.
 Finch trapping is illegal under EU law, but Malta has for years found ways of allowing it.
 In 2018 the ECJ sought to definitively block the practice, but two years later Malta reintroduced it by claiming that trappers were taking part in  a catch-and-release scientific research project.
 The justification left the European Commission unimpressed, and it subsequently sued the government before the European Court of Justice.
 This week, the ECJ concluded that Malta had broken EU law without justification.
 It was the second time that the ECJ has ruled that Malta was unjustifiably allowing finch trap
 Minister Clint Camilleri – who is himself a trapper – argued this week that the ECJ ruling had only found “minor breaches” in the way Malta implemented the research project.
 The ruling had only found “minor breaches”, he argued.
 On Saturday, Birdlife accused Camilleri of “blatantly twisting the facts” of the ECJ ruling. The minister, the NGO noted, had already tried to fool people by claiming the finch trapping exception was a genuine research project, and had also tried to derail infringement proceedings before the ECJ.
 “Rather than assume the political responsibility as would be the case from an Western European Minister, Minsiter Camilleri wants to cry victory,” the NGO said, as it accused the minister of offending the public’s intelligence.
 It was not true that the ECJ had only found one fault in Malta’s derogation, it said.
 Citing from the ECJ ruling, it noted that the court had concluded that Malta had failed to prove why it needed the derogation – the very basis for applying one – and had not bothered to examine other pleas raised, given that the first breach was enough in and of itself to rule against Malta.
 Birdlife said the ECJ ruling vindicated its years-long position against the finch trapping derogation, and told Abela it was now down to him to ensure the court’s verdict was respected.
 While he may have fully trusted Camilleri to design and implement the derogation, the prime minister now had to take over, Birdlife said.
 “It is high time to call a spade a spade and declare that Malta cannot keep on toying around with farcical ploys to try and fool the European Commission or the European Court of Justice with similar derogations,” Birdlife said.
 “The finch trapping derogation has failed twice, and the latest one, disguised as scientific research, fooled no one from day one.”
  “Malta now needs to make sure that we don’t harm our reputation even further, since breaching such a clear sentence, would also question our country’s position towards the rule of law. We believe this is a serious matter that needs a decisive decision of high level leadership.”
 Birdlife also called for the government-appointed Ornis committee – which is responsible for advising the government on hunting and trapping-related issues – to be reformed to be truly scientific in its approach.
 “Malta needs to have a science-based Ornis Committee to give science-based advice and not politically motivated ones,” Birdlife said. “Nothing stops the Minister from acquiring political advice from his people of trust, but the Ornis committee should not be anything but scientific.”

Josie Muscat: 'I was not aware of any involvement by Shaukat Ali in cancer treatment machine procurement',maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/129805/vitals_corruption_case_against_joseph_muscat_konrad_mizzi_and_keith_schembri_continues_today_,19-06-2024,003903.png," 
 Medical doctor and former politician Dr. Josie Muscat has told a court that he was not aware of any involvement by Shaukat Ali Chaudhry or Vitals Global Healthcare in the procurement of cancer treatment machinery during the time he had been involved in the process.
 The St. James Hospital Group chairman and founder was called to the witness stand in criminal proceedings against former Prime Minister Joseph Muscat and others, filed as a result of the inquiry into the sale of three State-owned hospitals to Vitals Global Healthcare.
 The court was told today that one of the inquiry’s conclusions was that all the participants in the project to purchase a cyclotron - a machine used to create radioactive isotopes for medical imaging and cancer treatment- Josie Muscat, amongst them, were simply frontmen, and that Pakistani businessman Shaukat Ali, who was also behind the VGH concession, was the real ‘promoter’ of the cyclotron project.  The text of the inquiry reads ""...the real Promoter of the cyclotron project may well have been at all times ‘Shaukat Ali and the VGH investors (working in tandem with the support of government ministers).""
 “I didn’t know Shaukat Ali and as far as I know he had never been involved in the cyclotron project. I can’t say whether he was [involved] after I left,” Muscat told the court today.
 Dr. Muscat told the court that he had been part of the cyclotron procurement committee, but had not led it. Brian Bondin and Andre Chetcuti, CEO and CFO respectively, of Roots Integrated Services Ltd, a company which Muscat said he owned, had handled the issue.
 He insisted that Vitals was “absolutely never mentioned” during the period that Dr. Muscat had been a part of the procurement committee.
 He gave Magistrate Rachel Montebello a timeline of his involvement in the project on Wednesday.
  “Many years ago. Malta Enterprise had sent for me because they wanted to install a cyclotron for [the treatment of ] animals. It seemed strange to me, as it didn’t seem necessary and I wasn’t interested.”
 He said that subsequently, in 2008, St. James’ Hospital had decided to purchase a PET scanner, which required the procurement of radioactive tracers, which are difficult to transport. The scanner was eventually installed in 2011 and after that, Dr. Muscat said he was invited by Malta Enterprise to travel to Israel to strike a deal with a prospective supplier of radioactive medical tracers.
 He told the court that he had found it odd to try and obtain tracers from Israel, when there was a more straightforward option of importing them from Italy.
 He had later withdrawn from the project, he said.
 When Dr. Muscat was confronted on the stand with the inquiry’s conclusion that he had not been the cyclotron project’s promoter but had merely been a front for Shaukat Ali, he denied this was the case.
 He insisted that he had negotiated on his own behalf and on behalf of his company, Roots.
 “I didn’t know Shaukat Ali and as far as I know he had never been involved in the cyclotron project. But I can’t say whether he was [involved] after I left.”
 The witness insisted that Vitals Global Healthcare was “absolutely never mentioned” while he was part of the cyclotron committee.
 Joseph Zammit, Chief Officer for Corporate Services at Malta Enterprise told the court today that the cyclotron was currently up and running. Malta Enterprise had been involved in the latter stages of the project, he said.
 “In 2015, Dr. Josie Muscat had recommended the introduction of a cyclotron…but had informed Malta Enterprise that he was withdrawing from the project, after it had already been approved and had obtained a soft loan of 60% of the €69 million project.
 Vitals Global Healthcare had failed to invest directly in the project, Zammit said and when Steward took over the hospitals, they had declared that they were not interested in continuing with the cyclotron project.
  
 What are the charges?
 In addition to money laundering, fraud and conspiracy charges, Muscat and Mizzi face charges of accepting bribes and corruption in public office, while Schembri will be charged with offences relating to the solicitation of bribes and abuse of his office to exact an unlawful advantage.
 Nexia BT’s Brian Tonna and Karl Cini are charged alongside their firm with having knowingly assisted Muscat to accept bribes.

 Who is charged:
 Steward Malta Management’s legal representative, lawyer David Joseph Meli, is charged in both his personal capacity, as well as in representation of Steward Malta Management Ltd, of corrupting public officials – namely Muscat, Schembri and Mizzi.
 Steward’s British IT manager, Clarence John Conger-Thompson and its  auditor,  Christopher Spiteri, are also charged with bribery-related offences.
 Spiteri alone is further accused of acting with grave dishonesty in carrying out the professional activity of auditor or accountant, as well as with making false declarations to a public authority, breaching professional secrecy and omitting or making false tax declarations for Pakistani entrepreneur Shaukat Ali Chaudhry and members of Chaudhry’s family. He is also accused of perjuring himself before the magisterial inquiry.
 Spiteri in his personal capacity as well as that of auditor, together with Jonathan Vella, medical equipment supplier Ivan Vassallo and his business partner Mario Victor Gatt are charged with false accounting, both in their personal capacities as well as in representation of  Technoline Ltd and Eurybates Ltd.
 Spiteri is also accused, in his personal capacity as well as that of auditor, together with Jonathan Bondin and David Meli, as representatives of MTrace p.l.c. and Gateway Solutions Ltd, with having knowingly made false declarations to a public authority to obtain an illicit advantage.

MUT loses defamation case against rival union,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/132352/mut_loses_defamation_case_against_rival_union,18-11-2024,003905.png,"The Malta Union of Teachers and its president, Marco Bonnici, have failed in their defamation suit against the Union of Professional Educators over claims published online. In In its ruling, the court upheld the importance of free expression in public discourse between competing unions.

 The MUT had claimed that a publication by UPE on 11 November, 2023, made false and damaging statements aimed at undermining its credibility during a critical period of industrial negotiations. Specifically, the MUT accused UPE of suggesting that the MUT had accepted financial proposals from the government and that the announced strike on 27 November, 2023, was a mere demonstration of power.

                     The MUT argued that these statements were defamatory, harming its reputation and reducing members' trust. The UPE, in its defence, maintained that the statements constituted fair comment on matters of public interest, reflecting its honest opinion and reasonable belief about ongoing negotiations.

 The court examined the evidence, including statements made by the MUT and UPE, and focused on determining whether the statements were inherently defamatory and if they caused serious harm to the MUT's reputation.

 The Court emphasised that defamation law, under Malta's Media and Defamation Act, requires proof of serious harm or potential serious harm to reputation, a threshold that also applies to organisations such as trade unions. Furthermore, it considered the balance between protecting reputation and safeguarding freedom of expression, especially in the context of public debate involving competing unions.

 Ultimately, the court, presided by Magistrate Rachel Montebello, ruled that the statements did not constitute defamation. It noted that the comments were part of a broader critique within a competitive environment between the two unions. The claims lacked the intent or effect of causing serious reputational damage to the MUT or Bonnici. Additionally, the MUT failed to demonstrate significant harm, such as financial loss or a tangible decline in its public standing.

 The judgment concluded that MUT, as a trade union not operating for profit, could not claim damages for financial harm under the relevant defamation laws. Moreover, it did not provide sufficient evidence to establish that the alleged defamation seriously impacted its reputation or Bonnici's personal credibility. Thus, the court dismissed the MUT's claims and ordered it to bear the costs of the proceedings.

Man admits drug possession at Mt Carmel Hospital,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/man-admits-drug-possession-mt-carmel-hospital.1096432,08-07-2024,003917.png,"A man on Wednesday admitted drug possession while he was receiving treatment at Mt Carmel Hospital, and was granted bail pending judgement on Thursday. 
 The drugs were discovered by the police a month ago after a tip-off. A court-appointed pharmacological expert certified that there were 2.7 grams of ketamine, 2.7 grams of cocaine and 3 grams of ecstasy. 
 During court proceedings, prosecuting Inspector Joseph Mallia presented a medical certificate declaring the accused fit for interrogation and prosecution. 
 The accused, a 32-year old from Swieqi, pleaded guilty to possession of controlled drugs.  
 When making submissions on punishment, defence lawyer Charles Mercieca pointed to the accused’s cooperation with police, his medical situation as well as the amount of drugs found in his possession. 
 The lawyer suggested a probation order coupled with a treatment order as adequate punishment, further pointing out that the accused was a user of these controlled substances. 
 The prosecution did not press for effective imprisonment.  Nor did it object to a request for bail.
 The court thus ordered the accused to attend Thursday’s hearing, not to abscond or commit some other offence, to deposit €200 and bind himself under a €1,000 personal guarantee.

 Charges were recommended by investigators against the man believed to be running Vitals Shaukat Ali Chaudhry, managing directors Sri Ram Tumuluri and Mark Edward Pawley, Vitals CEO and later managing director Armin Ernst, Steward CEO Ralph De La Torre, and Accutor AG owner Attaul Wasay Bhatti.
 The criminal charges they face are: money laundering, trading in influence, criminal conspiracy and bribery of former Prime Minister Joseph Muscat, former minister Konrad Mizzi and former OPM chief of staff Keith Schembri.
  They also recommended charging Chaudhry and Tumuluri with making fraudulent gains and obtaining money by false pretenses, and charging Tumuluri, Pawley, and Ernst with alleged document forgery – with Pawley also facing allegations of making a false statement in a public document.
 Investigators further believe Chaudhry should be charged with allegedly promoting an organization to commit a crime and complicity in crime, while Tumuluri should be charged with alleged fraud to the detriment of the tax commissioner.
 The six individuals, along with 28 others ranging from family members to business partners and employees, form a third group set to face serious criminal charges. All those named in this group are believed to reside abroad.
 31 companies owned or legally represented by these individuals were also singled out by the investigators including Vitals Global Healthcare Limited, Steward Healthcare International Limited and Accutor Consulting AG.

 The magisterial inquiry
 Magistrate Gabriella Vella, who was investigating the sale of three public hospitals to Vitals Global Healthcare, concluded her report and passed it on to the Attorney General last week.
 The inquiry was initiated in 2019 on Repubblika’s initiative.
 Joseph Muscat had tried to remove the magistrate from the inquiry, insisting she had a conflict because her relatives were publicly critical of him. He also complained of constant leaks from the inquiry and decried the magistrate’s refusal to let him testify before her.
 In January 2022, as part of the inquiry, police officers searched Muscat’s Burmarrad home and seized several electronic devices.

"Woman, 69, was dragged, hit on the head, during robbery, court hears",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/woman-69-dragged-hit-head-robbery-court-hears.1091754,30-04-2024,003930.png,"An elderly woman quietly cooking in her kitchen ended up being dragged across her home and hit on the head by three men who barged in when she opened the door for her, a trial has heard.
 The hold-up took place 19 years ago and the woman, who was 69 at the time, has since died.
 But her testimony before a magistrate was read out in court during the trial of one of the three men on Monday.
 Keith Cremona, 36, who was seventeen years old when the alleged violent robbery took place in July 2005, stands accused of involvement in a violent armed robbery, holding the woman against her will and seriously injuring her. He has pleaded not guilty.  
 The trial, presided by Madam Justice Consuelo Scerri Herrera, started on Monday and is expected to end later on Tuesday. 
 Recalling her ordeal, the woman, Bernardetta Meilaq, had testified how that July morning, around 9.30am, she was cooking in the kitchen of her home in Ta' Giorni Road, St Julian's, when the doorbell rang.
 Wrapping a towel around her chest, she headed to the front door.
 Three strangers were standing outside and immediately barged in, pushing her aside, causing her to fall.
 They demanded money but she told them she had none, pleading with them to take her gold valuables instead.
 But one of the robbers insisted that he wanted cash, saying that he had “two kids” and needed money.
 While two of the intruders rummaged through her possessions, the third, later identified as Cremona, dragged her along the corridor floor, right up to the kitchen where he grabbed a cordless phone and hit her on the head, the woman had testified.
 He also twisted her right arm so roughly that she suffered a dislocated shoulder.
 The pain was “agonizing,” she said.
 She also told police the men were armed with a hunting shotgun.
 The robbers fled the scene after they managed to find some Lm200 (460 euro) tucked inside a purse.
 Dazed and in pain, blood dripping from the cut on her head, the victim managed to make it to the front door but collapsed on the porch.
 The court was told that investigations kicked off but it was years later that police received confidential information which pointed at Cremona’s alleged involvement in the crime.
 Four of his fingerprints allegedly matched those found on a wooden chest inside the residence where the violent robbery had taken place.
 Cremona was subsequently charged in 2012 with aggravated theft, unlawfully holding his victim against her will as well as grievous bodily harm.
 After hearing a number of witnesses, the court heard submissions by both parties, with final arguments by the defence wrapped up on Tuesday.
 Judgment is expected later this evening.

'He tried to strangle me' - Stagno Navarra describes dispute over unsettled debt,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/he-tried-strangle-me-stagno-navarra-describes-dispute-unsettled-debt.1097674,09-05-2024,003957.png,"TV host Karl Stagno Navarra said on Thursday that constant threats by a man who chased him over an unsettled debt had driven him to report the matter to the police or else kill himself.
 “I don’t report people easily. My choice was either to commit suicide or file a report,” the ONE TV presenter said when testifying at the first hearing against a single father who was remanded in custody last week after pleading not guilty to violently insulting and threatening the broadcaster. 
 Jean Pierre Schembri, a 47-year-old maintenance worker from Żebbuġ, is accused of harassment, causing Stagno Navarra to fear violence, insulting and threatening and slightly injuring him, causing wilful damage to his property as well as misuse of electronic communications equipment.
 Stagno Navarra presented a pen drive with screenshots of the threatening messages, as well as audio recordings of voice calls from the accused and images of damages at his home.
 The dispute stemmed from the sale of a car by Schembri to Stagno Navarra in a part exchange agreement. 
 Stagno Navarra said he had started making monthly payments to Schembri who at first issued signed receipts accordingly.
 But then, Schembri did not issue any further receipts.
 Stagno Navarra said he jotted down subsequent payments in a booklet which he presented to Schembri to sign.
 There were five more payments, each varying between €300 and €500.
 But, he said, Schembri refused to sign, saying he could not identify the signatures on the booklet.
 No receipts were issued since June 2021 and Schembri did not transfer the car ownership.  
 And although he handed over money for the licence, Schembri had not paid for the licence renewal, Stagno Navarra said.
 Moreover, the car was no longer in his possession. Schembri took it back two years ago.
 Stagno Navarra claimed he was being blackmailed.
 He said that on August 8, he handed €400 to Schembri when they met at Hamrun.
 A few days later, Schembri demanded the same amount.
 “I’m going to commit suicide,” Stagno Navarra said he told Schembri.
 “It’s your business,” came the reply.
 Stagno Navarra said matters came to a head when he reported his issue to the police.
 Schembri turned up at his home, banging on the front door with his crash helmet.
 Fearing public embarrassment and that the man outside would damage the glass panels on his door, Stagno Navarra said he opened the door.
 As he did so Schembri swung his helmet, smashing a vase, and then tried to strangle him.  
 “All the swear words in the audio messages he sent me would cause my mobile to melt,” said the witness. Those recordings were played out in court.
 Stagno Navarro said he felt ""liberated"" when Schembri was remanded in custody last week. He could finally “open the curtains” at home.
 He recalled that when he had previously warned Schembri that he would call the police, Schembri replied: “you won’t do it because you’re scared of me.”
 After hearing that testimony, the court heard submissions on bail.
 Defence lawyer Lennox Vella said that the defendant had sole care and custody of a young daughter. Moreover, he had a full-time job.
 The court, he said, could grant bail against stringent conditions. The defendant now “knew well enough” that if he breached those conditions he would go back to jail.
 Lawyer Franco Debono, appearing for Stagno Navarra, pointed out that all that the victim wanted was “to live his life in peace.”
 If the defendant had any claims, he was to pursue them through lawful means.
 Magistrate Giannella Camilleri Busuttil upheld the request for bail against a deposit of €500, a personal guarantee of €2,500, daily signing of the bail book, and a curfew between 8pm and 7am.
 The magistrate warned Schembri not to go to approach or contact Stagno Navarra in any manner.
 A protection order to that effect, issued at the arraignment, remains in place.
 Inspector Doriette Cuschieri prosecuted.

Man accused of threatening to murder ex-partner and son granted bail,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/130544/man_accused_of_threatening_to_murder_expartner_and_son_granted_bail,02-08-2024,004006.png,"A man from Bormla has been released on bail after being accused of threatening to murder his ex-partner and their son.
 The 31-year old Freeport employee was arraigned under arrest before magistrate Lara Lanfranco, accused of slightly injuring the woman, threatening her and causing her to fear violence against her and her child. He was also charged with breaching two sets of bail conditions and a separate supervision order.
  Police Inspector Christian Cauchi told the court that the woman had reported the defendant as having punched her in the eye at her residence in June, during an argument over access to the son. The injuries had been certified by a doctor as slight.
 Last month the woman had given the defendant the keys to her home while she was accompanying the son to hospital. She had returned to find the medical certificate relating to her eye injury missing. The police had later confirmed that it had been issued by contacting the doctor who had seen her.
 The inspector explained that on 28 July, the defendant had gone to the woman’s home in Bormla, where he threatened to “slit her with a knife from her private parts all the way up to her mouth” and warning her that if she wouldn’t allow him to spend time with his son, he would kill him too.
 During questioning, he had denied doing so and showed the police a number of emails he had received from the woman, the inspector confirmed, when asked about this by defence lawyer Franco Debono.
 The court was told that the man is currently on bail in relation to two ongoing proceedings and had previously been handed a 3-year probation order in a similar case.
 The defendant filed a not guilty plea and requested bail, informing the court that he was currently living with his sister in a separate residence in Bormla.
 Inspector Cauchi objected to the bail request, explaining that at this stage, the alleged victim had not yet testified and stressing that the man had already been convicted of similar crimes as recently as last February. All this led the police to have concerns about his trustworthiness, the inspector said.
 At that point, Debono pointed out that the woman was also present in the courtroom, following the arraignment, arguing that there was no impediment to the court hearing her testimony immediately.  The lawyer said that the case was not as straightforward as it had been made to appear, and asked the inspector to confirm the context which the incident had taken place in.
 It emerged that the defendant had told the police that the woman had been taunting him with messages about other men whom she claimed to be seeing. The police inspector confirmed this, requesting that a protection order be issued should bail be granted.
 The man appeared to consent to the suggestion that he temporarily waive his access rights to the child to avoid any problems, 
 The court upheld the request for bail, prohibiting the man from contacting the alleged victim or child, also ordering him to sign bail book four times a week and observe a curfew. 
 His bail was secured by a €1,000 deposit and a €5,000 personal guarantee. The court also imposed a protection order in favour of both the woman and the son they have in common.
 A ban on the publication of the names of the involved parties was imposed..

 The information emerged before a Magistrates’ Court where Ernst was due to appear to face criminal charges over his alleged role in the Vitals hospitals deal, now annulled on the basis of fraud and collusion. 
 Lawyers Jose’ Herrera and Matthew Xuereb, who are expected to take up Ernst’s brief, informed the court that the defendant was not present today.
 He was briefly detained in the US, like former Steward Healthcare CEO Ralph de la Torre, until his mobile phone was seized.
 He was also ordered to appear before a US court to testify before a grand jury. 
 The lawyers made reference to documentation relating to those proceedings in the foreign jurisdiction which appeared to focus on the Maltese hospitals concession. 
 Investigators were apparently instructed to seize all mobile phones linked to Ernst and all records related to suspected foreign corrupt practices, conspiracy, wire fraud and money laundering. 
 Those included the Maltese concession agreement, business dealings between Steward, VGH and other foreign governments or entities, as well as any valuable or gift given by Steward to Maltese government officials, Shaukat Ali and other members of Shaukat’s family. 
 In light of that information, the lawyers pointed out that the merits of the US charges and those faced by Ernst in Malta were the same.
 That could potentially give rise to a situation of double jeopardy. 
 In light of such information, the court asked the prosecution to confirm through official channels Ernst’s current position in the US. 
 Before seeking Ernst’s extradition, the defence lawyers suggested that the Attorney General should first communicate with their counterparts about the issue of jurisdiction over the case. 
 The case was postponed to March. 
 AG lawyers Francesco Refalo and Shelby Aquilina prosecuted. Lawyers Jose’ Herrera and Matthew Xuereb appeared amicus curiae since they are still to take up the brief.

 it follows complaints from home owners saying they are getting bills from telephony companies addressed to people who have never lived there. 
 On Wednesday, Nationalist MP Albert Buttigieg said he suspected his property was being used for ID card fraud after he received letters addressed to people he had never heard of.
 Buttigieg said he recently found four letters from the mobile service company EPIC addressed to four individuals who did not live in his Gżira property. He urged Home Affairs Minister Byron Camilleri to order an investigation and said he would be reporting the matter to the police. 
 “I ask: Are these the fake ID cards that Jason Azzopardi wrote and spoke about?” Buttigieg said on Facebook. 
  It follows a sworn application in court by former PN MP and lawyer Jason Azzopardi, where he claimed some 18,000 identity cards had been issued based on marriage certificates and other documents fabricated by Identità officials.
 The PN MP also asked whether Epic accepts applications without being shown physical ID cards.  
 Another person, who preferred not to be named, gave a nearly identical story, saying he received letters from Epic addressed to people who have never lived in his property.
 Replying to questions, Epic said that As with other service providers across industries, it implements a vetting process which requires customers to show proof of identity and follows standard industry procedures if such complaints occur.
 In a statement on Wednesday, Identità, the state agency responsible for identity matters, said property owners who receive mail addressed to individuals who do not live in their properties should contact the police.
 The owner must also inform Identità’s Compliance Unit, if they believe the letters are being addressed to people who are not residents or citizens. 
 
 But Identità also said there may be various reasons why property owners receive mail addressed to people who do not live at their properties
 These include the tenant failing to notify the agency or private companies of a change of address or the property owner failing to submit a De-Registration Form, or persons deceptively and illegally making use of the address.
 The agency reminded property owners of their legal obligations to register and de-register rentals and stressed that a De-Registration Form should be submitted by property owners after the tenant has vacated the property.
 Following a change of address, foreign tenants should also regularise their presence in Malta and submit a Change of Address form, declaring their new address. Their residence permit could otherwise be revoked, the agency said.
 The agency also pointed out that as from September 1, 2024, any property lease contract submitted with a residence permit application must be signed by a notary, lawyer, or legal procurator. 
 Identita urged companies and service providers to verify clients addresses when a service is requested.  
 ""Identità declares that it cannot be held liable when false or fraudulent information is intentionally provided to businesses, entities, or local suppliers,"" it said.
 Last March, two Indian nationals were charged with submitting forged lease documents to Identita after the owner of a Naxxar apartment testified that the pair did not live there.
 However, magistrate Yana Micallef Stafrace acquitted the two after concluding that they were unaware the documents they handed to Identità were false.
 The man who allegedly set up the forged leasing documents, Anil Kumar Ghanta, was an agent who charged the pair thousands to migrate to Malta.
 Ghanta has been charged in India with criminal breach of trust, forgery, and cheating related to the manipulation of funds.

 A stranger walked up to the couple, offering help in retrieving the bag. He directed them to a bar along the Msida seafront where the bag would be returned by the person who allegedly took it.
 He also told them that if the woman’s boyfriend was European, the bag would not be returned.
 So while the woman entered the bar her boyfriend waited outside.
 The defendant was inside the bar and the woman later told police that she immediately smelt a rat. But when she tried to leave, the door was locked.
 That was when the defendant allegedly fondled her and took her smartwatch.
 Her boyfriend heard a scuffle in the bar, kicked the door open and stepped inside where he found the defendant armed with a hammer. 
 The accused subsequently needed treatment for hand injuries. 
 When subsequently interrogated by the police, the defendant denied the allegations by the couple, insisting that they initially approached him in Paceville.
 During his arraignment, defence lawyer Franco Debono requested bail, arguing that the defendant had been living in Malta for the past 13 years. He had a fixed address and had obeyed all conditions when released on police bail.
 Magistrate Donatella Frendo Dimech turned down the request.
 AG lawyer Nadia Ciappara and Inspector Michael Vella prosecuted.
 Lawyers Franco Debono and Adreana Zammit were defence counsel.

 In a statement, police said the accident occurred at around 8:15pm in Triq iż-Żejfa, Mosta.
 Preliminary investigations show that the 50-year-old motorcycle driver was hit by a vehicle that later took off. Police said the suspect also had an impact with two other cars, although their drivers suffered no injuries. 
 The motorcycle driver was aided by a medical team before being taken to Mater Dei Hospital by ambulance, where he was later certified as having sustained serious injuries.

Man accused of raping his ex-partner's underage daughter,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/man-accused-raping-expartner-minor-daughter.1097151,23-08-2024,004066.png,"A man was remanded in custody after pleading not guilty to raping his former partner’s minor daughter.
 The alleged abuse came to light when the girl, now aged 15, filed a police report claiming that the 39-year-old Swieqi man, who was previously her mother’s partner, had started defiling her eight years ago.
 The girl claimed that the abuse finally escalated to rape.
 A magisterial inquiry was appointed to investigate the allegations and the girl, as well as her parents, testified before the inquiring magistrate.
 The suspect was arrested in January and was subsequently released on police bail.
 Meanwhile, medical checks confirmed that the girl’s hymen was not intact.
 The man was charged in court on Friday, pleading not guilty to rape, abusing his position by engaging in sexual acts with the minor, holding the girl against her will, non-consensual sexual acts, defilement, harassment and causing her fear of violence.
 His lawyers requested bail.
 The prosecution objected not only given the nature of the charges but also because the alleged victim and her parents were still to testify in court.
 Defence lawyers Michaela and Mattea Giglio countered that all three had already testified before the inquiring magistrate.
 Although he had been out on police bail since January, the defendant had never approached the girl or her family. He had abided by all bail conditions.
 However parte civile lawyer Jacob Magri intervened, saying that the defendant had apparently sent non-stop WhatsApp messages to the girl’s mother in an attempt to communicate.
 After hearing submissions the court, presided over by Magistrate Victor George Axiak, turned down the request for bail in view of the real risk of tampering with evidence.
 The court also issued a protection order, warning the accused not to approach the alleged victim or her family in any way.
 The court banned the publication of the parties’ names.

"Arsonist jailed for six years after torching man's car, front door",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/arsonist-jailed-six-years-torching-man-car-front-door.1094373,24-06-2024,004067.png,"An arsonist who torched a vehicle in Senglea and set up a burn trail all the way to its owner's front door two years ago, was condemned to a six-and-a-half-year jail term.
 That trail - from the parked vehicle right up to the door of its owner’s home -  was the first piece of evidence that put investigators on the tracks of Jesmond Cassar who had adopted the same modus operandi in two previous arson attacks. 
 
 Police officers immediately spotted the trail when they were called to the scene of the crime that January night after a Toyota model burst into flames at around 3.30am.
 A blue plastic container, which melted in the blaze, further confirmed the suspicion that it was no accidental fire. 
 As investigators pieced together the evidence, the sequence of events emerged. 
 Police claimed that an accelerant fluid was first splashed over the parked vehicle, and then sprinkled along the pavement to the owner’s door. 
 When ignited, the flames spread to the residence where the owner and other family members slept. 
 The door and curtains behind it were soon ablaze. Smoke and soot filled the ground floor of the victims’ home. 
 The car owner’s mother later recalled she was woken up by her neighbour who was sounding the alert. There was smoke in her bedroom and the smell of burning. 
 By the time she got downstairs, her neighbour had managed to put out the fire at her front door. But her son’s car was still ablaze. 
 She handed him buckets of water as he struggled to put out the fire. 
 The car was a total loss. Mother and son also had to fork out some €2,000 to repair the damages to their home. 
 CCTV footage and call profile data further confirmed suspicions that Cassar, now 49, was behind the attack. 
 A Toyota model with two green doors and two missing hubcaps was caught on footage driving off at high speed close to the crime scene that night. 
 That vehicle was spotted a few weeks later in Cospicua. Its driver was Matthew Haidon. 
 Police gathered footage from outside Haidon’s Kalkara home. 
 On the night of the arson, at around 3:00am, Haidon drove up and parked the car outside. He went indoors and exited shortly after carrying a blue container. 
 The passenger waiting for him was Cassar. When arrested, Haidon insisted that it was Cassar who had committed the arson. He had simply waited in his car after Cassar walked to the victim’s home a short distance away. 
 Haidon also claimed that Cassar had asked him to hand over his waistcoat before heading out to put his arson plan into action. 
 Haidon was subsequently prosecuted and sentenced upon admission to his involvement in the crime.
 The victim testified that he suspected Cassar because of some pending issues between them. 
 Prior to the night of the arson, he spotted Cassar in the vicinity of his home.
 Moreover, the victim identified the accused through his gait and stature on footage that showed the arsonist walking up to the crime scene, a container in hand. 
 Call profile and geolocation data further strengthened the prosecution’s case. 
 At 2:45am on the night of the incident, Cassar had received a call from Haidon. 
 Later that day, police in the control room received a call. They recognised the caller’s voice. It was Cassar.
 The man was subsequently charged with wilfully setting fire to the car and the victim’s door, wilful damage to third party property, breaching bail as well as recidivism. 
 He pleaded not guilty, his lawyer arguing that the arson was committed by Haidon. 
 However, the court threw out the defence’s arguments, concluding that the prosecution had successfully proved a link of causation between the accused and the criminal action in such a manner as to morally convince the court of the accused’s guilt. 
 When delivering judgment, the court, presided over by Magistrate Rachel Montebello, observed that Haidon’s testimony was “consistent” and remained so even when cross-examined a year and a half after the incident. 
 The witness never contradicted himself and the court did not believe that he had maliciously made up his version implicating Cassar. 
 Moreover, material evidence supported Haidon’s version.
 When meting out punishment, the court took note of the accused’s voluminous criminal record, including other arson convictions. 
 There was nothing to show that Cassar had reformed himself. On the contrary, he proved to be untrustworthy even when twice granted bail during these proceedings, remarked the court. 
 Cassar had a drug problem which he failed to “actively” address.
 In light of all considerations, the court declared him guilty and condemned him to a six-and-a-half-year effective jail term and confiscation of €5,000 out of his bail bond.
 The accused was also ordered to reimburse the victim €2,000 for his car that was damaged beyond repair, €2,000 for the damages caused to the residence and a further €2,646.98 in court expert expenses. 
 The court also placed Cassar under a 3-year restraining order and a treatment order. 
 Inspectors Mario Xiberras and Jeffrey Scicluna prosecuted.

Man remanded in custody after Bormla arson,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/131182/man_remanded_in_custody_after_bormla_arson_,12-09-2024,004120.png,"A textbook police investigation has resulted in a man being charged with arson in connection with the destruction of a vehicle in Bormla.
 Gypsum installer Joshua Gatt, 35, from Tarxien was arraigned under arrest before magistrate Rachel Montebello on Thursday, accused of arson and wilful damage to property.
  Police inspector Jeffrey Scicluna, prosecuting together with inspector Mario Xiberras, told the court how they had identified the defendant as a suspect. CCTV gathered in inquiry showed an individual spreading a liquid over the vehicle that was then set alight, but the arsonist’s features were not visible.
 But a closer examination of the footage showed that, while the suspect had arrived at the scene in a Peugeot, he had left it in a SsangYong. This fact led the police to suspect that the vehicles he used might have been taxis.
 Further checks had confirmed that two bookings had been made using the Bolt taxi platform at the same time and place, for a user by the name of Joshua Gatt.
 After discovering that there was only one person in Malta with that name, the police had arrested Gatt.
 Before interrogation the suspect had initially refused to consult with a lawyer, but had changed his mind during questioning, the court was told.
 Gatt, who was assisted by lawyer Roberto Spiteri, pleaded not guilty to the charges.
 The defence’s request for bail was objected to by prosecutor Joseph Azarov, on the basis of the early stage of proceedings, together with the gravity of crime, as well as the risk of Gatt tampering with evidence and the fact that five civilian witnesses still had to testify.
 Besides this, there was also an objection on the grounds of trustworthiness as Gatt also had several previous convictions for theft.
 Investigations showed that he had acute drug addiction problems, explained the prosecutor.
 Inspector Scicluna added that the police were still actively investigating the possibility that other people were also involved in the crime.
 Spiteri pointed out that his client was not being charged with recidivism and argued that there were no factors which merited Gatt’s continued detention.
 The lawyer conceded, when asked by the court, that Gatt had a drug dependency problem and said that the defendant would submit to being shadowed by a social worker.
 The court, however, said that it could not fail to take into account the seriousness of Gatt’s alleged crimes, adding that in this context, his dependency on drugs had a negative impact on his chances for bail. The request was denied, with the court ordering Gatt be remanded in custody.
 The magistrate upheld the prosecution’s request for a protection order in favour of the intended victim.  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police

 Mohammed Hamza, a 37-year-old Libyan national, was charged with attempting to place the life of his alleged victim in manifest danger but willingly stopped the attack. 
 He was also charged with causing grievous bodily harm and wilfully breaching the public peace. 
 Before he pleaded to the charges, his lawyers contested the validity of the arrest. 
 Court was told that at around 9.30am on Thursday, a man entered the Paola police station wearing a blood-stained top and with blood on his hands and face.
 He sat down in a chair and an officer asked whether he needed medical help. 
 But the man - later identified as Mohammed - replied: ""not me. Someone else"".
 The blood was not his but someone else's with whom he had just argued, the man added. 
 Meanwhile, a second report came in about a man who needed help. 
 He had been assaulted with a sledgehammer and a sharp tile layer's tool. 
 The victim told the police that he had been attacked by a ""certain Mohammed"".
 The constable at the police station, acting under instructions of a sergeant, informed Mohammed that he was under arrest, explained prosecuting Inspector Keith Rizzo. 
 The duty magistrate was informed of the arrest at 11am.
 The defence pounced on that information to challenge the validity of the arrest citing article 355AD(i) of the Criminal Code.
 ""The law speaks clearly,"" argued lawyer Jacob Magri. 
 In case of voluntary attendance at a police station, the arrest must be authorised by an inspector and the duty magistrate must be informed ""immediately"", he added.
 The prosecuting inspector said he had been told of the arrest ""within minutes"".
 But after hearing further submissions, the court, presided over by Magistrate Leonard Caruana, declared that the arrest was not in line with the law. 
 The accused was released from arrest. 
 He then pleaded not guilty. 
 The court upheld a request for a protection order in favour of the victim. 
 In view of the gravity of the charges, the fact that the victim was still to testify and the risk of absconding, the court upheld the prosecution's request for conditions to be imposed on the accused, although there was no bail.
 The court ordered the accused not to approach any prosecution witnesses, to attend all court sittings, not to abscond and to bind himself under a personal guarantee of €3,000.

 Jobe had been stopped by law enforcement at the Malta International Airport on October 11, 2022, upon his arrival on a flight from Bologna, Italy.
 A search of his suitcase had revealed it to contain 6kg of cannabis, with an estimated street value of between €60,000 and €168,000.
  In his considerations on punishment, Mr. Justice Neville Camilleri took a number of factors into consideration, particularly the amount of drugs involved, its value as indicated by a court-appointed expert and Jobe’s role and awareness of what he had been doing.
 Noting that punishment for the offences Jobe was accused of carried a term of imprisonment for life, the court said a life sentence would not be appropriate in view of the circumstances of the case, especially taking into account the accused’s admission of guilt before the Court of Magistrates.

 Twenty witnesses - representatives from Malta-registered banks - were heard in under an hour.
 The witnesses had been summonsed to confirm whether the banks they represented held any accounts registered to Kasco Engineering Company Ltd or MTrace PLC, either presently or in the past, and for eighteen of them, the answer was ‘no’.

 It emerged that MTrace had banked with BOV from January 2016 to December 2023, while Kasco Engineering Co Ltd held five active accounts with the bank. Statements for the accounts for the duration of the companies’ relationship with the bank were exhibited. Mtrace had never opened or operated any accounts at HSBC, the court was told, but Kasco Engineering Co Ltd held five HSBC accounts since 2004.

"'I am ready to go prison for my son,' Daniel Meli's mother tells court",maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/132487/i_am_ready_to_go_prison_for_my_son_daniel_melis_mother_tells_court,27-11-2024,004206.png,"Magistrate Leonard Caruana told Daniel Joe Meli’s mother that she’s “putting [her] neck under the axe for him” after she declared that she was ready to act as guarantor for him.

 Caruana warned the mother of Daniel Joe Meli that she could face serious consequences if she acts as his guarantor, after defence lawyers requested his release on bail following his eight-month arrest for allegedly selling illegal malware on the dark web.

 Defence lawyers Arthur Azzopardi and Franco Debono requested Meli’s release from his arrest and explained that, at this stage, all the evidence has been collected and has been preserved for a number of months.

 The defence also declared that, if the Court grants him provisional release, his parents, who were present in the Courtroom, were ready to act as guarantors for him and even welcome him back to their home. The defence further asked the Court to take into consideration that Meli has been arrested for eight months and that, during that time, the law regarding extradition has been amended.

 Despite this, the prosecution still insisted that Meli should be kept in custody due to the fear of escape and tampering of evidence. The prosecution said that Meli allegedly worked with around 500 clients and posted on social media to audience of around 8,000 people, while also claiming that he has strong contacts with other jurisdictions, which would make it easy for Meli to flee Malta.

 The Court explained to Meli’s parents that, in case their son violates the conditions of the Court, they will be held responsible for him. When the magistrate asked the mother if she understood the burden of this guarantee, she said that her fear is that the Court will ask her for an amount of money that she does not have. Meli’s mother, however, said that “I am ready to go prison for my son”.

 “You will put your neck under an axe for him,” Magistrate Leonard Caruana said while informing the parties that the decision will be given later by a decree of the Court.

 Daniel Joe Meli, 28, from Haż Żabbar, is accused of selling illegal malware on the dark web and in connection with mentoring services on a so-called hack forum.

Lawyers insist human rights apply in extradition request,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/lawyers-insist-human-rights-apply-extradition-request.1096688,13-08-2024,004212.png,"Fundamental human rights must be considered by the courts in extradition proceedings, a young man fighting extradition to the United States has insisted.
 Daniel Joe Meli, 27, is legally contesting an extradition request by US authorities after FBI investigations linked him to alleged sales of malware on the dark web between December 2012 and June 2022.
 A Grand Jury at the District Court in Georgia issued a bill of indictment in respect of Meli in December 2023.
 Following the extradition request, arrest warrants were issued by the Maltese courts for the police to investigate Meli for alleged computer misuse and for his arrest. 
 Meli was arraigned in February and initially consented to the extradition, invoking the rule of speciality which meant that he could only face prosecution for the offences mentioned in the extradition request. 
 However, after engaging new lawyers, Meli set up a legal challenge to his surrender to the United States, arguing that the Magistrates’ Court had not verified whether he was medically fit and capable of understanding what he was consenting to. 
 He first filed an appeal before the Court of Criminal Appeal, asking that court to allow him to produce evidence to prove that he was not in the right state of mind when consenting to extradition.  When that was turned down, he filed constitutional proceedings wherein he summoned a long line of medical professionals who testified about his psychological problems, his long-term substance abuse and social anxiety.
 The First Hall, Civil Court in its constitutional jurisdiction was to assess whether Meli had validly consented to the extradition. Yet when delivering judgment, that court concluded that fundamental rights considerations, particularly the right to a fair hearing, did not apply in extradition proceedings. 
 The court also ruled that Meli lacked victim status. 
 Meli has now appealed that decision before the Constitutional Court. 
 His lawyers pleaded that extradition laws were meant to ensure that all guarantees were judicially verified so that the surrender of a wanted person was not reduced to a merely ‘political’ process, argued Meli’s lawyers.
 ""It is inconceivable to argue that the right to a fair hearing is not to be taken into consideration in extradition cases which are equivalent to other criminal proceedings,"" lawyer Franco Debono said. 
 There was a whole line of judgments which upheld this argument, the latest being that delivered on Monday in the case of the Romanian prince, he observed.
 Citing that decision by Madam Justice Edwina Grima, Meli’s lawyers said that extradition laws must always be interpreted in line with fundamental human rights. 
 And since the alleged breach of that right affected Meli personally, then the appellant had victim status, argued his lawyers requesting the court to uphold the appeal. 
 Lawyers Franco Debono, Arthur Azzopardi and David Chetcuti Dimech are assisting Meli.

"‘Justice has prevailed’ - victim's mother says, as driver is convicted",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/justice-prevailed-victim-mother-says-driver-convicted.1093020,25-05-2024,004230.png,"The mother of Johanna Boni, who was killed in a horrific accident in 2016 said her faith in justice has been restored after the truck driver involved in the crash was convicted of the crime on appeal. 
 A judge overturned the acquittal of Carmel Cauchi, then 53, the driver of a heavily loaded left-hand drive truck, declaring him responsible for the accident that claimed Boni’s life on January 5, 2016, in Labour Avenue, Naxxar.
 Madam Justice Edwina Grima ruled that the evidence was diametrically contrary to the first court’s conclusion.
 Cauchi was found guilty of criminal negligence in causing Boni’s death and failing to keep a proper lookout. He was handed a six-month suspended jail term and disqualified from obtaining a driving licence for three months. He was also ordered to pay just over €2,100, representing half the court expenses.
 The judgment was welcomed by Boni’s parents, Josephine and Pippo, who said that justice had prevailed.
 “Justice prevailed! For once I can say I'm proud to be Maltese! I had lost faith in the Maltese justice but I was proved wrong!,” she told Times of Malta in a first reaction.
 She said the appeals court saw the evidence and drew its conclusions on the evidence presented in court, which showed that her daughter had no fault in the accident since she was the most careful driver.
 “The driver was given 100 per cent of the fault for claiming Johanna's life, like it should have been in the first place,” she added.
  ""We are happy that the truth has emerged. It was not enough that they killed her but they tried shifting the blame onto her. And she wasn't here to defend her name so we did it for her. We were never after the pound of flesh. All we wanted was for the truth to emerge and it did,"" she said. 
 The first court, presided over by Magistrate Nadine Lia, had ruled that it was a miscalculated manoeuvre by the motorcyclist when she tried to overtake the heavy vehicle that had contributed to the fatal impact.
 However, the appeals court ruled that the first court could have never reached that conclusion based on the evidence presented in court. 
 “Based on the evidence produced, the court believes that contrary to what was stated by the first court. [Cauchi] did not maintain the attention required by every driver… especially since he was driving a left-hand drive truck and therefore had to maintain a higher level of attention and diligence,” Madam Justice Grima ruled in her judgment.
 This accident could have been completely avoided or had less serious consequences had Cauchi seen Boni had he looked into the side mirror rather than focusing on the road ahead, the court ruled.
 An eyewitness recounted seeing the heavy truck moving slowly in the opposite direction, a motorcycle stuck to its front.
 “I don’t think he [truck driver] realised he had run over the bike and rider,” recalled the witness, who was also an architect.
 The victim’s body ended up some 28 metres away from the spot where the truck came to a standstill after dragging the motorcycle along with it.
 Scratch marks along the road surface were caused by the bike as it was dragged along.
 Madam Justice Grima concluded that Cauchi was to blame for the fatal accident. Although there was contributory negligence on the part of the victim, the driver should have kept a proper lookout.

 34-year-old detention officer, Charlotte Casha, is suing the state and the Police Commissioner after a distressing police raid on her home. Her Court application describes how she had been asleep, topless in her bed, when four male officers broken down the front door of her penthouse at around 6am on 12 August 2024. 

                     After the officers, from the police Special Intervention Unit (SIU), forced their way into her residence, they entered her bedroom and, without explanation, pulled her from bed, turned her to face the wall, and restrained her hands with plastic ties before leading her into the living room. 

 The bewildered woman who had been sleeping in a state of undress, was left topless in the presence of the male officers for 20 minutes until two senior officers, including a woman, arrived, instructing the team to release her and end the wrongful arrest.

 Casha alleged that the officers failed to follow protocol by neither confirming her identity nor presenting an arrest warrant. She later discovered that the raid had targeted a different individual residing in the flat below hers. 

 She subsequently filed a complaint with the police’s Professional Standards Unit, but her claim was dismissed, with officials maintaining that the officers had acted on ""reasonable suspicion.""

 The woman described her experience as humiliating and deeply distressing, mentioning both the physical force used to enter her home and the disregard shown for her dignity. She claims, due to emotional and psychological distress, that the trauma from the incident led her to leave her job as a detention officer, where she worked with vulnerable detainees. 

 Casha has taken her case to the constitutional courts, arguing that her rights to protection against arbitrary arrest and degrading treatment were violated. She is seeking damages for both financial and non-financial losses and requests further court measures to uphold her fundamental rights.

No Deposit Cars' 'pointless' appeal against upholding of customer's mistreatment claim dismissed,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/131072/no_deposit_cars_pointless_appeal_against_upholding_of_customers_mistreatment_claim_dismissed,07-09-2024,004251.png,"An appeal filed by No Deposit Cars, a company with a well-earned reputation for fleecing its customers, was dismissed earlier this week, in a stinging judgement in which an additional fine was also imposed.
 No Deposit Cars had filed court proceedings against one former customer in November 2019, claiming that the defendant had only paid one instalment of €300 against the €18,000 purchase price for a Citroen C3. After sending several reminders to keep up with the repayments on the hire-purchase agreement, the company informed the purchaser that it would be taking the car back and had done so several months later.
  In his sworn reply to the application, the defendant customer explained that he had, voluntarily and without prompting, returned the vehicle to the company himself, because he had found the car to have considerable damage and latent defects. 
 In September 2023, the First Hall of the Civil Court presided by Judge Toni Abela had upheld the defendant’s argument that the hire-purchase contract on which No Deposit Cars were basing their claim was illegal on the grounds that it constituted a deceptive commercial practice in terms of the Consumer Affairs Act.
 The First Hall also established that the vehicle in question had in fact been sold again in November 2021, and that the second buyer had paid €5,800 for it  - which was also never refunded to that buyer.
 “A businessman must act fairly and not milk a situation to the buyer’s expense. Profit must be commensurable to that being provided, otherwise it would be a contract of exploitation and not of sale,” read the court judgement in that case. 
 Two employees of No Deposit Cars: Luke Milton and  Thorne Mangion (both of whom are facing criminal charges in separate proceedings), had testified that the customer had made several empty promises about honouring his payments.
 But the court observed that the defendant had given a more credible account of what happened. He had testified to having visited the No Deposit Cars offices in Ħal-Farruġ, where he had spoken to Milton about the damaged vehicle, telling him that the company had to pay for its repairs.
 “At that moment he changed his tune completely and I had informed him that I would not be paying further instalments unless they repaired the vehicle. In fact I had even sent them a letter on July 5 2019 to tell them all this...” the man said.
 The company’s lawyer then wrote back to tell the customer that he had bought the car tale quale, meaning ‘in the condition it was in’. Three months later, still with no repairs to the vehicle, Milton had texted the man again, offering to swap the car with another, older, model for the same price.  The First Hall remarked that it was “amazed at how [in his testimony,] Luke Milton did not even remember the messages that he had sent,” which had been exhibited in the acts of the case.
 A court expert had examined the car and declared that it was not roadworthy. It had collision damage to the bumper, passenger door and side mirror, mismatched tyres, as well as incorrect repairs to the bodywork that could affect the safety of its occupants. “Proper attention needs to be given to the mechanical and braking system of the vehicle to ensure proper functioning,” his report adds.
 The court deciding the case at first instance said that it was convinced that at the moment of sale, the company had been aware of the fact that the car had been involved in a collision and had a number of defects, which was why the contract it issued had expressly excluded any warranty for latent defects and forced the hirerto give up other statutory consumer rights, leaving no avenue for a claim to be made against the company. “Our law is built on good faith,"" ruled the judge, ""No business enjoys immunity from the principle of ‘fraus omnia corrumpit. [fraud renders the entire contract invalid]” In a judgement handed down on September 3, the Court of Appeal, presided by Chief Justice Mark Chetcuti together with judges Christian Falzon Scerri and Josette Demicoli, dismissed No Deposit Cars' appeal. quoting case law which had established that the simple fact that the phrase “tale quale” featured in a contract does not release the seller from his obligation to provide a guarantee for the object being sold.
 “The vendor company hid an important fact and didn’t stop there, but added a disclaimer against any responsibility for the car. This is deception and a blatant abuse of the defendant consumer,” reads the judgement.
 The fact that the car being sold was already used does not absolve the seller from the necessity of selling a car that is fit for use, said the judges. “Certainly this does not give him the right to sell an object that can barely be used at all.”
 The defendant’s failure to continue paying for a car, which he had already paid the road licence and insurance for, was not a capricious one, the court said, “but a reaction to the empty promises of the appellant company.”
 “The Court cannot fail to express its surprise at how the appellant company accepted the return of the car from the defendant….proceeded to sell it on to third parties and yet persisted in its legal action, despite the contract being dissolved when it accepted to take the car back.” The company had also hidden the fact that the car had been sold again, and this had only been revealed because the defendant happened to spot the vehicle on the road, being driven by a third party.
 In closing, the court pointed out that the company had got off lightly when the court of first instance had not imposed the financial penalties for infringements contemplated by the Consumer Affairs Act, despite being found guilty of engaging in unfair commercial practices. “But instead of repenting from its deceptive behaviour and accepting the judgement at first instance, the company used these appeal proceedings to add to the stress and unnecessary bother to the consumer.
 ""It is fitting therefore that the appellant company be condemned to pay additional costs according to law for filing this pointless appeal which was obviously not going to lead it anywhere,” ruled the Court of Appeal, ordering the company to pay an additional fine of €1,000.

Alleged Daphne bomb supplier Jamie Vella files 10th bail application,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/alleged-daphne-bomb-supplier-jamie-vella-files-10th-bail-application.1094644,28-06-2024,004252.png,"A lawyer for one of the men accused of supplying the bomb that killed Daphne Caruana Galizia has blamed “a group of people with vested interests” for forcing the Attorney General to continue opposing bail for his client, who has spent three and a half years in preventive custody. 
 While Madam Justice Edwina Grima continued to hear pre-trial pleas in the case against Jamie Vella, Geroge Degiorgo and the Maksar brothers Adrian and Robert Agius, Vella made a fresh case for bail. This is his tenth request to date. 
 The men are facing criminal charges for their alleged involvement in the assassination of the journalist, as well as in the murder of lawyer Carmel Chircop, who was shot dead in the doorway of his Birkirkara garage in  2015. 
 Appearing for Vella on Friday, lawyer Ishmael Psaila said in similar cases, such as that of Aleksandar Stojanovic, murder suspects had been given bail after being in preventive custody for long periods. 
 The only thing that was different for Vella, Psaila argued passionately, is “who the parte civile is” and said that there are a “group of people with vested interests” who force the AG’s hand to continue to object to bail. 
 The prosecution, he said, continues to insist that bail cannot be granted due to the gravity of the charges and public disorder, however forgets that Vella is still presumed innocent. 
 The police commissioner himself had said that investigations into Caruana Galizia’s murder had been concluded, the lawyer went on to say, adding that when he was first questioned, Vella had even been granted police bail, which had been renewed frequently and even expanded to allow him to travel.
 “Had Jamie Vella intended to tamper with evidence or abscond, he had all the time in the world to do so. But on the doorstep of a truly unprecedented trial, the AG continues to object to bail and tell us that this is not the right time,” Psaila said.
 “This time, they tell us it on the grounds of public disorder. But in this case, whatever we say there is a group of people out there who have a vested interest in this outcome and this is why his hands are tied and he must continue to object to bail. It is a total injustice.” 
 AG Godwin Cini rebutted that the case at hand shows evidence of several elements of organised crime and for which European jurisprudence justified continued detention. 
 With regards to the issue of public order, he said that this was not something the defence had simply cooked up, but which the court itself had commented on. 
 Reading from a constitutional reference, Cini said that the Caruana Galizia murder had rocked not only Malta but countries overseas as well. 
 Given this, he said that the time remains inopportune for the granting of bail. 
 “We must see the course of justice through, no matter where it may lead us,” he said. 
 Judge Grima is expected to issue a decree on the matter from the chambers. 
 On Friday the judge meanwhile granted a request by the defendants to have a copy of testimony given by Melvin Theuma and Vince Muscat so that they may be exhibited in separate civil proceedings.
 Lawyer Alfred Abela said that police inspector Keith Arnaud had testified that Muscat had given evidence before an inquiry that he claimed was not in their case file.
 He further claimed this was being withheld from his clients by the inquiring magistrate of the recently reopened inquiry. 
 Grima upheld the request and ordered the registrar to file a request asking permission from the inquiring magistrate to exhibit copies of the Daphne Caruana Galizia inquiry.
 She also ordered the transcripts of testimonies given by Muscat and Theuma in the case against Alfred and George Degiorgio to be exhibited.

 Scicluna is a board member of a high-level national coordinating committee on combatting money laundering and terrorist financing. 
 Other board members include Attorney General Victoria Buttigieg and Police Commissioner Angelo Gafà. 
 Scicluna is set to face trial over fraud and misappropriation charges linked to the privatisation of three public hospitals in 2015. 
 Other former top government officials, including ex-prime minister Joseph Muscat, have been charged with money laundering in connection with the hospitals deal. 
 All involved deny wrongdoing. 
 Committee chairperson Paul Zahra told Times of Malta that Scicluna “is relinquishing his role” on the committee’s board. 
 He has already been axed by the government from the MFSA’s board of governors. 
 Scicluna also “suspended” himself as Central Bank governor last week, in a compromise deal with Prime Minister Robert Abela, who had initially threatened to sack him. 
 The deal means Scicluna will continue to receive a salary of €69,000, after agreeing to the suspension on half-pay. 
 Scicluna says he was prepared to go to the European Court of Justice to fight any attempt to remove him as governor, and only agreed to step aside temporarily “until I clear my name”. 
 “Had the prime minister relieved me of my duties, I would have resorted to the European Court of Justice and had I won I would probably have been refunded my lost income.
 “I will step aside only for the time being, but I will remain governor until the end of my term,” he said. Scicluna was finance minister when the government handed over the running of the St Luke’s, Karin Grech and Gozo hospitals to Vitals Global Healthcare in 2015. The contract was taken over by Steward Health Care in 2018, only to be annulled on fraud grounds last year. 
 A year-long magisterial inquiry concluded government officials like Muscat, his chief of staff Keith Schembri and ex-minister Konrad Mizzi were complicit in money laundering and corruption. 
 Scicluna and ex-health minister Chris Fearne were among a second category of officials charged with fraud.

 On 13 November 2024, proceedings continued with the testimony of Miroslava Milenović, a court-appointed Forensic Accountant Expert.

                     Upon being questioned about how she was appointed as an expert in the enquiry, Milenović replied that she did not apply for this work, recalling that her appointment happened sometime in 2018.

 Further to this, she went into detail on which investigation methods she used, stating that she used “by-book investigations”, such as analysis on the accounts, relationship, bank statements, and other relevant documents.

 “I was looking at the big picture”, Milenović stated. 

 In a previous sitting, former prime minister Joseph Muscat’s defence lawyers, along with other defendants in the Vitals corruption case, raised concerns over the impartiality of financial crime expert Samuel Sittlington, appointed to assist in the Vitals inquiry. 

 Sittlington, who has a background in economic crime, faced intense questioning over his qualifications and alleged conflicts of interest. Defence lawyers highlighted issues such as his involvement in organising inquiry documents, alleged past dealings with law enforcement, and details on his LinkedIn profile, as potential challenges to his credibility. However, the court dismissed motions questioning his integrity, noting that formal recusal procedures must be addressed in the appropriate jurisdiction.

 When probed on the relevance of the statements made in her report on offshore companies being opened in Panama and New Zealand, Milenović said on Wednesday that she was under the impression that such decisions were acceptable in Malta. “That’s why I listed the companies in the ‘important section’.”

 “If any report made any huge difference to me, it was a national audit report,” she remarked.

 Milenović went on to talk about how her report was sectioned, saying she mentioned different levels of corruption in her report. She added that when one has an inquiry, case or investigation, one would need to describe the methods and assumptions made in order to prove or disprove the concept. “That’s the process of an inquiry” she remarked.

 Milenović was questioned on the reasoning behind mentioning Malta Enterprise in her report, to which she stated that there were a few documents at the start of the inquiry which she was not able to reach.

 Milenović said that she couldn’t find a due diligence report, adding that, for her, “the role of Malta Enterprise in the due diligence process was unclear.”

 During the cross-examination, Lawyer Vince Galea, representing former premier Joseph Muscat, requested she provide a list of her qualifications, such as a CV, which Milenović provided during the proceeding.

 Whilst Galea was making questions, both the Court and Milenović disputed over the relevance of such questions, leading to Milenović postulating: “I came here because I was asked to come here. This is a time of humiliation for me”.

 In a related case, Milenović had also been asked similar questions, where, since she was a one of the court-appointed experts on that case, she was questioned about her qualifications for the role.

 In answering a question posed by Galea, Milenović confirmed that after having studied for a five months accountancy course, she had become an accountant. She said that after the course she obtained an ACCA diploma. She further explained how her master's degree in political science, financing of terrorism and money laundering did not include any study-units on accountancy.

 Milenović acknowledged that she does not currently hold a warrant to practice as an accountant, though she had one in the past. In recent years, she has shifted her focus from practicing accountancy to providing training. 

 When concluding the cross-examination Milenović was asked why she had not disclosed her lack of an active warrant to the inquiring magistrate who appointed her as a forensic accountant, with her promptly responding that she is “an accountant.”

 The three former government officials and others were charged two weeks ago with serious crimes in connection with the government’s fraudulent hospitals deal with Vitals Global Healthcare.
  Magistrate Rachel Montebello heard witnesses and many legal submissions as the compilation of evidence against the disgraced former Prime Minister, his former energy and health minister Konrad Mizzi, and former chief of staff Keith Schembri, as well as 12 other individuals and nine companies, continued on Thursday. All of the defendants are denying wrongdoing.
 Police Inspector Wayne Borg, who was only involved in the latter stages of the investigation, took the witness stand in today’s sitting. In what felt like a never-ending loop of similar questions and answers, it emerged that the police had not carried out investigations of their own. Neither had the police questioned the suspects before issuing the charges.
  Inspector Borg made it clear that the police had simply relied on the inquiring magistrate’s conclusions when charging the suspects, repeating the mantra-like refrain an alarming number of times.
 From the witness stand, Inspector Borg also repeated several times that he had not seen the contents of the 78 boxes of evidence, but had instead, relied solely on the magistrate’s proces verbal as a basis for charging the suspects.
 The police and Attorney General’s decision to rely on the inquiry, alone, before pressing charges in such an unprecedented, important and politically-delicate case, against defendants of such prominence, is very hard to explain away as a simple oversight or a mistake borne of inexperience.
 The Attorney General and the Commissioner of Police, who the court was told, had instructed police inspector Wayne Rodney Borg and his predecessor not to carry out any investigations of their own, appear to have done the absolute minimum possible at law and had - whether knowingly or unknowingly is yet to be seen - potentially sabotaged the prosecution’s case.
 The sitting was adjourned to next week.

"Man jailed for 19 months for stealing a ladder, breaching bail ",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/man-imprisoned-19-months-stealing-ladder-breaching-bail.1101264,20-11-2024,004334.png,"A 38-year-old man was handed a 19-month prison sentence on Wednesday after he admitted to stealing a ladder that was tied on top of a van.
 The theft took place on October 30 between 3am and 6am.
 Michael Spiteri, from Żabbar, was accused of stealing the ladder, breaching bail conditions imposed on him in a previous case, and recidivism.
 He immediately admitted the charges in court and owned up to the fact that he had committed the theft to get money for drugs.
 Magistrate Leonard Caruana said he was finding Spiteri guilty on his admission and considered that, given it was not the first time that the accused had a brush with the law, an effective jail term would be appropriate.
 “In these circumstances, the court will see to it that that the sentence nonetheless skews towards the minimum, given that it is very clear this theft was motivated by the accused’s drug problem,” Caruana said.
 He sentenced the accused to a 19-month effective prison sentence and ordered him to follow a drug rehabilitation program while in prison.
 Spiteri was also ordered to pay €185 to the owner of the ladder.
 The court ordered that €50 be confiscated from a personal guarantee he had been bound to in a separate case.

"Chris Fearne, Edward Scicluna likely to face lesser charges over Vitals deal",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/chris-fearne-edward-scicluna-likely-face-lesser-charges-vitals-deal.1091866,05-04-2024,004342.png,"Chris Fearne, Edward Scicluna and three top civil servants will likely be charged with crimes related to the Vitals hospitals deal, Times of Malta is informed.
 The five are believed to be within a second tier of suspects eyed for criminal prosecution. While not suspected of having played leading roles in the fraudulent deal, they are understood to have come under scrutiny.
 Fearne, currently EU Funds Minister, took over the hospitals concession when Konrad Mizzi resigned from cabinet in 2019. Scicluna, currently Central Bank Governor, was Finance Minister at the time of the deal.
 While Scicluna, 77, is at the twilight of his working career, the same cannot be said of Fearne, who is Malta's nominee to become an EU Commissioner later this year. 
 The prospect of facing criminal charges will still shock both men: neither was singled out for any blame by a National Audit Office investigation into the deal, and they barely featured in documents filed as part of a civil court case that led to the deal being annulled. 
 In a Facebook post, Fearne said he still had no indication about the details of the inquiry and insisted there was nothing that could cause him embarrassment. 
 Fearne recalled serious anonymous allegations had similarly surfaced last year and the police had concluded there were no grounds for any criminal action. 
 ""I have no doubt there will be the same conclusions this time around. I have never broken any law or ministerial ethics,"" the minister said, pointing out, however, that he could only speak on his behalf. 
 Sources said Fearne called for a vote of confidence from fellow Labour MPs on Thursday afternoon, insisting that he ""never took a penny"" from the hospitals' deal.
 Fearne told MPs he had no problem stepping down from his post but the parliamentary group unanimously backed him. 
 Speaking on Friday, Prime Minister Robert Abela appeared to back his deputy, saying he, not a magistrate, would decide who should resign from political office. 
 Scicluna was unavailable for comment.  
 Times of Malta is, at this stage, not naming the civil servants likely to face criminal charges.
 Lawyers at the Attorney General’s office are currently poring over a magisterial inquiry into the deal that was concluded last week.
 The inquiry was tasked with assessing whether Joseph Muscat or any of his ministers involved in the deal had committed crimes in negotiating, approving or managing it.
 Its contents remain secret, but sources say Joseph Muscat, Konrad Mizzi and Keith Schembri are among those suspected of having committed money laundering-related offences. Muscat has gone on record saying that he has “no doubt” he  will face criminal charges, saying the inquiry is politically motivated. Mizzi and Schembri have not spoken publicly.  
 The hospitals deal handed three state hospitals - St Luke's, Karin Grech and Gozo General Hospital - to Vitals Global Healthcare and subsequently Steward Health Care to run.
 It was mired in controversy from the start, and a National Audit Office investigation concluded that Vitals should have been barred from bidding for the contract from the outset.
 In 2023, a court annulled the deal altogether, following a civil case filed by former Opposition leader Adrian Delia. The court concluded that Vitals -and later Steward - did not fulfil their contractual obligations, that the deal was tainted by fraud and that top government officials had colluded against the national interest to approve it.
  In parallel to that case, Magistrate Gabriella Vella was leading the inquiry concluded last week. With the probe now concluded, it is up to attorney general lawyers to decide whether to file criminal charges against anyone involved.
 Prime Minister Robert Abela says he would like the attorney general to publish the inquiry’s conclusions. But Abela has also sought to leverage the inquiry for political gain: he has publicly accused the magistrate who led it of being part of an “establishment” that is out to damage Labour and said citizens would “scrutinise the judiciary” through their vote on June 8.
 Polls suggest Labour enjoys a massive 10-point lead over the Nationalist Party and will win by up to 28,000 votes.

"Court says PBS, Broadcasting Authority breached PN's human rights after not airing Sofia inquiry parliament vote",maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/129072/court_says_pbs_broadcasting_authority_breached_pns_human_rights_after_not_airing_sofia_inquiry_parliament_vote,08-05-2024,004343.png,"Public broadcaster PBS and its regulator, the Broadcasting Authority breached the Nationalist Party’s fundamental rights by failing to broadcast footage from inside and outside parliament when the motion calling for a public inquiry into the death of JP sofia was defeated on July 12, 2023.
 This was the substance of a judgement handed down by Mr. Justice Lawrence Mintoff, presiding the Civil Court in its Constitutional Jurisdiction earlier today. The judge ordered the BA and PBS to each pay €2,000 by way of compensation for the fundamental rights breach.
 In order to avoid any attempts to spin the decision, the judge also ordered that a “faithful summary” of the court decision be prominently broadcast on PBS, during the 8pm news bulletin, no later than a week from the day when the judgement becomes final.
  The PN had filed a judicial protest in July 2023, asking the court to condemn the actions of PBS and the BA, and to stop them from “perpetuating the censorship of anything critical against Prime Minister Robert Abela, which has persisted for years”.
 The plaintiffs claimed that PBS had refused to broadcast footage of the unprecedented scenes both inside and outside parliament on 12 July 2023, after the government had voted against a public inquiry into Sofia’s death at a construction site.
 Before that, the PN had filed a complaint with the Broadcasting Authority, which while ruling that PBS ought to have reported those events, did not order it to comply.
 This behaviour was ruled to be both discriminatory and a violation of the BA and PBS’s duties under the constitution and other laws. The failure to provide an effective remedy was also declared to breach Article 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights.
 There had been at least three instances where the BA rejected the PN’s complaints about PBS in vain. “In truth, this Court says that the only conclusion that can be drawn from all this, is the the defendant company, which has important duties as a public broadcaster, attempts to hide from the public those instances where the Authority has given a decision against it…”
 Neither had PBS provided good reasons for its actions which had led to imbalance in the reporting on a newsworthy event of considerable importance.
 Lawyer Paul Borg Olivier represented the PN in the proceedings.

"Hunter has hate speech conviction confirmed but spared €3,000 fine",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/hunter-hate-speech-conviction-confirmed-spared-3000-fine.1097378,29-08-2024,004364.png,"A hunter found guilty of inciting violence against Birdlife Malta by commenting on Facebook that “this scum” deserved “a beating,” had his conviction confirmed on appeal but was spared a €3,000 fine. 
 The alleged hate speech was flagged to the police cybercrime unit in April 2022 through an email sent by Birdlife Malta's CEO.
 Mark Sultana drew the police's attention to a comment by Stephen Micallef under a Facebook post published by Minister Clint Camilleri. The minister was commenting about Birdlife’s bid to stop hunting for turtle doves in spring.
 The environmental organisation had filed a court application for a warrant of prohibitory injunction to that effect and the civil court had provisionally upheld Birdlife’s request whilst appointing the case for hearing. 
 Minister Camilleri, responsible for the hunting portfolio, announced that court decision, saying the government had directed the State Advocate to request the court to “urgently” appoint the case for hearing.
 Among the many comments by supporters of the hunting lobby, one comment read that although there were “so many cowboys” no one had “given these people a good beating"". 
 It was “now just too much”, and “they were asking for it”, went on the comment.
 “They say that hunters are stupid... how much longer should [we] put up with these scum?” 
 Screenshots of that comment were sent to the police who pushed on with investigations even after Sultana said that he did not wish to proceed since he could no longer find the links to that post. 
 The author of that comment was tracked down and questioned by the police.
 He admitted that the comment was written by him but denied that it was aimed at Birdlife Malta. 
 Micallef insisted, even when later testifying in court, that his comment was directed against those hunters who acted in breach of hunting laws, thus placing law-abiding fellow hunters in a bad light. 
 Some days before posting that comment, a protected species was shot down and such acts harmed all hunters, Micallef sought to explain. 
 But neither the First Court nor the Court of Criminal Appeal deemed that argument credible.
 When delivering judgment upon appeal Madam Justice Natasha Galea Sciberras stated that the court firmly believed that Micallef’s comment was actually directed against Birdlife Malta.
 Taken within the context of the minister’s post, there was no doubt that Micallef’s comment was meant to convey a message that could harm or insult Birdlife’s representatives. 
 In fact, its CEO felt the need to file a police report.
 When subsequently testifying in the proceedings, Sultana explained that the comment was “worrying” in case it instigated someone “to lose common sense”.
 Micallef’s words were not simply insulting or defamatory but incited violence, observed the court.
 In a tense climate where hunters were at loggerheads with Birdlife Malta over the spring hunting issue, Micallef’s words breached the criminal code and electronic communications regulations. 
 While confirming the conviction, the court said that in this case, the defendant was to be punished only for the more serious offence which was punishable with a term of imprisonment. 
 Thus while confirming the six-month jail term suspended for three years, the court partially upheld the appeal by cancelling the €3,000 fine.

Police officer acquitted of raping colleague to be retried,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/129324/police_accused_of_raping_colleague_to_be_retried,22-05-2024,004391.png,"A former police officer who, last March, was acquitted of raping a colleague at the Msida police station is to undergo a retrial, after three judges presiding the Court of Criminal Appeal declared that his acquittal had been affected by a “grave irregularity” during the trial, which had led to justice not being served. 
 The police officer, whose name is subject to a court-imposed publication ban, had been accused of raping one female colleague and sexually harassing another. The court had been told that he had engineered his shift patterns to better his chances of ending up alone with the victim at the Msida police station. Prosecutor Angele Vella had told the Criminal Court, presided by Madame Justice Consuelo Scerri Herrera, that the man had felt ‘untouchable’ and able to do anything because he was in uniform.
 But in March, the judge had acquitted the man of rape, after expunging the first statement he released to interrogators, in which he had admitted to the crime.  The judge ruled that the statement was inadmissible as evidence because he had been administered the wrong caution by his interrogators - his lawyers having claimed  that before questioning started, he had been warned that inferences could be drawn from any failure to reply to questions, instead of being told that he had the right to remain silent.
  In the end, the man was only found guilty of sexually harassing a second teenage colleague, for which he was handed a suspended sentence.
 In an appeal filed in June, the Attorney General urged the court to overturn the judge’s decision to acquit the defendant, arguing that his confession had been expunged from the acts in an irregular manner and that the judge had made inappropriate comments, observations and inferences about the victim in her conclusions. The AG argued that the Criminal Court had made a “manifestly incorrect application of the law,” in conclusion that in order for the offence of rape to subsist, the victim must have resisted sexual intercourse, “and this when the element [of resistance] is not needed at law, because the lack of consent suffices for the finding of guilt.”
 That appeal was upheld this morning by the Court of Criminal Appeal, presided by Chief Justice Mark Chetcuti, Madam Justice Edwina Grima and Mr. Justice Giovanni Grixti.
 The judges observed that before his first questioning session, the defendant confirmed that he had been given a copy of his legal rights and that he had the right not to reply to questions and that what he chose to say would be used as evidence in court. He had been assisted by a lawyer all the while and at the bottom of the statement was a warning that the court could draw inferences from any facts he might state in court but which he had not declared during interrogation.
 In addition, the defendant himself had declared that he had been given the right to remain silent and that anything he said could be used as evidence against him, as well as that he had consulted with and was accompanied by a lawyer before starting the statement.
 The appeal court judges ruled that the way the defence had raised the plea of inadmissibility of the statement “was entirely irregular and contrary to the dispositions of criminal law,” pointing out that the Criminal Code gives accused persons a 15-day timeframe to give notice of their pleas, including about admissibility of evidence.
 “This is precisely why the compilation of evidence takes place…so that the person accused would know beforehand what evidence the prosecution intended to exhibit and whether they are in conformity with the law.”
 There was no doubt that the statement which the defence sought to impugn at trial stage did not land in its lap right before, said the judges, “and neither can the defence contend that it could not have noticed it earlier, because this piece of evidence had been in the hands of the defence from the very beginning of the proceedings.”
 The Criminal Court should have first decided whether or not to permit the plea to be made at such a late stage, when the trial had almost reached its end, and then, only if that permission is granted, allow the defence to debate that point, “and this is because the guide rails for the criminal action would be shifted by this defence request, which goes against every procedural rule.”
 “But not only did the Criminal Court not follow the law of Criminal procedure, but its final decision was also not based on facts which had emerged during the trial.”
 While it was true that the date printed on the statement indicated that the caution administered was not in accordance with the law in force at the time, the Criminal Court should not have stopped there when assessing the legality of this crucial document, said the judges.  “The fact that before releasing his first statement, the defendant had been given all his legal rights is not contested. It doesn’t appear, therefore, that in the space of 24 hours, the defendant had reason to believe that the law had changed overnight and that the rule of inference had started to apply to him anew!”
 He had also consulted privately with his lawyer before, and was accompanied by his lawyer while releasing his second statement. That statement had not been recorded on video, also at the suggestion of his lawyer.
 Inspector Joseph Busuttil, who had interrogated the defendant, had testified that the incorrect date on the written statement and the wording of the caution had been the result of him using an outdated template by mistake.
 “So therefore, that which the Criminal Court should have done when faced with this request by the defence, after deciding on whether or not the plea was admissible at the advanced stage of the trial, had been to examine the evidence brought before it and not simply rest on the words written at the start of the statement, more so when it was evident that in the first place the defendant had already been administered the caution before he released his fist statement, a caution which he never contested, was assisted by his lawyer at all times and had even consulted with him privately before.”
 The defence had not felt it necessary to clarify this issue when cross-examining the prosecutors on the witness stand, but had waited for the prosecution to declare its evidence closed before raising this objection, when it was too late for the other party to contest it. 
 “The Criminal Code erred when it disregarded evidence that, as emerges from the acts of the case, had been valid evidence at law and that the defence’s contestation had been entirely unfounded.”
 “It is certainly not conducive to the correct administration of justice that a party in criminal litigation is met with a surprise request for the expunging of evidence at an advanced stage in the proceedings, when this evidence had been in its hands from the very beginning and, given every opportunity in the law to contest it, had remained silent until the moment when it would be too late for the prosecution to rebut the request.”
 “Above all, although ‘the person accused has a right to a fair hearing, this fair hearing while protecting the presumption of innocence of the person accused, must also be fair with the society which had been outraged by the crime.”
 Finally, the judges said that they could not fail to observe that if it had been true that the wrong caution had been administered, this would have been picked up by the lawyer assisting him during questioning - a right which was not in force at the time when the inference rule applied. “To this Court, it is evident…and this beyond all doubt, that the defendant had at no time been administered the caution as erroneously written down by the interrogator.""
 For these reasons, the court upheld the AG’s appeal and declared that a grave irregularity had taken place during the trial, which had effected the final verdict and had led to a failure of justice. The court revoked the Criminal Court’s decision to expunge the man’s first statement and ordered that it be readmitted in the acts of the case, which it sent back to the Criminal Court for a retrial, with the defendant remaining on bail under the same conditions he had been under before his acquittal.

Man remanded in custody after damaging villa and vehicle in Birkirkara,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/132605/man_remanded_in_custody_after_damaging_villa_and_vehicle_in_birkirkara_,04-12-2024,004398.png,"A 37-year-old man, Musah Ahmed, has been charged with entering a Birkirkara villa and causing damage to both the property and a vehicle outside.

 The incident, reported on 21 November, was captured on CCTV footage. Ahmed, who admitted his identity in the footage but claimed no recollection of events, has been remanded in custody while the case continues.

 On the day, the Birkirkara Police Station received a call from a person at around 6:30am that a person had entered the person’s villa and had caused damage.

                     Ahmed was arrested when the police arrived on the scene.

 A police inspector said that the Ahmed had caused damages to the Villa and to a vehicle outside of the villa. The inspector said he extracted footage which showed the accused damaging the villa and vehicle.

 When taken to the police station, the accused had no visible injuries, but since he used to take medication, he was taken to Mater Dei Hospital, and later to Mount Carmel Hospital.

 Ahmed was discharged on 3 December 2024, and was then arrested on the strength of an arrest warrant issued by Magistrate Abigail Critien.

 After his arrest, Ahmed was interrogated and he admitted that it was indeed him in the footage and it was him that was causing the damages.

 However, during the interrogation, he was not able to recollect the circumstances which led him to go into the residence.

 The defence requested that the Court appoints an expert psychiatrist to determine the mental state of the accused when the alleged offences were committed. 

 The prosecution objected to the appointment of a psychiatrist since the accused was discharged from Mount Carmel Hospital on 3 December and he is able to understand explanations from his lawyer.

 The Court pointed out that the accused said he can understand what is being said to him. Considering this, the Court rejected the defence’s request for a psychiatrist 

 Upon being examined, Ahmed pleaded not guilty, and the defence did not request that the accused is released on bail. 

 The man was remanded in custody.

Christian Borg pleads not guilty to money laundering and tax fraud,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/christian-borg-pleads-guilty-money-laundering-tax-fraud.1097297,27-08-2024,004420.png,"Christian Borg pleaded not guilty to money laundering and tax fraud when he was arraigned on Tuesday afternoon, alongside his girlfriend and six of his companies.
 The 31-year-old notorious car rental entrepreneur from St Julian’s and Monique Mizzi, 26, from Paola, were charged together with Princess Construction Limited, Princess Holdings Ltd, Princess Operations Limited, Zing Rental Limited, No Deposit Cars Limited and Lion Funding Limited with money laundering and criminal conspiracy. 
 Borg and the companies were further charged with evading income tax and VAT, making false declarations for tax purposes, defrauding the Tax Commissioner and making fraudulent gains to the detriment of the government. 
 Company director Joseph Camenzuli was also in court as the legal representative of Borg’s companies. 
 The court heard that criminal investigations were triggered by a request by the VAT department after Borg allegedly filed invoices for “hundreds of thousands of euros” and claimed VAT refunds on amounts classified as expenses. 
 Inspector Tonjoe Farrugia said the investigation concluded that millions had been defrauded to the detriment of the VAT department.
 The prosecution requested a freezing order over all assets of the defendants, given the money laundering charge. 
 In light of recent amendments to the law on freezing orders, the specific amount to be frozen would be indicated by the prosecution within 90 days. 
 A request for bail was objected to, at the risk of tampering with evidence.
 
 AG lawyer Francesco Refalo pointed out that a number of civilians who “unknowingly” assisted Borg in the commission of these crimes were expected to testify. 
 Although this investigation had been ongoing for several years, not all civilian witnesses had testified before the inquiring magistrate. 
 The case involved the issuing of VAT receipts and VAT unduly claimed by the defendants. 
 Defence lawyer Stephen Tonna Lowell rebutted that Borg and Mizzi had been aware of the ongoing investigation for “months if not years” and had been on police bail. They had always abided by bail conditions. 
 Moreover, Mizzi had a young son and never had any previous brush with the law. 
 After hearing submissions the court, presided over by Magistrate Elaine Rizzo, upheld the request because evidence was preserved by means of the magisterial inquiry. 
 Bail was granted under a number of conditions including a €35,000 deposit and a €60,000 personal guarantee for Borg and a €15,000 deposit and €40,000 personal guarantee for Mizzi. 
 AG lawyers Francesco Refalo, Rebekah Spiteri and Mauro Abela are prosecuting together with inspectors Robert Azzopardi and Tonjoe Farrugia. 
 Borg was thrust into the national spotlight back in 2022 when he was one of four men charged with a botched kidnapping. 
 A court heard how he and his associates allegedly threatened to torture their victim and rape his sister.  
 Borg is also a central figure in suspicious property deals involving Prime Minister Robert Abela. 
 The deal, first exposed by Times of Malta had netted Abela €45,000 but the timeline of events raises suspicions over why he entered a contract to buy a field only to transfer his stake in that contract to Borg just a few months later.
 At the time, Abela had been the Planning Authority’s legal advisor and he entered the deal only after permits had been issued to develop the plot.    
 Borg's property purchases have also raised eyebrows amongst investigators. Most of these property purchases, which include a luxury penthouse with a rooftop pool and a massive villa, were not funded by bank loans or even withdrawals from his local bank accounts.
 Times of Malta has previously reported how some of the property purchases were partly funded by  luxury car swaps.

Watch: Tourist traumatised after unprovoked attack leaves him bruised,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/watch-tourist-traumatised-unprovoked-attack-leaves-bruised.1094331,23-06-2024,004423.png,"A tourist from Germany has expressed his disappointment with the police after they downplayed an unprovoked attack in Valletta which left him suffering a punctured eardrum and facial bruising.
 What began as a normal day trip in the capital ended up with the man and his family living in “fear and trauma”, worried that such an attack could happen again.
 The incident happened in the afternoon of May 30 on Merchant Street, while the man was sightseeing with his wife, two children and friends.
 “I’ve been to many countries, and we were all excited about visiting Malta,” he said about the five-day holiday.
 The man, who wished to remain anonymous, explained that while crossing the intersection of Merchant Street and St Christopher Street, a motorcyclist “deliberately” pushed his friend.
  While his friend was shocked by the unprovoked push, she remained calm and told the aggressor he did not need to push her as there was enough space on the road.
 The attacker did not take her comments lightly. He responded aggressively, saying that if he had a truck, he would have run her over.
 Seeing the situation escalating, the man tried to intervene and calm the attacker.
 “To my surprise, he came down from his bike and started shouting at me. I told him there was no need to be loud and that we were leaving.”
 The aggression got worse, and the motorcyclist started beating the tourist on his face.
 While the man tried to move away, the victim’s wife and children started calling out for help. The female co-rider on the aggressor’s bike did nothing. Groups of people witnessed the attack, and no one intervened or called the police, he said.
 The victim’s wife captured some seconds on film before the attacker fled the scene.
 A staff member of a hotel close by called the police, where the victim described the incident, and provided the number plate of the attacker’s motorbike.
 The man claimed the police instructed them to go to the Floriana Health Centre.
  After receiving initial treatment at the health centre, they were advised to go to Mater Dei Hospital for further treatment. The man suffered from an injury in his right eye, a punctured left eardrum and overall bruising on his face.
 While at the emergency department, they found a police room and discussed the situation with the police, showing them the video.
 “One officer immediately recognised the perpetrator but informed us that we needed to go to the Valletta Police Station to make a formal report,” he said.
 At around 10pm, the family arrived at the police station and once again described the incident to the police officers.
 The victim claims two of the police officers recognised the man in the video.
 “They expressed empathy but explained that filing a report would lead to a police case potentially requiring us to return to Malta for court proceedings in the future. They advised us to consider whether we wanted to proceed with such a complex process.”
 He said he believed the police had sufficient evidence to take immediate action, especially if they claimed to know the perpetrator.
 After discussing with family members, the victim and his friend decided not to file a police report and instead returned to the hotel.
 “The next two days we lived in fear and trauma in Malta, worried this could happen again,” he said.
 “It is sad that the police, knowing this man was a criminal, did not take any action and instead were informing us of the disadvantages of filing a report,” he said.
 He said his family and friends are concerned the attacker could hurt other people.
 “We are back in Germany now, but our mental health is unstable. The doctor said it would take three months for my eardrum puncture to heal.”
 While the family is not seeking justice through legal proceedings, the man urged action to ensure the public and tourists are safe, together with an improved police response.
 “There should be a swift and proactive response from the Malta police in such situations, with a straightforward reporting system for tourists,” he said.
 “I wish to visit Malta again, but I hope that this story will bring awareness.”
 The police told Times of Malta investigations were ongoing and the perpetrator has been identified. 
 ""The police officer on duty explained that he had spoken at length with the alleged victims who opted to leave the station without filing a report when they were informed they had to testify in person in court.""

"Two suspects linked to one kilo of heroin at apartment, remanded in custody",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/two-suspects-linked-one-kilo-heroin-apartment-remanded-custody.1096571,08-09-2024,004448.png,"A former drug convict and a prison inmate landed in fresh trouble over their alleged involvement in a drug trafficking conspiracy, a court heard on Thursday.
 The two men were arraigned separately, following a police surveillance operation leading up to their arrest on Wednesday.
 Acting upon information about a suspect linked to a drug circle, police monitored one of the suspects in Kirkop.
 They watched as Christain Grech, a 42-year-old former construction worker, who was currently out on prison leave, entered an apartment block where his girlfriend lived.
 The other suspect, 43-year-old Nigerian national Ferdinand Onovo, entered the building shortly afterwards.
 When Onovo stepped out again, police approached. He was stopped and personally searched. That search gave no results but the man “seemed uncomfortable.” 
 Acting upon magisterial authorisation, police forced their way into the apartment where Grech’s girlfriend lived. 
 That was where they found the accused and a one-kilo drug package. 
 Upon arraignment, Grech pleaded not guilty to involvement in a drug trafficking conspiracy, procurement of heroin, possession of the drug under circumstances denoting that it was not intended for personal use and recidivism. 
 His lawyers, Franco Debono and Ramona Attard, did not request bail. 
 Onovo, who the police had stopped and searched outside the apartment block, was arraigned soon after. 
 Prosecuting Inspector Jonathan Cassar said that DNA tests allegedly linked Onovo to the drug discovered inside the apartment. 
 The accused, a former professional footballer now working in construction, pleaded not guilty to the same charges.
 Onovo lawyer, Charles Mercieca, did not request bail at the arraignment stage. 
 A freezing order was also issued overall assets of the accused who, like Grech, was remanded in custody. 
 Magistrate Noel Bartolo presided over the arraignments. Inspector Jonathan Cassar prosecuted.

AG appeals bail granted to man charged with attempted murder of ex-partner's daughters,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/132074/ag_appeals_bail_granted_to_man_charged_with_attempted_murder_of_expartners_daughters,31-10-2024,004450.png,"Attorney General Victoria Buttigieg has filed an urgent application appealing the bail granted to the man charged with attempting to kill his ex-partner’s two young daughters.

 The AG is arguing that bail should not have been granted to Nazzareno Dalli at this stage of proceedings.

 She said in her application that the victims and their mother are now in a state of panic knowing that Dalli is out on bail.

                     Nazzareno Dalli, also known as Ronald, who is accused of attempting to murder his ex-partner's two young daughters, has been released on bail. He denies charges of trying to kill the 12 and 15-year-old girls at a house in Triq San Tumas, Marsa, on 9 March. 

 The youngest girl survived despite being stabbed 16 times and losing 40% of her blood. Her older sister managed to escape with minor injuries after slipping past the attacker and hiding on the roof. 

 Just two hours before the alleged attack, Dalli had posted photographs on Facebook, one captioned with the word “vendetta.” He had been in a three-year relationship with the girls’ mother and allegedly spent the night before the incident drinking and taking drugs with friends. Dalli told police he has no recollection of the violent act, later stating that he loved his ex-partner’s children “like his own.” 

 The AG’s application has led to defence lawyers requesting government explain as to why government has not yet introduced electronic tagging has not yet been introduced for individuals undergoing criminal proceedings.

 The issue of electronic tagging has popped up sporadically in court over the past ten years, but so far only the prison authorities have introduced an ankle bracelet tracking system for inmates granted prison leave.

 Lawyer Franco Debono, who is representing Dalli in the proceedings, informed Madam Justice Consuelo Scerri Herrera the defence team wishes to summon a Home Affairs Ministry representative as to why the technology has not yet been introduced.

 The court quoted a constitutional court declaration that the fact the state has not yet introduced electronic tagging did not breach the accused’s fundamental human rights.

 “An accused person should not remain under preventive arrest simply because the state did not provide for it,” argued back Debono.

 The court minuted the defence’s request and the prosecution did not object.

 The case continues.

Psychiatrists conclude man behind Labour HQ explosives was in a state of psychosis,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/131296/psychiatrists_conclude_man_behind_labour_hq_explosives_was_in_a_state_of_psychosis_,20-09-2024,004479.png,"A panel of three psychiatrists have concluded that the man accused of planting an explosive device outside the Malta Labour Party’s headquarters was in a state of psychosis at the time and had told them that he had consumed home-made mephedrone and GHB.
 The compilation of evidence against 18-year-old David Brincat from Santa Venera continued before magistrate Kevan Azzopardi on Friday.
  Brincat was charged with offences related to terrorism and the illegal manufacture of explosives in connection with the discovery, last May, of an explosive device in a dustbin outside the Labour Party headquarters in Hamrun.
 In a previous sitting, lawyer Nicholas Mifsud, who is appearing for Brincat together with lawyers Mario Mifsud and Lara Attard, had asked the court to order a psychiatric evaluation of the defendant before the compilation of evidence proceeded any further.
 Today the panel of three psychiatric experts appointed by the court presented their report and described the conclusions of their joint assessment of the defendant, whom they had met with twice, in addition to discussing the youth’s medical history with his parents.
 “At the time of the offence, he was intoxicated and in a state of psychosis,” they told the court. “Our conclusion is that he is a vulnerable young man due to use of substances, mental health and neurodiversity, as he suffers from a personality disorder and autism.”
 They assessed that risk of Brincat committing further offences in future “would be high if he doesn’t receive regular outreach from a multidisciplinary team.”
 “He shows little remorse about what happened and could have happened and would require a lot of scaffolding to reintegrate into society and live independently,” the court was told.
 “Mr Brincat told us that he was consuming mephedrone which he was making himself, as well as GHB, and had been drinking a lot of alcohol at the time,” one expert told the court.
 Prosecutor Joseph Camilleri Azarov asked the panel whether this meant that the defendant had been consuming all these substances since 2023, pointing out that the alleged offences required a great deal of preparation.
 The witnesses replied that although they had only been appointed to establish his mental state at the time of the offence, there was also documentation and medical notes about hospital admissions which state that he had been abusing substances.
 The defendant’s parents had also told the panel that they had suspected he was drinking “over seven bottles of beer a day and taking mephedrone every day too.”
 In the months before his arrest, Brincat’s parents had suspected he was suffering from drug-induced psychosis. Brincat would regularly visit a number of pharmacies and was consulting with several psychiatrists, they added.
 Brincat had already been held at the Corradino Correctional Facility for over a month by the time they had been appointed to examine him which rendered drug tests useless.
 “The issue is that many substances which can be abused do not show up on urine tests, particularly synthetic drugs,” said the experts. “Our conclusion is that Brincat was suffering from substance-induced psychosis, a state of insanity probably triggered by substance abuse.”
 One of the lawyers assisting Brincat, Nicholas Mifsud, asked the panel what tests could be carried out to detect GHB and mephedrone.
 Two types of tests could be carried out in Malta: a basic urine test and a more detailed lab assessment of a urine sample. Only the basic urine test had been carried out at the time, and not the detailed urine toxicology testing.  It was too late for this test to be carried out, added the witness.
 But another panel member informed the court that another type of test existed - hair analysis - which could detect drug use for up to a year, but said that it is not available in Malta.
 The court ordered that a hair sample be taken from the defendant and tested abroad, despite its considerable cost, ordering that its results be included in the experts’ report.
 Magistrate Azzopardi explained why he felt this was necessary. “The court needs to take a decision about a serious matter and any help that science can offer will be taken. We are establishing a state of insanity… I would prefer some more certainty.”
 The case was adjourned to October 28.

 Meli, 27, is contesting in court an extradition request by US authorities after FBI investigations linked him to alleged malware sales on the dark web between December 2012 and June 2022.
 A Grand Jury at the District Court in Georgia issued a bill of indictment in respect of Meli in December 2023.
 Following the extradition request, arrest warrants were issued by the Maltese courts for the police to investigate Meli for alleged computer misuse and for his arrest. 
 Earlier this week, Meli insisted his fundamental human rights must be considered by the courts in the extradition proceedings.
 On Thursday the government - through the ministries for justice and foreign affairs - said it was ""closely monitoring the developments in the case"".
 It said in a statement it was ""essential to unreservedly respect the judicial process"", currently at the stage of a Constitutional Appeal.
 ""The government is taking into account the judgments already delivered by the Maltese courts, as well as the declarations regarding Meli’s health, considering the unique nature and legal complexities of the situation.""

Compilation of evidence against Roderick Cassar concluded,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/132593/compilation_of_evidence_against_roderick_cassar_concluded,03-12-2024,004515.png,"The compilation of evidence against Roderick Cassar has been concluded, bringing the Bernice Cilia murder proceedings one step closer to the jury stage.

 The prosecution and the defence have finished their submissions, while the parte civile stated that the victim’s family is ready to go ahead to the next phase of the proceedings. 

                     Roderick Cassar is charged with the murder of his estranged wife, Bernice Cilia, who was shot in the face and chest while she was making her way to work. Cassar’s arrest followed a standoff with the police which lasted an entire day in November 2022.

 The victim had filed five police reports against her husband for domestic violence, one of them as the day before she was murdered.

 During the compilation of evidence, the court heard that the alleged murderer phoned the victim’s father three times after the murder, telling him that he had killed his daughter.

 Further details emerged, with witnesses describing the victim as a woman who was terrified of her husband, detailing violent episodes and direct threats which finally led to the shocking murder. 

 The murder also kicked off an independent inquiry which found that a lack of resources and an increased workload were responsible for the State’s failure to protect the victim. 

 The inquiry recommended prompt police action to arrest the perpetrator when a court protection order is breached, as well as the introduction of electronic tagging, which is still yet to be implemented.     ",Matthew Farrugia ,court_and_police

 Police Inspector Omar Zammit recalled the mother filed a police report, noting that her son, who had a drug addiction problem, would ask her for money. Although she would oblige on various occasions, she ultimately could not afford to keep providing money, with this resulting in the accused shouting at and threatening her and her other son.

 Defence lawyer Jose Herrera noted that his client was not a criminal, but simply needed help.

 He furthermore pointed out that the lack of a halfway house between prison and drug rehabilitation programmes, an issue which he opined should be addressed.

Man charged after stealing cash from Valletta Food Market,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/128854/man_charged_after_stealing_cash_from_valletta_food_market_,26-04-2024,004561.png,"A man has been jailed after admitting to stealing cash from the Valletta Food Market, returning to court just over a month after being charged with the theft of historical artefacts from the Maritime Museum.
 Justin Mallia, 26, from Bormla, pleaded guilty to a charge of theft, aggravated by value, before Magistrate Victor Axiak on Friday.
 Police Inspector Gabriel Micallef, prosecuting together with Inspector Tilden Tabone, told the court that €930 in cash had been reported as stolen from the shop’s strongroom on March 14.
  CCTV footage and descriptions given by people who had been in the vicinity led to Mallia’s identification. The defendant was traced to Corradino prison, where he was being held in connection with the museum thefts.
 Mallia admitted to interrogations that he had stolen the money, which the police were unable to recover.
 The defendant pleaded guilty during his arraignment in court, confirming his admission of guilt after being given time to speak to his lawyer and reconsider.
 Lawyer Martina Herrera, assisting the defendant as legal aid counsel, requested a light punishment, a suggestion seconded by the prosecution who explained that the defendant was doing his best to return the stolen cash.
 A recidivism charge had to be dropped in view of the fact that the prosecution was unable to produce a copy of Mallia’s latest conviction, handed down on 14 December last year.
 After discussing sentencing privately with the lawyers, the court declared Mallia guilty of all charges, including those of breaching probation and recidivism, and sentenced him to imprisonment for 12 months. He was also bound to repay the stolen cash, via the police, within six months of his release from prison.  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police
Man released on bail after threatening his younger sister and terrorising his family,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/129227/man_released_on_bail_after_threatening_his_younger_sister_and_terrorising_his_family,16-05-2024,004569.png,"A man in his twenties has been released on bail after being arraigned on domestic violence charges, accused of threatening his younger sister and terrorising his family.
 The young man, who is also understood to have previously been involved in similar incidents, was accused of threatening three members of his family on 14 May, coercing them, causing them to fear violence, harassing three, with whom he also resided.
 He was also accused of attacking his sister and uttering insults and threats.
 Police Inspector Colin Sheldon, prosecuting, told the court that on 13 May, at around 10:30pm the police had received a phone call from the man’s younger sister, who reported that the defendant had grabbed her arm during an argument and that she feared for her safety.
  When contacted by the police, the man’s parents and siblings said that they were so afraid of the defendant’s behaviour that they would often lock themselves in their respective rooms and avoid communicating with him.
 When he called the man in for questioning, the inspector said he felt it would not be safe to send the man home after questioning. The man’s father, who drove the defendant to the police station, had also told him as much, said the inspector.
 The father had added that during the drive, the defendant had passed a comment about doing something to his sister, which led the Inspector to decide not to take the risk. After consulting with the magistrate on duty yesterday, an arrest warrant was issued and the defendant was taken into custody while at the Domestic Violence Unit.
 Before the start of the arraignment, presiding magistrate Monica Vella upheld a request for a ban on the publication of names of the defendant and his family, made by parte civile lawyer Charles Mercieca. The court-imposed ban prohibits the identification of the defendant or the alleged victims on any media “and includes the town in which they reside and all other connotations.”
 The defendant, who told the court that he was not employed, pleaded not guilty to the charges. Bail was requested.
 Inspector Sheldon asked the court to issue a protection order if it were to grant the man bail. Mercieca told the court that the man’s grandmother was prepared to allow him to live with her for the time being.
 Bugeja confirmed that the man was currently residing with his grandmother. If the court did not deem this acceptable, he could also live with his uncle as an alternative.
 At the end of the day, he will have bail conditions, which if he breaches, he will face even worse consequences, argued the lawyer.
 The young man’s grandmother was called to the stand after the court was told she had offered to take him in for the time being.
 Asked by the magistrate whether she thought the defendant could repeat the alleged crime to her, the woman replied that she felt it was unlikely. “I don’t think so,” the woman replied. “Even when we talk on the phone, he always tells me ‘you know that I love you nanna.’ We have always had a good relationship.”
 The magistrate released the defendant from arrest, ordering him to sign a bail book three times a week, secured by a €500 deposit and a €5,000 personal guarantee, telling him that she was doing so on the strength of his grandmother’s testimony. “God forbid I hear you did something like this to her, too.”
 Besides placing the defendant under a treatment and supervision order for the duration of the proceedings, the magistrate also issued a protection order in favour of the alleged victims and warned the man to cooperate with his probation officer.  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police
"Court orders release of man charged with human trafficking, money laundering",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/court-orders-release-man-charged-human-trafficking-money-laundering.1092857,23-05-2024,004570.png,"A magistrate has ordered the immediate release of a man charged with human trafficking and money laundering following a blunder by the prosecution.  
 Andre D’Amato, 37, from Mosta, an ICT professional and company director, was also charged with computer misuse, forgery of official documents, using forged documents, fraud and with making false declarations.
 He is pleading not guilty to the charges brought against him for crimes allegedly committed between 2018 and earlier this month.
 He was originally arraigned under arrest last week, was denied bail and remanded in custody.
 But when the case was due to be heard on Wednesday, the prosecution, led by Attorney General lawyers Ramon Bonett Sladden Andreas Vella and police inspector Karl Roberts, asked for a correction in the charge sheet because they wanted to add the money laundering charge as well as the charges related to fraud and falsification of documents.
 However, rather than correcting the charge sheet, the prosecution filed a brand new charge sheet bearing Wednesday’s date as if the arraignment was going to start afresh.
 Defence lawyers Franco Debono, Alfred Abela and Karl Cordina vociferously objected to their client’s continued arrest.
 Debono told Magistrate Donatella Frendo Dimech that the fresh charges meant that the case was starting afresh and that the previous procedure, which saw their client remain under arrest in preventive custody for a week, was now taken over by this new event. The defence therefore asked the court to declare that the continued arrest was illegal.
 The prosecution insisted that it was not a fresh case but they had simply added charges to the charge sheet, which was permissible.
 However, Magistrate Frendo Dimech noted that the prosecution had not added charges, as it was claiming, but had filed a fresh charge sheet bearing Wednesday’s date as if it were a fresh arraignment.
 She observed that D’Amato was arrested on the strength of an arrest warrant issued by the duty magistrate last week. He was remanded in custody following the arraignment on the strength of the same arrest warrant.
 She ruled that since this was a fresh procedure, his continued arrest was therefore illegal and she ordered his immediate release from arrest.
 The case will now be sent to the court registrar for the case to be assigned to the magistrates presiding over money laundering cases.

 The four men and one woman, all Maltese nationals, had reportedly confronted the officers while they had been issuing a parking fine.
 Magistrate Joseph Gatt presided over the arraignment of the five defendants who were charged with participating in affray, using violence against public officials, insulting, threatening and violently resisting the same officials. The defendants were further charged with causing grievous bodily harm to one of the officers and slight bodily harm to the other, with those charges being aggravated by the fact that the defendants had assisted one another in doing so.  Charges of breaching the peace and causing damage to private property rounded up the list of charges.
 46 year-old restaurant owner Elton Anthony Borg from Hamrun, 44 year-old Kurt Borg, also a restaurant owner from Hamrun, were charged under arrest together with Erica Borg, 42, a housewife from Msida, Redeimen Aquilina, 23 from Hamrun, Christian Mansueto, 33 from Siggiewi all pleaded not guilty and requested bail.
 Inspector Elisia Scicluna told the court that the police had been sent to Hamrun after being informed that two officers had been assaulted. At the scene, the two officers had pointed out the individuals.
  Some ten to fifteen people had participated in the argument, said the inspector, adding that the three Borgs were arrested at which point the crowd started to disperse. 
 Aquilina and Manseuto were first to be arrested. Mansueto was subsequently arrested at his residence by RIU officers. Franco Debono asked about the identities of the arresting officers and whether they had been informed of their rights at the time. The inspector replied with the arresting officers’ police numbers and confirmed that the suspects’ rights had been read to them and copies provided. The duty magistrate was informed about the arrests at 12:32 am. None of the other defendants contested the validity of the arrest.
  The request for bail was objected to by prosecutor Jennifer Polidano, representing the Office of the Attorney General. “There was already tampering with evidence,” she said. “Mr. Borg’s restaurant CCTV cameras have been removed and the police were unable to extract footage,” said the inspector, adding that further arrests were a possibility. “A clear message must be sent out that this kind of behaviour is not acceptable to society.”
 Inspector Elisia Scicluna argued that the risk to evidence was a real one. The testimony of the police officers who were assaulted is still yet to be heard. “When the police went to collect CCTV footage from the restaurant of one of the defendants this was not found and there is a risk that further evidence will be tampered with if the defendants are released on bail,” she said. The court was told that a bodycam had also been lost in the melee and was still being traced. 
  If bail were to be granted this would cause great disruption and commotion in society, argued the inspector. The police were there for the security and protection of the public, said the inspector, and had ended up being attacked by citizens whom they were protecting. Lawyer Franco Debono argued that Mansueto had never been in any trouble with the law before. “If someone out there thinks that getting bail means you are exonerated, that’s their problem.” 
 “It is good that people can express themselves on social media, although maybe it would also be good to inform oneself about issues like bail, but the point must never be reached that the court be conditioned by the social media response.” 
  Magistrate Gatt pointed out that all he had before him at this point were the charges and identification documents.
 “I am not going to discuss the merits,” said the lawyer, before proceeding directly to arguing on the merits that Mansueto had only been trying to separate the fighting parties.
 Mifsud also picked up on the media coverage argument, adding that “the crowd had also picked Barabbas.” The media had not published footage of the incident that had been taken from another angle which, he said, showed a different story. 
 While disclosing the evidence against his client, the police had shown him footage that “this chaos broke out over a silly thing,” he said. 
  “In Hamrun, because of the situation there, every shop invests in CCTV, so no tampering with evidence is possible,” added the lawyer. He argued that the fact that his client had changed his clothes after the incident did not mean that he was tampering with evidence.
 Mifsud praised the police for allegedly informing him themselves that his client had intervened to break up the scuffle. The story had been blown out of proportion, he said, telling the court that once the facts emerged “the famous media will change its view.”
 In his bail submissions, Xuereb alleged that third parties were also  involved in the incident, arguing that adopting a “one size fits all” approach to bail was a disservice to society. “All we have before us at the moment is a PIRS report and charges, so it is unfair to bring in social media and so on,” said the lawyer, adding that the adverse media coverage was prejudicial to his clients’ right to the presumption of innocence.
 On his part, lawyer Arthur Azzopardi argued that the charges against his client, Erika Borg “all fell within the original competence of the Court of Magistrates.” Her behaviour during the incident was already preserved on the footage and could not be contradicted by any number of witnesses, he said. “If somehow the CCTV’s DVR went missing, my client is definitely not at fault because she was already in police custody at the time.”
 The footage collected, both on mobile phones and on police bodycams, had good video and audio quality, he added. 
 Polidano counter-argued that the prosecution “was not saying that the defendants should never be granted bail, but that it was too early a stage” for them to do so. The CCTV recording and the clothing of one of the defendants is yet to be found, she said. And while one of the defendants had been seen separating the fight, he was also seen throwing punches later, added the prosecutor.
 After hearing the defence’s lengthy arguments, the court ultimately denied the requests for bail in view of the nature of the incident as well as the risk to evidence and ordered that the defendants be remanded in custody. 
 Elton and Kurt Borg were assisted by lawyers Matthew Xuereb and Alex Scerri Herrera; Erica Borg, 42, was assisted by Arthur Azzopardi and Jacob Magri; Redeimen Aquilina was assisted by lawyer Mario Mifsud and Nicholas Mifsud; Christian Mansueto was assisted by lawyers Franco Debono and Charles Mercieca.
 Footage of the incident went viral after being captured on video by bystanders and updated to social media. The footage shows the officers being picked up and bodyslammed on the ground before being assaulted. One officer had attempted to use his pepper spray and taser while the other tried to fend off the attackers with a baton, but both were overwhelmed.
 A few minutes later, backup units arrived and brought the situation under control. The 42 year-old woman was arrested at the scene, together with two men aged 46 and 44. Two other suspects fled but were later apprehended at their residences after being identified through investigations.
 Parte civile lawyer Herman Mula told the court that the AG had not objected on the ground of adverse media, but said that the ECHR includes potential disruption of public order amongst the grounds for which bail should be refused. Although his clients are police officers, they were also victims, and not witnesses simply because they had conducted an investigation, which merits different treatment.
 There was also the risk of collusion with potential witnesses, said the lawyer.
 After hearing the defence’s lengthy arguments, the court ultimately denied the requests for bail due to the nature of the incident as well as the risk to evidence, and ordered the defendants be remanded in custody.

 Jomic Calleja Maatouk and his wife Marzia had only been in Gharyan, a town 80km south of Tripoli, for a few weeks before they were located by Libyan law enforcement on Thursday.
 Marzia Calleja Maatouk was found dead. Jomic Calleja Maatouk was captured alive, close by. He is now being held in Tripoli and will appear in a Libyan court. Maltese authorities have asked for his extradition to Malta, where he faces a number of criminal cases.
 Sources told Times of Malta that Libyan authorities have yet to carry out an autopsy on Marzia’s body, to determine the cause of death. Initial indications, however, have ruled out any foul play.
 The couple escaped Malta last summer, weeks after they were both sentenced to time in jail for separate crimes. Marzia Calleja Maatouk’s family told  Times of Malta at the time that she vanished without warning and left the house she and Jomic shared in a state of disarray.
 Intelligence later placed the fugitive couple in Italy, and Malta worked with Italian authorities over the ensuing months to pinpoint their precise location.
 Their capture appeared imminent. But just as Italian police prepared an operation to arrest the couple, they were on the move again.
  Using fake passports, they are believed to have crossed the Mediterranean into Libya, a sprawling, sparsely populated country where they believed they could more easily avoid detection. 
 They then made their way to Gharyan, a town of around 170,000 people in Libya’s Nafusa mountain range with a strong Berber population. There, they moved into a villa and hid away from public view.
 Intelligence sources believe they leveraged Jomic Calleja Maatouk’s knowledge of the dark web to make enough money to get by.
 Jomic, who was described as “highly intelligent and tech savvy” by sources, was well-versed in navigating the internet’s fringes. 
 He previously operated a Bitcoin-linked car trading business and also frequented illicit marketplaces on the dark web – parts of the internet that are hidden from search engines like Google.
  It was an interaction on one such marketplace that led to his most recent conviction in Malta: a five-year jail sentence for having bought C-4 explosive online, after trying and failing to procure doses of lethal poisons like ricin.
 When sentencing him, a magistrate described him as a “lethal weapon” who was ready to unleash “the gates of hell” on whoever crossed his path.
 His wife, Marzia, also had a run-in with the law. Last August, she was sentenced to 15 months behind bars for conspiring to traffic cannabis, after she was caught in a car in Birkirkara with more than 300 grams of the drug.
 Jomic, who was her boyfriend at the time, was with her in the vehicle at the time. It is not known when her body will be transported back to Malta.

Vitals accused hit with gagging order… or are they?,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/vitals-accused-hit-gagging-order-they.1093192,30-05-2024,004594.png,"Tuesday’s marathon court session into the Vitals case ended with a twist in the tale when the  magistrate ordered defendants to steer clear of publicly discussing the case.
 “The case is tried in court and court alone, not through the media. So the parties and their lawyers are banned from handing any of the data to third parties or making any public comments about any testimonies or evidence in the proceedings,” Magistrate Rachel Montebello decreed.
 The gagging order has been the source of some confusion, with some interpreting it to mean that all talk of the issue is off-limits while others say that defendants are still free to express themselves as long as they exercise caution.
 Emerging from court, former prime minister Joseph Muscat briefly paused to tell journalists gathered that he couldn’t hold a press conference he had been planning after he had been hit by a gagging order, which meant that he can’t speak publicly about the case.
 “If I were to answer your questions, I would be directly violating the court’s orders,” he said.
 
 Justice Minister Jonathan Attard was unimpressed by the court’s decision, describing the prosecution’s request for a gagging order on defendants as “disproportionate” in a case “characterised by strategic leaks”.
 Unsurprisingly, former Repubblika president Robert Aquilina sees things differently. “It’s not true that there is a general prohibition,” he told  Times of Malta yesterday. “The court order is for things that should take place in court to take place in court, not outside”.
 Times of Malta spoke to several criminal lawyers not involved in the case to understand their interpretation of the magistrate’s instructions. All lawyers said that they were basing their interpretation on media reports of the decree, not having read a transcript of the magistrate’s words.
 “It’s not a gagging order in the sense that there is no clear legal provision in Malta for gagging orders – this is a term adopted from other jurisdictions,” one lawyer said.
 Gagging orders are usually directed at the media, prohibiting the publication of details about a case, whenever the court feels that this could hinder the proper administration of justice, with article 517 of Malta’s criminal code explaining this procedure.
 But, they said, it is, ultimately, up to the magistrate presiding over the case to ensure that the case is heard in tranquillity, so she has a free hand to impose whatever measures are needed for this to happen, including instructing defendants to keep mum about the subject.
 “The order appears to be limited to what happens in court,” another lawyer argued, suggesting that, while defendants can speak about the case in “generic terms”, they can’t actually refer to any activity that takes place in court.
 What this means in practice, the lawyer said, is that, although defendants can continue to publicly proclaim their innocence, they can’t refer to any testimony, evidence or statements made in court when doing so.
 “Defendants can say ‘I don’t understand how the freezing order was calculated’ but they can’t add ‘the prosecution’s testimony hasn’t justified the freezing order’,” the lawyer said, by way of explanation.
 Other lawyers broadly agree that, while the order isn’t a blanket ban on talk of the case, it limits defendants’ ability to rebut claims publicly.
 “I don’t think the magistrate has the power to stop someone from speaking about the case in political terms,” one lawyer said, “but it’s clear that they need to measure their words carefully.”
 Ultimately, a lawyer said, the magistrate’s instructions need to be interpreted with a good dose of “common sense”.
 Not at all, the lawyers who spoke to Times of Malta agreed. But it’s also not completely unheard of.
 One lawyer described it as “quite rare” for a court to take this step. “But it is also quite rare for a court to be faced with such a high-profile case,” they added.
 The nature of the case, and the persons involved, certainly adds an almost unprecedented layer of complexity, lawyers agreed.
 One lawyer pointed to another high-profile court case in Malta’s recent political history, that of former chief justice Noel Arrigo and Judge Patrick Vella, who stood accused of bribery. The case was tainted after the courts had found that the words of then-prime minister Eddie Fenech Adami had breached their right to a fair trial and presumption of innocence.
 “The magistrate is trying to avoid a situation where proceedings are taken over by the public pronouncements that might prejudice the case.”
 Several lawyers questioned what effect this might have on the broader debate surrounding the case.
 “It’s clear that this brings about a situation where defendants cannot rebut allegations in public, even if those same allegations are also made publicly,” one lawyer said.
 But defendants aren’t totally helpless. “If an outside party makes a false accusation or allegation, the accused can still file judicial proceedings and hold them responsible for damages,” another lawyer argued.
 In short, defendants can take legal action to defend themselves but might have to bite their tongue when it comes to doing so publicly, or risk reprimand. Whether this has an impact on the public perception is anyone’s guess, lawyers say.
 “Cases shouldn’t be judged on sympathy or perception,” one lawyer said. “But there’s no denying that public discourse can influence a jury and swing their perception one way or another, especially in a system where jurors are members of the public.”

[LIVE] Compilation of evidence continues in Vitals fraud charges against former ministers,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/130836/vitals_fraud_fearne_scicluna_1,22-08-2024,004598.png,"
 Magistrate Leonard Caruana will hear a number of witnesses testify today, as the compilation of evidence against former deputy prime minister Chris Fearne, Central Bank governor Edward Scicluna and 13 other defendants who are facing charges over the fraudulent private hospitals’ concession to Vitals Global Healthcare.  
 In a decree issued after the previous sitting, on July 24, the court ruled that there was a prima facie case to be heard against the accused, paving the way for them to be indicted and tried before the Criminal Court. 
 Among the witnesses requested for today’s sitting is former economy minister Chris Cardona, who testified yesterday in the parallel criminal proceedings against former Prime Minister Joseph Muscat. 
 On the witness stand yesterday, Cardona appeared to distance himself from the Memorandum of Understanding which he had signed with Vitals in his ministerial capacity.  
 He told the court that he had not read the document before signing it and had only done so in preparation for his testimony before the National Audit Office. When pressed by the court, Cardona said: “I was the minister responsible for Malta Enterprise. They asked me to sign it and I signed it.” 
 But later that same afternoon, Cardona took to Facebook to accuse the press of maliciously distorting his testimony, despite it being reported in real time.  
 Also expected to testify are several forensic accounting experts, who had been appointed to assist the magisterial inquiry into the hospitals deal.  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police
Lifetime ban for poacher who shot down eagle at Binġemma,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/131425/lifetime_ban_for_poacher_who_shot_down_eagle_at_binemma,27-09-2024,004599.png,"A poacher who shot an eagle at Binġemma has been given a lifetime hunting ban.
 Christopher Mercieca, 40 and from Santa Venera, was fined €5,000 for the crime. Mercieca pleaded guilty to shooting and killing the protected short-toed eagle, as well as unlawful possession of a number of protected species, both alive and dead.
 Mercieca was identified as the poacher responsible for that crime through
  Footage provided by third parties, who filmed the incident and alerted the police, helped to identify Mercieca. Police received a report on Tuesday evening about the 6:15pm shooting in the limits of Mġarr, Malta. Mercieca was arrested later that evening, then released after a few hours.
 He was re-arrested on Thursday after the police obtained footage of the shooting.
 He registered an admission after consulting his lawyer, Edward Gatt, and confirmed that plea after being warned of the implications by the court.
 Magistrate Jean Paul Grech said that the court would not impose an effective jail term given the early guilty plea, but would fine him €5,000 – payable in €150 monthly instalments – and revoke the accused’s hunting licence to the maximum permitted by law.
 The court banned Mercieca from holding any such licence for life.  ",Matthew Vella ,court_and_police

 Five divers were rescued by the Armed Forces of Malta and the Civil Protection Department on Tuesday after finding themselves in difficulty off Wied iż-Żurrieq.
 The police said the alarm was raised at about noon.  
 Two divers were rescued by helicopter and three were taken ashore by a CPD dinghy. One diver was taken to Mater Dei Hospital. No one was injured. 
  In a joint statement, AFM and CPD said Red Cross volunteers alerted them that the five divers were in difficulty after they were dragged out to sea by strong currents and large waves.
 The rescue was a difficult one because of the strong currents and winds.
  The area is popular among divers, but there have been frequent incidents of divers being unable to get back to shore because of rough seas.
 The most recent helicopter rescue from the area was in April, when two divers also found themselves in difficulty.

"Prime Minister, State Advocate clash over Vitals inquiry in PN civil damages case",maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/129199/prime_minister_state_advocate_clash_over_vitals_inquiry_in_pn_civil_damages_case,15-05-2024,004642.png,"A judge has rejected the PN’s request to exhibit the entire magisterial inquiry into the fraudulent sale of three public hospitals, in the party’s case seeking the return of the public funds spent on it.
 Mr. Justice Toni Abela handed down his decree this morning following a brief, but lively, sitting in the civil case filed by the PN which is seeking to recover some €400 million, paid out by the taxpayer as part of the ill-fated hospitals deal with Vitals Global Healthcare, later taken over by Steward Healthcare, which was subsequently declared null by a court on the grounds of fraud.
 Making their arguments before the decree was issued, it was evident that the State Advocate and the Prime Minister held diametrically-opposed positions as to whether the court should provide the opposition PN party with a full copy of evidence exhibited in the Vitals inquiry or not.
 The court incredulously read out a note filed by the PN, which cited a story published by One News which quoted one of Joseph Muscat’s lawyers, Charlon Gouder, as stating that Muscat had been granted access to the inquiry documents and that the same would be granted to everyone else earmarked for prosecution by the inquiry. Lawyer Julian Farrugia, representing the Office of the State Advocate, informed the court that the Office was objecting to the request.
  It was only the Criminal Court which could decide to grant the PN access to the inquiry, said the judge, adding that “besides the acts that were illicitly published in the media, the court has no knowledge of them.” 
 Judge Abela warned about the publication of leaks from the inquiry, noting that before recent amendments to the law, the acts of criminal proceedings could not be seen by anyone, bar the parties involved. Those amendments now gave the AG discretion to allow access to others.
 “The court understands that both the rights of the prosecution and those of the defendants must be protected,” said the judge, also pointing out that the plaintiffs had made this request when it should have been made by the AG.
 The court said it could not see how the request was relevant to this case. 
 Having seen the various applications and the replies, the judge observed that the case was aimed at getting the court to summon the registrar of Criminal Court to exhibit attachment orders and other documents from the criminal proceedings.
 He also noted that the Prime Minister had not objected but that the State Advocate disagreed.
 “The acts are being published in the media. This is not right and will lead to injustice, especially when they end up in the hands of people who have obscure agendas,” said the judge, who expressed disbelief at the fact that the person behind the leaks had not yet been identified “when the circle of people with access to it is small.”
  
 Earlier in court
 Before the decree was handed down, lawyer Edward Debono, assisting former opposition leader Adrian Delia, insisted on the court handing down a decree on the request. “The issue is simple. The case we filed is that the State Advocate must litigate against those people in the highest functions of the Maltese government who acted with criminal intent in collusion with Vitals. The State Advocate’s reply was that his office doesn’t have that function.”
 “Thanks to the International arbitration proceedings, today we know that Steward Healthcare is bankrupt. These government officials have been identified, not only thanks to attachment orders, not only in the charges that were issued, but now, too because the Court of Magistrates in its criminal jurisdiction, has decreed that every person charged is to be given a copy of the inquiry.
 “So now the State Advocate cannot use the excuse that he doesn’t know what the inquiry contains. He is not the government’s lawyer, he is duty-bound to defend the interests of the State, which is different. So our position is that we also require a copy to prepare our case,” Debono explained.
 Farrugia counter-argued that when the plaintiffs had declared their evidence to be closed, they had been unequivocal in stating that they had no further evidence to exhibit, adding that “the evidence they are trying to exhibit is completely irrelevant to this case, because this case is simply about what the Office of the State Advocate can do in terms of the Constitution and the law, and nothing more.”
 “After the exhibition of the 78 boxes of evidence that were reported in the media, is this court going to be in a better position to know what the law says?” asked Farrugia, insisting that his role was not to enter into the political discussions, but to ensure that the law is obeyed.
 Farrugia accused the PN of filing this case in a bid to get around that law.
 The lawyer added that he did not have a copy of the inquiry and did not know what it contained. “What I know is this. When an inquiry is concluded, it is transmitted directly to the Attorney General. Under the Criminal Code, access to the inquiry, until that inquiry is exhibited as evidence in criminal proceedings, it is the Attorney General who is the custodian of that inquiry and only the AG can determine who to grant access and give copies to.”
 The judge asked Farrugia to confirm what he had just said, on oath, warning him to be careful about what he was going to say. But Farrugia obliged without hesitation. “The office and the State Advocate do not have in their possession a complete copy of the inquiry,”  he testified.
 “With regards to the Constitutional case that was recently filed by Joseph Muscat in the light of a decree by Mr. Justice Giovanni Grixti, part of the inquiry, had to be transmitted to him and is under seal in the case file before that judge.”
 The lawyer said he was led to believe that Muscat is one of the people which the inquiry recommended for prosecution. “Like everyone else, he has a right to the disclosure of the evidence against him.” 
 “I’ve been saying the PV should be published for a long time,” Prime Minister Robert Abela, who was also present in the courtroom, told the court.
 Using the Prime Minister’s remark as a springboard, cabinet’s lawyer Ian Borg added that the request for the documentation “is not only relevant, but important to show this case is baseless and we have no objection to it being exhibited.”
 A brief shouting match erupted between the lawyers on both sides, who bickered about the claim that the Prime Minister had first heard about a recent court application through One news, before the judge brought the parties to order.
 Mr. Justice Abela adjourned the sitting to 11:15, announcing that he would be reading out his decree in open court to prevent any misinterpretations.
 Mr. Justice Toni Abela announced that he would be handing down a decree on the matter later.

Drunken duo kicked off flight ended up in taser altercation with police,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/drunken-duo-kicked-off-flight-ended-taser-altercation-police.1093986,15-06-2024,004649.png,"A golfer and her friend who allegedly went on a drunken rampage after being denied boarding of a flight back home will be spending more time in Malta after a court ordered that they be held in police custody. 
 Chloe May Frankish, 25, and John Chinedu Uche, 31, both British nationals from Kent and London respectively, landed on the wrong side of the law on Wednesday evening when they attempted to board an EasyJet flight at around 9pm while drunk. 
 When the pair refused to listen to cabin crew instructions, the police were called in. The situation escalated and the police officers had to call for backup from their colleagues at the Rapid Intervention Unit. 
 When the couple were finally escorted to the police station at Malta International Airport, their aggressive behaviour allegedly continued.
 During the incident, police had to taser the man. Frankish kept up her aggressive behaviour, prosecutors said, kicking and smashing a wooden gate.
 She later told police that she was pregnant. But a medical test did not confirm that claim.
 On Friday, the now sober pair were escorted to court, Frankish’s left tattooed forearm apparently in a cast. 
 They were jointly charged with violently resisting arrest, refusing to obey legitimate orders of public officials, wilfully breaching the public peace as well as being drunk in public. 
 Frankish was separately charged with wilfully damaging a gate attached to the desk at the police station. A woodworks company estimated the damage to be €436.
 She was also charged with slightly injuring a police officer. 
 Uche was separately charged with insulting and threatening public officers. 
 The prosecution exhibited a denied boarding report by EasyJet, photos of the damages caused, the quote for the damages as well as a medical certificate. 
 Both were initially inclined to plead guilty. 
 However, following a short break to give the accused time to consult with their lawyer, the defence told the court that the accused were not fully understanding the implications of their guilty plea.
 Magistrate Abigail Critien said that the court “was not convinced that they understood such guilty plea” and that the court could not assume responsibility for such a plea. 
 “If the court were to do so [to accept their guilty plea] the court would be breaching your human rights,” explained the magistrate.
 Nor did the court have peace of mind that any payments due by the accused would be settled in due time before they travelled out of Malta. 
 The court thus registered a “not guilty” plea for both. 
 No bail was requested at arraignment stage and the pair were remanded in custody. 
 Inspector Roxanne Tabone prosecuted. Lawyer Alexia Vassallo was legal aid counsel.

 Daniela Casdova, a passenger and friend of the victim, described how a dispute over reckless driving and a payment demand escalated, with the accused allegedly attacking the victim with a concealed weapon.

                     A Libyan taxi driver, Mohamed Bashir Ibrahim Aljalli, was charged with the of stabbing a Brazilian passenger in Valletta after a dispute over reckless driving and an additional payment demand, leading to serious shoulder injuries for the victim.

 The compilation of evidence presided over by Magistrate Monica Vella, began against the taxi driver on Thursday. It was recalled by the prosecution that the Libyan driver, Mohamed Bashir Ibrahim Aljalli, 37, pleaded not guilty to stabbing and seriously injuring the Brazilian man.

 A passenger who was riding with the victim, Daniela Casdova, testified on 27 November 2024. She recalled how the accused taxi driver was driving the vehicle really quickly. She said, “We asked him politely if he can drive less fast. He refused. This happened multiple times.”

 Casdova added that, upon arriving to their destination, she had exited the car. The victim, she recalled, stayed inside of the car to pay the taxi driver. Casdova further added that the victim had told the driver that he “is crazy” and that he “could’ve gotten us killed”.

 She further went on to explain how the taxi driver stepped outside and attacked the victim. After punching he victim, she said that the driver went to the car and when he returned he continued to punch the victim, this time with an object concealed in his hand. “The driver was aiming at his neck”, Casdova said as she recalled the way in which the driver attacked the victim.

"South American sex workers gave pimps half their earnings, rent and flight costs",maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/130800/colombian_human_trafficking_ring_testify_2,28-08-2024,004737.png,"Two women from Colombia and Venezuela have testified in court proceedings against a Maltese human trafficking ring, describing the way they were encouraged to take up sex work in Malta and how they split their earnings with their pimps.
 Magistrate Donatella Frendo Dimech insisted that the victims be only brought to testify once, warning the prosecution the court would not allow any secondary victimisation of the witnesses. 
  The two women testified by video-link, and form part of some 50 witnesses who are yet to testify in the criminal proceedings against nine individuals who were among 11 people arrested in police raids on 12 August. The defendants are facing charges of money laundering and immoral earnings, apart from other prostitution-related charges. 
 Assisted by parte civile lawyer Lara Dimitrijevic, the two witnesses explained that they were first introduced to the prospect of travelling to Malta by a friend, before leaving on a ticket financed by the Maltese organisation. 
 Once they arrived in Malta, they had to pay back the flight ticket, as well as rent for their apartment – which was shared with other sex workers – and give practically half of their earnings to their pimps. 
 One of the accused, Clint d’Amato, was identified in court as their fixer by both witnesses, who told the court that they knew him as, ‘Elmo’ and ‘Miguel.’ 
 The Venezuelan witness travelled in Malta back in March 2024, with an intention to overstay and enter prostitution at the behest of the traffickers. She said she was promised a good pay “and no problems”. 
 She said she charged clients €100 for one hour of sex work, keeping 55% of her earnings. “The work didn’t have fixed hours. If I woke up at 10am I could start work then. Two, three hours, as much as my body could take.” 
 D’Amato would forward the clients to her, effectively taking calls through the prostitute’s WhatsApp number that was displayed on an online profile page for sex workers. Clients would enter the apartment, explain the services required, and if she refused, they would have to leave. “If I finished working at 2pm, I would message ‘Miguel’ and he would tell me to calculate my dues and leave the money on the table for him.” 
 The witness said she paid some €750 in rent every month, on top of the percentage she passed on to the pimp, as well as the €3,350 ‘loan’ that represented her flight ticket to Malta. “I came here with debt for the flight. So when the client paid me, I took all the money and then I would do the sums and hand everything over to Miguel.” 
 She added that she hoped to raise money to buy a house and pay for an operation for her daughter, “and have a better future.” 
 She said she could see around six clients a day, and potentially earn even up to €1,700 when including tips; by 1 August, she estimated that she was owed €5,000 but that she was not transferred the entirety of those earnings by her pimp. “When the police came to our apartment, I was frightened, even though I needn’t have been. They found my notebook and asked who it belonged to, but I said nothing. I told them it was mine, later at the police station.” 
 She added that new women were moving into the flat, also sex workers. The premises was monitored by small cameras, one inside and the other outside the building. 
 The second witness, a Colombian 20-year-old, recounted a similar experience where an online acquaintance had encouraged her to travel to Malta. 
 The witness revealed she had already carried out sex work in Medellin, explaining that she was described as a ‘company woman’ there rather than a prostitute. She was a beautician by trade but had carried out sex work for people she met on Tinder. Malta was proposed to her as a destination close to Bilbao, Spain, where she would be able to move and leave the sex trade after saving enough, she told the court. 
 She was picked up by D’Amato from the airport upon her arrival, who would also accompany her on €150 outcalls to clients. 
 She, too, was obliged to pay back her flight, which she estimated at around €1,200 (5 million Colombian pesos). 
 Background
 The nine suspects were arrested during an early morning raid last week across various Malta localities on Monday, 12 August. 
 The defendants are: Luke Farrugia, 36, from Birkirkara; Clint D’Amato 36, from Gudja; Denzil Farrugia, 19; Alexandra Suhov Procora, a 32-year old Romanian woman residing at St Paul’s Bay, who told the court she was an accountant; Nicolae Efimov, 37 also Romanian and residing in St Paul’s Bay; Kane Vassallo, 22, from Siggiewi; Luca Emanuele Corito, 21, from Isla; Dylan McKay, 30, from Fgura; and Gordon Cassar, 44 from Żebbuġ. 
 All nine are charged with money laundering, promoting or setting up a criminal organisation, forcing individuals over 21 years of age into prostitution, holding persons against their will in a brothel as bonded debtors, knowingly living off the earnings of prostitution and running a brothel.

Lawyers condemn Cuschieri’s singling out of Vitals prosecutor,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/lawyers-condemn-cuschieri-singling-vitals-prosecutor.1094309,22-06-2024,004746.png,"Emmanuel Cuschieri’s singling out of a Vitals case prosecutor for simply doing his job is “despicable” and deserves “strong condemnation”, the Chamber of Advocates said on Friday.
 Cuschieri, a talk-radio show host on the Labour Party’s station and a staunch Joseph Muscat ally, mentioned prosecutor Francesco Refalo by name and included his picture in a Thursday Facebook post.  
 He was writing after that day’s court sitting, which centred around the cancer-treating cyclotron project.  
 In court, Refalo and defence lawyers were engaged in a heated debate over whether the cyclotron project really existed or if the equipment was still in storage.
 Cuschieri criticised the AG prosecutor, accusing him of casting doubt on the existence of cancer-treating equipment when the machinery was actually installed at the Life Sciences Park.  
 “What happened in court was shameful” and “incredible”, the ONE Radio host said. 
 Cuschieri also uploaded a picture of the AG lawyer and mentioned him by name.
  Asked for a reaction, the Chamber of Advocates condemned Cuschieri’s comments.
 “Justice needs to be free from influence and especially nowadays from social media threats,” Chamber of Advocates president Peter Fenech told Times of Malta.  
 “While the Chamber respects everyone’s right to freedom of expression and, thus, the right to comment, comments inciting the denigration of lawyers who are simply doing their job are despicable and strongly condemned by the Chamber of Advocates,” he said.  
 Refalo is the lead prosecutor in the Vitals case, in which Muscat, his ex-chief of staff, Keith Schembri and former health minister Konrad Mizzi and others face charges of money laundering, accepting bribes and other financial crimes.

Bail denied for repeat offender accused of theft from Rabat pastizzeria,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/130618/bail_denied_for_repeat_offender_accused_of_theft_from_rabat_pastizzeria,06-08-2024,004747.png,"A 41-year-old construction worker with a history of bail violations and a criminal record has been remanded in custody after being accused of stealing alcohol from a pastizzeria in Rabat. 
 Clive Micallef, who the court was told, has repeatedly failed to adhere to previous bail conditions, appeared in court on Tuesday, accused of theft and repeated bail breaches. 
  Inspector Godwin Scerri, prosecuting together with lawyer Brandon Bonnici from the Office of the Attorney General, charged Micallef with theft, aggravated by time and means, breaching bail conditions and recidivism.
 Micallef pleaded not guilty to the charges. Lawyer Alessandro Farrugia, assisting Micallef as defence counsel, requested bail.
 Inspector Scerri objected to that request, due to the risk of evidence being tampered with but also because of the defendant’s character, pointing to his “packed criminal record” and highlighting that he was already being accused of breaching bail.
 The inspector explained that Micallef would often fail to sign his bail book, requiring the police to contact him, after which he would present a blue medical certificate to justify his absence. He had not signed his bail book for the past 3 days and had falsely claimed this to be due to a medical ailment, added Scerri. 
 “If you look at the bail book, there are more blue papers than pages. Many times he is called to the police station to explain his failure to sign the bail book and he comes with a medical certificate.”
 Magistrate Abigail Critien, who presided over the arraignment, ordered the prosecution to exhibit the bail book in the acts of the case. After examining the bail book for herself, the magistrate observed that the medical certificate exhibited by the defence was not suitable for these proceedings, adding that “besides this, it amply clear that the bail book in question is full of similar certificates explaining or justifying failures to sign it.”
 Farrugia argued that the defendant was his mother’s carer, as a further reason to grant him bail. “From what I can see, it looks like he needs a carer himself,” quipped the magistrate.
 Inspector Scerri added that Micallef had complained of being unwell and been taken to a health centre while under arrest, subsequently being discharged with a prescription for paracetamol.
 The court, after hearing these submissions, rejected the bail request to avoid possible subornation of witnesses and because it was concerned that the defendant would reoffend were he to be released from arrest.  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police
Judge grants Joseph Muscat partial access to Vitals inquiry,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/129103/judge_grants_joseph_muscat_partial_access_to_vitals_inquiry,09-05-2024,004500.png,"A judge has granted Joseph Muscat, with immediate effect, partial access to the magisterial inquiry into the Vitals hospital deal, but rejected the disgraced former Prime Minister’s request to suspend the effects of the inquiring magistrate’s April 4 decree, refusing Muscat disclosure.
 Judge Giovanni Grixti’s ruling, however, limits Muscat's access to those documents in the inquiry in which he is mentioned.
 “The court is of the opinion that without concrete evidence of that being alleged by the applicant, Dr. Joseph Muscat, it would not be possible for this court to arrive at a conclusion either way. As the proces verbal is not strictly exhibited in a criminal case on the merits and in homage to the principle of equality of arms and of transparency in the correct administration of justice, the court needs to see the documentation which the applicant is complaining about, for itself. At the same time, because the applicant’s complaints do not concern the entirety of the magisterial inquiry, but only from the moment that Muscat became a subject of it, there is no need to exhibit the inquiry in its entirety.”
  The judge ordered the AG to exhibit all the documentation from the inquiry, starting from the date of the application filed by Repubblika, which concerns Muscat until the inquiry’s end, also ordering that the documents be secured in the judge's chambers.
 He explained that this was necessary because Muscat’s complaints dealt with the inquiring magistrate’s refusal of Muscat’s request that she recuse herself, Muscat’s application for full disclosure and the fact that he was not notifiedwhen the application which started the inquiry was filed in 2019.
 The judge clarified that the AG must exhibit every document in this regard, “but other parts of the inquiry are not required unless the court decides otherwise during the course of the proceedings.”
 The ruling effectively brings to an end the year-long battle by Muscat’s lawyers to obtain access to the inquiry. The judge also upheld Muscat’s requests to order the immediate enforceability of the decree and for the abbreviation of the time window in which the State Advocate can request the Chief Justice’s permission to file an appeal.
 Lawyers Vince Galea and Charlon Gouder are assisting Joseph Muscat, who did not attend today’s sitting. In 2019, Mr. Justice Grixti had overturned another magistrate's order to hold an inquiry into the VGH hospitals deal, after having also blocked yet another magistrate's order for an inquiry into the Panama Papers scandal. ""Shameful to see Robert Abela enabling Muscat to evade justice"" -Repubblika  before he faces criminal charges in court.
 “Now everyone can see with their own eyes who is really working against the interest of the people of Malta and Gozo! It is shameful to see Robert Abela enabling attempts to evade justice by persons earmarked by a criminal inquiry for prosecution on very serious criminal charges.”

Five deny trafficking charges after police raids recover 14 kilograms of drugs at several properties,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/131619/cocaine_cash_cannabis_found_as_police_arrest_five_suspected_of_organised_crime,08-10-2024,"004512.png,004513.png,004514.png,004515.png,004516.png","Five people have been charged after a coordinated Drugs Squad operation led to the seizure of 7kg of cocaine and 7kg of cannabis from a number of properties.
 36-year-old taxi driver Nikola Vujakovic, from Serbia, 37-year-old self-employed businessman Salvatore Rogazione from Sicily, 34-year-old Aleksandar Vujakovic from Croatia, cleaner Sara Lerinc, 22, from Serbia, residing in Zabbar and Goran Davkovski, a 54-year-old man from North Macedonia, appeared in the dock before magistrate Nadine Sant Lia on Tuesday, charged with drug trafficking and money laundering offences.
 Aleksandar Vujakovic and Rogazione refused to reply to questions about their address. Their lawyers argued that he was exercising his right to silence and did not have to justify this.
 Lawyer Charles Mercieca told the court that Davkovski would not be answering any of the court’s questions.
  All pleaded not guilty to the charges.
 Police Inspector Mark Mercireca told the court that some months before the operation, the police had received information about a Serbian gang in Malta which might be involved in drug trafficking, weapons possession and false documents.
 Nikola Vujakovic was identified first, with the police discovering that he lived in Zabbar with his girlfriend, Lerinc, but would turn up at several other residences throughout the day.
  He was observed to make use of several vehicles and a property in Marskala.
 Initial surveillance confirmed that the defendants would use both the Zabbar and Marsaskala properties as well visit several commercial establishments in the latter town.
  On 5 October 2024, the police had started a round-the-clock surveillance operation targeting the group to confirm the information they had received.
 Leric would live at Marsaskala, said the inspector.
 A Volvo driven by Nikola Vujakovic and two other men, was observed leaving his Zabbar residence and driving to a nearby field in which a number of abandoned vehicles were dumped. He was observed taking a bag out of his Volvo and filling it with items that had been stashed in one of the abandoned vehicles, a Peugeot.
 He was then seen to drive towards Bahar ic-Caghaq, and was followed by the police, but was lost in traffic soon after.
 The Peugeot, which was registered to another man, was also placed under surveillance.
 On October 6, Nikola Vujakovic was seen approaching the Peugeot on a motorbike with Lerinc riding pillion. He took something out of the Peugeot and put it in a bag. He drove to a house in Marsaskala and dropped off the bag outside.
 A man, later identified as Rogazione, was then seen to pick up the bag. The contents of the bag were identified by the police to be a block of what appeared to be cocaine. Rogazione was arrested together with his girlfriend. Vujakovic and Lerinc were also arrested soon after.
 A search of the residence recovered a single sachet of suspected cocaine together with a small amount of cannabis and a firearm that is currently being tested for functionality as well as a cash counting machine.
  Several mobile phones and digital weighing scales were discovered with cash, inside the car and over €14,000 were found inside the glove compartment. Vujakovic was carrying €3,600 in cash in his wallet at the time of his arrest. In the residence keys to several vehicles were also found.
 Vujakovic told the police that he had only just recently bought one of the cars, in which a large amount of cannabis was discovered, but the police said that he had been seen repeatedly accessing it in the days before.
 Davkovsky was arrested inside the Marsaskala property. He had tried to walk away from the property when the police arrived, said the inspector, who added that he had claimed to be the cleaner.
 Blocks of cocaine in varying states of preparation were found inside the house, he said.
 Approximately 7kg of cannabis and 7kg of cocaine were found in total.
 In every residence that was searched, the police had also found documents which they suspected were forged and are now being analysed, he said.
 The court imposed freezing orders over all of the assets belonging to the defendants, which the defence registered objections to.

"Inspector awarded €20,000 after being detained under defective arrest warrant",maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/132811/inspector_awarded_20000_after_being_detained_under_defective_arrest_warrant,17-12-2024,004519.png,"A Police inspector detained under a defective police warrant was yesterday awarded €20,000 by the Court after it was confirmed that his fundamental human rights had been breached.

 Elton Taliana instituted Constitutional proceedings in 2021, whereby he argued that a warrant of arrest issued against him constituted a breach of his fundamental human rights inasmuch as it was procedurally defective.

                     Taliana had been suspended from the corps following suspicions by his superiors that he may have leaked sensitive information regarding an ongoing investigation involving a person convicted for fraud.

 Julian Hofstra had been the subject of links to alleged secret recordings pertaining to the murder of Daphne Caruana Galizia. Taliana was suspected of leaking information to lawyers assisting Yorgen Fenech, who stands accused of complicity in the murder.

 Following numerous years of legal proceedings, Taliana was within reach of a promotion to the rank of superintendent, so much so that, when another superintendent had arrived at his house on a particular day, he believed that she had done so to hand him a certificate of said promotion.

 But alas, he learnt that he was subject to a warrant of search and arrest, on the strength of which he was taken into custody and his name logged into the so-called ‘detainee book’. His home was searched and personal possessions, including his mobile phone, were seized.

 During the proceedings Taliana’s lawyers argued that there were several defects pertaining to the arrest warrant, including the fact that it did not conform to the requisites laid down by the Criminal Code. It was further argued that the information supplied in order to obtain the arrest warrant was ‘incomplete’ and ‘deceptive’.

 Although the Court dismissed the argument that the warrant was in breach of human rights insofar as it was requested before the wrong court, it accepted other arguments raised by Taliana.

 One ‘grave shortcoming’ highlighted in the judgment referred to the fact that the arrest warrant failed to state the reason for the arrest.

 Two conflicting versions were provided by high-ranking officers. Whilst one stated that the arrest was sought because Taliana had accessed the police system, another officer cited an alleged leak of information to a third party as the reason for the arrest. The Court furthermore noted witness testimony which confirmed that it was realised that the reason for arrest was not specified in the warrant.

 The Court held that it could not comfortably conclude that the inspector was aware of the reason for his arrest.

 It was also argued that the information supplied by the officer requesting the warrant was deceptive and incomplete.

 The Court noted that the duty magistrate was not informed that Taliana was not the only person to have accessed Hofstra’s profile on the police system. The Magistrate was further told that Taliana leaked information regarding an ongoing investigation, when the inspector had no access to such information to begin with.

 The Court noted that this meant that not all information was passed to the Magistrate when the request for the arrest warrant was made, as is required by law. It was noted that the law is clear in providing that the police must divulge all information, and this so that Magistrates retain a clear view of the all facts before making a decision. Indeed, so that an adjudicator can reach the best decision possible, in a ‘just and equitable manner’, it is necessary that the whole truth, rather than part of it, is provided.

 The warrant was ultimately declared defective and in breach of the plaintiff’s fundamental human rights. The defective nature of the warrant meant that Taliana’s arrest, detention, interrogation, search and seizure of personal items were all invalid in character.

 Taliana’s ‘turbulent’ history taken into consideration

 The Court, in considering the damages to be awarded, held that it could not ignore Taliana’s claims that he was made to pass through ‘various challenges and persecutions’ made by his superiors in recent years.

 Indeed, Taliana argued that the facts of the case at hand constituted one of various attacks made against him in order to prevent him from reaching the rank of Superintendent.

 The Court noted that similarities existed between the case at hand and a conclusion made by the Ombudsman in 2019 which concluded that that police authorities “rushed to punish the complainant [Taliana].” Indeed, an arrest warrant was rushed when the plaintiff was expecting a promotion.

 Taliana was ultimately awarded €20,000 in non-pecuniary damages. It was further ordered that Taliana’s name be struck off the detainee book.

Mystery surrounds gruesome Gżira discovery of dismembered body,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/mystery-surrounds-gruesome-gzira-discovery-dismembered-body.1102436,13-12-2024,004523.png,"Police are working to determine whether the victim found in a suitcase off Gżira on Monday was murdered before his body was dismembered and discarded in the sea.
 Forensic experts are conducting further tests to uncover the circumstances surrounding the death of the victim, believed to be a Colombian drug mule.
 A 43-year-old man, also a Colombian national, was arrested on Thursday and is expected to face charges by Saturday, including drug trafficking and concealing a corpse. However, it remains unclear if he will also be charged with murder, as investigators continue to piece together evidence.
 Sources close to the investigation say the victim’s autopsy revealed asphyxiation as the cause of death. However, experts are examining whether this was the result of strangulation or other factors, such as a possible overdose caused by burst cocaine capsules inside the victim's stomach. Further studies are being carried out to establish if there are any visible marks of violence. 
 Details have started emerging of the trail which led to the arrest of the suspect, as well as a 39-year-old Portuguese national at a flat in Msida. 
 The breakthrough in the case came when police identified the suitcase containing the body as having been purchased from a hardware store in Naxxar. CCTV footage from the shop showed a man buying a suitcase and an axe.
 Acting swiftly, authorities distributed images of the suspect to airport and port officials to prevent the possibility of leaving the island. Footage was also analysed of passengers leaving the airport before the discovery was made. 
 Investigators kept tracking the suspect's movements through extensive CCTV analysis from different areas. While raids in areas such as Naxxar and St Julian’s yielded no results, police eventually located the Msida flat where the Colombian suspect had been staying. 
 Drug-related items were also recovered from the property. The Portuguese man is also under investigation to determine if he played any part in the case. 
 If the suspect is charged with murder, it would mark the fifth homicide case in Malta this year. Four individuals have already been arraigned in connection with other killings.

 Roderick Bellizzi, a 36-year-old from Birkirkara, admitted that he threatened a couple through messages on WhatsApp.  

                     In front of Magistrate Astrid May Grima, it was said that the accused was doing maintenance work in the couple's house when they started arguing with him about delayed work, which led the accused to threaten the couple.

 Regarding the punishment, the prosecution insisted that Bellizzi be given a treatment order and a protection order be issued against him. The defence said that the man cooperated fully with the police while arguing that the treatment order will be beneficial for him because he is going through a difficulties while under psychiatric treatment. Bellizzi had stopped working due to a medical condition. 

 The Court found the accused guilty and placed him under a probation order for two years. Apart from this, the Court also issued a protection order in favour the victims.

 The case revolves around 72-year-old John Oliver Kane, who stands accused of attempting to murder his 70-year-old neighbour in an altercation earlier this month in St Paul’s Bay.

                     Kane, an English national, has denied the charges, which also include causing grievous injuries.

 During the sitting, a defence witness testified in support of a pending bail application. The witness, a woman who has known Kane for 17 years, offered to house him and his partner at her residence in Balzan should he be granted bail.

 “We understand the situation, and John cannot return to his house in Qawra. We are offering temporary accommodation until they can find an alternative,” she said.

 The alleged victim was expected to testify during the hearing, but Inspector Kurt Colombo Zahra informed the court that the man was not in a condition to testify or even undergo questioning. The court heard that the victim remains in a delicate state, both physically and mentally, following the altercation.

 Inspector Italo Mizzi testified that the victim, recently discharged from hospital, had complied with a request to visit the Qawra Police Station. “He appeared very fragile, clutching his stomach. I suggested we speak on the ground floor as there are no lifts at the station,” Mizzi said.

 Mizzi recounted how the victim, still recovering from his injuries, broke down during the attempted interrogation, describing recurring flashbacks of the accused striking him. The interrogation was halted, and the victim was referred to the Victim Support Agency for assistance.

 In light of the victim’s condition, the prosecution requested the appointment of Mario Scerri to assess whether the man is fit to testify and undergo questioning. The court granted the request and instructed the prosecution and investigators to facilitate the medical examination.

 Meanwhile, the defence’s bail application, filed earlier this month, was put on hold pending further developments.

 Magistrate Kevan Azzopardi, presiding over the case, adjourned proceedings to Monday, 2 December, when the alleged victim is expected to testify.

His mother, Antonia Micallef, 71, later died in the hospital. Micallef is pleading  insanity at the time of the crime. The case remains pending. 
 Shannon Mak, 30, was beaten, kicked and stabbed in the neck. The body of the Dutch woman was found in a pool of blood between a parked car and a garden wall. In 2020, her former colleague and boyfriend, Jelle Rijpma was sentenced to  30 years in prison. 
  Lourdes Agius, 35, a mother of seven children was found strangled at her home in Paola by her mother in September 2018. The main suspect is her partner – and father of two of her children – Michael Emmanuel from the Ivory Coast. He had claimed insanity and pleaded not guilty, but his  plea was thrown out by a jury.
 Earlier this year, Joseph Bonnici was sentenced to 36 years in jail after admitting to killing his  mother Maria Lourdes and sister Angele Bonnici on March 26, 2019. Bonnici shot his relatives at a close range and later dumped their bodies in a field in Gudja where they were unearthed by  scene-of-crime officers. 
  Chantelle Chetcuti, a mother of two, was stabbed at least five times in the head outside a bar in Żabbar in February 2020. She was allegedly stabbed by Justin Borg, her former partner of over a decade and the father of her two daughters. He was charged in court, denied the murder and was  granted bail. 
 Polish national Paulina Dembska was raped and murdered in Sliema on January 2.  A 20-year-old man, Abner Aquilina, has been accused of the crime. Officers have previously testified that Aquilina said to them that “the devil” made him kill the Polish student and a court has heard that police bodycam recorded his  confession on camera. The case is ongoing. Her death sent shockwaves throughout the nation, and Malta introduced the concept of  femicide to the criminal code after her murder. 
 Rita Ellul, 49, originally from Iklin, was found dead in an apartment in Għajnsielem, Gozo in February 2023. An autopsy confirmed that she had been strangled to death, and forensic doctors said the victim had  fingerprints around her neck and also severe bruising in various parts of her body. The accused,  Lawrence Abina, Ellul’s partner, was jailed for life in March 2024 following a unanimous verdict by jurors. 
 He previously confessed to police that he strangled her because he thought she was cheating on him. Ellul had reported her partner to the police over  domestic violence. 
 Bernice Cassar, a mother of two, was shot dead on a road behind the MCAST campus in Paola on 22 November 2022. Her body was found outside her white Nissan Qashqai. Her estranged husband, Roderick, is  the prime suspect. He also faces criminal charges for domestic violence, following a report Bernice Cassar filed against him in May. He was arrested early on Wednesday morning when police officers stormed his house in Qrendi at the end of a  17-hour standoff. 
  Just one hour into her 30th birthday, Pelin Kaya was walking home from a her party when she was killed by a man driving a black BMW on 18 January 2023.
 Originally from Istanbul, the interior designer lived in Gżira, and had been living in Malta for over a year.
 The driver who ran her over, Maltese French national Jeremie Camilleri, then picked up stones and flung them at his victim’s body.
 In March, after admitting to the murder, he was sentenced to 40 years in jail, despite the judge saying she believed the sentence should have been higher. 
  Colombian national Sandra Ramirez, 43, was found dead with stab wounds on her body in an apartment on Sir George Borg Street on January 13 2024.
 Her ex-boyfriend, Fabian Eliuth Garcia Parada, had stabbed and slashed her body 26 times with a knife he had bought the previous day from a supermarket.
 Garcia Parada turned himself in to police and told them through a translation app: “I murdered my ex-partner in an argument inside my home.”
 Garcia Parada, 39, is the second person to be charged with the aggravated crime of femicide. The case is ongoing. 
  Nicolette Ghirxi, 48, was found dead in her Swatar apartment on Monday, 12 August 2024.
 The police shot dead the suspect, her Irish ex-partner Edward William Johnston after he pointed a replica gun at officers in St Julian’s.
 Family members told Times of Malta how Johnston ran fake social media accounts  to target Ghirxi, at one point making accusations about her sex life. 
 Ghirxi had filed a harassment report in April linked to some emails Johnston sent her after their breakup in December but did not believe her life was at risk at the time.
  Others would argue that the list of femicides is much longer.
 Some argue that journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, murdered by a car bomb in 2017, is a femicide. However her murder was also an attack on democracy and an assassination of one of the government’s harshest critics
 Lisa Marie Zahra, could also be included. She was just 15 years old when she was found dead at the bottom of Dingli cliffs in March 2014. Her former drama teacher, Erin Tanti pleaded guilty to murdering her and was handed a 20-year prison sentence back in 2019.
 Trans sex worker, Sion Grech was another victim, stabbed to death in 2005, at just 20 years old. 
 And Carmen Abela, along with her partner Joe Bartolo were killed by a man in their Marsa garage in October 2023.

"Over €50,000 in cash discovered in fraud investigation",maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/131161/over_50000_in_cash_discovered_in_fraud_investigation_,11-09-2024,004590.png,"Police have described discovering staggering amounts of cash- in excess of €50,000- in €20 and €50 notes, stashed in multiple locations together with other items by customs officials now charged with fraud, money laundering and participation in organised crime.
 Duncan Mangion, Carmel Busuttil, Jonathan Theuma, Jonathan Mizzi and his wife, Greta Mizzi, were arrested after a sting operation led by the European Public Prosecutors Office and arraigned in court last July, accused of the offences, together with Edward Mifsud, Marika Bugeja, Timothy Galea and Libyan businessman Otman Ali Otman Abdulkader.
  Magistrate Rachel Montebello heard police officers describe how around 40 handbags, 26 sets of curtains, as well as pendants, keychains, clothing, mobile phone covers, wallets and sunglasses - as well as around €25,000 in cash were found during a search of Edward Mifsud’s residence. Mifsud had confirmed to the police that the money was his and that he had received the case from container owners.
 The officials are believed to have received the cash and other items in return for allowing the shippers to under-declare the weights of the merchandise in order to pay less import duty and VAT.
 A search of Duncan Mangion’s residence had also returned similar items, the court was told.
 At Timothy Galea’s house, the police found approximately €18,000 stashed in a suitcase, together with bags, men's shoes, schoolbags, clothing, and luggage. A wallet containing €980 in cash was amongst the items retrieved from his car.
 The police officers testified that when they had searched Marika Bugeja’s apartment, they found her bedroom to be “full” of handbags, and had also found around €8,000 in cash.
 More cash was discovered stashed inside various rooms in the home of Convey Shipping and Trading Agency Ltd owner Greta Mizzi, including her children’s wardrobes.
 The case continues next month.
 Police inspector Joseph Xerri is prosecuting, together with EPPO official Geoffrey Azzopardi. The defendants are being represented by lawyers Franco Debono, Adreana Zammit, Arthur Azzopardi, Ishmael Psaila, Alfred Abela, Rene’ Darmanin, Michael Sciriha, Lucio Sciriha, and Roberto Spiteri.

Two men charged with robbing Gżira grocery store at knifepoint,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/129669/two_men_charged_with_robbing_gira_grocery_store_at_knifepoint,10-06-2024,004593.png,"Two men have denied armed robbery charges in connection with a hold-up at a grocery store in Gzira earlier this month.
 Usri Mifsud and Jonathan Vella, both from Bormla, were arraigned in court on Monday accused of stealing €600 in cash, at knifepoint, from a Gzira grocery store on 1 June.
  The men, both 22 years of age, appeared in the dock before Magistrate Leonard Caruana, accused of theft, aggravated by violence, means, time and value. The pair were also accused of carrying a knife in public without a police permit and detaining the cashier against his will and threatening to kill him with intent to extort money.
 Mifsud, who told the court that he worked in plumbing and electricity, was further charged with recidivism and committing an offence during the operative period of a suspended sentence which he had been handed last October.
 While the men were waiting for their lawyer to arrive, before the court was in session, Mifsud appeared willing to confess. “If we made a mistake, we made a mistake. We are ready to return the stolen money,”  he blurted out to the court.
 The man persisted, despite the court telling him to speak to a lawyer before saying anything else.  “I wasn’t in a good state. After my last court case I had been doing well but then something happened and problems started. I live with a friend… my children were taken away from me, my girlfriend made a fool of me, and we didn’t have enough to live on. My life didn’t stay the same,” Mifsud said, seeming to take a load off his chest.
 At that point, lawyer Ingrid Zammit Young arrived in the courtroom, replacing the defence’s missing legal aid lawyer. Zammit Young informed the court that she would be assisting both defendants for the purposes of their arraignment, but as she had spoken to Jonathan Vella first, she could only represent him, going forward. The court requested the Agency for Legal Aid to appoint another of its lawyers to assist Mifsud from the next sitting onward. 
 When the arraignment got underway, police inspector Pawney explained that the police had investigated a hold-up at a shop, which had been reported on 1 June. The investigation had established that two men approached the cashier while brandishing a knife and had made off with €600 in cash. 
 Vella was identified from CCTV, being recognised despite having covered his face. Mifsud was also later identified and an arrest warrant was issued for the men, who were subsequently taken into custody last night. 
 The men had cooperated with the police and the knife used during the robbery had also been recovered from their residence, added the inspector. 
 The magistrate explained to the men the consequences of admitting the charges, pointing out to Mifsud that he was already under an 18 month suspended sentence.
 Both defendants, after consulting with their lawyer, pleaded not guilty and requested bail.
 Prosecutor Martina Calleja argued that it was too early a stage to release the men, due to the risk of them suborning witnesses, in particular the cashier.
 Inspector Pawney submitted that the crime appeared to have been motivated by financial trouble and psychological issues on the part of at least one of the defendants. Mifsud had also recently been sentenced for theft, he said, adding that in view of the defendants’ socio-economic situation, there was a strong probability of further offences being committed.
 Zammit Young submitted that one of the men was gainfully employed and that neither of them knew the victim, whose workplace in Gzira was far from their hometown of Bormla. 
 The court, after hearing submissions, ruled that it was very early in the proceedings and that the prosecution still needed to bring the person who was allegedly robbed to testify. That person worked in a shop open to the public, the whereabouts of which is known to the defendants, observed the magistrate.
 “Besides this, the court notes that Usri Mifsud had committed these alleged crimes less than nine months after being convicted of similar offences.”
 For these reasons, the court refused the bail request, but urged the prosecution to bring their civilian witnesses in as short a timeframe as possible. 
 The prosecution’s request for a protection order in favour of the shopkeeper who was allegedly robbed, as well his family and any other witnesses, was upheld by the court.
 Prosecutor Martina Calleja from the Office of the Attorney General, assisted by police inspectors Shawn Pawney and Nico Zarb, asked the court to issue a protection order in favour of the cashier and to order that the defendants reimburse their alleged victim.
 Lawyer Ingrid Zammit Young was appointed to assist the defendants as legal aid counsel.  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police
"Man denied bail for phoning ex to speak to son, in alleged breach of court order",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/man-denied-bail-phoning-ex-speak-son-alleged-breach-court-order.1093835,06-11-2024,004596.png,"A magistrate has denied bail to a man who called his former partner’s phone to speak to his three-year old son, allegedly breaching a protection order prohibiting any such communication.
 “A protection order means that you do not communicate for any reason whatsoever, nothing, zero,” Magistrate Yana Micallef Stafrace said as she  presided over the arraignment of the 39-year old builder from Birkirkara.
 The man, whose name is not being disclosed to protect the identity of the alleged victim who is his estranged partner, was arrested after the woman reported him to the domestic violence unit on Sunday evening.
 The former couple are going through mediation at the Family Court and a protection order had been issued against the man pending those proceedings.
 Last Sunday, he repeatedly tried to call his partner on Facebook Messenger but she did not take his calls, the court was told.
 Around 7:15pm, he called her phone from an unknown number.
 Sensing that it might be her ex, the woman handed her mobile phone to her infant child, putting the device on speaker mode.
 The caller was her ex who told the boy, “Aw qalbi. Ħsibt li mhux se tweġibni dik il-minfuħa ommok” (Hello dear. I thought that big-headed mother of yours would not answer me)
 That call triggered the woman’s report to the police.
 Her ex was arrested and taken to court on Tuesday, pleading not guilty to misusing electronic communications equipment, insulting or threatening his ex and breaching a protection order.
 He was also charged with relapsing.
 The accused pleaded not guilty.
 His lawyer, Lennox Vella, made a request for bail arguing that family court proceedings were not to be used as a weapon to prevent the father from seeing his minor son.
 The woman had not hesitated in communicating with the accused when she wanted to go abroad for a week, entrusting their child in his care, he pointed out.
 Furthermore the protection order did not bar the father from speaking to his son, argued Vella.
 But the court observed that a protection order was “very clear.”
 “Whatever the situation it’s at [the alleged victim’s] discretion not his. A protection order means that you do not communicate, nothing, zero, zilch!”said the Magistrate, observing that since the call was made to the woman’s phone, the accused appeared to have prima facie breached the protection order.
 “Not a very clever thing to do!” she said.
 “How could he speak to his three-year old son?”insisted the accused’s lawyer, pointing out further that the man was a self-employed builder with clients lined up and waiting for his works.
 “She reported him for saying half a word. Let alone if he were to approach her! She’d go straight to the domestic violence unit,” went on the lawyer.
 The court observed that at arraignment stage it was not clear who was taunting who but a protection order meant that there could be no communication.
 The accused should seek other channels to communicate by speaking to his lawyer, went on the magistrate.
 The prosecution objected to the request for bail citing the fear of tampering with evidence since the alleged victim was still to testify.
 Moreover the accused had a criminal record that was five pages long.
 After hearing submissions the court turned down the request for bail.
 Inspector Christian Cauchi prosecuted.
 Lawyer Lennox Vella was defence counsel.

Simshar survivor cleared after his brother forgives him for assault,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/simshar-survivor-cleared-brother-forgives-assault.1091686,21-06-2024,"004598.png,004599.png","The sole survivor of the 2008 Simshar tragedy has been spared jail over a domestic violence incident with his brother who refused to testify against him in court, stalling criminal proceedings.
 Simon Bugeja, 50, from Marsaxlokk, was cleared of seriously injuring his brother during an altercation in December 2022 after the prosecution’s main witness refused to testify against his brother.
 Bugeja made headlines in July 2008 when he survived seven days at sea without food and water after an explosion on his fishing vessel, Simshar.
 The tragedy left four people dead: Bugeja’s father, Karmenu, 61; Noel Carabott, 33; Somali Abdulrahman Abdala Gedi, 21, while the body of Bugeja’s 11-year-old son, Theo, was never found.
  Bugeja was arrested in December 2022 shortly after a physical altercation with his brother, Marvin, outside their shared block of flats in Marsaxlokk.
 Police Inspector Sherona Buhagiar told the court that Marvin was the first to file a police report against his brother, telling the police that Simon had assaulted him with floor tiles.
 He claimed that he had to use a wooden pallet he found on the ground to defend himself from the attack. He suffered serious injuries to his hand in the assault. 
 He told the police that his mother had demolished her house and built a block of apartments, with the mother, the two brothers, and the mason taking one apartment each.
 On the day of the incident, while workers were on site, Simon Bugeja turned up and was angry at him because he usually took care of these things himself. He wanted to send the workers away.
 According to Marvin Bugeja, his brother suddenly aggressively turned towards him with floor tiles in his hand, telling him that he was not intimidated by him, and assaulted him with the tiles. The physical fight continued until workers and passers-by separated the two brothers.
 When an arrest warrant was obtained and Simon Bugeja was arrested, he told police it was his brother who had assaulted him, hurling the wooden pallet at him. He too had suffered injuries, which were classified as being of a slight nature.
 
 When proceedings continued last week before Magistrate Nadine Lia, Marvin Bugeja refused to testify against his brother, telling the court that it was an isolated incident that never happened again since and that he had forgiven his brother.
 The court declared the proceedings extinguished due to lack of evidence and Simon Bugeja not guilty of the charges brought against him.

 This emerged as criminal proceedings against former Transport Malta director Clint Mansueto and two of his former subordinates: Raul Antonio Pace and Philip Endrick Zammit, continued before magistrate Rachel Montebello on Monday.
  All three men are denying charges related to the driving tests racket.
 Witness Maria Assunta Camilleri testified on Monday.
 Camilleri had been arraigned herself in 2022 and pleaded guilty in June this year, to trading in influence and complicity in the bribery of a public official in connection with the Transport Malta bribery racket. She was handed a two-year Probation Order.
 Magistrate Montebello was informed that the woman had not appealed this conviction.
 On the witness stand, prosecutor Abigail Caruana Vella asked the woman about several texts that she had sent Mansueto about her nephew Marcus Galdes who was due to sit for driver’s licence tests, and had offered him money to make sure Galdes passed.
 Camilleri recognised Clint Mansueto in the courtroom, telling the court that she only knew him by his surname. “My nephew went to him for his theory test during the COVID-19 pandemic. They told me that the nearest exam slot was in six months’ time, so I spoke to Jesmond Zammit to see whether they could hurry things up and within two weeks it was done.”
  Asked who Jesmond Zammit was, the woman said that he was a Labour canvasser who had asked her mother in-law whether she needed anything, during a pre-election house visit to the residence which Camilleri shared with her relative. She had mentioned the test. The witness added that she had “erased everything” from her phone after the men were charged.
 Her nephew had failed his first test, but had passed on the second attempt, she added.
 “Then there were two other people who had the same problem, one was an Arab and another man was a friend of my sister’s husband. I met with them and told them to speak to Mansueto, because he’ll get it done for you.”
 The woman claimed that gratitude had been the only reason why she had given €50 to Mansueto before the test and said that she had told her nephew to do the same on the date of the test.“I had given him the €50 because I wanted to, not because he asked for anything. I went to Transport Malta myself and handed him the money as a gesture of thanks.”
 “Did he take them?” asked the magistrate. “To tell you the truth he didn’t want them, but I insisted.”
 Before her nephew’s theory test, she had texted Mansueto asking about the arrangements.
 The following November, she had texted Mansueto again, this time about the two men she had referred to him, and had also sent him a third SMS that month.
 She had told the Arab man who had wanted to obtain a motorcycle licence, to give Mansueto €50 “as a thank you,” she said. The man had told her that he had been unable to obtain a licence because he had no fixed address.
 She had also texted Mansueto with updates, telling him that the man was going to sit for his test on a certain date. She recalled that he had told her to tell her nephew to pay attention, because the youth had not attended his first test.
 She had gone to apply for the nephew’s commercial passenger carriage licence, which is known as a CPC. “[Mansueto] would let him skip the queue. Instead of six months I would wait two weeks,” said the woman. When asked what she had meant by asking Mansueto to “help” her nephew, she replied that he had provided assistance because the candidate could not read. 
 She insisted that she had told her nephew to hand him the €50. “A couple of days to a week later” she had gone to Mansueto and handed him another €50 herself, “as a thank you”, which he had accepted after initially refusing.
 Are you sure he would tell you “no I don’t want them”? asked the magistrate. The woman replied that she was.
 “Today he drives minibuses,” the woman told the court. The case continues.
 Lawyer Arthur Azzopardi is appearing for Mansueto, lawyers Joe Giglio and Roberta Bonello are representing Pace. Lawyer Herman Mula is defence counsel to Zammit.

 Last Sunday, Dalli confirmed reports that a man had left a jar of cannabis and a note saying, ""Next time I will be prepared with something for your children,” at her doorstep on July 31.
  The Commissioner said she had immediately filed a report to the police and provided them with security footage, adding that almost a month after the incident, police had told her that they had no update. 
 The incident was confirmed by Dalli after PN newspaper II-Mument published security footage showing the suspect parking outside Dalli's residence, leaving the item, and capturing a photo of it. 
 Dalli is in the last weeks of her five-year-term as European Commissioner.
 Dalli and her family had recently made headlines following Illum's report that Prime Minister Robert Abela is pushing back against suggestions by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to have Helena Dalli once again nominated as Malta’s commissioner.
 Dalli's husband, Patrick Dalli later alleged that two senior Labour Party officials are attempting to politically harm Dalli’s chances for commissioner, describing it as a ""fascist attack.""
 The couple's son, Luke Dalli then announced that he will no longer host productions on the PL's ONE TV and ONE Radio, after 14 years on the party's stations.  ",Matthew Farrugia ,court_and_police
ASA says waterpolo player's court action after 12-match ban was 'premature',timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/asa-says-waterpolo-player-court-action-12match-ban-premature.1096348,08-05-2024,004635.png,"Malta waterpolo's regulatory body on Monday stood by its decision to ban a player for 12 matches for biting other players, and argued that court action to overturn the ban was premature since other remedies could have been sought within the association's structures itself.
 San Giljan waterpolo player Ben Plumpton was disciplined by the disciplinary commissioner of the Aquatic Sports Association for biting two Sliema players during a match. An initial four-match ban was tripped on appeal.
 Plumpton went to court last week, seeking a warrant to stop the ban, arguing that the ASA's appeals board acted beyond its powers.
 But the ASA rebutted that Plumpton had other remedies at his disposal which he failed to exhaust before seeking an injunction in court. The civil courts, therefore, were not the proper forum to challenge and annul the decision of ASA’s Board of Appeal and the action was premature 
 The ASA’s statute said that the association’s council had the power “to remit or shorten” any sentence handed down by its internal organs “upon due cause being shown.” 
 Plumpton, therefore, could have simply asked his club to file a motion before the council asking for the revocation or reduction of the penalty. However, Plumpton and his club did nothing of the sort.  
 Moreover, the ASA said, the board’s appeal decision was in line with the association’s regulations and the association believed that such misbehaviour deserved “harsh sanctioning” as it harmed the reputation of the sport.
 The board of appeal members as well as the association’s secretary general denied that the board had acted beyond its remit, pointing out that St Julian’s club had appealed the commissioner’s decision on Plumpton’s behalf “in its entirety.”   
 Madam Justice Josette Demicoli is expected to decree on the matter in chambers.

Simon Mercieca denies Yorgen Fenech's mother ever influenced his writing,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/simon-mercieca-denies-yorgen-fenech-mother-ever-influenced-writing.1098285,19-09-2024,004660.png,"University academic and blogger Simon Mercieca denied receiving any payment from Yorgen Fenech’s mother, insisting that she never interfered in his writing, not even when he invited her for a meal at his family home.
 Mercieca strongly rebutted allegations made by author and publisher Mark Camilleri whom he sued for libel over an article wherein he alleged that Mercieca received payments from Patricia Fenech for writing in favour of her son who awaits trial for alleged complicity in the murder of Daphne Caruana Galizia.
 When cross-examined by Camilleri’s lawyer, Mercieca explained how his interest in the murder case first developed while following media reports about testimonies given during the compilation of evidence.
 The way certain things were being said “flashed red lights,” said Mercieca. “Something was not functioning well.”
 That line of thought was strengthened further when he received an anonymous letter containing information related to the murder case.
 As a university professor practising demographic studies, Mercieca had regularly followed and researched judicial cases, both civil and criminal, directing his students to carry out research, long before Fenech’s case.
 “Can you explain your demographic analysis so far on this case?” asked the respondent’s lawyer, Joseph Mizzi.
 “If by demographics you understand simply calculations on population, there are none. But demography also signifies the influence on a mass of people,” said Mercieca, adding that he kept his academic work and blog totally separate.
 The libel case concerned the blog.
 “Was your acquaintance with Yorgen Fenech’s mother another factor?” asked Mizzi.
 “It added to the interest in the case,” replied Mercieca.
 But he began to pen newspaper articles before 2013. He was also involved in drawing up the post-election report on the Nationalist Party’s defeat at the 2013 polls.
 He then turned to Facebook to defend Adrian Delia when there was an internal power struggle within the party to remove him as Opposition Leader.
 When his friends on Facebook totalled over 5000, he could receive no other friend requests.
 That was when Mercieca’s wife suggested starting a blog.
 When details of alleged chats between Fenech and Delia began to emerge, the murder case was “used against Delia to remove him.”
 “Daphne also did not want Delia,” said Mercieca.
 “That’s where my interest in the [murder] case started….It started in defence of Delia. The allegations by Jason Azzopardi and others continued even after Delia was removed.”
 When Camilleri’s lawyer pointed out that there were “over 166 articles” wherein the blogger stood up for Fenech, Mercieca rebutted that those “200 or so articles” were among “thousands” of other articles on his blog.
 Describing himself as a “fast writer” Mercieca said that the blog only took “an hour or two” of his time.
 There were others who contributed too.
 “It usually takes longer to read through the different versions published by different newspapers,” he added.
 Asked whether he received any remuneration for his blog, Mercieca said he only received “some very minor contributions” from the general public which he used to cover expenses.
 Questions then zoomed in on Yorgen Fenech’s mother.
 Mercieca first got to know her around the time of her son’s murder case. He was told that she originally hailed from Paola.
 But he was the one to approach her.
 Public comments labelling Patricia Fenech as “a murderer’s mother” were not condoned by him, Mercieca said.
 Asked whether the woman had ever offered him gifts or freebies, Mercieca recalled a single occasion when he had invited Patricia for a meal at his family home.
 It was around Christmas and she had gifted the family a food hamper.
 And when every summer he took his family on a one-time day by the pool at the Hilton, he always paid in cash.
 Patricia Fenech had once invited Mercieca and his family to her family home, sending an invite via Messenger.
 But she never offered payments and never interfered in the subject matter of his public writing.
 She thanked him for his work but stopped there.
 Mercieca denied having ever met the mother and her son’s lawyers at Portomaso.
 “Never, never,” he stressed.
 She once sent him a letter via Messenger asking whether he could publish it.
 “I had no difficulty publishing,” said Mercieca.
 Asked why in most of his articles he claimed that Yorgen was not guilty, Mercieca clarified that he never argued about guilt or otherwise.
 “I say that Yorgen Fenech was framed.”
 Asked about any damage caused by Camilleri’s article, Mercieca replied “yes and no.”
 He had faced great pressure from civil society group Repubblika and the University Rector to have him fired.
 He had also experienced some trouble with a local bank which first accepted a €50 cheque addressed to him and deposited by his wife, but subsequently returned it, saying that the endorsement was “irregular.”
 Camilleri had labelled Mercieca a “demented academic.”
 “I didn’t suffer monetary damage but academically yes. Obviously you get ostracized,” finished off the witness.
 The case is being presided over by Magistrate Rachel Montebello.
 Lawyer William Cuschieri assisted Mercieca.

Arrest v Summons: how charges against Joseph Muscat will unfold,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/arrest-v-summons-charges-joseph-muscat-unfold.1092073,21-06-2024,"004665.png,004666.png","Joseph Muscat and key figures face charges in the hospitals deal scandal and will be arraigned under summons, not arrest.
 The former prime minister, his chief of staff, Keith Schembri, ex-minister Konrad Mizzi and others will likely be informed this week of the charges they face.
 So too will deputy prime minister Chris Fearne, Central Bank governor Edward Scicluna and others who stand accused of fraud. 
 But when they eventually face Magistrate Rachel Montebello, they will not do so under a state of arrest.
 When the attorney general and the police want to issue criminal charges against a person, there are two ways to go about it. The person can either be arraigned under arrest or they can receive a court summons at home ordering them to appear in court to face charges on a specific date and time and in front of a specific magistrate.
 A person charged under arrest is taken to court by the police in a state of arrest. After the charges are read out in open court and the person pleads guilty or not guilty, that person has to be granted bail to be released from the state of arrest pending the outcome of the court case. If they aren’t granted bail, they are remanded in custody. The bail conditions usually include depositing their passport in court to ensure they cannot leave the island as well as other conditions that may include signing the police bail book, a curfew, house arrest and a deposit or personal guarantee.
 In the case of a summons, bail is not needed since that person was never in the state of arrest.
 They, therefore, do not risk being remanded in custody but the court has the discretion to order that the accused deposits his or her passport in court.
 In other words, Muscat and all those charged will be free to return home after they - presumably - plead not guilty to charges during their arraignment. But the court will still be able to temporarily confiscate their passports, if it deems that necessary. 
  According to the law, when the attorney general and the police issue charges they have to consider the risks.
 The decision centres around three questions:
 If the answer to any of the three questions is a ‘yes’, then the person is charged under arrest.
 If all three questions result in a ‘no’, then the arrest is not justified and the person is charged by summons.
 The goal of the law is to ensure the accused turns up to face charges while maintaining the presumption of innocence and the fundamental right to liberty.
 The severity of the crime does not come into it, unless it can result in fears of absconding, tampering with evidence or committing another crime.
 When the prosecutors opt for summons, they first send the charges to court.
 The case is assigned to a magistrate, in this case Magistrate Montebello, and the summons sheet (containing date, time and magistrate) is delivered to the accused by police officers.
 
 If a person who is served with a summons does not turn up for the sitting, then an arrest warrant is issued against that person.
 This is spelt out clearly in the summons document that is delivered to the person facing the charges.

"Man denied bail after getting caught selling cannabis, cocaine from his Marsa house",maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/131132/police_arrest_man_who_trafficked_cocaine_cannabis_from_his_marsa_house_,10-09-2024,004669.png,"A covert surveillance operation by police officers resulted in a man being arrested and charged with drug trafficking on Tuesday.
 Police Inspector Mark Cremona arraigned Mohammed Hassan Abdukadir, 36, from Somalia before magistrate Caroline Farrugia Frendo. The inspector told the court how the police had received information in August about a house in Marsa that was being used for drug trafficking. The information had also indicated the defendant as the person behind it.
  After obtaining an arrest warrant, police officers surveilling the property spotted him handing over what were recognised to be drugs to another man, at which point uniformed officers were told to move in to arrest him.
 Abdukadir is accused of trafficking cannabis, aggravated possession of the same and possession of cocaine in circumstances denoting it was not for personal use.
 He pleaded not guilty and requested bail.
 The prosecution objected to the bail request, telling the court that the man was found to be carrying some 400 grams of cannabis and a “considerable amount” of money. He had also told the police that he was unemployed, which raised the question as to how he would support himself if granted bail, said the inspector, adding that a civilian witness was yet to testify.
 The arrest came after a police surveillance operation on a residence in Marsa, said the inspector. Officers had tailed the defendant who was seen leaving the property until they observed him exchanging some packages with another person in return for cash. The Somali man was stopped and searched, with police finding a substance thought to be cannabis, as well as cash. The man who he had handed the items to was also found to be in possession of suspected cannabis which he had just bought.
 Searches at his home recovered more cash, drugs, cocaine and cannabis as well as paraphernalia related to drug trafficking.
 Bail was denied.

"Father and son who threatened Żejtun council secretary fined €2,000",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/father-son-threatened-zejtun-council-secretary-fined-2000.1096849,16-08-2024,004671.png,"A public employee and his father who admitted to threatening and insulting the executive secretary of the Żejtun local council, were fined €2,000 upon arraignment on Santa Maria. 
 Court on Thursday heard that tensions had been simmering for a while between the executive secretary and 22-year-old Ayrton Camilleri, an employee at the Notary to Government office who had been seconded to the Żejtun's council office.
 Camilleri’s lawyer Herman Mula said the two had had some arguments in the past but the situation boiled over on Wednesday, prompting a call for assistance from the Żejtun council office to the police. 
 Officers who went on site found Camilleri arguing with Falzon. 
 Both men - as well as the mayor - were asked to go to the district police station to provide their version of events. 
 While that process was ongoing, Camilleri’s father - 64-year-old Emmanuele - entered the police station.
 “Are you Anton?” asked the man, addressing the council secretary. 
 When the other man replied in the affirmative, the father began to threaten and verbally assault him. 
 The police stepped in to restore calm. 
 But the verbal aggression resumed once the council secretary and the Camilleri duo stepped outside. 
 The Camilleris continued to threaten and insult Falzon, leading to their arrest.
 On Thursday, the pair were escorted to court and charged with insulting and threatening the executive secretary who was carrying out public duties. 
 Both registered an admission which they confirmed after being duly warned by the court that they were each liable to a maximum fine of €5,000. 
 Their lawyer pointed out that the fact that the accused had already spent 24 hours under preventive arrest was in itself a form of punishment.
 Such incidents would normally be prosecuted under summons, rather than under arrest.
 However, it was for the police to decide upon the manner of prosecution.
 Neither father nor son were “criminals”, argued Mula. The whole episode was to serve both father and son a lesson, said the lawyer, suggesting a conditional discharge by way of punishment. 
 The prosecution did not object. 
 However, after hearing those submissions the court, presided over by Magistrate Charmaine Galea, imposed a fine in respect of both. 
 The father was fined €1,200, while his son was fined €800. 
 The court also upheld the prosecution’s request for a restraining order, warning the defendants that although they could visit the Żejtun local council offices, they were not to address the executive secretary. 
 Inspector John Sammut prosecuted.

Couple denied bail after allegedly staging woman's kidnap to extort money from her parents,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/129562/couple_denied_bail_after_allegedly_staging_womans_kidnap_to_extort_money_from_her_parents,04-06-2024,004672.png,"A couple from Qormi have been accused of trying to extort €3,000 from one of their parents by staging the woman’s kidnap. 
 Darren Spiteri, 44, and Graziella Francalanza, 43, both pleaded not guilty to charges of attempted extortion, misuse of telecommunications equipment and carrying a knife in public without a police permit. Francalanza was further charged with driving offences while Spiteri alone was also accused of breaching bail conditions.
  Police inspector Roderick Attard told Magistrate Gabriella Vella that the woman’s mother had gone to the St. Julians Police Station to report that she had received a phone call from her daughter, who claimed to have been kidnapped for a €3,000 ransom. At one point during the phone call, the daughter’s partner - Spiteri - had also spoken to her. 
 Francalanza’s parents told the “kidnapper” that they didn’t have access to €3,000 but convinced him to accept €80 instead. Police went to the designated place in Blanche Huber Street, Sliema, where they found the couple’s daughter unbound and in no danger. Further investigations suggested that the defendants had intended to extort the money to buy drugs.
 Not guilty pleas were entered on behalf of both defendants by their lawyers, Marion Camilleri and Franco Debono. Bail was also requested.
 Inspector Attard objected to bail, arguing that the principal witnesses were one of the defendants’ parents, which posed a “serious and manifest risk” to the evidence.
 He added that the pair’s drug addiction meant that there was a higher risk of them committing further crimes.
 Camilleri counter-argued that there was “absolutely no truth” to the statement that drug addicts were more likely to commit crimes, pointing out that Francalanza’s previous convictions were very old and questioning why the police had not taken down a declaration or statement -from the defendants if there was such a risk to the witnesses.
 “The prosecution should not be the cause of the exception to the rule of liberty,” argued the lawyer.
 “I have known Graziella since we were children. She is an ex-police officer and it is a shame to see her deprived of her liberty for reasons attributable to the prosecution.” Francalanza had two children, one aged 9 and another, 20, added the lawyer.
 The court, after hearing the submissions on bail, rejected the request for the defendants’ release, due to the fact that the alleged victims are the elderly parents of one of them and were known to the other. “At this stage the risk of tampering with evidence is real and so the request is premature.”
 The court made a recommendation that the prison director should provide them with assistance to overcome their drug dependence  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police
Man charged with cutting up body and disposing of it in suitcase,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/man-charged-cutting-body-disposing-suitcase.1102461,14-12-2024,,"A Colombian man alleged to have chopped up a dead man’s body, stuffed the parts into a suitcase and then dumped it at sea pleaded not guilty to criminal charges on Saturday.
 Andres Leonardo Gamboa Duran, 43, from Cucuta, Colombia, appeared in court shortly after police held a press conference to inform the public that they would not be charging the accused with murder for the time being.
 Instead, prosecutors opted to cite him for aggravated drug possession and trafficking, profiting from illicit proceeds, money laundering, tampering with criminal evidence and trying to conceal a body that died as a result of a criminal offence.  
 Appearing in court wearing a white hoodie emblazoned with the slogan ‘Gang Signs’, Duran was assisted in court by an interpreter.
 He pleaded not guilty to the charges before Magistrate Marse Ann Farrugia.
 Duran, who lives in Msida, was arrested earlier this week following a nationwide manhunt for the person responsible for a gruesome discovery made inside a suitcase found floating off Gżira.
 The suitcase was initially spotted by two minors out on a paddle boat who hauled it back to shore, police inspector Wayne Camilleri told the court.
 Once back on land, they informed two adults, who opened the suitcase themselves. When they realised they were looking at a dismembered body, they immediately called the police.
  Testifying in court on Saturday, inspector Camilleri said the suitcase was photographed as it was found in Gżira before being closed up and taken to the morgue for further investigation.
 Once there, it was reopened in front of the police and court officials.
 An investigation confirmed that the body was of a naked man save for an adult nappy. The man’s dismembered hands and feet had been bundled into plastic bags and stuffed in the suitcase.
 The victim had 101 capsules of cocaine inside his stomach. Police say they believe he was also a Colombian national but have not yet definitively identified him. They say they are still not sure why the cocaine was left there. 
 The suitcase still had its pricing sticker attached, and that helped police quickly narrow down the shop where it was purchased – a store in San Ġwann.
 CCTV footage extracted from the shop revealed that the person who purchased the suitcase the previous day had also bought an axe from the store.
 Investigators then tracked the suspect down to an Msida apartment block. After obtaining an arrest warrant from a magistrate, police moved in.
 Inside, they found Duran with a 39-year-old Portuguese man and a lot of drug paraphernalia indicating a trafficking operation. The Portuguese man is to be charged separately, police said earlier on Saturday.
 The magistrate upheld a request for a freezing order on Duran’s assests.
 No request for bail was made at this stage and Duran was remanded in custody.
 Police inspectors Kurt Colombo Zahra and Wayne Camilleri together with AG lawyers Kaylie Bonett and Dejan Darmanin prosecuted.

 Four men and a woman are under arrest after police officers were assaulted when they issued a ticket for an illegally parked car in Ħamrun.
  The police said a number of people came out of a catering establishment when the officers issued the parking ticket. The officers were forced to use pepper spray when their orders were ignored and they were assaulted. 
 One officer was seriously injured and the other suffered slight injuries. Both were hospitalised.
 The situation was brought under control when reinforcements arrived.
 The arrested people are a woman aged 42, and four men aged 46, 44, 33 and 23. Two of them were arrested at their homes after fleeing the scene. 
 They are due to be taken to court later on Sunday.
 A magisterial inquiry is underway.

 Iklin resident Anthony Stivala pleaded guilty to charges of handling stolen property and knowingly keeping cultural property owned by the nation, during his arraignment before magistrate Leonard Caruana on Friday.
 The court heard how police had searched the man’s home on Thursday and found the items wrapped up in towels, fortunately undamaged. Stivala told the officers that he was unaware that the items had been stolen. 
  After Stivala confirmed his guilty plea, having been given time to reconsider the court declared him guilty on his own admission and sentenced the man to a two-year prison term, which it  suspended for four years. 
 Defence lawyers Roberto Spiteri and Joanne Scerri told the court that their client did not intend to appeal.
 It is understood that Stivala will be asked to testify against Ljubica Zivkovic, who last month was charged with, amongst other things, the aggravated theft of the artefacts. Zivkovic denied the charges and was remanded in custody.
 The court was informed only three of the four items stolen from the palace had been retrieved so far.

Biting back: waterpolo player fights tripled suspension with legal action,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/130479/biting_back_waterpolo_player_fights_tripled_suspension_with_legal_action,29-07-2024,004688.png,"A waterpolo player who was recently suspended and fined for allegedly biting two players from an opposing team has filed a court injunction against the league organisers to halt the execution of the judgement in his appeal, which saw his fine increased and his suspension period tripled.
 Ben Plumpton, who plays for St. Julians ASC filed the injunction against the Aquatic Sports Association of Malta, after a shock decision by the association’s appeals board to increase the four-game suspension and €1,000 fine originally imposed by the association’s disciplinary board, to 12 games and €1,270, respectively.
  In the original decision, delivered on July 18, the Disciplinary Commissioner had cleared Plumpton of two of the charges, namely behaving in such a way that is likely to bring the sport into disrepute and behaving in such a way that is likely to give a bad example, and found him guilty of the offence of committing a violent action during a match, for which he received the four-game suspension, the maximum punishment allowed by the regulations.
 The opposing team, Sliema ASC, who had filed the original complaint, did not appeal that decision, which subsequently became final.
 The only appeal was one filed by Plumpton, who claimed to have been defending himself. “But in its decision handed down on July 19, the appeal board not only did not uphold the appeal, but (to everyone’s surprise) changed the Disciplinary Commissioner’s decision…and found Ben Plumpton guilty of charges which he had already been acquitted of and to which decision no appeal had been filed.”
 In his appeal application, Plumpton’s lawyers, Carlos Bugeja and Charles Mercieca argued that the July 19 decision was both defective and procedurally irregular, and had resulted in “enormous prejudice” to the player, who will effectively have to miss the rest of the season.
 They argued that the Board of Appeal had not increased the punishment, but had changed the original decision by finding guilt on charges from which he had already been conclusively acquitted.
 It would have been bad enough had the board increased the punishment awarded for the offence subject to appeal, said the lawyers, but a reading of the decision immediately shows that the board had gone one further and reversed his acquittal for offences which were not even the subject of the appeal which the player had filed.
 It was a well-established legal principle that an appellant cannot be placed in a worse position than the one he was in before he filed his appeal, said the lawyers, adding that the decision also breached one of the basic principles of natural justice - that both parties be allowed to have their say.
 As during the hearing of the case, the board had stated that it would not be considering the offences Plumpton had been acquitted of, it had not heard any defence evidence or submissions about them.
 In a decree handed down earlier on Monday, Madame Justice Josette Demicoli ordered that the ASA be notified and must file its reply within the next ten days.
 The court, however, did not uphold the player’s request for a provisional injunction that would allow him to return to the pitch after August 3, on which date he would have served the original four game suspension, saying that it needed time to examine whether it had the power to halt the execution of a decision that had already been given. The case was adjourned to August 12.  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police

 The case goes back to 2016, when D'Anastas had applied for the position but was passed over, prompting him to seek recourse through the Ombudsman and later the courts, claiming unfair treatment.
 In 2021, the Ombudsman had ruled that the decision to pass certain officers in the selection process appeared to have been a personal choice of the former police commissioner Lawrence Cutajar.
  In light of this, the Ombudsman had recommended that the Police Commissioner reopen applications for this rank, allowing officers in the complainants situation to resubmit their application for the post. At the time, a €15,000 compensation was suggested by the Ombudsman.
 On Thursday, a court concluded that the selection process unfairly favoured certain candidates, depriving D'Anastas of a fair chance at promotion. However, Judge Joanne Vella Cuschieri clarified that this did not imply that those promoted were undeserving, but that others, like D’Anastas, were unjustly overlooked.
 D’Anastas argued for compensation based on loss of earnings and a lower police pension, estimating his losses at €112,000 over 20 years. The court awarded him just over half of that amount, noting that even without discrimination, promotion was not guaranteed.
 The court also reasoned that calculating pension losses over 20 years was speculative and uncertain, leading the court to reduce the compensation accordingly.
 Lawyer David Bonello represented the plaintiff.

 Police Inspector Ritienne Gauci and Prosecutor Claire Sammut arraigned 40-year-old Stefan Cutajar from Xemxija on Thursday before Magistrate Rachel Montebello. Cutajar was charged with breaking into and stealing from nine different vehicles, which had been parked in various localities.
  The court was told that CCTV footage collected as part of the investigations into the break-ins had identified several people, one of whom was Cutajar.
 He was arrested on September 7 upon his return from Sicily and had spent the next few days in hospital, being treated for an unspecified ailment. He had been granted police bail during that time and was rearrested after his discharge from hospital.
 “Cutajar you are charged with nine thefts in all, as well as with breaching your bail conditions. These are serious charges, you have a lawyer to assist you and you may remain silent,” explained the magistrate before asking the defendant how he wanted to reply to the charges.
 A not guilty plea was filed and defence lawyer Amadeus Cachia requested that the defendant be released on bail.
 The prosecution objected to that request, describing it as being premature as the victims, one of whom had confronted him during the commission of the crime, had not yet testified.
 Militating against his release was the fact that he was already on bail, had gone to the police station an hour later than ordered to and hadn’t provided an address to the police.
 There was also the issue of Cutajar’s 103-page criminal record.
 Cachia denied that there had been any confrontation between the defendant and the victims. The lawyer conceded that Cutajar did have “a past and present problem with drug abuse” and explained that pending the outcome of an appeal in a separate case, he had been permitted by the courts to travel to his mother's house in Sicily “to stay out of trouble.”
 The judge had allowed him to stay with his mother until the end of September, insisted the lawyer, reminding the court that in prison, “drug problems tended to get worse.”
 Sammut interjected to point out that the defendant’s mother had filed an application asking to withdraw a bail guarantee which she had provided in another case, but the defence lawyer replied that a compromise had been reached, in terms of which Cutajar would be allowed to reside with his mother in Sicily. “He is bound to inform the police of his presence in Malta within 24 hours of arrival, but was arrested immediately,” complained the lawyer.
 The court denied bail in view of both the man’s drug problem, and his criminal record, explaining that Cutajar “cannot be described as trustworthy” and saying that it was not  convinced that he would obey his bail conditions if he were to be released from arrest. It also ordered Cutajar’s probation officer to continue to keep tabs on him during these proceedings.  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police

 Jake Dalli Balzan was also accused of being part of a group of people who assaulted the victim on 23 November in Mqabba and of being in possession of a flick knife. Two of the people in the group had also brandished weapons, one of which was found in the accused’s garage.

 Dalli Balzan appeared in front of Magistrate Giannella Busuttil and was charged with causing the victim slight injuries without the intention of killing her, trying to extort money from her, forming part of a group of more than three persons that assaulted the girl and illegal possession of a flick knife. He pleaded not guilty.

 Sources privy to the incident have told MaltaToday the assault happened outside the victim’s house. The victim is understood to have been bullied at school by a group of students, including a 13-year-old girl. MaltaToday understands that Dalli Balzan is a close friend of one of the students who were bullying the victim.

 “From 110 instances in 2017, this number dropped to 36 reports in 2023. As at September 23, 2024, we recorded 24 reported cases of violence against police,” he said.
 Twenty-three males and five females have been charged in court in this regard. Proceedings against 17 of these cases are still ongoing, while the others were concluded, and the accused found guilty.
 Violence against police refers to the incidents when police officers were physically assaulted during their line of duty, the police explained, and the dramatic decline in reports shows respect towards officers is on the rise.
 “This demonstrates that only a small minority disrespects the police. We would like to express our gratitude to the public for their continued support and daily appreciation of our work,” he said.
 Police sources said it is believed the decline was primarily driven by the introduction of body-worn cameras in 2021.
 “People think twice before assaulting an officer now, because they know they’re being filmed,” one source said.
 Times of Malta was handed the figures after an incident on Saturday evening in Ħamrun, when two police constables – Clive Mallia and Aidan Demicoli – were assaulted after issuing a parking ticket.
 Bystanders filmed the assault on their phones and the footage quickly circulated on social media, sparking shock.
 Earlier this week police said the two officers were equipped with pepper spray, taser, and batons and one of them also had a service firearm (Glock).
 All officers undergo practical training covering safe weapon handling, control and restraint techniques, use of taser and pepper spray, and public order and crowd management, the police said.
 All are equipped with handcuffs, pepper spray, a baton, a radio and as of recently, with body-worn cameras and an upgraded baton.
 Four men and a woman were charged in court with last weekend’s crime. They all pleaded not guilty but were denied bail.
 Since then, the Home Affairs Ministry confirmed the government is looking into toughening the law.
 Sources close to government said this could possibly mean judges would be empowered to hand out heavier fines, longer prison sentences and even replace probation and suspended sentences with actual jail time in several cases of violence against public officials.
 People found guilty of assaulting policemen are generally slapped with fines ranging between €3,000 and €20,000, and are sometimes handed suspended jail terms ranging between six months and four years, depending on the severity of the assault and whether they committed other crimes during the same incident.
 Earlier this year a UK professional golfer was fined €4,000 and her friend was slapped with a €6,000 fine after the two admitted to assaulting and disobeying police at the airport while drunk.
 And just this week a Spanish national was jailed for nine months after he went on a wrecking spree on a Paceville street, jumping on cars and injuring a policeman as he violently resisted arrest.
 Lawyer and former MP Jason Azzopardi is among those who advocated for the law to be changed so that people who assault public officials must inevitably go to prison.

Updated | Chef remanded in custody for 146kg Freeport drug bust,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/132389/freeport_drug_bust_police_arrest_third_man_connected_to_organised_crime_network,21-11-2024,004789.png,"Another man has been remanded in custody after he was arraigned and charged in connection with a 146kg seizure of drugs reported earlier last week.

 Kurt Scicluna, a 31-year old self-employed chef residing in Zejtun, has pleaded not guilty to a number of charges including conspiracy to traffic drugs, trafficking of cocaine, criminal association, money laundering and recidivism.

                     The arraignment follows what were described by the police in a press statement as ‘intense investigations’ which led to the arrest of a third person allegedly involved in what they describe as an ‘organised crime network in the country’.

 The police further confirmed the seizure of jewellery, luxury cars and significant amounts of cash in connection with the arrest.

 The prosecution successfully requested a freezing order on the accused and the defence did not contest the validity of the arrest.

 No request for bail was made by the accused at this stage.

 Lawyers Kevin Valletta and Maria Francesca Spiteri were present on behalf of the Attorney General. Inspectors Mark Mercieca and Lianne Bonello led the prosecution on behalf of the police.

 Lawyers Roberto Spiteri and Michael Sciriha represented the accused.

Man charged with sexually harassing 11-year-old refuses to sign protection order,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/man-sexually-harassing-11year-old-refuses-sign-protection-order.1094121,18-06-2024,004806.png,"A jobless man with no fixed residence was remanded in custody on Tuesday afternoon after pleading not guilty to sexually harassing an 11-year-old boy on Sunday evening. 
 But the sitting ended on an unusual note when the accused refused to sign the protection order binding him to stay away from the alleged victim. 
 The incident allegedly took place between 6 and 8 pm at Misraħ is-Summit in Birżebbuġa when the suspect, Jar Annabi Mohammad Abdallah, a 21-year-old Sudanese national, touched the minor’s bottom. 
 Details about the incident were scarce when the suspect was charged this afternoon, his loud complaints reaching the courtroom even before the man himself had made an appearance. 
 Assisted by an Arab-speaking interpreter the man spoke loudly in his native language, seemingly in protest, gesturing with his hands as his interpreter and lawyer signalled to him to stop. 
 Wearing a Manchester United top, camouflage-patterned bermudas and trainers, the man fell silent as the hearing got underway. 
 But his occasional outbursts persisted, his voice loud and clear. 
 “If he continues in this manner, he’s in for trouble,” warned presiding Magistrate Caroline Farrugia Frendo as the interpreter promptly translated the warning to the accused. 
 The man pleaded not guilty to committing a non-consensual sexual act against the minor who was a vulnerable person in terms of law.
 He was also charged with offending public morals or decency, harassing the boy by subjecting him to an act of physical intimacy.
 He was also allegedly drunk in public. 
 The accused pleaded not guilty. 
 His lawyer did not request bail.
 The prosecution requested the court to issue a protection order in respect of the minor and his family relatives. The request was upheld. 
 But when a member of the magistrate’s staff approached the accused with the written protection order for him to sign, according to standard procedure, the accused simply refused. 
 Hands on hips, he stood next to the interpreter, stubbornly refusing. 
 “He’s rather difficult,” explained the interpreter.
 Faced with that attitude, prosecuting Inspector John Spiteri minuted that although the accused had been placed under a protection order, he chose not to sign it even though it was translated to him by the court-appointed interpreter. 
 The court stated that such an order was issued ‘ex lege’ (in terms of law) and it was recorded in the acts of the case whether the accused signed or not.

 Nkem Junior Anthony, 32-year-old Nigerian-born with an Irish identity card, was heading home on Tuesday at around 6pm. 
 An airline employee stopped him at the boarding gate and informed him that he could not take his 10Kg hand luggage on the plane.
 The woman asked him to step out of the queue.

Three fined over 2016 death of 19-year-old construction worker,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/128827/three_fined_over_2016_death_of_19yearold_construction_worker,25-04-2024,004823.png,"Three men have been fined €26,000 between them in connection with the death of a 19-year-old construction worker, who died in 2016 after falling from a height at a building site in Pietà.
 George Cassar, 61, from Qormi, Joseph Grech, 60, from Pietà and 71-year-old Anthony Sammut from Sliema were charged with the involuntary homicide of Samuel Camilleri.
 Camilleri died on 23 February 2016 on a construction site on Triq id-Duluri tal-Pietà. The 19-year-old victim had fallen to his death from a height of three storeys, suffering fractures to his skull and a number of ribs.
  In court it emerged that at the time of the incident, Camilleri and contractor George Cassar had been putting up shuttering on the third floor in preparation for the pouring of concrete when the victim fell down into the internal yard. Neither Grech, who was the project supervisor, nor Sammut had been on site at the time of the incident.
 Cassar, who was the victim’s employer, had also been charged with a number of offences relating to health and safety breaches, as well as with recidivism.
 The project’s supervisors, Grech and Sammut, had been accused of failing to appoint competent supervisors at both the design and construction stages, as well as with having failed to prepare a health and safety plan.
 Grech, who was the owner of the building and the project’s supervisor, was further accused of failing to coordinate and implement general health and safety principles.
 Sammut and Grech had agreed that Sammut would pay half of the project’s expenses.
 In his judgement, Magistrate Leonard Caruana noted how the Ħamrun district police were informed after Camilleri was admitted to Mater Dei Hospital, where he died a short while later.
 Architect Charles Farrugia had gone to the site at the request of the Occupational Health and Safety Authority. The court heard how Farrugia had found a pool of blood on the floor of the internal yard and on some wooden boards there. He discovered missing boards on the shuttering, corresponding to those found in the internal yard, below.
 The architect found that several health and safety measures had not been implemented. The victim and a colleague had been preparing the shuttering for a balcony, on wooden boards that were only secured at one end. Were someone to step on the boards, they would give way, he said.
 The site had first been issued with a stop order in January 2011, and another one was subsequently issued on the day of the fatal incident, said the witness, who also exhibited an email featuring the Occupational Health and Safety Plan dated 29 March 2016.
 Grech was listed as the client and project supervisor on official documentation. The architect observed that although this was not illegal, the defendant had no qualifications, training or even experience in the field.
 A health and safety officer who had submitted the plans to the OHSA in May 2016 testified that at the time of his engagement, one or two storeys had already been built. The OHSA had issued a Stop Order, requiring a competent health and safety officer be present on site, as well as remedial works be undertaken.
 Another court expert testified that the shuttering was being prepared on the second floor, he explained that it was impossible to set up safety nets when carrying out that type of work on a roof and that harnessed were impractical when carrying out formwork.
 Although helmets were available on site, the victim had not been wearing one at the time of his fall.
 Jeffrey Cassar, son of one of the defendants, had not been present on site when the incident happened, but testified to having frequently reprimanded Camilleri for looking at his phone while carrying out dangerous tasks. Camilleri phone had started ringing when his body was being taken away, he added.
 A fellow worker who had been working on another part of the site also told the court that he had seen the victim using his phone several times on the day he died, and that Camilleri had been arguing with someone on a phone call earlier that morning.
 A number of previous OHSA inspections had found nothing wrong.
 Grech told the court that he had told Camilleri not to use the phone twice on the day of the incident, on one occasion after seeing the victim on his phone, while walking along the unsecured shuttering boards.
 Cassar was fined €10,000 after being found guilty of involuntary homicide and health and safety breaches.
 Grech was also found guilty of involuntary homicide and a health and safety violations, for which he was ordered to pay a €9,000 fine.
 Sammut was fined €7,000 for health and safety breaches.
 The defendants were also ordered to pay a total of €2,085.96 in court expenses, between them.

Malta's first strategy to fight human trafficking launched,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/malta-first-strategy-fight-human-trafficking-launched.1096165,08-01-2024,004840.png,"Malta’s first national anti-trafficking strategy has been launched and will seek to better protect human trafficking victims, the bulk of who are exploited at work.
 One of the measures proposed in the strategy seeks to explore the introduction of guaranteed compensation for victims with confiscated assets of their abuser used to pay for the damages they suffered.
 The National Anti-Trafficking Strategy for 2024-2030 will equip Malta with more effective tools for the prevention of human trafficking, the protection of victims of trafficking and the prosecution of offenders.
 Drawn up by the Human Rights Directorate,  it will contribute to strengthening a human rights-based, gender and child-sensitive, interdisciplinary, and cross-sectoral approach to combatting human trafficking, developing a system for the early identification of victims, and the provision of timely assistance to victims and their access to justice, including compensation.
 The strategy will be implemented over seven years (2024 - 2030), with actions of its National Action Plan to be implemented over four years (2024 - 2027). For the first time, it brings together all stakeholders and creates a common understanding of combatting human trafficking in Malta and the roles of government bodies and civil society. 
 The strategy is built on five strategic priorities:
 In terms of victim protection, it lays down that efforts will be made to improve victim identification and protection, strengthen the system of assistance to all victims (including potential victims) of trafficking, facilitate temporary residency permits, enhance legal assistance and free legal aid, and guarantee effective access to compensation amongst other things. 
 The report outlines the human trafficking reality in Malta. According to the 2023 US Trafficking in Persons Report, in 2022, the police and Aġenzija Appoġġ identified 14 foreign trafficking victims (12 for the purpose of sexual exploitation and two for forced labour), compared to 18 victims identified in 2021.
 According to the 2021 report issued by the Council of Europe Group of Experts on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings (GRETA)  the total number of formally identified victims of human trafficking in 2017-2020 was 44: five in 2017 (all women), and 35 in 2018 (13 men, 22 women, one child).
 To date, the adult victims who were formally identified were foreign nationals, mainly from Ukraine and the Philippines, Nepal, China, and more recently from South America, including Columbia.
 In 2018, the Maltese authorities formally identified for the first time a child victim of trafficking who had arrived in Malta in 2018 as an unaccompanied child and was subsequently sexually exploited. Furthermore, in 2020, three Maltese children were identified as victims of trafficking.
 “In addition to these statistics on formally identified victims by the police, there are a number of potential victims of trafficking in human beings who have refused to report to the police and have been assisted by NGOs,” the report states.
 During the period of 2017-2020, the predominant form of exploitation of the identified victims was labour exploitation (77% of the victims), followed by trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation.
 The report noted that the direct link between obtaining residence permits and employment contracts in Malta via the Single Work Permit “seems to contribute to increasing the vulnerability of the migrant workers who are unlikely to report abusive working conditions because of fear of losing their residence permit which is tied to the work permit.”
 Despite the fact that all third-country nationals are permitted to change employment without providing a reason or any other previous employment tenure, in practice, this does not seem to take place easily, the report said.
 Parliamentary secretary Rebecca Buttigieg said that the government is committed to continuing to fight human trafficking with this strategy by implementing legislative and administrative action over the next 7 years. 
 To achieve this, she said that an inter-ministerial committee has been set up to take the necessary action and make sure the strategy is implemented.

Police bribery: Gym owner charged with bribing sergeant to leak investigation details,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/132501/gym_owner_charged_with_bribing_police_sergeant_to_leak_investigation_details,28-11-2024,004880.png,"A Marsascala gym owner has been remanded in custody after pleading not guilty to charges of bribery, involvement in a criminal organisation, and other serious crimes.

 Ruud Buhagiar, 30, was arraigned on Thursday, accused of bribing a police sergeant to obtain sensitive information about ongoing police operations. Prosecutors allege that Buhagiar’s actions undermined the integrity of the police force and facilitated criminal activity.

                     The case began in October when police were investigating a planned robbery that ultimately fell through. Suspicion soon turned to Buhagiar, one of the suspects. Investigators discovered that a member of the police force had leaked operational details to third parties, including Buhagiar.

 A breakthrough came on November 18, when police arrested Police Sergeant Cherise Camilleri after obtaining a search and arrest warrant. Data extracted from her phone reportedly revealed she had passed sensitive information to Buhagiar.

 Three days later, Buhagiar was arrested at the airport upon returning from a holiday abroad. However, after requiring medical treatment at Mater Dei Hospital, he was released on police bail.

 Further investigations uncovered data from Buhagiar’s phone linked to various police operations, including raids conducted by the drug squad. Upon arraignment, he faced multiple charges, including promoting a criminal organisation, bribery, complicity in drug trafficking, and cannabis possession under circumstances suggesting intent beyond personal use.

 He was also charged with improper use of electronic communications equipment and recidivism. Prosecutors requested a freezing order on his assets, which was upheld by the court.

 Defence lawyers Alfred Abela and René Darmanin requested bail, arguing that the case primarily rested on phone data already preserved by the police. They noted that media coverage had alerted potential suspects, and further investigations could proceed without detaining Buhagiar.

 However, Prosecuting Inspectors Christina Delia and Lydon Zammit objected, citing the severity of the charges and the risk of witness tampering. Inspector Zammit emphasised the defendant’s lack of trustworthiness. “He corrupted the whole system,” he said.

 The prosecution also mentioned the ongoing nature of the investigation, with several witnesses, including civilians, yet to testify.

 Magistrate Abigail Critien denied bail due to the grave nature of the offences and the potential risk to the integrity of the investigation.

 The case is being prosecuted by Assistant Attorney General lawyers Kevin Valletta and Maria Francesca Spiteri.     ",Nicole Meilak ,court_and_police

 Svetlana Muscat, who serves as the Correctional Services Agency's (CSA) Head of Strategy, has now been put on forced leave. 
 Sources close to the Home Affairs Ministry told Times of Malta the issue was internally flagged on Friday and police questioned her on Saturday.
 Fenech, a business magnate and heir to the Tumas family fortune, is being held in prison while he awaits trial for his alleged role in the murder of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia. 
 Prosecutors allege he masterminded that crime and paid hitmen to have Caruana Galizia killed in 2017. 
 The people that Fenech allegedly met in Muscat's office have not yet been identified, but lawyer Jason Azzopardi on Tuesday alleged on Facebook that they were ""business people"".
 It is also unclear whether Muscat's office was used for such meetings on more than one instance. 
  According to prison regulations, all visits to prisoners must take place in approved visiting areas. Visits must also be monitored by CCTV camera, save for conjugal visits.
 To enter the offices of prison administration officials like Muscat, a special written permit is required. 
 In a statement on Tuesday, the Home Affairs Ministry told Times of Malta that police were alerted to the allegations last week and triggered an immediate investigation.
 ""The person in question has been on forced leave from her job at CSA [Correctional Services Agency] since then.""
 Sources also said police will now decide whether Muscat will face criminal charges or be subjected to disciplinary measures.

 The accused, Yusef Hamki Said, is a 21-year-old man from Syria living in Marsaskala. He had threatened the victim that if she didn’t terminate the pregnancy, he’d kill her.

                     The victim was in the hall and asked to leave before the proceeding began.

 The accused pleaded not guilty, and the defence requested bail.

 The prosecution objected due to the lack of ties he has to the country and because he does not have a fixed Maltese address.

 The prosecution also mentioned fears of tampering of evidence, since the victim and other witnesses need to testify.

 The defence objected to this on the basis that the acts are those which are typical of domestic violence.

 “The case is what it is, I had three such cases this morning and none of them were imprisoned,” lawyer Jason Grima said.

 He said the accused was expecting a baby with the victim, which automatically ties the accused to Malta. “He does have an address, he is not homeless,” Grima said.

 The defence concluded its statements by mentioning that the accused collaborated with the police, and had voluntarily presented himself at a police station to answer for his accusations.

 The Court did not accept the defence’s request, and the accused was remanded in custody until the compilation of evidence starts.

 Meanwhile, a protection order was ordered by the Court in favour of the victim.

 Speaking in court on Friday, lawyers from the Attorney General’s office referred to a criminal complaint filed against Milenović, and said the prosecution is requesting that the case is deferred to another date.

                     Lawyer Franco Debono, who is part of the defence counsel, objected to the deferral of the hearing. “Does an objective reason why a court-appointed expert does not have to testify exist? What happens to these procedures if Milenović does not testify?”

 Other lawyers forming part of defence counsel also raised numerous objections to the request.

 Lawyer Stefano Filletti objected on the basis that when an ordinary witness declares that there are fears that they might incriminate themselves, they can make use of their right of silence.

 “Milenović is afraid of incriminating herself on a role that was assigned to her as a court-appointed expert. The presence of this witness is not only a cosmetic one but very much a material one"" Filletti said.

 “It is not the Attorney General’s role to protect court-appointed witnesses, and it is apparent now that the AG is displaying some bias.”

 The prosecution countered these objections, once again citing what happened in the last 24 hours, adding that it is the prosecution that regulates the witnesses.

 Debono countered the prosecution’s statements by reminding that there is an entire proceeding that is all about hearing a witness testifying, “as the bare minimum, a valid reason should be given” Debono concluded.

"Muscat to get parts of Vitals inquiry, judge rules, as former PM skips court",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/muscat-get-parts-vitals-inquiry-judge-rules-former-pm-skips-court.1092160,05-09-2024,004951.png,"Updated 6.30pm
 Sections of the Vitals magisterial inquiry that refer to Joseph Muscat are to be made available to him, a court decreed on Thursday.
 Judge Giovanni Grixti ordered the Attorney General to present every document in the inquiry’s records about the former prime minister - from the moment his name cropped up in the case until the end of the investigation - saying that he could not accurately reach a conclusion without seeing them.
 The judge made that decision in a case that Muscat filed alleging that his rights were breached by allowing a particular magistrate to investigate him.
 Muscat, former minister Konrad Mizzi and former chief of staff Keith Schembri are among dozens facing criminal charges filed following the recommendations of that inquiry into the scandal-racked deal to privatise three state hospitals.
 The inquiry documents ordered into that case on Thursday are to be kept by the court and only made available to parties in the case, the judge said. 
 Muscat will only be given access to the parts of the inquiry that concern him, the judge said. All other sections of the probe will remain with the Attorney General unless future hearings in the case presided by Judge Grixti require them. 
 If the State Advocate intends to appeal that decision, it has just four days to do so, as the judge slashed the usual 10-day limit to ensure Muscat’s lawyers receive the documents before a criminal case that is based on them begins.
 Criminal charges were filed against Muscat and  two dozen others earlier this week. They allege that Muscat received bribes and traded in influence in connection with the privatisation deal with Vitals Global Healthcare [later Steward].
 Muscat's Thursday court success in obtaining parts of the criminal inquiry could add pressure on the Attorney General to make the entire report  public, as other defendants facing criminal charges as a result of the inquiry will be tempted to file their own court proceedings to obtain access.
 All defendants are assured access to the inquiry once they are arraigned before a criminal court, but it remains unknown when those arraignments will take place.
 The former prime minister was not present in court for Thursday’s session but as the case did not concern those criminal charges, he was not required to attend.
 Instead, Muscat appeared on local TV station F Living shortly after the court hearing to say he would disprove the ""hatchet job"" and then focus his energies on suing those who had kindled it. 
 Thursday’s session concerned Muscat’s attempt to halt the investigation that led to the criminal charges he insists are trumped-up. Led by Magistrate Gabriella Vella, that inquiry was completed 10 days ago.
 On Thursday, Judge Grixti observed that given that the inquiry has now been completed, another of Muscat’s requests was a non-starter.
 The former prime minister had asked for the inquiry to be suspended until the court rules on his objections against the magistrate. But the judge said on Thursday that given that the inquiry has been concluded, Muscat’s request to suspend it was no longer relevant.
 However, Muscat’s broader legal aim – that of convincing the court that his rights were breached by Magistrate Vella investigating him – will continue.
 The judge said Muscat’s lawyers will be able to present their evidence as of the next hearing, once they have received the inquiry documents pertaining to him. 
 Muscat has waged a year-long legal battle against Magistrate Vella’s probe, which he says is biased and part of a political “vendetta”. He has said information about the investigation was systematically leaked and that the magistrate did not summon him to testify until he objected to her.
 The case continues on June 25. 
 Lawyers Vincent Galea and Charlon Gouder represented Muscat. 
 State Advocate lawyers James d'Agostino and Isaac Zammit represented the office as well as the Attorney General.

 The former Labour prime minister resigned in 2019 in the wake of the arrest of Tumas magnate Yorgen Fenech, accused as the alleged mastermind in the Caruana Galizia assassination. Since 2018 it had been revealed that Muscat’s chief of staff, Keith Schembri, was Fenech’s secret business partner in a network of offshore companies suspected of channelling dirty money from government mega-contracts. Fenech resigned, and Muscat followed suit as his Cabinet demanded a way out of the political crisis. Since news of the magisterial inquiry being concluded came out, Muscat first toyed with a bid for MEP, which he never followed up, and now has accused his detractors of pursuing a vendetta against him on a magisterial inquiry.
 Konrad Mizzi
 The former Labour minister of energy, health, and later tourism, was the chief architect of the Muscat administration’s PPP agency Projects Malta, which effectively stewarded all major government contracts with private entities: Vitals was one of them, and even after the Steward handover, Mizzi was still working on contractual changes which suspiciously benefited Steward alone. Mizzi resigned in 2019, and was later sacked from the party over press reports revealing alleged corruption in an Enemalta wind farm deal in Montenegro.
  Keith Schembri
 The former chief of staff of Joseph Muscat and architect of Labour’s 2013 electoral victory, Schembri is a businessman who is believed to have used his overweening influence inside the Muscat administration to personally benefit from major government concessions to the private sector. Schembri, who was Muscat’s chief of staff from 2013 to 2019, has already been charged with money laundering, corruption, fraud and forgery. The investigation was looking into claims that Schembri paid former Allied Newspapers director Hillman €650,000 between 2011 and 2015 through offshore bank accounts, for a deal for his company Kasco to provide machinery for a new printing press. Schembri has called the inquiry a “travesty of justice”. “For the establishment, the ‘crime’ I am guilty of is having formed part of Joseph Muscat’s team that led to a number of electoral victories for the (Labour) party that I love so much.”
 Schembri had already resigned as chief of staff in November 2019 after his name was mentioned by businessman Yorgen Fenech, the main suspect in the Daphne Caruana Galizia murder.
 In September 2020, Schembri was arrested and his assets were frozen over an investigation into alleged kickbacks connected to Malta’s sale of passports to wealthy foreigners.
 Christopher Spiteri
 Auditor who registered the first companies established in Malta by Pakistani businessman Shaukat Ali and his family in 2014. He was later responsible for the audit of the accounts of Vitals Global Healthcare.
  Adrian Hillman
 Former director of Allied Newspapers and Progress pRess accused of having been paid €650,000 between 2011 and 2015 through offshore bank accounts, for a deal for Keith Schembri’s company Kasco to provide machinery for Progress Press’s new printing press.
 Pierre Sladden
 Sladden was a subcontractor on the €30 million Progress Press relocation and refurbishment. Keith Schembri was a shareholder in a Cypriot company through which €900,000 was passed on to Sladden’s personal offshore company in the British Virgin Islands. The Cypriot company, A2Z Consulta, was owned jointly by three BVI companies owned by Schembri, Sladden and Hillman respectively. Sladden’s Redmap had carried out works on the printing press.
 David-Joseph Meli
 Legal representative of Steward Management Ltd accused of corrupting public officials.
  Brian Tonna and Karl Cini
 Auditors who were partners in Nexia BT, the audit firm employed by both Keith Schembri and Konrad Mizzi to open offshore companies in Panama. Tonna and Cini are both still facing charges in court related to financial misdemeanours in connection with Schembri.
 Ivan Vassallo
 Former marketing director of medical importer Technoline: he acquired the company using his personal company through a €5.14 million loan from VGH’s shareholders. The share purchase agreement was brokered when the hospital concession  moved from VGH to American healthcare giant Steward. The loan was made from Vitals Procurement of Jersey, to Vassallo’s Gateway Soluutions Ltd, effectively meaning that the people running VGH had assisted Vassallo in buying out Techoline’s former shareholders, to secure exclusivity to supply the VGH concession.

 Shareholder in Ivan Vassallo’s Gateway Soluutions Ltd.

 CEO of Mtrace plc: after Technoline was sold to Vassallo, who now had exclusivity of supply to the three hospitals run by Vitals – meaning all purchases of medical equipment for the hospitals had to pass through Technoline – the VGH consortium also took over an Italian company, Mtrace plc, that supplied materials for diagnosis and treatment of cancers and other diseases.

Accused in Vitals case claims he was slapped with two freezing orders for the same crime,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/131647/accused_in_vitals_case_claims_he_was_slapped_with_two_freezing_orders_for_the_same_alleged_crime,09-10-2024,004992.png,"Lawyers representing an Italian man charged with various crimes involving Vitals Global Healthcare have told a court that he had been hit by two separate freezing orders for the same alleged crime.
 Court proceedings involving various figures tied to the Vitals Global Healthcare scandal continued on Wednesday, before magistrate Leonard Caruana.
 Giuseppe Fabrizio Musarella stands accused of money laundering, fraud and making false declarations to a public authority in connection with the purchase of a cyclotron machine through Mtrace, a company that had just been set up, and which was subsequently sold to Vitals.
  Lawyer Veronique Dalli raised concerns over the imposition of two freezing orders on her client’s assets. In a single case, Musarella is accused both in his personal capacity, as well as on behalf of his company, Taomac Ltd, of laundering €62,500. Two separate freezing orders had been issued, each for the whole amount, effectively freezing double the alleged criminal proceeds.
 Dalli, assisting Musarella together with lawyer Dean Hili, questioned the fairness of the freezing orders, because of this fact.
 In a previous sitting, when one of the inquiry experts had been asked whether he agreed with Harbinson Forensic's report about Taomac and Musarella, he had replied that although he accepted the report he had disagreed with Harbinson’s opinion as expressed in it.
 Dalli emphasised that the purpose of a freezing order is not to indiscriminately seize all assets, but rather to prevent the proceeds of illegal activity being dispersed, should a guilty verdict be reached. ""The amount is not €62,500 times two,"" argued Dalli, adding that recent judgments had limited the scope of freezing orders to the amounts derived from the alleged crime. In the past, such orders were used to freeze the defendant's assets in their entirety, but the courts have since declared this interpretation to be unjust and introduced a cap accordingly. 
 During the session, Dalli also pointed to a previous case involving Pilatus Bank’s CFO Claudeanne Sant Fournier, where the Attorney General’s (AG) request for a freezing order was dismissed. In that case, the court found no evidence to suggest the defendant had benefited from or was involved in illegal activity, reinforcing her argument that freezing orders must be proportional. 
 “We should not crucify the defendant…with double the amount that needs to be secured,” the lawyer said.
 Prosecutors Francesco Refalo, Rebekah Spiteri, and Shelby Aquilina countered, arguing that a garnishee order had originally been issued and later superseded by the freezing order.
 Spiteri noted that the law requires any objection on the amount of a freezing order to be made within seven days before the Criminal Court, meaning Mosarella’s application was time-barred. She further argued that since the prosecution cannot guarantee the success of the separate case, it was essential to safeguard the full amount. 
 Dalli expressed satisfaction at hearing the prosecution confirm that the amount in question was indeed €62,500 and that it had already been preserved. 
 The court will give a ruling on the request.
 Inquiry expert unable to testify due to Covid infection
 In the separate, but related cases being heard by magistrate Caruana on Wednesday against Asad Shaukat Ali and Wasay Bhatti, a financial crime expert who had assisted the magisterial inquiry into the Vitals deal had been due to testify, but was unable to do so after testing positive for COVID-19.
 The possibility of video-conferencing was raised by the prosecution but Ali’s lawyer Shazoo Ghaznavi said he would prefer to hear the witness in person. 
 Consequently, the court agreed to adjourn the case to November.
 The affected cases deal with payroll company Accutor AG and Vitals Global Healthcare’s successors, Steward Healthcare International. 
 Accutor is under scrutiny for its alleged involvement in receiving €3.6 million from Steward Healthcare during a critical period when Steward took over the 30-year concession of three Maltese state hospitals from Vitals Global Healthcare.  
 Accutor AG is run by lawyer Wasay Bhatti, who also reportedly assigned a consultancy contract to former Prime Minister Joseph Muscat. 
 The firm’s transactions with Steward Healthcare are being closely examined, particularly in light of the consultancy contract assigned to Muscat, whose involvement in the hospitals deal has already attracted significant controversy in Malta. 
 In the ongoing legal proceedings, lawyers Shazoo Ghaznavi,  Alex Scerri Herrera, Jessica Formosa, and Jeannine Depasquale are representing Bhatti and Ali.  ",Jordan Pace ,court_and_police
Identità denies Jason Azzopardi's security breach claims,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/identita-denies-jason-azzopardi-security-breach-claims.1097092,22-08-2024,004994.png,"State agency Identità has denied allegations that its Msida premises suffered a security breach or having received orders from a magistrate to seal off one of its archives. 
 This comes after lawyer and former PN MP Jason Azzopardi claimed that the building suffered a security breach early this morning after the alarm went off in its ""server room"". 
 Azzopardi claimed that this alleged breach happened just the morning after an inquiring magistrate ordered the archives of the Expatriate Unit to be sealed off. 
  However, in a statement on Thursday, Identità rubbished these claims and said that while the alarm did go off in the building earlier this morning, it was a false alarm and no foul play is suspected. 
 Preliminary findings suggested that the alarm was caused by a faulty sensor and that an inspection of the server room and the rest of the premises revealed ""no issues or irregularities"".
 ""There was no security breach, and the agency’s systems remain fully intact. A review of CCTV footage showed no signs of foul play. All logs and CCTV footage are meticulously preserved as a preventive measure to ensure complete transparency,"" they said. 
 Identità said that no applications or submitted documents are kept in the room in question because its servers are hosted by MITA. 
 The agency also said that it received no ruling or order from the magistrate conducting the inquiry but clarified that management had chosen to seal the Expatriates Unit's archives on its own initiative. 
 ""Identità premises are under constant surveillance by security personnel, with 24/7 monitoring. All entry logs and CCTV footage are securely recorded and accessible exclusively by authorised compliance personnel,"" they said. 
 Just last week a magistrate upheld a request by Azzopardi to have a magisterial inquiry into an alleged racket in which Identità officials are said to have fraudulently issued Maltese ID cards on the basis of forged documents. 
 Azzopardi has claimed that some 18,000 ID cards were issued in this manner.

 Andrew Brian Duffy, 34, from the UK entered a guilty plea when was arraigned before magistrate Jean Paul Grech on Monday, accused of causing slight bodily harm. Duffy’s defence counsel, lawyer Stefano Filletti was permitted to approach the bench together with the prosecuting official, police inspector Brian Xuereb, to discuss the case privately with the magistrate.
 The defendant pleaded guilty to the charges, confirming his admission when given the opportunity to recant by the court.
 Making submissions about the punishment to be handed down, inspector Xuereb told the court that it was a one-off incident and that Duffy had not followed up his initial punch. “We have no intention of being severe about the incident, especially in view of the fact that he was provoked.” said the inspector.
 Filletti asked the court to understand the circumstances in which the assault had happened. “He was out with his girlfriend at a pub in Paceville. At one point an individual started harassing his girlfriend and so the defendant approached and asked him to leave.” The victim had persisted, however, and had carried on touching the woman, whilst describing to the man what he “would do to her,” Filletti said.
 He underlined to the court that the man’s actions had been intended to ward off the persistent and unwelcome advances, requesting a conditional or unconditional discharge in the circumstances, “in the light of the one-off nature of the incident and the severe provocation that had led to it.”
 The court upheld the defence’s submissions and, while making it clear that violence was not the correct path for the man to have taken, it also had to take the persistent sexual harassment of the defendant’s partner, in his presence and the isolated nature of the incident into consideration.
 Duffy was conditionally discharged for two years and bound by court order not to approach or contact the other man for one year, against a €500 penalty.  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police
Sex workers testify in human trafficking case,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/sex-worker-testifies-human-trafficking-case.1097254,26-08-2024,005030.png,"Updated 4.05pm
 A Colombian sex worker said she earned roughly €2,000 in her first 10 days in Malta but kept none of that money.
 The woman said she relied on an additional €1,500 she received in client tips to pay for her living expenses and to send money back to her family.
 She had been in Malta for less than two weeks before she was arrested, she told a court on Monday.
 The court is hearing the case against eight men and one women accused of human trafficking and running a prostitution ring. 
 Monday's testimony followed on a similar hearing one week ago, when other Colombian sex workers testified about how they were flown to Malta, housed and put to work. 
 The accused are Luke Farrugia, 36, a self-employed maintenance worker from Birkirkara, Clint Lawrence D'Amato, a cab driver from Gudja, Denzil Farrugia, 19, a food shop employee from Sliema, Alexandra Suhov Pocora,a 32-year-old Romanian from St Paul's Bay, Kane Vassallo, a 22-year old barber from Siġġiewi, Gordon Cassar, a 44-year-old maintenance worker from Kalkara, Luca Emanuele Corito, 21 from Senglea, Dylan McKay, a 30-year old taxi driver from Fgura and Nicolae Efimov, 37 from St Paul's Bay.
 Prosecutors allege that the prostitution ring operated a criminal organisation, brought people to Malta to engage in prostitution, then held them against their will at a brothel while they lived off their earnings and laundered proceeds.
 All those accused deny criminal charges.
 Sex workers caught during the police raids are now being treated as human trafficking victims and are being held at a safehouse. 
 Testifying via video conference on Monday with the help of a Spanish translator, the woman said she had worked as an escort in her hometown Medellín “every now and again” to financially support her daughter, mother and grandmother.
 She said she came to Malta knowing she would work as an escort and said she knew of the working conditions before she travelled to Malta. 
 She found out about Malta through a friend, Michelle, who was on a WhatsApp chat group with many other escorts. She described the group as a means to connect escorts with opportunities abroad.
 Days before she was due to travel to Malta, she received her flight tickets and travel details through a “private” contact in a WhatsApp chat group set with disappearing messages.
 The contact organised her flight tickets, which cost around €3,700 and told her to bring €500 in cash. She would have to repay the flight costs – Colombia to Madrid and then Malta - through her earnings in Malta.
 In Malta, she was picked up by a man driving a white car. She later identified the man as the accused Clint Lawrence D’Amato, known by the witness as “Miguel”.
 ‘Miguel’ took her to a home with basic amenities and rooms. There was another escort living there.
 She said she rested for a few hours and then began her sex work later that evening.
 The woman said the deal was for her to take 55% of her earnings, once she had paid back the cost of her flight tickets.
 Her work rates were set at €50 for 30 minutes and €100 for one hour. She was free to set rates for extras requested by the client, “such as kisses”, and she pocketed that money directly.
 She said she would work from 4pm to 2am, and would see around five to six clients daily. Her goal was to work hard and pay off her travel debt quickly, she told the court.
 In all, she calculated that she made around €4,000 from the work before the police raids. Of that, roughly €2,000 was for her, though all money except for tip money went to D'Amato.
 D’Amato would arrange client bookings for her over WhatsApp. She would leave her earnings on a table and he would collect them every day, she recalled. He was her only point of contact and no clients contacted her directly, she said.
 The woman was unable to say where in Malta the house she was living in was, saying she only left the house twice – to send money back to Colombia – and D’Amato had driven her on both occasions.
 Her initial plan was to spend two months in Malta. But 10 days into her stay, she was arrested.
 She kept her passport at all times but never thought about leaving, she said, as she did not have enough money to purchase a return ticket to Colombia.
 Under cross-examination, the woman confirmed that she was always free to return to Colombia and said she had not been mistreated or abused while in Malta.
 Her passport and mobile phone are now being held by the police, she said.
 When asked if she had been threatened with deportation, the witness confirmed that the police had not spoken to her until she gave her statement.
 The court also heard the testimony of another Colombian sex worker allegedly working for the accused.
 The 28-year-old had only been in Malta for a weekend before police raided the brothel she was working in. She had four clients in her first two days, she said.
 She told the court that she, too, was already working as an escort back in Colombia. She also learnt of Malta through a WhatsApp chat group advertising escort vacancies.
 The woman told the court that she was picked up from the airport by D’Amato, who she knew as ‘Mig’.
 The apartment she was placed in had four bedrooms: three had large beds with air conditioners and the fourth was where all four women who worked in the apartment slept.
 When asked how much she earned, she said she earned €600, but left that money on a table. She was told the money would be provided to them once they left Malta.
 Under cross-examination, she said nobody from the police informed her that she was a victim of human trafficking. She also said she was never forced or abused during her time in Malta.
 The sitting, originally scheduled to begin at 9.00am, was postponed by two hours after the court heard that sex workers being held at a safehouse left that property on their own and caught a bus to Valletta.
 Members of the state-run welfare agency Appoġġ then ordered the women to return to the safehouse and be taken to court under police escort, accompanied by Appoġġ members. 
 That caused a lengthy court delay and angered the magistrate. 
 After hearing a witness explain that the women were free to leave the safehouse without protection, Magistrate Donatella Frendo Dimech ordered Apoġġ and safehouse organisers to provide an explanation. 
 The case resumes on Wednesday. 
 AG lawyers Ramon Bonett Sladden and Charmaine Abdilla prosecuted, together with Inspectors John Spiteri, Joseph Xerri and Dorianne Tabone.
 Lawyers Franco Debono, Marion Camilleri, Roberto Montalto, Joe Giglio, Michaela Giglio, Charles Mercieca, Kathleen Calleja Grima, Nicholas Mifsud and Etienne Borg Ferranti are defence counsel. Lawyers Lara Dimitrjevic and Stephanie Caruana appeared parte civle.

Man on probation after returning stolen items,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/131069/man_on_probation_after_returning_stolen_items_,06-09-2024,005038.png,"A thief whose conscience spurred him to return the items that he had stolen has been sentenced to probation after admitting to related charges.
 Police Inspector Kurt Farrugia and prosecutor Juliana Magro Conti arraigned 42-year-old Endrick Azzopardi before magistrate Marseanne Farrugia on Friday.
 Azzopardi, who is from Bormla, pleaded guilty to charges of theft aggravated by value and committing an offence against an elderly person on 7 August, as well as to a second theft, on 24 August.
  Inspector Farrugia told the court that on 7 August, an elderly woman had reported being robbed of her wallet while walking in Birgu.
 CCTV footage from the area showed a man matching the description given by the victim, running in the direction of Zabbar.
 Later that month, a mobile phone, designer sunglasses and a packet of cigarettes were stolen from the Kalkara regatta club. The police were subsequently informed that Endrick Azzopardi had returned the stolen items, with the exception of a packet of cigarettes.
 When the police spotted Azzopardi entering the regatta club, dressed in the same clothes as the footage of the first incident, he was arrested. The man had admitted to both incidents during his interrogation.
 The court was told that the defendant had returned the items he had stolen in the second theft, and was in the process of paying back the cash he had stolen from the elderly woman, in instalments.
 After Azzopardi pleaded guilty, the court warned him that the maximum punishment for the charges was imprisonment for 10 years, but the man confirmed his admission after the court gave him time to consult with his lawyer.
 Making submissions on punishment, Magro Conti acknowledged the man’s early admission and full cooperation with the police, telling the court that he had already paid back €30 of the approximately €300 stolen during the first theft. 
 She suggested the court impose a probation order of maximum duration that way Azzopardi would receive the professional help and guidance he needed.
 Inspector Farrugia explained that the theft had been prompted by Azzopardi’s drug addiction.
 After the defence did not object to the punishment being proposed, the court sentenced the man to probations for three years, also ordering him to pay €10 to the second victim for the stolen cigarettes and to settle the outstanding balance of €270 owed to the first victim within six months.

Jacob Borg looks at some of the key questions.
 Malta’s landfills are running out of space.
 As Richard Bilocca, CEO of the country’s waste management agency Wasteserv, put it: “This waste-to-energy facility is essential for Malta to move away from the primitive way of managing waste through landfills, which are costly to operate and harmful to the environment.”
 The facility will produce a substantial amount of green energy and make a “significant contribution” to the reduction of the Maltese carbon footprint, according to the tender document.
 Apart from incinerating waste, Wasteserv says the facility is expected to meet around 4.5% of Malta’s total energy needs.
 The project is earmarked for a site within Wasteserv’s waste processing facility in Magħtab.
 Plans for the project immediately drew protests from surrounding local councils in 2018 over environmental concerns.
 An environmental impact assessment hit a snag in 2021 when the environment watchdog ERA had to ask Wasteserv to conduct a new study, as the original one had been called into question over a potential conflict of interest by its authority.
 The new assessment had reached similar conclusions about the environmental sustainability of the project.
 This paved the way for the Planning Authority to green-light an outline proposal for the construction of the facility in January 2022. 
 A case officer told the Planning Authority board that an environmental impact assessment concluded there would be “net environmental benefits” from the project.
 The €600 million contract was awarded to a French company Paprec working in partnership with local construction firm Bonnici Brothers last October.
 The tender envisioned that the design and build phase of the facility would take “approximately” three years.
 It is the government that will foot the bill for the construction, while the winning bidder will be responsible for its operation and maintenance over a 20-year period.
 The final bidding process yielded what Wasteserv described as three “high-quality compliant bids.
 These were Hitachi Zosen Inova AG – Terna SA, FCC Medioambiente Internacional SLU and Paprec.
 Paprec submitted the lowest bid – €599 million. Hitachi, whose own bid came in at €781 million, was not happy.
 The company, whose legal team included PN MP Adrian Delia, took its grievances to a body known as the Public Contracts Review Board.
 The board is the first port of call when appealing a government tender.
 Hitachi claimed, among other things, that the tendering process was tainted and that the winning bidder could not fulfill the technical requirements at the price it submitted.
 Hitachi claimed that the price quoted by the winning bidder was too low to be realistic.
 It told the appeals board that the recommended bidder could not sustain such a price with the mandatory technical requirements specified within the tender.
 The other losing bidder FCC Medioambiente joined the appeal as an interested party, only to later drop out.
 The board, chaired by Kenneth Swain with Vincent Micallef and Charles Cassar as members, ruled in February that Hitachi’s claims were not backed by any form of substantive evidence.
 “From the testimonies heard and documents presented, this board is very serene in stating that the evaluation conducted, and the documents submitted by the recommended bidder, met all the requisite requirements,” the board said.
 Reacting to the decision, Wasteserv’s CEO Richard Bilocca said this “unequivocal verdict shows that WasteServ delivered a gold standard procurement process”.
  An appeals court, headed by chief justice Mark Chetcuti, was less impressed by the process.
 The court this month found that one member of the committee that evaluated the tender should never have been nominated for the role.
 Stephanie Scicluna Laiviera’s nomination to the committee breached public procurement regulations, as she worked as a Wasteserv procurement manager and was also listed as a member of the public contracts review board, the court ruled.
 “Once Stephanie Scicluna Laiviera was, by law, precluded from sitting on the Tenders Evaluation Committee, the composition of the committee was irregular and, as a consequence, all decisions it took were irregular too,” the court ruled.
 As a consequence, a new adjudicating committee will have to be set up to reconsider the bids, the court ruled.
 The court also upheld Hitachi’s claims that two members of the public contracts review board who rejected the initial appeal had conflicts of interest, due to their links with public entities.
 The judges upheld Hitachi’s claim but made it clear that this did not imply the decision taken by Kenneth Swain or Vincent Micallef was motivated by personal gain or intended to breach principles of good governance.
 Wasteserv said it will “analyse” the implications of the court decision to decide the best way forward.
 It noted that the court “left it up to Wasteserv” to decide whether to further pursue the current procedure by appointing a new evaluation committee.
 Speaking to Times of Malta, Environment Minister  Miriam Dalli defended the procurement process led by Wasteserv.
 Dalli said the process involved international consultants and auditors who monitored it throughout.
 The minister said the government’s main aim is to ensure that its waste management aims are met.
 “This is a national project that addresses the needs of the entire country. We are analysing the sentence and will pave the way forward from there,” Dalli said.
 Given the three-year construction timeline envisioned in the tender, the project is unlikely to be up and running any time before 2028.

 In a statement, police explained that they were on patrol in St. George Street in connection with this case when they spotted the suspect in Triq il-Wilga, where he was immediately arrested.

 He was taken to the police station, and the man was subjected to a search and 38 bags of cocaine were found on his person.

 A search was later made at the man's residence and vehicle where more drug related items were found.

  

 He is being detained at the police lock-up in Floriana and is expected to be arraigned in court on Sunday morning.

Wasteserv to 'analyse' decision on €600 million waste plant contract strikedown,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/wasteserv-analyse-decision-600-million-contract-strikedown.1094262,21-06-2024,005062.png,"Updated 12.20pm with minister's comment
 Malta's waste management agency will ""analyse"" the implications of a court decision to annul the award of a €600 million tender for a waste-to-energy plant. 
 In a statement, Wasteserv said it will now chart the best way forward for the much-delayed project. 
 A spokesperson for the Energy Ministry added that both the ministry and Wasteserv remain ""fully committed to a fully transparent process"".
 In comments to Times of Malta, Energy Minister Miriam Dalli said the Court of Appeal focused primarily on the conflict of interest with certain PCRB members.
 She said the process led by Wasteserv included the involvement of international consultants and independent auditors to ensure the process was run well.
 “We are looking into the conclusions of the sentence to see how our promise, to reach our milestones when it comes to waste service are reached. This is a national project that needs to be addressed. We are looking into this sentence and see the way forward.”
 The contract was awarded to a French consortium working in partnership with local firm Bonnici Brothers. 
 A court struck down the decision after finding that members of the adjudicating panel within the contracts department had a conflict of interest and ordered a new evaluation process take place
 The appeal was filed by unsuccessful bidders Hitachi. 
 Members of the tenders evaluation committee and the public contracts review board who dismissed an earlier appeal by Hitachi had a conflict of interest, the court ruled. 
 Hitachi first appealed before the public contracts review board, pleading that there had been a wrong evaluation of its bid, irregularities in procedure, and irregular composition of the evaluation committee.
 When the appeal was dismissed, Hitachi took its grievances to the court, again complaining about the composition of the adjudication committee and also arguing that two members of the revisions board, Kenneth Swain and Vincent Micallef, also had a conflict of interest.
 The consortium also complained about irregular procedures by the board.
 Hitachi argued that Swain had a conflict of interest since he was a former director of Enemalta, which had a power purchase agreement with Wastserv. Similarly, another board member, Vincent Micallef was a director of ClearFlowPlus plc which like Eastserv and Enemalta, had Malta Government Investments as its shareholder.
 The court upheld the pleas, adding that by so doing it was not saying that Swain or Micallef had decided in any manner which gave them personal gain or that they intended to breach good governance norms.
 The court declared the decisions of the revision board in this case as being null.
 The court also upheld pleas that Stephanie Scicluna Laiviera stood on the Tenders Evaluation Committee in breach of public procurement regulations as she was also on the list of members of the Public Contracts Revision Board and worked as Wasteserv Procurement Manager
 ""Once Stephanie Scicluna Laiviera was, by law, precluded from sitting on the Tenders Evaluation Committee, the composition of the committee was irregular and, as a consequence, all decisions it took were irregular too,"" the court declared.
 The court said that once it had already declared the committee's composition was irregular, it did not need to consider the alleged conflict of interest of another committee member, Charlon Buttigieg.

Dismembered victim found at sea believed to have been used as drug mule,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/dismembered-body-belongs-man-40s-early-50s.1102239,12-10-2024,005079.png,"Updated 2.15pm
 An axe was used to dismember a body discovered in a suitcase floating off the Gżira promenade on Monday, sources close to the investigation have said.
 The middle-aged caucasian victim has still not been identified though police believe he was used as a drug mule judging by the initial results of the autopsy, which revealed drugs packed in his stomach. 
 He was found in a large suitcase spotted in the water, which was retrieved by the police on Monday afternoon, sparking alarm. 
 Investigators believe the crime was committed just hours before the grim discovery since the body had not yet decomposed.
 They also noted that the suitcase had not been sufficiently weighed down, which led to its visibility on the water's surface.
 Despite the dismemberment, sources said investigators are studying the facial features, providing potential clues to the identity. 
 An autopsy was conducted on Tuesday to gather further forensic evidence, which could also lead to the alleged killer. 
 Police retrieved the body and the suitcase from the water and placed it into a body bag for further examination. Police are believed to be inspecting CCTV from several locations to try to find the man behind the crime. 
 A magisterial inquiry is also underway.
 Monday’s grim discovery is believed to be the fifth murder to take place in Malta this year.
 Taxi driver Eric Borg was shot dead in his hometown of Rabat on New Year’s Day, after becoming involved in an argument with 39-year-old Noel Azzopardi who later turned himself in.  
 Later that month, Colombian woman Sandra Ramirez was stabbed to death in her home, with a post-mortem finding she had been stabbed and slashed 26 times. Her ex-boyfriend stands accused of the murder. 
 In August, Nicolette Ghirxi was found dead in her home after being stabbed to death by her Irish ex-partner Edward William Johnston, who was later shot dead by police after a stand-off in St Julian’s.  
 Two months later, 54-year-old Mount Carmel resident Jesmond Gatt was found unconscious in a pool of blood, succumbing to his injuries days later. His roommate Vuk Milic, a Serbian national, told a medical officer that he was behind the killing.

Sta Venera mayor cleared of drink-driving charges,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/sta-venera-mayor-cleared-drinkdriving-charges.1092779,21-05-2024,005083.png,"The mayor of Santa Venera has been cleared of driving under the influence of alcohol and refusing to allow LESA officials to conduct a breathalyser test during the village feast two years ago.
 Magistrate Victor Axiak cleared Stephen Sultana after ruling that he had “reasonable doubts"" as to the versions of the LESA officers and the charges brought against Sultana had not been sufficiently proven.
 The incident happened during the Santa Venera feast week in July 2022.
 The magistrate heard how the officers filed a police report against Sultana. They claimed that on July 30 at about 2am one of them was resting his legs on the dashboard of his car as his shift had started at 6pm and would last until 7am.
 Sultana walked up to the car, knocked and started telling him off for not doing his job. Both the officer in the car and his colleague - who was monitoring  St Joseph High Street - said Sultana smelt of alcohol and that they then saw him get into his car and drive off.
 They contacted their colleagues who were stationed further along the road in another fixed point near the St Joseph Institute. They told them to look out for Sultana’s car as he may be under the influence.
 The colleagues stopped the car and said Sultana reeked of alcohol and refused to take a breathalyser test.
 In his testimony, Sultana, represented by lawyers Franco Debono and Marion Camilleri, explained that the local council had paid for two officers to man each fixed point during the feast. But they had been slacking.
 On the night in question, the mayor saw one officer manning one fixed point in St Joseph High Street, while the other was in the car with his feet on the dashboard. He complained to their superior. When he drove away toward St Joseph Institute, he noticed another car with two officers asleep inside it. He denied being drunk or refusing to take the breathalyser test. He said he was never asked to.
 The magistrate noted that while there were CCTV cameras in the areas in question, the footage did not capture the areas where the alleged incidents happened. The magistrate ruled that the charges brought against Sultana had not been proven and cleared him.

Police find drugs on man who tried to reverse and drive away from roadblock,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/police-find-drugs-man-tried-reverse-drive-away-roadblock.1101226,19-11-2024,005103.png,"A 22-year-old man was charged with the possession of cocaine, heroin and cannabis with the intent to sell – after he was stopped at a police roadblock on Sunday.
 Kyle Pace, from Valletta, pleaded not guilty to the possession of the drugs on and before November 17.
 He was also charged with tampering with evidence and driving a car without a licence or insurance cover.
 In a statement earlier on Tuesday, police said the incident happened in Triq Giuseppe Garibaldi in Paola, where they were conducting routine traffic stops in the area. 
 Officers on the scene said that as soon as the man noticed the police, he reversed into the entryway of a field and tried to drive away. 
 He was stopped before he got the chance to do so and police say the man told them that he did not have a driving license. 
 With reasonable suspicion, police searched the car and found two packets of a substance suspected to be cannabis grass and an unspecified amount of money in cash. 
 When officers were about the search the man's person, police say that he reached into his trousers, pulled out two bags that had been hidden there and tried to dispose of them in a nearby well. 
 The bags were immediately recovered by the police and inside they found several sachets filled with white and brown substances, suspected to be cocaine and heroin. 
 In court, lawyer Godwin Cini, prosecuting on behalf of the Attorney General’s office, explained that Pace was arrested on Sunday after police stopped and searched his vehicle when he tried to drive away from a routine roadblock in Triq Giuseppe Garibaldi, Paola, at about 3pm.
 Magistrate Yana Micallef Stafrace ordered a freezing order of Pace’s assets. He was remanded in custody.

Gozo Channel bomb scare suspect granted bail amid lack of evidence,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/132007/gozo_channel_bomb_scare_suspect_granted_bail_amid_lack_of_evidence_,28-10-2024,005138.png,"A man accused of issuing bomb threats to the Gozo Channel ferry service has been released on bail after a hearing, at which a lawyer argued that no evidence existed which actually linked his client to the offence.

 Marvin Tabone, 43, from Imqabba and employed with the Civil Protection Department, was arraigned in court after his arrest in connection with a spate of alarming telephone calls that warned of bombs on ferries operating between Malta and Gozo. The calls were received by police at about 7 pm, sending tourists and patients who travel on the ferries into a panic.

 Inspector Zachary Zammit of the police terrorism unit said that the court had received bomb threats concerning the ferries operating between Malta and Gozo.

 Investigators traced the calls to Tabone's mobile number and tracked it; officers searched for him at his residence. He was not home at first, but the police found him near his son's residence and brought him in at 7:45 pm. Still in shock, the inspectors said, Tabone handed them his mobile phone and the password of said phone.

 Although he was released shortly after his first arrest, the police managed to obtain a search and arrest warrant due to reasonable suspicion that he was the one who had made the threats. Officers searched his home and vehicle later in Imqabba. While the phone, which was allegedly used for making the calls, has not been found, the box it was bought in was found.

 During the sitting, Tabone's lawyer Franco Debono entered a plea of not guilty and requested bail, arguing that his client was a family man with deep roots in the community and an unblemished career in the Civil Protection Department. Debono asked the court to uphold the principle of the presumption of innocence and turn down any request to deny him bail since no tangible evidence bound Tabone to the offence in question.

 Debono continued by saying that if Tabone pleaded guilty, a sentence without incarceration was likely to be meted out and so it was not reasonable that he remain in custody. ""Bail is there to protect against the unfair detainment of a person who could result acquitted,"" said Debono, continuing that no single evidence ever tied Tabone with the phone calls.

 The prosecution opposed bail outright in view of the gravity of the offence and the implication it had upon public safety and transportation.

 Inspector Zammit referred to the distress caused to residents and tourists commuting by ferries, saying the prank calls disrupted an essential service and affected the businesses operating in Gozo. He further observed that there were several witnesses, whose testimony will form part of the compilation of evidence.

 After having heard the submissions, Magistrate Rachel Montebello upheld the request for bail. She ordered that Tabone sign the bail book regularly and set the bail conditions with a deposit of €3,000 and a personal guarantee of an additional amount of €3,000.

Man jailed because of scheduling mistake gets a second chance,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/man-jailed-scheduling-mistake-gets-second-chance.1096921,19-08-2024,005146.png,"A man sentenced to jail because he was told to appear in court for his appeal hearing on the wrong day is to get a second chance at liberty.
 Reno Azzopardi was found guilty of misappropriation and sentenced to three years in jail in October 2020. He appealed that sentence.
 Azzopardi’s appeal was due to be heard on April 23, 2024. But on the day, he did not appear in court, prompting the judge presiding over proceedings to declare the appeal abandoned and the original sentence valid.
 But it appears Azzopardi was given the wrong information. The formal notice of summons he was served stated that the hearing was scheduled for April 24, despite the sitting being held one day prior.
 Azzopardi subsequently filed a court application seeking to have the court of appeal reappointed, but the court turned down that request.
 That was when Azzopardi took his grievances before the First Hall, Civil Court in its constitutional jurisdiction, arguing that his fundamental right to a fair trial had been breached.
 The matter landed before Mr Justice Toni Abela, who found that Azzopardi had somewhat tested the court’s patience over the years. The April 23 hearing which prompted the judge to declare the appeal abandoned was the last in a string of failed hearings in the case, he noted.
 Azzopardi’s appeal had been put off several times since November 2023, when it began, either due to Azzopardi being ill or not having a lawyer to represent him.
 When delivering judgment Mr Justice Abela acknowledged that the court of appeal had every reason to feel “exasperated” by the appellant’s “unorthodox” manner of informing the court about his absence right on the day of hearing.
 However, the notification Azzopardi received was “radically wrong”, given it cited the wrong date. That was not just a cosmetic issue, he noted.
 “Without formal knowledge of proceedings against you, you can never defend yourself,” went on the court, noting further that “justice can never be served when this is done behind someone’s back.”
 The judge said that although the appeals judge may have been exasperated by Azzopardi’s previous behaviour, any lesson directed towards him should have been reserved for a later stage, after re-appointing the appeal rather than declaring its abandonment.=
 Judge Abela therefore quashed the decision of the criminal appeals court. Azzopardi has been ordered out of jail until his appeal is reheard. He was also given €2,500 in non-pecuniary damages for the breach of rights.

"Perjury investigation into Identità official 'did not find anything', witness claims simple confusion",maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/132038/perjury_investigation_into_identit_official_did_not_find_anything_witness_claims_simple_confusion,29-10-2024,005148.png,"An Identità employee who was investigated for perjury after he testified in a case about fake documents allegedly issued by the agency, has told a court that he had been confused while giving his previous testimony.

 Isaac Micallef took the witness stand for the second time as the proceedings against Moustafa Ata Moussa Darwish, an Egyptian man currently facing charges over the use of a residence card, issued by Identità, that is normally issued to individuals with British relatives, of which Darwish has none, continued on Tuesday. 

                     Darwish is pleading not guilty to the charges.

 When the case was called before magistrate Kevan Azzopardi, police inspector Lara Butters told the court that inspector Gabriel Micallef from the Valletta Police Station had concluded the investigation into two Identità employees which had been ordered by the court following their conflicting testimonies in the previous sitting. 

 Inspector Butters informed the court that the investigation “did not find anything.”

 The inspector added that Isaac Micallef would be called to testify once again on Tuesday, meeting objections from defence lawyer Nicholas Mifsud, who argued that Micallef had already testified. The lawyer questioned whether anything new could emerge from hearing the witness again.

 Micallef would be clarifying statements which he had made during his last appearance in court, explained the inspector. After checking the records of the previous sitting, Magistrate Azzopardi ruled that Micallef would be permitted to return to the witness stand. 

 The magistrate asked Inspector Butters about the outcome of the investigation into possible perjury which he had ordered. She replied that the police investigation into Isaac Micallef and Identità’s Chief Information Officer, Stefan Rodoligo, had concluded that there was no case to answer. 

 Micallef was then called to the stand. He told the court that when he had been asked about the files relating to the man and his wife during the previous sitting, he had got mixed up.

 “I had exhibited a blue file belonging to the woman. By mistake, at the time, I had said that I had not given the file to Stefano Rodoligo. When I looked for the accused’s file I could not find it, but when I opened the woman’s file in court, I found a plastic folder containing the accused’s file and got confused.” 

 As soon as had stepped off the stand, Micallef said, he had gone to Neil Harrison, Identità’s Chief Legal Officer, to apologise for his mistake.

 Harrison testified next, telling the court that while he had been waiting outside the courtroom during the last sitting, Micallef had come out and explained what had just happened to him.

 “I tried to draw the court’s attention, but the sitting had already been adjourned,” Harrison said. 

 After Harrison left the witness stand, Inspector Butters informed the court that the prosecution had no more witnesses to present. Inspectors Lara Butters and Christian Abela are prosecuting. Lawyers Nicholas Mifsud and Tiziana Micallef are defence counsel.     ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police
Elderly driver admits guilt in 2022 traffic fatality case,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/129695/elderly_driver_admits_guilt_in_2022_traffic_fatality_case,12-06-2024,005156.png,"An elderly driver who killed a motorcyclist in Gozo as a result of a negligent lane-change, two years ago, has been sentenced after admitting to related charges.
 69-year-old Joseph Buttigieg pleaded guilty to the involuntary homicide of 66-year-old Bernard Xerri and assorted driving offences, two years after the fatal collision in Triq it-Tessuti, Xewkija.
  Buttigieg had been behind the wheel of a Mitsubishi Pajero when he failed to indicate his intention prior to making a turn off the main road and collided with Xerri, who had been riding a Yamaha motorcycle.
 Xerri suffered an extensive traumatic brain injury as a result of the collision and did not survive.
 Buttigieg entered a guilty plea during his arraignment on 28 May 2024.
 In his considerations on punishment, Magistrate Jean Paul Grech, presiding over the Court of Magistrates (Gozo), observed that the defendant had admitted guilt at the first opportunity and that he had already paid Xerri’s heirs for a shortfall in the insurance payment, for the damage to the motorcycle, out of his own pocket.
 But this did not mean that the court could ignore the seriousness of this case, said the magistrate.
 In its submissions on punishment, the defence had suggested a conditional discharge, arguing that the incident was the result of a slight error on Buttigieg’s part, but this did not wash with the magistrate.
 He observed that the incident had taken place on a straight stretch of road with no visual obstructions, while the victim had been in the correct lane. Buttigieg had been travelling in the opposite direction in the other lane and had turned, without warning, into the direction of oncoming traffic to enter a side street. “He appears to have done so by suddenly turning, invading the opposite lane, and this without first checking if he could do so without endangering himself and other people. So much so, that he had not even used his indicator to show that he was going to change direction.”
 The fatal incident could have been avoided entirely had Buttigieg stopped and checked for traffic in the other lane before initiating the turn, said the court, pointing out that he had been obliged to do so.
 “Had the defendant truly been paying attention in his driving and followed traffic regulations which indicate how one should change lanes, he would not have failed to see the victim approaching on the opposite lane,” observed the magistrate.
 Quoting a comment made by Lord Justice-General Emslie in a UK case from the 1980s, the defendant’s driving  “fell far below the standard of driving expected of the competent and careful driver and that it occurred either in the face of obvious and material dangers which were or should have been observed, appreciated and guarded against, or in circumstances which showed a complete disregard for any potential dangers which result from the way in which the vehicle was being driven.”
 Finding him guilty of all charges upon his own admission, the court sentenced Buttigieg to six months imprisonment, which was suspended for a year. He was also disqualified from driving for three months and ordered to refund the €2,796.44 costs of appointing court experts within the next 6 months.

"Fearne, Scicluna and others to be charged with fraud over hospitals scandal",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/fearne-scicluna-others-charged-fraud-hospitals-scandal.1092085,05-08-2024,005175.png,"Chris Fearne, Edward Scicluna, three top civil servants and nine others are to face charges of fraud, misappropriation and fraudulent gain in connection with the hospitals' deal, Times of Malta can reveal.
 Malta’s deputy prime minister and central bank governor are among a group of 14 people and two companies listed in a second charge sheet related to the Vitals deal that was filed in court on Monday.
 The second group of people charged in connection with the deal do not stand accused of having taken bribes or trading in influence, though they still face serious charges. 
 The list – which is separate to one that features Joseph Muscat, Konrad Mizzi, Keith Schembri and others – includes lawyers, civil servants and people who served on the adjudication committee that awarded the lucrative deal to run three state hospitals to Vitals Global Healthcare.
 It lists two former permanent secretaries, Alfred Camilleri and  Joseph Rapa, and a current one in  Ronald Mizzi, adjudication committee members  James Camenzuli,  Manuel Castagna and  Robert Borg, financial controller  Kenneth Deguara and five lawyers:  Kevin Deguara, Jean Carl Farrugia, Aron Mifsud Bonnici, Deborah Anne Chappell and  Bradley Gatt.
 Also cited is law firm DF Advocates, which is led by Kevin Deguara and Farrugia with Kenneth Deguara as its Chief Financial Officer, and its sister firm  DF Corporate Advisory. The firm served as legal advisers to Vitals as well its medical supplier Technoline and was  raided by police in 2021.
 The charge sheet adds to a political earthquake that has rocked Malta's political establishment. 
 Suspicions about the deal to privatise three state hospitals led to multiple investigations and court cases. 
 In 2020, the National Audit Office concluded that Vitals should have been disqualified from the deal altogether. In 2023, a civil court annulled the entire deal following a case filed by then-Opposition leader Adrian Delia. 
 Now, a years-long magisterial inquiry into ministerial crimes has culminated in criminal charges for some of Malta’s highest-profile politicians.
 It remains unclear on what basis prosecutors have charged all those cited, as that inquiry remains under wraps.
 Prime Minister Robert Abela has sought to dismiss the inquiry that triggered the charges as politically motivated. 
 But while he has implied that he has full faith in Fearne and will not be sacking him, the criminal charges are likely to derail the deputy prime minister's plans of becoming an EU Commissioner later this year.
 Similarly, it is unclear how central bank governor Scicluna will be able to sit on the European Central Bank’s governing council while also defending himself from criminal charges of fraud.

Court halves costs for More Supermarket’s bogus creditors in ‘Maksar’ debt claim,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/132440/court_halves_costs_for_more_supermarkets_bogus_creditors_in_maksar_debt_claim,27-11-2024,"005186.png,005187.png,005188.png,005189.png","A Court of Appeal has halved the legal costs borne by two defendants who claimed to be owed €3.5 million from the defunct More Supermarkets chain.

 The supermarket chain became national news in 2014 when former owner Ryan Schembri fled Malta leaving behind millions in debt. Schembri is still in prison while waiting to face charges for fraud.

                     Effectively this most recent court decision confirms one of the more mysterious aspects of the supermarket chain – criminal suspects like Adrian Agius, currently in jail awaiting trial for the murder of a More Supermarkets lender, had a hidden interest in the operation’s cash flow.

 Right before Schembri fled Malta, it was another of his creditors – Darren Casha – who stepped in to take over the chain. Casha, of the Medasia restaurants, had himself loaned Schembri at least €5.7 million, before taking over the entire supermarket operation for just €94,000 in 2014.

 But months later, Casha was fending off the pretensions of two men, Alex Farrugia and Edmond Mugliette, who claimed they were owed €3.5 million by Ryan Schembri.

 They claimed they had a constitution of debt which they signed with Schembri, but also the director of the More Ħamrun outlet – Adrian Agius ‘tal-Maksar’, the man accused of ordering the murder of More Supermarkets lender, lawyer Carmel Chircop; and whose brother Robert Agius and associate Jamie Vella stand accused of supplying the bomb that killed Daphne Caruana Galizia.

 Casha challenged their claims, leading to a magistrate to request an FIAU investigation into the share transfer of the five More outlets to Casha, and into the alleged debt claimed by Farrugia and Mugliette. The defendants’ claims that there was a €300,000 VAT refund ruse were also referred to the Tax Commissioner and Police Commissioner for action. The notary who sat in for the false constitution of debt, Claire Camilleri, was also referred to the Notarial Council to examine her role in facilitating the constitution of debt.

                         Appeals Court decision

 The Court of Appeal last week partially upheld Farrugia’s and Mugliette’s appeal regarding costs borne on the first case, decreeing they would be liable in equal parts with the defendant company Cassar & Schembri Marketing (CSM), which is being liquidated. CSM was the company which financed the products on sale inside the More chain.

 The first court had found that both Schembri and Adrian Agius, as one of the supermarket directors, had fraudulently constructed the €3.5 million constitution of debt, by fabricating the claim of having borrowed money from Farrugia and Mugliette.

 Farrugia pleaded with the Court of Appeal that he too had been a victim of Ryan Schembri’s fraudulent actions, and queried why Adrian Agius had not been made to pay any legal costs.

 The Court of Appeal ultimately upheld Casha’s original challenge to the false debt constitution, finding that Schembri had committed fraud, ordering the rescission of the debt agreement and the cancellation of the general hypothec and promissory note associated with it.

 Mysterious debt ruse

 As the new owner of five of the six More Supermarkets outlets, Darren Casha had challenged the €3.5 million claim from Mugliette and Farrugia, accusing Schembri of conspiring with ‘Maksar’ gang suspect Adrian Agius to bleed the company dry with the bogus debt claim.

 He accused Schembri and Agius of roping in Mugliette, who acquired the remnants of media house WE Media, and undergarments retailer Alex Farrugia to create a constitution of debt for €2 million and €1.5 million respectively, without having the authority to represent the business which he had already taken over.

 Crucially, the two strawmen could not identify how they had procured the money they had lent out and where it had been spent on. “This was Schembri’s ruse, and Mugliette and Farrugia are involved with him in a bid to take from More Supermarkets something they are not entitled to,” Casha told the court.

 Casha must have been aware of Schembri’s mounting debts before absconding in 2014.

 He was acting as a guarantor of enormous loans made out to Schembri, one of them an €8.4 million credit from a Libyan food supplier called Copacabana Investments, or another with developer Adrian Zammit for €2.2 million. These debts too have been the subject of criminal complaints to the police, because they were unconnected to the supermarket business.

 Then after Casha took over More in May 2014, Schembri and Adrian Agius – who had retained the directorship of one More supermarket not transferred to Casha – created the €3.5 million constitution of debt, with Mugliette and Farrugia appearing as the creditors.

                         Schembri absconds

 Mugliette’s alleged €2 million loan, from companies he claimed to be their ultimate beneficial owner – All Seas Management and Blue Finance – lacked all proof that any money loaned was used for equipment purchased by Cassar & Schembri Marketing. No money, it seems, was ever received from the company.

 Farrugia claimed he had met a mysterious Indian entrepreneur named ‘Abdul Rahman’ at a construction fair in Libya, to which he had travelled with Ryan Schembri. He then became a representative of Rahman, who invested €1 million paid to Schembri’s company Cassar & Schembri Marketing. Yet neither a written agreement nor a power-of-attorney had been signed or included on the constitution of debt with Schembri.

 In court, Farrugia claimed that as he got wind of More Supermarket’s debt problems, he approached Schembri about securing his position. Schembri suggested that he enters a constitution of debt, together with Mugliette.

 Eventually, the constitution of debt was signed without Schembri even being present. Instead, it was his father Mario, together with Adrian Agius, who at that point was a registered director of More Ħamrun, who inked the debt agreement.

 In court, Farrugia’s claims were challenged by More Supermarket’s accountant Dennis Francalanza, disputing the claim that Farrugia – who ran the supermarket’s ‘Sock Corner’ outlet – could have poured in €1.5. million into the enterprise.

 But Francalanza also said when Schembri left the island, the operation was suddenly taken over by Darren Casha, Ray Camilleri and Adrian Agius. Mugliette was also introduced to the company as an accountant.

 Months later in October 2014, two garnishee orders were filed against the company, one of €1.5 million from Alex Farrugia, and the other of €2 million from Mugliette.

 Adrian Agius’s role

 It remains unclear what role Adrian Agius had in the running of the More Ħamrun supermarket.

 Today, Agius is in prison facing charges of having ordered the murder of lawyer Carmel Chircop, who had loaned a substantial sum, €750,000, to Ryan Schembri. Agius also appeared as one of the debtors on the Chircop loan.

 Further cementing the Agius connection was the fact that both him and Cassar & Schembri Marketing were shareholders in the company InterAA Holdings, of which Ryan Schembri was a director.

 When prior to his arrest in 2020, Agius testified in the €3.5 million More debt case, he claimed having had no effective role in the running of the Ħamrun outlet. “I trusted Schembri with eyes shut,” he said, suggesting his disinterest in the running of the business he was a director of, was wantonly limited.

 “I passed on my shares to Darren Casha without even collecting a cent, because until then I expected that those shares would return once things get back on their feet... I just rested on Ryan’s word, because I don’t understand anything about supermarkets. Schembri would lead. But I did work from Ryan’s office basically. My office was his, and I would hear about things going on.”

 And yet despite this kind of proximity, Agius claimed he was unaware of Schembri’s plans for a bond issue with KPMG, and was easily convinced that More Supermarkets owed the ‘unknown’ Farrugia and Mugliette €3.5 million. “Schembri told me I had to sign as a guarantor for their debt. In truth this did not suit me... apparently it was money to Ryan for projects he was investing in.”

 Casha’s lawyer pointed out to Agius that he had been a shareholder from day one at More Supermarkets, yet right up until the share transfer to Casha, he had no idea of the Mugliette-Farrugia loans.

 “Look, I didn’t know because... I would just hear them talk in the office. I never cared much. My fault really...” Agius replied.

                         The Maksar-More connection

 As a director for the holding company of the More Supermarkets outlet in Hamrun, Adrian Agius ‘tal-Maksar’ appeared as a debtor on a contract that took a €750,000 interest-free loan from the lawyer Carmel Chircop in March 2014.

 Chircop’s contract was with Ryan Schembri, then appearing as director of the company Erom Limited. Also appearing as debtors in the contract were Schembri’s business partner Etienne Cassar, as well as Adrian Agius: one of the men first arrested by police in December 2017 in connection with the assassination of Daphne Caruana Galizia, and later released on police bail. Together, Schembri and Cassar, and Agius, owned shares in another joint company called InterAA Holdings.

 The contract suggests that the loan had already taken place, and was constituting the repayment schedule: a €50,000 repayment happening the day of the contract signing, with a further payment expected by 31 March 2014, and a further €50,000 by 30 April 2014. The final €600,000 should have been paid by February 2015.

 Schembri and Cassar, who together owned Cassar & Schembri Marketing – the company that acquired and supplied foodstuffs to the More Supermarket chain – issued two loan notes to Chircop, personally in their names for the debt. But it was Agius who was guarantor on the debt, presenting as a special hypothec agrand villa property on Engineer Street, Madliena heights.

 Chircop then exempted the notary, Malcolm Mangion, from carrying out the usual searches on the title and the property guarantee.

 Three months later, Schembri started transferring his supermarket business to a new investor, the restaurateur Darren Casha, who was then under the impression that the More Supermarkets chain was in excellent financial health.

 Chircop was killed in the morning of 8 October 2015 as he walked to the Birkirkara garage complex, where he died from four gunshot wounds to his upper body. Six months later, Adrian Agius took recourse to the law courts in a bid to cancel the notarial deed that had locked in his property as guarantee for the €750,000 debt. At first, Chircop’s widow refused the claim, insisting Agius himself had informed Chircop “to take his villa in Madliena as repayment for the loan to Erom. If what he now claims is true, [Agius] would have not put the villa up… the business that was to take place with Carmel Chircop never did happen because the agreement was that either Erom or the loan guarantor, pay back the money loaned to them.”

 Neither party ever made it to court to take a stand on the alleged claim. In 2017, the Madliena house was sold for €1.8 million, and in January 2018 the Chircop heirs told the court that an out-of-court settlement had been reached.     ",Matthew Vella ,court_and_police
Fenech’s defence claims inquiry secrecy creates unequal playing field in court,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/130514/fenechs_defence_claims_inquiry_secrecy_creates_unequal_playing_field_in_court_,31-07-2024,005199.png,"A lawyer representing Yorgen Fenech in a pre-trial sitting before the Criminal Court has lamented what he described as inequality between the prosecution and the defence regarding access to relevant inquiries.
 Defence lawyer Charles Merceica argued that the law created an ""unequal party"" scenario by only granting “absolute visibility” over a still-active inquiry to the prosecution, “powers that not even this court has with regards to the inquiry.”
  “[The AG] decides whether to prosecute a case before the Court of Magistrates or the Criminal Court, whether to follow the recommendations of the inquiring magistrate, or whether to proceed on other offences entirely and restricts what evidence which the defence can have access to.”
 Prosecutor Anthony Vella, representing the Attorney General’s Office, defended the secrecy as necessary to protect the integrity of the investigation.
 When the sitting began on Wednesday, Madam Justice Edwina Grima noted that the AG had filed a reply to a recent application filed by the defence with regards to the contents of two inquiries—one concerning the murder of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia and another inquiry which is still ongoing.
 Mercieca argued that the law does not specify when the proces-verbal of an inquiry should be closed, only specifying that it should be sent to the AG.
 It was up to the AG to then decide whether to return it to the inquiring magistrate for further investigation or pass it to the compiling magistrate. In this case, Mercieca claimed, the AG had opted to do both.
 The lawyer contended that the inquiry had gathered evidence that had not been used in the compilation of evidence, a fact which he said, under Article 550A(4) of the Criminal Code, placed the AG, with extensive visibility and control over the inquiry, at an unfair advantage. ""The prosecutor is in a position where he has unlimited access to the acts of the inquiry,"" Mercieca stated, arguing that this creates an ""unequal party"" scenario. He added that the complexity of the investigation, involving multiple suspects, necessitated continued inquiry, which was gathering further relevant evidence that the defence was being denied access to.
 Mercieca emphasised that while the secrecy of the inquiry was meant to protect its integrity, but did not preclude the use of its findings as evidence. He also argued that the AG was incorrect in asserting that the inquiry could not be closed, pointing out that this had evolved as a customary practice and did not emerge from the law.
 He maintained that the court has the authority “to order actions in the pursuit of truth, provided they are not contrary to the law.”
 The defence lawyer cited case law in support of this argument. The restriction of access to the inquiry was a pre-Venice Commission tradition, submitted the lawyer, arguing that with the AG's expanded responsibilities since then, there was an imbalance that needed to be addressed.
 If the AG is concerned about maintaining the inquiry's secrecy, Mercieca suggested, the court could order that its contents remain confidential while still allowing the defence access to the evidence.
 Prosecutor Anthony Vella strongly objected to the defence’s arguments, insisting that the proces-verbal had been exhibited in accordance with the law, as is standard procedure. He explained that the inquiry had been closed, but later reopened after the potential involvement of third parties came to light.
 “No unusual procedure was employed,” said the prosecutor. Vella argued that it was illogical to collect evidence during the compilation of evidence while an inquiry into the same subject is still ongoing.
 He added that the AG's powers regarding inquiries are in fact, “very limited”, only allowing prosecutors to inspect the inquiry acts inside the magistrate’s chambers, without the ability to make copies.
 Vella also stressed the sensitive nature of the inquiry, warning that disclosure of its contents could jeopardise other investigations.
 After hearing submissions, the court announced that it would be issuing its decree from chambers, with a follow-up sitting scheduled for September 5, after which the acts will be sent to the AG.  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police
The Vitals headaches: Charged by summons and a court hall not big enough,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/129086/legal_community_scratches_its_head_over_uncertainty_surrounding_vital_charges,09-05-2024,005205.png,"Storm clouds in the form of both legal and logistical obstacles, loom over the impending arraignments of the individuals to be charged in connection with the Vitals deal.
 On the legal front, there is an almost ubiquitous sense of shock and even disgust amongst the legal community, at the manner in which the charges have been issued. Pressing charges without questioning the suspects first, although not illegal, is a first for Malta in such a serious case and many lawyers have expressed disbelief at the tactic, which has been described as underhanded.
 As the suspects will be charged by summons, and not under arrest, the prosecution have done away with the need to interrogate them first. Joining the dots is important here because no interrogation means no need to disclose the evidence against the suspects, and that allows them space to allege a fundamental rights breach, which could draw out and complicate the proceedings further. For a more in-depth explanation of this point click here.
  A human rights breach in the making?
 As one defence lawyer explained to MaltaToday, this creates a problematic situation. “What can impinge on human rights is the lack of disclosure - I’m not being given a copy of the inquiry, yet you're taking me to court. And I don’t know the conclusions. The right to disclosure is a human right too.”
 “It's unfair, to say the least, that suspects are not given the opportunity to state their version of events (after being given adequate disclosure of evidence) - especially given the special rule applicable solely to money laundering charges, that is, the shifting of the burden of proof onto the defendant, who has to prove his innocence.”
 So although not necessarily fatal to the criminal action - because the concluded inquiry is the prosecution’s best evidence and this one in particular is likely to have been incredibly meticulous - the lack of disclosure is almost certainly going to result in constitutional proceedings, which will cause considerable delays to the criminal cases.
 Now, add to this mix the fact that, starting from the moment that the suspects are arraigned, the prosecution will have just one month to prove to the satisfaction of the court that there is a prima facie case to answer for, and you have all the makings of a legal fiasco. 
 Never mind the elections, the timing everyone should be worrying about is that one month period.
 But besides the prosecution having potentially torpedoed their own case before it even started, there is another, practical but equally intractable, problem that has no apparent solution: Where to hear the cases?
 A problem of space
 By deciding to charge 19 people at one go, the prosecution appear to have also hamstrung the court administration. 
 Time for some simple maths: Assuming each defendant has just one lawyer - unlikely given the profile of the case - that already places 38 people in the courtroom, to whom must be added at least five prosecutors (three AG lawyers and two police inspectors), not to mention court clerks and ushers, security personnel, members of the press and defendants; family members besides any members of the public who may decide to observe the proceedings. A conservative estimate would be around 50 people, but there will likely be more.
 Now, anyone who has set foot in Malta’s courts will know that there is currently no courtroom that can fit that many people in it and continue to function. Keeping the public and press corps in one courtroom, with a video link to the one in which the defendants, their lawyers and security staff will be packed like sardines appears to be the only half-plausible solution, and even then, that would create a potential transparency problem if the video or audio feed encounter technical difficulties, which are by no means a rarity. 
 How that issue will be tackled remains to be seen. Questions about the logistical aspect of the case were sent to the Court Services Agency and the Justice Ministry on Wednesday. No reply has been received yet.  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police
Charges dropped against woman who attempted to run her partner over with baby onboard,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/132054/charges_dropped_against_woman_who_attempted_to_run_her_partner_over_with_baby_onboard__,30-10-2024,005210.png,"A 28-year-old woman, who allegedly attempted to run over her partner while driving with a baby onboard, will face no further criminal charges after the victim withdrew his claims, stating the couple plans to marry soon.

 The woman, whose name was withheld by court order since her arraignment over two years ago, faced multiple charges, including attempted murder, slight injury to her partner, insult, and threats that exceeded provocation.

                     She was additionally charged with wilfully damaging the vehicle, driving dangerously, and having an unrestrained child in the car.

 The accused, who pleaded not guilty, was granted bail. The man had also offered to leave their home to allow her to use that address for bail purposes.

 The incident took place on a Sunday afternoon in March 2022 in Żabbar. When summoned last year, the accused’s partner expressed his wish to end proceedings, choosing not to testify against her, since they had a young son together.

 In early October 2024, he reiterated his stance, informing the court that the couple had reconciled and planned to marry. The prosecution did not oppose his request to discontinue proceedings, since the law provides for such requests in domestic violence cases.

 In light of these developments, Magistrate Astrid May Grima ruled that ceasing the case was in the best interests of both the alleged victim and the couple’s child, thus ending the case.

 Inspector Cremona told the court that on 7 September, a police patrol in Paceville in an area well known for drug trafficking.
 The 28-year-old man was arrested in St Julian’s on Saturday evening on suspicion of drug trafficking, after a police patrol noticed him acting strangely, apparently looking for something amongst vegetation at the edge of a car park in Triq San Ġorg.
 After observing the man retrieving objects from the ground and putting them up his shirt, the officers had moved in for a closer look. The sight of the police officers had clearly spooked the man, who then began to act even more suspiciously.
 The police stopped the man and searched him, finding a black bag containing 38 sachets containing a white substance which the suspect later confirmed to be cocaine, ready to be sold and €450 in €20 and €10 notes.
 In the vegetation where he had been seen picking something up, the police also found a small number of sachets containing cannabis. A subsequent search at his home discovered notes together with drug trafficking paraphernalia, which the inspector said consisted of several mobile phones, empty sachets and a pipe.
 The prosecution told the court that in his statement, Jama claimed to have simply come across the drugs outside.

 The victim had told police officers at the Domestic Violence Unit that she had argued with the defendant after returning from a night out in the early hours of Sunday morning.
  Inspector Audrey Micallef told the court that the man became enraged when the woman had “mentioned the name of a third party.”
 After throwing a metal ashtray at the woman and pelting her with kitchen supplies, he allegedly grabbed her by the hair and neck and told her that he would cut off her head, explained the inspector in court.
 After entering a not guilty plea, the defence requested that the man be released on bail.
 The prosecution objected to the defendant’s release from arrest due to the fact that he was still residing with the alleged victim, despite her having ended their relationship and even thrown him out of the house some days prior to the incident.
 The defendant’s daughter testified to act as a third-party guarantor for her father, should the court grant him bail, but the prosecution insisted that the man was untrustworthy, pointing to the fact that his son had falsely told the arresting police officers that his father was not at home.
 The defendant was, in fact, found hiding in the bedroom, said the inspector, arguing that the risk of tampering with evidence was clear.
 The court, after hearing the arguments on bail, rejected the request for the man’s release and ordered that he be remanded in custody, both because of the nature of the charges, as well as due to the risks to the evidence.

 There were many times when he was on the brink of succumbing to drugs again. The struggle was massive.
 But the staff at Dar Victoria – which offers a community-based residential service – believed in him. They offered him support together with therapy.
 “Today, he is doing well. We worked with his family and there is a plan for him to finally return home after all these years,” said Sarah Bondin, the general manager at Fondazzjoni Suret il-Bniedem that runs  Dar Victoria.
 Mark (*not his real name) was one of the 2,000 people supported by the foundation throughout these 25 years.
 Fondazzjoni Suret il-Bniedem was founded by the Capuchins in 1999 to provide residential services to people experiencing homelessness, as guided by the Capuchins’ core values of compassion, dignity and service to the marginalised.
 It started off with one home aimed at offering a place for inmates who had nowhere to go after leaving prison. But, over the years, it evolved to meet the needs of society.
 The foundation currently runs Dar Leopoldo, which hosts homeless men;  Dar Teresa Spinelli for women with children;  Dar Victoria;  Dar Franġisk, a semi-independent home for males with mental health challenges; and Dar Imelda and Paul Debono – community-based facilities with staff round the clock that assist men and women who, due to mental health challenges, end up homeless.
 “Homelessness is the final result we see but there are many causes: mental health, financial problems, addictions, domestic violence. We do not just offer a roof above their heads. We help them rebuild their lives through a range of services,” said Bondin.
 The dedicated team of professionals provide individualised and comprehensive care covering medical, health and mental-health, emotional and social needs.
 Fr Elmar Pace, who chairs the foundation, said that stigma remained. “There is still the stigma that a person who is homeless brought it upon himself,” he said. However, through his 16 years of experience, he has seen how people from all walks of life ended up homeless for a range of reasons that include marriage breakdowns, financial trouble, mental health issues and more.
 Bondin said that, over the years, homelessness had increased. “There is always a primary cause, like domestic violence or separation. But now we are seeing more reasons that are amplifying this like drug and alcohol abuse,” Bondin said.
 
 Pace added: “Lifestyle changes also make a difference. Life has become more stressful as there are more demands on people to cope with higher standards and this is amplifying mental health issues.”
 Along the years, the foundation has supported some 2,000 people and it plans to keep expanding its services to reach more people.
 The government helps with the running costs of the five residential homes, which amounted to close to €1.25 million last year.
 But any expansion projects depend on fundraising.

"Mizzi, Muscat and Schembri prime targets for Vitals prosecution",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/mizzi-muscat-schembri-prime-targets-vitals-prosecution.1091796,21-06-2024,005277.png,"Joseph Muscat, Konrad Mizzi and Keith Schembri are the prime targets for criminal prosecution in connection with the deal to privatise three state hospitals.
 The trio, who played major roles in the process that led to Vitals Global Healthcare and then Steward Health Care getting the multi-million contract, are among dozens of individuals and companies that prosecutors believe may have breached laws related to money laundering and the proceeds of crime.
 A magisterial inquiry into the deal was concluded last week and is now at the attorney general's office, a court heard on Tuesday.
 Muscat said on Tuesday that he has ""no doubt"" he will end up facing criminal charges in the case. Times of Malta was unable to contact Mizzi and Schembri for comment.   
 
 Criminal lawyers told Times of Malta that most money laundering cases begin with prosecutors filing court requests to freeze the assets of people suspected of involvement in crime.
 They noted, however, that asset freezes are broader than criminal prosecutions – meaning not everyone who is cited in an asset freezing order ends up being charged with a crime.
 A court heard on Tuesday that a copy of the concluded inquiry, along with 78 boxes of evidence, was sent to Attorney General Victoria Buttigieg last Friday.
 Buttigieg and her team of prosecutors must now assess that evidence and decide whether to file criminal charges against anyone mentioned in the inquiry report.
 The inquiry was led by Magistrate Gabriella Vella. A court was told on Tuesday that it involved 78 boxes of evidence with police inspector Wayne Borg as the lead investigator. 
 Muscat, his successor as prime minister Robert Abela and Labour-owned media have piled pressure on the magistrate in recent days. Muscat has accused the magistrate of leading a politically motivated “vendetta” against him, while Abela has said the inquiry was  timed to damage Labour’s electoral prospects.
 The magisterial inquiry kicked off in late 2019 following a criminal complaint filed by NGO Repubblika. It initially sought to investigate the roles then-ministers Konrad Mizzi, Chris Cardona and Edward Scicluna played in the deal to hand three state hospitals to Vitals Global Healthcare, a company with no business track record.
 The probe was eventually broadened to include Joseph Muscat, who led the government at the time as prime minister.
 In 2023 a court struck down the hospitals deal, saying Vitals – and its successor Steward Health Care – did not fulfil their contractual obligations, that the deal was tainted by fraud and that top officials involved in the deal had colluded against the national interest.
 Documents filed by Steward as part of that court case revealed the key roles played by Mizzi and Schembri, who served as Muscat’s chief of staff, in the deal.

Villa fraudster spared jail as court hears she has turned a new leaf in prison,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/villa-fraudster-spared-jail-court-hears-turned-new-leaf-prison.1102456,14-12-2024,,"A woman with a long history of rental fraud convictions has been spared a fresh two-year jail term upon evidence that her efforts while in prison deserved encouragement.
 Annabelle Camilleri Monreal, 39, who has been serving jail time since 2018 for similar offences, was found guilty of making money by renting out a luxury villa that she did not own. 
 However, a Magistrate Court has given her a chance to prove herself after hearing professionals testify that she now realised she could not take shortcuts to make a fast buck.
 The case dates back 10 years when Monreal signed a private lease agreement concerning a luxurious villa in Safi which she had received from her grandparents in 2004.
 She sent photos of the property to her prospective tenant who signed the deal without ever visiting the villa. 
 The tenant also changed her ID card to that address and handed Monreal €1,350 in advance payment of rent, utilities and possible damage to the property. 
 However, she never got the keys. 
 The victim soon discovered that the villa actually belonged to a married couple who had acquired it through a judicial auction in 2013. 
 In September 2014, Monreal reimbursed €1,500 to the misguided tenant and promised to refund the balance, but it took her four years to do so. 
 In the meantime, her victim filed a criminal complaint that triggered charges against Monreal. 
 In 2021 she was sentenced to two years imprisonment by a Magistrates’ Court. That judgement was quashed over a technicality on appeal through her new lawyers Franco Debono and Marion Camilleri. The case was sent back to another Magistrates’ Court as a result. 
 When delivering judgment, Magistrate Marse-Ann Farrugia observed that Monreal had reimbursed the full amount by 2018. The victim testified that she had no further interest in the case. 
 The court cleared the accused of fraud but found her guilty of having made a fraudulent gain, recidivism as well as committing the offence in breach of a previous conditional discharge. 
 When meting out punishment the court observed that the accused had an unruly criminal record, including eight fraud convictions, document forgery, two thefts, two cases of slight injuries and a number of contraventions.
 Camilleri Monreal had pulled off similar swindles in the past involving townhouses and apartments in Malta and Gozo. Ten years ago, she pleaded guilty to defrauding a man out of €1,000 when she rented him a Xemxija apartment that was not hers. 
 However, over the last years during her time behind bars, Monreal completed five educational courses and did voluntary work at Corradino Correctional Facility and other detention centres. 
 Her psychotherapist testified that she was an able worker, but she previously believed that she could make a fast buck.
 Today Monreal had changed the psychotherapist testified, claiming she now realised there could be no such shortcuts. 
 
 She also had a supportive family who were willing to offer her a home and a job. 
 Her lawyers, Franco Debono and Marion Camilleri, argued that she deserved another chance.
 The prosecution insisted on an effective term of imprisonment saying that it was only because she was in a controlled environment that the accused had marked improvement. 
 The court observed that throughout the proceedings the accused appeared to have done her utmost to reform herself. 
 Her efforts deserved encouragement, said Magistrate Farrugia. 
 Prison was to serve not only as punishment and deterrence but also to reform those detained so that they might eventually be reintegrated in society. 
 Considering such considerations, the court deemed that society stood to make no gain by adding another term of imprisonment.
 While not imposing an effective term of imprisonment, the court placed the accused under a three-year probation period to make sure that she would stick to the right path once out of jail. 
 The court also fined the accused €1,200 in terms of the breach of the conditional discharge and to cover court expenses.

Lawyers demand explanation for gargantuan Vitals-related freezing orders,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/129838/live_chris_fearne_edward_scicluna_in_the_dock_over_vitals_charges,21-06-2024,005299.png,"Defence lawyers representing a number of defendants accused of fraud and misappropriation in relation to the fraudulent hospitals concession have demanded prosecutors provide an evidential basis for the multi-million euro freezing orders imposed at their request, urging the court not to allow itself to be reduced to “a rubber stamp” in that regard.
 Former Deputy Prime Minister Chris Fearne, Central Bank Governor Edward Scicluna, and 13 others, amongst them former and current permanent secretaries and lawyers, are facing charges relating to fraud arising from the concession of public hospitals to Vitals Global Healthcare. Fearne and Scicluna face additional charges of misappropriation and fraudulent gain. Other defendants are charged with money laundering.
  Charged alongside Fearne and Scicluna are former permanent secretaries Alfred Camilleri and Joseph Rapa, current permanent secretary Ronald Mizzi, adjudication committee members James Camenzuli, Manuel Castagna, and Robert Borg, financial controller Kenneth Deguara, and five lawyers: Kevin Deguara, Jean Carl Farrugia, Aron Mifsud Bonnici, Deborah Anne Chappell, and Bradley Gatt. Magistrate Leonard Caruana heard three witnesses today: Deborah Farrugia, Secretary to the Chamber of Advocates and Legal Procurators, who gave evidence about the registration status of law firm DF Advocates; Franklin Calleja, Registrar of Criminal Courts, provided digital copies of the Vitals inquiry and discussed the handling of evidence; and Former FCID Inspector Anthony Xerri testified about the police's role in seizing evidence during the inquiry. Perhaps the most striking thing which emerged from today’s sitting was the prosecution’s reluctance or inability to explain the calculation process which had resulted in the outsize amounts seized by the freezing orders it had requested.
 The defence lawyers contested the €20 million and €40 million freezing orders issued against the defendants, questioning the justification and calculation of these amounts. “So a prosecutor in the Republic of Malta, in 2024 is objecting to being asked to justify a freezing order.” observed lawyer Franco Debono, telling the court that the law placed an obligation on the prosecution to substantiate the amounts frozen. “Before the law would seize everything you had. Today it can seize that and can also seize more than you have,” Filletti said.  “One presumes that this exercise has already been done,” said the lawyer, but observed a “total reluctance on the part of the prosecution to explain how they had reached that figure.” “A freezing order for €20 million, €40 million here…I expect the prosecution to come here and provide evidence to support those amounts, that we are allowed to question it and the court examines it.”
 Lawyer Franco Galea added that case law had established that the higher the amount of money to be seized, the greater the burden of proof on the requesting party

Police recount woman's harrowing description of assault by her husband,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/police-recount-woman-harrowing-description-assault-husband.1101328,21-11-2024,005301.png,"A 29-year-old engineer was remanded in custody on Thursday after a court heard how his wife reported him for allegedly committing violence against her.
 The accused, an Indian national living in Rabat, was arraigned before Magistrate Astrid May Grima, accused of having committed violence against his wife as well as insulting her.
 Police inspector Sherona Buhagiar told the court that the victim’s wife had called at the domestic violence unit to report the man, to whom she had been married for four years and shared a 7-month old child with.
 The woman told police that an argument had broken out and that he started to insult her, shouting at her and grabbing her hair while hitting her on the head. He also allegedly hit her on the face, grabbed her by the neck and punched him in the stomach.
 She said she fought back as the alleged attack continued.
 Buhagiar said the woman did not provide a medical certificate to certify her injuries.
 Objecting to a request for bail, the prosecution said that while the parties did not live together any more, there was still a risk that the accused could try to approach the woman, which gave rise to fear of tampering with evidence. A risk assessment of the alleged victim had also found that she was in “extreme danger”.
 The defence argued that the fear of tampering with evidence could be assuaged if appropriate measures, such as a protection order, were imposed on the accused. Ultimately, the accused was facing two charges that amounted to contraventions and he was a stable person with a place to live, a full-time career and a clean criminal conduct. It would therefore not be appropriate to keep him in detention.
 The bail request was denied and the man was remanded in custody.
 Police Inspector Sherona Buhagiar prosecuted. Lawyer Martin Farrugia appeared for the accused as legal aid.

Lawyer for Shaukat Assad Ali denies angling for plea bargain in Vitals proceedings,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/129837/lawyer_for_shaukat_assad_ali_denies_angling_for_plea_bargain_in_vitals_proceedings,21-06-2024,005336.png,"A lawyer representing Shaukat Assad Ali and his prosecutors have both denied allegations that their client was angling for a plea bargain, describing them as “absurd.”
 Assad, who is the son of the Pakistani businessman at the centre of the Vitals Global Healthcare scandal, Shaukat Ali Chaudhry, was charged on June 5 with money laundering, fraud and organised crime and hit with a multimillion euro seizure and freezing order.
  After the court finished hearing several prosecution witnesses, the defence asked to dictate a note in the acts.
 Lawyer Shazoo Ghaznavi, assisting Assad together with lawyer Jessica Formosa, made reference to the court’s decree on comments made by the accused to the press. He requested the court reconsider the decree “in the light of heavy coverage and speculative statements in the press. In particular the absurd assertion that the accused is in some manner cooperating with the Attorney General’s office with a view to some form of plea bargain.”
 He said it was a totally unfounded allegation as no such discussions had been carried out.
 Spiteri, for the prosecution, objected to the request. “The prosecution strongly believes that the decree given by this court…ensures that the proceedings are carried out in the best interests of justice. Secondly, the prosecution confirms that there have been no such discussions.”
 The case was adjourned to July for a decree on prima facie and the defence lawyer’s request to lift the ban on speaking to the press.  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police

Court dismisses Curia’s bid to evict Kalkara voluntary group,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/court-dismisses-curia-bid-evict-kalkara-voluntary-group.1102160,12-08-2024,005383.png,"A court has thrown out a bid by the Curia to evict a Kalkara voluntary organisation from premises it had used for decades as a storage space for street decorations during the local parish feast.
 A bursar representing Archbishop Charles J Scicluna as administrator of all ecclesiastical entities in Malta and on behalf of the Kalkara Parish Church instituted a civil action against Għaqda Mużikali San Ġużepp AD 1987.
 The dispute revolved around premises adjacent to the Parish Centre corner with Triq Rinella which the respondent had been since its inception in 1987, taking over from its predecessor Kummissjoni Sezzjoni Malta tal-Armar tax-Xatt. 
 The Curia was now claiming that the respondent had no valid legal title to retain possession of the premises and thus sought its eviction.
 The voluntary organisation countered that in the first place, the applicant had to prove its own legal title over the property.
 It also argued that it held the property under a title of commodatum or loan for use and thus had a valid right to retain possession.
 The dispute landed before the First Hall, Civil Court, presided over by Madam Justice Joanne Vella Cuschieri.
 Research carried out by Rev Brian Gialanze, then Kalkara Parish Priest, gave some historical background to the property at issue. 
 Since the old parish church was damaged during World War II, the diocese bought a plot of land to construct a new church. 
 Part of a gas factory that was situated on that land was temporarily used as a church.
 Once the new church was ready, the gas factory premises were handed to the Kummissjoni Sezzjoni Malta tal-Armar tax-Xatt for the purpose of storing decorations used along the Kalkara seafront during the feast of St Joseph.
 The Kummissjoni merged with the  Għaqda Mużikali San Ġużepp AD 1987, which continued to use the store, but only on mere tolerance, according to Gialanze. 
 He said that he had personally spoken to Għaqda officials about the matter. 
 Due to extensive damages, the premises needed repair work, Gialanze explained. Moreover, he wished to have an alternative property which could be used for Mass for elderly parishioners who had difficulty accessing the parish church.
 His predecessor Mgr Salvinu Micallef testified that he had asked the Għaqda to move out. 
 They had other storage facilities and did not keep all decorations in the disputed premises. 
 Micallef testified that he had come across a note whereby his own predecessor had granted the place to the Ghaqda free of charge until they managed to find an alternative place. 
 That note was never produced in court. 
 Honorary President of the Għaqda, former Minister Joe Mizzi, testified about his childhood memories, recalling that the premises had long served this storage purpose. 
 The organisation never paid any rent, even when they offered to do so to help cover expenses related to works carried out in the adjacent premises. 
 The premises were also the subject of a meeting at the Curia in 2013 where Għaqda officials were asked to supply dimensions for adequate storage facilities. They agreed to comply “without prejudice”.
 During the court case, the Curia produced a document whereby it claimed that the Għaqda was well aware of the fact that it was to move out of those premises. 
 When delivering judgment, the court observed that in 1945 the property was sold by Malta Mediterranean Gas Company Ltd to Archbishop Mikiel Gonzi who in 1949 donated it to the Kalkara parish. 
 The respondent’s main argument rested on its claim that it possessed the premises under a loan for use in terms of Article 1824 of the Civil Code. 
 Such a legal title implied that the loan was gratuitous, for a specified time or purpose subject to the obligation of the borrower to restore the thing itself. 
 It was proved that the respondent never paid any money for the premises and that there was a verbal agreement whereby it was to use the place for storage of feast decorations. 
 All testimonies proved that the place was indeed used for that purpose. Only if the feast, for some very remote reason, were not to be celebrated any longer would the loan of the premises lapse. 
 As for the document produced by the Curia claiming that the respondent knew that it had to vacate the premises, the court was not convinced of its probatory value. 
 That document was not issued under the Għaqda's  letterhead and was not signed by its secretary. That was mandatory under its statute. 
 The court did not have the reassurance that such a document “was effectively issued by the respondent”.
 The Curia’s claim that the respondent occupied the premises without its consent arbitrarily, was not true, declared the court, turning down the applicant’s claims with costs. 
 Lawyer Edward Zammit Lewis assisted the respondent.

San Ġiljan waterpolo player seeks to block 12-match ban,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/san-giljan-waterpolo-player-seeks-block-tripled-match-ban.1096033,29-07-2024,005392.png,"Updated at 6.27 pm
 San Ġiljan waterpolo player Ben Plumpton, disciplined for biting two Sliema players during a match, has sought an injunction to block his 12-match ban after it was tripled on appeal, arguing that the decision was “defective and highly prejudicial”.
 Lawyers for the player applied for a warrant of prohibitory injunction to be provisionally upheld, arguing this was “crucial” and that unless the court intervened “a great injustice” would be committed. 
 Plumpton did not target the original four-match ban handed down by the Aquatic Sports Association Disciplinary Commissioner but the rest of the matches from which he was suspended. 
 His lawyers’ arguments ran along the lines that the Board of Appeal had acted beyond its powers by deciding upon and overturning the commissioner’s decision over two of three of the original charges in respect of which Plumpton had been acquitted. 
 Since no appeal was filed over that acquittal, the commissioner’s decision was final in that regard and the board’s decision was thus “gravely defective, procedurally irregular and causing enormous prejudice to the player”.
 The issue stemmed from a “miscellaneous report” filed by the Sliema club after their league match against San Giljan on July 17.
 No incident was flagged during that match but later, Sliema filed a report claiming that Plumpton had bitten two of their players. 
 The matter landed before the ASA’s Disciplinary Commissioner who cleared Plumpton over two of the grievances and disciplined him on the basis of the third by imposing a four-match ban. 
 Sliema did not appeal that decision. 
 Plumpton filed an appeal based on the grievance over which he had been found guilty, related to his right of self-defence. 
 That meant that in respect of the other two grievances, the Commissioner’s decision was final. 
 However, the Board of Appeal did not only confirm guilt on the ground appealed but changed the commissioner’s decision and found guilt over the other two grievances too, although no one had appealed on those two grounds. 
 The board tripled the ban to 12 matches. 
 According to the ASA’s terms of reference, the Board of Appeal “shall only decide upon the grievance/s raised in the appeal,” pointed out Plumpton’s lawyers.
 The 12-match ban meant that Plumpton would miss out on the whole league. 
 The board tried to “hide” behind a word in its terms of reference stating it could “increase” the sanction. But that argument was defective, rebutted Plumpton’s lawyers. 
 The board did not increase the sanction but it changed an acquittal into a conviction in respect of the two grievances which had been definitively decided. 
 Through its actions, the Board placed the appellant in a worse position and it also breached the basic principle of natural justice whereby it was to hear both sides.
 During the appeal hearing, the board “expressly” stated that it would not consider those grievances.
 Thus, Plumpton’s defence did not make any submissions in that regard. 
 When the board pronounced its decision, it came as a “surprise” to all, “pulling the rug out from under Plumpton’s feet.” 
 Since the board had declared it would not decide upon those grievances which had already been settled, Plumpton was not given the chance to defend himself on those two issues. 
 The board thus breached its own regulations, acting with impunity, argued Plumpton’s lawyers. 
 Unless this injunction was upheld, the player would be suspended throughout twelve matches, rendering an eventual judicial remedy useless because he would have served punishment by the time court proceedings ran their course.
 The player had tried to find some amicable solution with the Association and was told that the matter was to be discussed during a council meeting on July 25. 
 But no solution was forthcoming. 
 With the league scheduled to end on August 24, Plumpton sought recourse before the civil courts. 
 On Monday, Madam Justice Josette Demicoli ordered that a copy of Plumpton’s application was to be served upon ASA which had a right to file a reply. 
 The court turned down Plumpton’s request to issue the precautionary warrant since it would need to examine more closely whether the court had the power to stop the execution of the Board’s decision. 
 However, the court reserved the right to uphold the applicant’s request after it hears the parties’ submissions, decreed the judge, appointing the case for hearing on August 12. 
 Lawyers Charles Mercieca and Carlos Bugeja are assisting Plumpton.
 Lawyer Herman Mula, who is assisting ASA, said that they will be contesting the matter in court.

 Last week the PN successfully obtained a warrant of prohibitory injunction which put a stop to the national broadcaster airing the spots, which featured Prime Minister Robert Abela. 
 The PN maintain that the spots are ""unconstitutional"" because they breach laws that prohibit partisan content on public broadcasting platforms. 
 PBS denied that this is the case and said that such adverts have been broadcast for ""decades"" and both during PN and PL-led administrations. 
 So long as these spots never broke any broadcasting laws, PBS has always broadcast these spots as requested by the Government. 
 PBS added that it has always made a clear distinction between spots broadcast within the context of an electoral campaign - where it is the Broadcasting Authority that sets the schedule for political spots - and spots that are aimed at informing the public about the fiscal and social measures announced in the budget. 
 After airing the October 27 spot, which is the one the PN objected to, PBS received another two spots from the government and after an internal editorial evaluation, it was established that these spots did not breach the relevant article of the constitution. 
 It also pointed out that despite filing complaints about these spots as well, the PN appeared to be broadcasting them on its own media without issue. 
 PBS said that disproportionate interference in the operations of public broadcasting could lead to prejudice that impedes stations from delivering informative content that is in the national interest to the public in a timely manner. 
 this is why an urgent hearing is needed, they said.

Ombudsman offers to become human rights czar,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/ombudsman-offers-human-rights-czar.1092676,22-05-2024,005421.png,"The office of the ombudsman is positioning itself to take on the mantle of a national human rights institution after a bill to establish one faltered nearly five years ago and was never restarted.
 Earlier this month, the European Network of National Human Rights Institutions (ENNHRI) – which welcomed the ombudsman into its ranks in February – presented its report to the European Commission on the state of the rule of law in the European Union.
 In its report, the network said that over the past years, “national, regional and international stakeholders” including the UN have called on Malta to establish a national human rights body.
 It noted that while the Human Rights and Equality Commission bill was presented to parliament in 2019, it stalled after a second reading and lapsed the following year at the end of the parliamentary term. It was never resubmitted.
 “To date, no bills relating to the establishment of a national human rights institution have been proposed,” it said. 
 However, the ENNHRI indicated that since the ombudsman joined the organisation earlier this year, progress appears to have been made, with it even proposing to the government it take on the responsibilities itself.
 Describing the parliamentary watchdog as having “significantly intensified its efforts” to establish a fully-fledged human rights body in Malta, the network said the ombudsman was well placed to assume such a role. 
 “The office operates with a high degree of independence. It is supported by adequate resources and enjoys financial autonomy, ensuring it can effectively uphold and advocate for expanded human rights responsibilities,” it said.
 Commenting on the issue, human rights NGO Aditus director Neil Falzon said a “very broad” coalition of human rights groups had been demanding the government put the Human Rights and Equality Commission bill and another focusing on discrimination back on the table.
 “We have been repeatedly promised that the new bills will be shared with us and tabled in parliament, but all of us remain in the dark,” he said, adding such bills could “dramatically improve” human rights in Malta. 
 Stressing that victims of human rights violations were currently only able to turn to the courts or the National Commission for the Promotion of Equality (NCPE), Falzon said this wasn’t enough. 
 The courts, he said, were “extremely expensive and never-ending,” while the NCPE, while quicker, “fails to offer any real remedy.” 
 Falzon stressed that current anti-discrimination laws were not comprehensive enough, “leaving many people exposed to discrimination and violation” ‒ something he said his organisation had repeatedly reminded the government of. 
 Asked whether he agreed with the ombudsman taking on the mantle of a human rights institution, the Aditus director said that while the office had “massive potential to instil a sense of justice and accountability in the public service,” he and others were not sure it should take on the role. 
 “Keeping the two issues separate... will ensure both are given the specialised attention they need,” he said. 
 Questions were sent to the Office of the Prime Minister but remained unanswered by the time of writing.

Nicolette Ghirxi's femicide a wake-up call about underestimating risk - experts,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/nicolette-ghirxi-femicide-wakeup-call-underestimating-risk-experts.1096683,13-08-2024,005427.png,"The femicide of Nicolette Ghirxi, who was stabbed to death by her ex-partner on Sunday night, highlights the urgent need to address the often-underestimated dangers faced by victims of intimate partner violence, according to women’s rights experts.
 They agreed that the reporting system needs to be more sensitive to the realities of women who feel harassed or threatened. The women might not recognise the risks, but professionals should guide them and take any threats more seriously.
 Nicolette Ghirxi, 48, was stabbed to death in her apartment in Birkirkara and police shot dead the suspect - her Irish ex-partner Edward William Johnston, 50 - after he pointed a replica gun at officers in St Julian's on Monday morning. 
 Although there were no previous reports of violence between the two, Ghirxi had filed a harassment report in April linked to some emails Johnston sent her after their breakup in December.
 She was offered a risk assessment but declined – in writing - saying she did not feel at risk at that moment in time.
 She filed another report of harassment in May, again linked to emails described as harassing but not threatening. At the time the police established that Johnston was in Ireland.  
 Last month, Ghirxi informed police about slanderous posts written about her and that she suspected Johnston, who was still abroad at the time. 
 Family members told Times of Malta how Johnston ran  fake social media accounts posing as Ricardo Raspini and Lisa Campo to target his former partner, at one point making accusations about her sex life.
 He even attempted to have her sacked from her job at HSBC Malta, where she held a senior position as head of mortgages.
 Last Thursday at 9pm, Grixti informed police by email that Johnston might be in Malta.
 She was found dead on Monday at 2am in her apartment on Mro Giuseppe Busuttil Street in Swatar. Police said that her latest report was still being processed because it was considered ""low risk"". 
 Academic and activist Marceline Naudi said that women living in abusive relationships tend to underestimate the abuse and risk they face.
 “So when they say, in any way or form: ‘I feel at risk’ - then action needs to be swift. I would suggest that her reporting that the perpetrator was now in Malta could be seen as precisely such a situation,” she said.
 Victims of intimate partner violence find it difficult to admit and report that the person they chose as their partner was abusive, Naudi explained. 
 “It is often experienced as being humiliating and the reason is that we believe that people - society - will judge us. Society still expects us, especially as women, to make a relationship work. We still carry that responsibility One of the main things we need to do is change the mentality of society,” she said.
 Lawyer Marita Pace Dimech, who has been part of the legal team representing the family of  femicide victim Bernice Cassar, said that the fact that Ghirxi filed a report meant that there was some form of fear. 
 “While the victim could have been naïve in terms of not recognising the danger she was in, the professionals should have guided her and encouraged her to carry out the risk assessment to better understand the risk she was in,” the lawyer said. 
 She added that this showed a lack of training amongst staff and the lack of a follow-up system to such reports. 
 Karl Grech, from Victim Support Malta, said harassment and stalking ""should never be dismissed as minor"".
 ""When someone fixates on another person, their motives and potential actions are unpredictable, particularly given the unknowns around their mental state,"" he said. 
 Victims often hold back from escalating such incidents because ""they fear that police protection might be minimal, while the risk of provoking their perpetrator could be high,"" he noted.
 The National Council of Women agreed that the very report of harassment “is a cry for urgent help that must be addressed immediately…“We implore the people in authority to put stricter policies in place to investigate each harassment report with the strictest force of the law,” the council said.
 This sentiment was echoed by Anna Borg, chairperson of the Malta Women's Lobby, who said that the case of Ghirxi was a wake-up call. 
 “Research consistently shows that victims of violence from their partners, particularly those experiencing severe psychological trauma, may underestimate their risk of future violence,” she said adding that society had to recognise the signs of such risks and provide adequate support to those who may not fully perceive the danger they are in. 
 “It is also imperative for institutions offering support to potential victims to take any form of threat seriously, and it should not be the victim who assesses the risk posed, but the professionals working in the field, who are knowledgable of the fact that victims may not in a position to gauge the level of danger that they are in.”
 Elaine Compagno, from the Women for Women Foundation, said the foundation agreed that “it was not up to the victim to decide who is at risk or not - but the people taking the report should be trained enough to know that, if someone is pursuing and harassing someone months later, they need to recognise the signs of escalating risk”.
 “Unfortunately, the authorities tend to dismiss the level of risk,” said Compagno who has experience working with victims of domestic violence.   
 She said that in the case of Ghirxi, we know that she reported harassment more than once and, to report harassment even once there must be repetitive behaviour. Staff need to be trained to see that there is an escalation and that this person is in danger.
 The Malta Women’s Lobby called for immediate action that includes: 
 •    Enhanced Support Services: Strengthening resources available to victims, including psychological support, legal aid and emergency housing, to help them recognize the severity of their situation and take necessary steps to protect themselves.
 •    Improved Risk Assessment Training: Ensuring that all professionals who interact with victims of intimate partner violence—such as police officers, social workers and healthcare providers—are thoroughly trained in risk assessment and safety planning.
 •    Public Awareness Campaigns: Increasing public awareness of the signs of intimate partner violence and the resources available to those in need. It is crucial that friends, family members, and colleagues know how to support someone who may be at risk.
 •    Policy Reforms: Urging policymakers to review and strengthen laws related to stalking, harassment, and intimate partner violence, ensuring that they provide adequate protection for victims.

"Yorgen Fenech trial cannot proceed 'in an atmosphere of podcasts,' lawyers say",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/yorgen-fenech-trial-cannot-proceed-in-atmosphere-podcasts-lawyers-say.1101641,27-11-2024,005459.png,"Lawyers representing Yorgen Fenech insisted in court on Wednesday that their client's trial could not take place “in an atmosphere of podcasts,” flagging a series of productions about Daphne Caruana Galizia’s assassination which, they said, had been uploaded in flagrant breach of a court ban.
 The matter came to the fore at a pre-trial hearing after lawyer Jason Azzopardi expressed the Caruana Galizia family’s concerns about the passage of time for the start of the trial, adding that the family too had a right to a fair hearing within a reasonable time.
 Fenech has been under arrest since November 2019, awaiting trial for his alleged role in the journalist's car bomb murder in October  2017.
 Azzopardi’s brief intervention followed the testimony of court expert Martin Bajada who was summoned by the prosecution to update the court on the tasks assigned to him and the possible end date.
 Bajada’s task consisted mainly of preparing redacted copies of the assassinated journalist's correspondence in such manner as to ensure that her sources would not be revealed.
 During a previous session before the Magistrates’ Court where the evidence is being compiled, Bajada had indicated February as the date when he would likely wrap up his work.
 The case then moved back to the Criminal Court where Bajada was asked to testify.
 “As I said ten days ago, the first part [of my task] will be ready by January. The second part, by February,” said Bajada, explaining how he had split his work into two stages.
 He first had to read through 23,000 pages, equivalent to 11 books, and redact information according to the directions laid out by the court, he said.
 Once that was completed, he would make copies for the parties.
 He said it was an arduous, time-consuming task because he sometimes came across fresh information which would necessitate further redaction of previous pages. 
 “I will be ready by January but not before,” said Bajada, explaining that in her later days, the victim was “very active.”
 He reckoned that 75% of his task was ready.
 Under further questioning by the defence, Bajada explained that although he started working on the murder inquiry in 2017, he only received instructions to “censor” the victim’s correspondence in January 2024.
 “No one gave me any direction until this court did in 2024,” he said. “So technically I was tasked in January 2024.”
 Following that testimony, the expert left the courtroom.
 At that stage, Azzopardi addressed the court in the presence of two of the victim’s sisters.
 “The parte civile have been silent over the past sittings….The right to a fair hearing applies also to the victim,” he said.
 Speaking on behalf of the family, he said they wished to express their concern about the passage of time.
 He asked whether the court could order the expert to present “that 75%” of the work that was complete.
 Without in any way attributing delays to the court, he said the family wanted the judge to know “of their concern.”
 “It’s everyone’s concern,” remarked Madam Justice Edwina Grima. “Time has passed and we’re still compiling evidence since we have to safeguard [the victim’s] sources.”
 Defence lawyer Charles Mercieca intervened, saying that the defence would have no issue if the court were to revoke the expert’s brief so that the evidence might be presented “as is.”
 The court called back Bajada.
 “Can you present what is ready?”asked the judge.
 “I’ll do as the court orders,” replied the expert.
 He said he would produce the 75% completed work before the magistrate presiding over the re-opened compilation of evidence, then proceed with the rest of his task.
 At this point Mercieca said that it was good to speak of the right to a fair hearing but that must be observed both in and outside court.
 The Criminal Court, he noted, had twice imposed a ban on publications and comments about Fenech “but those orders were being repeatedly breached outside court"".
 Mercieca then made reference to a series of podcasts, the first of which was broadcast on September 25, and “every Wednesday since” related to this case.
 Every Wednesday, he said, the parte civile were breaching the ban while preaching to others about the rule of law and the right to a fair hearing.
 Out of all this, only one party was benefiting.
 “Such a virulent press campaign is only against us. How can the trial take place in an environment of podcasts? It cannot go ahead in such an environment,” argued Mercieca.
 “Who is doing these podcasts?”asked the judge, adding that the court was totally unaware of the matter.
 “The same person banned by your Honour and who subsequently went to challenge that ban before the courts,” said Mercieca.
 The defence had in fact presented notes about these podcasts together with transcripts of the script, he said.
 “Today is Wednesday. Another one has just been uploaded. We’re filing another note,” said Mercieca.
 The court directed the prosecution to summon the police commissioner to the next sitting.
 The case continues next week.
 Last month blogger Manuel Delia filed a constitutional case, claiming that a court ban on public comments and discussions about Daphne Caruana Galizia’s murder case and Yorgen Fenech, breached his freedom of expression and weakened the role of journalists to inform the public.
 AG lawyers Anthony Vella, Godwin Cini and Danika Vella prosecuted.
 Lawyers Gianluca Caruana Curran and Charles Mercieca were defence counsel.
 Lawyer Jason Azzopardi appeared for the Caruana Galizia family.

Hunters shoot each other in freak Żabbar turtle dove incident,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/hunters-shoot-following-zabbar-argument.1097830,09-09-2024,005463.png,"Updated 3.30pm
 Two hunters shot each other while in neighbouring Żabbar fields on Monday morning.
 The men were in adjacent fields on Triq San Anard when shots rang out at around 7.30am.
 A police spokesperson initially said the two had argued and fired at each other using their shotguns.
 But the police later said the incident was an accident: both men had fired at the same turtle dove and accidentally sprayed the other with lead pellets, a police spokesperson said. 
 The police are nevertheless investigating the case, he added. 
  
 One of the men, a 36-year-old Żabbar resident, was taken to Mater Dei Hospital for treatment. The other man, who is 35 years old and from Għargħur, was taken to a health centre for treatment.
 Both men suffered slight injuries in the incident.
 Bird hunting during autumn is allowed between the beginning of September and the end of January.
 Some 40 speicies of bird can be hunted from land but the European Turtle-dove (Gamiema) can only be hunted between 1st September and 30th September.

Watch: Man wields knuckle duster in Tal-Barrani road rage incident,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/watch-man-wields-knuckle-duster-talbarrani-road-rage-incident.1096418,08-07-2024,005469.png,"Updated 6.30pm with police response
 A man has been left shaken after an unknown person came at him with a knuckle duster after a minor collision in a road rage incident captured on camera. 
 The Austrian national told Times of Malta that the incident was further compounded by what he feels was poor treatment by the police, whom he says dismissed him when he tried to file a report. 
 The footage captured by the man shows the aggressor getting violent, before removing the knuckle duster and repeatedly hitting out at him and making violent threats. 
 The incident happened around 6.30pm on Monday while the man was driving back home after work and was stuck in the afternoon traffic.
 “I’ve been living in Malta for three years now, and this never happened to me before,” he told Times of Malta on Wednesday. 
 “I’m so disappointed by the police system. This man could be a danger to others, and I felt they did not make the effort to help me.”
  The man, who wished to remain anonymous, explained how he was aware the driver behind him, in a white van, was getting irritated because he was driving slowly.
 He said while he was changing lanes, the white van overtook his car, and in the process, nearly hit him.
 “At that point, I honked my horn at him, and that is when the man jumped out of his car and started to shout at me,” he said. 
 The man tried to continue driving, but the aggressor punched his car and left a dent in it.
 That is when he got out of his car to take a picture of the driver’s number plate, and the situation went from bad to worse. 
 He said the aggressor started to shout at him and his friend in the middle of the road and managed to hit him on the arm. Trying to keep his distance, he tried to kick the aggressor away.
 In the footage, the aggressor can be seen wearing a knuckle duster, which he removes before he hits the man. The aggressor can be heard swearing at the man and saying, “I will find you” and “I will call the police on you” as he once again hits the man’s phone. 
 After the aggressor got back in his van, the man and his friend called the emergency number, but he said no one picked up.
 He said he called the Żejtun police station and was told no police cars were available, and he would have to come to the station to file a report.
 He then drove to the Paola police station and claimed the police were unhelpful. 
 “They told me, ‘If I really want to make a police report, I can go ahead’. Go ahead? What is this system,” the man questioned.
 He said he provided police with sufficient evidence to take action, but the police said he would need to get a medical report to show that he was hit by the man, and then come back to file a police report.
 “The police did not show that they would take any action. If the same accident happened in Vienna and I showed the police the video, they would try and find him. I was so disappointed and I began to argue with them how they could not take any action.”
 The man decided to not file a police report, as he felt he would find no support or help from the police if he did so.
 ""Is it because I am a foreigner? I am disappointed because now I must deal with the damage to my car and my cracked mobile screen, which broke after the man hit it.""
 A police spokesperson later told Times of Malta the officer at Paola police station had requested the man be medically examined and attain a medical certificate from the nearby health centre. 
 ""Unfortunately the alleged victim never came back with the requested medical certificate and instead chose to report the incident to the media,"" he said. 
 He said they would like to contact the man to ""proceed with investigations in relation to the alleged bodily harm and also follow-up on the allegations made against the police officers"".

 Tragically, her efforts to save him had a devastating outcome – her son, Colin Galea, took his own life while in prison.
 “We were told, even by the court, that he would be given the care he needed. What care? They gave him back to me dead,” Isabelle says.
 The mother says she feels guilty she reported her son after 10 years of trying to help him.
 “I thought he’d be better off in there [prison], that they would help him and send him to a [drug rehabilitation] programme... It would have been better if I left him with the drug addition, at least I’d see him,” she says.
  Her son was one of 14 people who died in the space of three years during the time when Alex Dalli served as director of the Corradino Correction Facility between 2018 and 2021. Many of the deaths were by suicide.
 The others who died were: Mamadou Sakine, Seajay Cardona, Steve Farrugia, Noel Calleja, Mario Jean-Paul Carmelo Fenech, Francis Formosa, Ben Ali Wahid Ben Hassine, John Attard, Gordon Calleja, Nazzareno Mifsud, Ihtisham Ihtisham, Kim Borg Nicolas Virtu and Arun Jose.
 The realities of life inside the prison are highlighted in the documentary – The Kordin Prison Scandal – put together by Andrew Azzopardi and Peppi Azzopardi.
 Andrew said the initiative for the documentary stemmed from a desire to shed light on “that dark period”.
 
 “This troubling time exposed significant systemic issues within the correctional facility.
 ""It is widely acknowledged that the situation was dire, ultimately leading to the resignation of former director Dalli, despite his evident support from both the [Home Affairs] Minister and the government.”
 Dalli suspended himself in 2021 following a string of suicides and deaths behind bars that saw simmering concerns about his methods boil over. 
 An inquiry probing internal procedures at the Corradino Correctional Facility concluded that Dalli, a former army colonel, would not be reappointed prison director.
 Andrew Azzopardi said the documentary aimed to illustrate that improvements began taking shape following Dalli’s tenure. It also highlighted that many inquiries into these deaths remained unpublished and, in some cases, possibly incomplete. It also ensured that lessons were learned.
 Peppi Azzopardi added: “We tried to put all the things that happened over the years together, and add some more, and the question remains: it’s as though nothing happened. No action was taken. But here, through this documentary, we are showing that it is not true that nothing happened. A lot did. And it cannot happen again.”
  The documentary features a section about Kim Borg Nicolas Virtu who also ended her own life while in prison. Her father, Martin, spoke about how she was “ mentally traumatised” in prison.
 Marica Cassar, who knew the victim through Caritas, said she was a vulnerable person who ended up becoming addicted to drugs. But there were moments when Caritas attempts to reach her in prison were blocked.
 The one-hour documentary also features an old interview with Ben Ali Wahid Ben Hassine – the longest-serving inmate facing a life sentence.
 He was sentenced to life imprisonment in February 1992 for his part in the 1988 murder of two taxi drivers and two men, one British and the other French, in an 18-day killing spree that shocked the island.
  In 2017 his application for a review of his sentence was thrown out. He died two years later.
 In the interview he was quoted saying: “I made a mistake and I have to pay for it”.
 Peppi Azzopardi spoke about the need to replace the current prison system with a place that deprives people of liberty but not their dignity – and offers social reform.
 The documentary explored a range of issues that were in the media over the past years: a poster telling inmates that prison was a place where “they learn fear”, claims that Dalli put a gun to the mouth of an inmate, about a chair used to punish prisoners and claims of abusive solitary confinement.
 The claims were the subject of several libel cases that were thrown out by the courts.
 Inmate Alfred Bugeja, known as Il-Porporina, shared his story about how he first entered prison at the age of 16 for stealing cars – after his schoolteacher had encouraged him to steal the wipers of a car for him.
 He also started taking drugs in prison and eventually ended up getting his wife arrested for smuggling drugs into prison for him.
 “I aged in prison. I lost my parents and my wife…. I don’t want others to go through what I went through,” he says.
 This is why the documentary ends with recommendations that include removing solitary confinement, allowing media uncensored access, providing training to inmates, and addressing drug addiction which impacts 51 per cent of inmates.

Police: Accused in attempted double murder said he loved ex’s kids like his own,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/accused-attempted-double-murder-said-loved-ex-kids-like-own.1091744,21-06-2024,"005262.png,005263.png","A man who stands accused of attempting to murder his ex-partner’s daughters told investigators that he loved the girls “like his own children” and he remembered nothing of the assault.
 He was also unable to explain two Facebook photos he posted hours before the knife attack, one of them captioned with the word “vendetta.”
 Nazzareno Dalli, 43, is charged with attempted murder of the girls, aged 12 and 15 years old, in their home in Triq San Tumas in Marsa on March 9.
 The younger one was stabbed in the heart and lost up to 40 per cent of her blood, but is now recovering. The other was slightly injured. Dalli is pleading not guilty.
 Inspector Wayne Camilleri testified in the compilation of evidence about the two photos posted by the accused hours before the assault.
 The caption under one of them read: “Bonġu minn Zaren….lili ma jċekkinni ħadd…mhux se ċċekkinni int…Min jidħaq l-aħħar, jidħaq l-aħjar,” [Good morning from Zaren….No one will humiliate me….You won’t be the one to do so….He who laughs last, laughs best]. The picture showed Dalli, shirt unbuttoned, revealing a knife tucked at the waist.
 The vendetta-captioned picture showed Dalli standing against a darkish background at a nightclub, wearing a buttoned-up shirt that was possibly the same one worn at the time of the assault. 
 When confronted by those photos, Dalli told the police that he could not recall who had taken them. Nor could he explain the presence of that knife.
 A blood-smeared hunting knife, wrapped in a cloth, was found just behind the front door of the Marsa residence by scene of crime officers. Dalli had no recollection of that knife, even when it was unwrapped and shown to him during interrogation.
 The inspector also described the scene in the house after the assault saying the 12-year-old girl was in imminent danger of dying. Her 15-year-old sister was also injured.
 Doctors had told the police that the 12-year-old had suffered some 17 blows which damaged her vital organs and resulted in heavy bleeding. She was rushed, unconscious, to emergency surgery.
 Meanwhile her sister spoke to the inquiring magistrate and inspector, recounting how she was jolted out of her sleep at around 1pm by the screams of her younger sibling.
 She rushed to see what was happening and was met with a “scary scene.”
 She said her mother’s ex-partner, “Ronald tal-Muga,” (a family nickname) was stabbing her sister with a knife and there was a lot of blood all over the place.
 Although still drowsy, her immediate reaction was to try to stop the assault.
 But the aggressor turned upon her too, hitting her with the knife on her hand. Luckily she managed to get away, hiding in a room on the roof.  
 When the police arrived, there was blood splattered all over the place, mostly in the living room, with more traces on the stairs leading up to the roof and beyond, the inspector said. 
 He said the accused had walked into his ex’s home and out again in three minutes.
 Footage from various CCTV cameras along the street outside the residence where the alleged assault took place showed him walking up to the front door at 1:06pm-camera time not real time- testified the inspector.
 The suspect arrived from the direction of the Marsa bridge, drawing out a bunch of keys. Acting normally, he tried different keys and was successful on the third attempt, stepping inside and shutting the gate behind him.
  Soon, his ex’s 14-year old son rushed outside. He later described the aggression, saying that it was Dalli who stabbed his sisters.
 Dalli himself left the residence three minutes later, running in the direction of the Marsa bridge.
 He later turned himself in at Cospicua police station, asking whether police were searching for him.
 He was read out his rights and arrested. The process was filmed on police bodycams.
 The suspect’s jeans and t-shirt - apparently the same ones worn during the crime - were handed to the DNA expert. The shirt he wore in the two photos posted on Facebook, was never retrieved, explained the investigator.
 The inspector said Dalli spoke at length under interrogation about his relationship with the girls’ mother, referring to her as “his ex.”
 They had been together for three years and he “loved her a lot.” According to him “he would do anything for her……He could not understand why she did what she did, leading to break up. He never gave a specific reason for their breakup,” the inspector said.
 The accused said he had moved in with the girls’ mother for some time and regarded her children “as his own.”
 He claimed to have helped her as best as he could, even paying for her car insurance policy.
 But when shown the photos he had posted on Facebook hours before the incident, he could not recall who had taken them, although he identified the background as the Red Stars bar at Zejtun.
 Nor could he explain the presence of the knife visible in one of the photos.
 That night he was working as an unlicensed security guard at the Osiris nightclub, heading to the Red Stars in Żejtun when he clocked off around 5am.
 That was where he allegedly paid for some drugs which he took with a drink. He had also previously consumed cocaine.
 “He didn’t know what it was. He didn’t even remember who he bought it from, simply saying that it was a man from Serbia,” the inspector said.
 “After that it was total blackout. He insisted he could not remember anything. He went to the police station when he heard that the police were looking for him. He recalled nothing about the attack, not even that he was in Marsa,” testified Camilleri.
 Dalli himself requested police gather CCTV footage from the nightclub and Żejtun bar. He also offered to give a urine sample to support his intoxication claims.
 Shown footage from the crime scene, Dalli identified himself and recognised the street where his ex lived.
 “But he didn’t know how he had the key to the place. He never had the key when he lived there. He just could not explain how the key ended up in his possession,” the inspector said. 
 The inspector also pointed out that Dalli had been charged under arrest after his ex partner filed a domestic violence report in which she was slightly injured.  He was cleared after the alleged victim chose not to testify against him.
 In January, the woman filed another report claiming that this time round she was suffering psychological abuse.
 Her claims were assessed by Appoġġ who classified the case as “standard” and “no risk.”
 The police nonetheless prosecuted Dalli under summons.
 The case, presided over by Magistrate Marse-Ann Farrugia, continues.
 AG lawyers Etienne Savona and Manuel Grech prosecuted together with Inspectors Wayne Camilleri and Ian Vella.

Two charged with attempted robbery of Santa Venera jewellery shop,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/129228/two_charged_with_attempted_robbery_of_santa_venera_jewellery_shop_,16-05-2024,005275.png,"Two men have been charged in connection with an attempt to rob a jewellery shop in Santa Venera and the theft of an expensive high-performance SUV.
 Wilton Gatt, 28, from Zurrieq and Kieran Caruana, 20, from Qormi, were arraigned before magistrate Monica Vella on Thursday, accused of attempted theft from the jewellery shop, aggravated by violence, means, value and time.
 Gatt alone was also charged with conspiracy to steal a Porsche Cayenne SUV from Attard, driving without a licence and committing an offence during the operative period of a suspended sentence.
 Inspector Lydon Zammit said that the men were arrested in connection with a long-term investigation into a gang thought to be behind a string of violent robberies targeting shops. During the police investigation it had emerged that the two defendants could possibly have been involved in two of the incidents, namely an attempted theft early in the morning on April 21 from a jewellery shop at ST Venera and the theft of a Porsche Cayenne SUV, just a few minutes prior.
  It emerged that Caruana’s role had been to act as a look out while the robbery was underway. Gatt had a similar role in that theft, but he had also been involved in the theft of the Porsche. “Wilton had found them a buyer because they had been unable to sell it. He was the middleman,” said the inspector, adding that the proceeds from the sale were used to buy drugs.
 Caruana’s lawyer, Mark Busuttil, asked that the cases be dealt with separately, explaining that his client wished to plead guilty as part of an informal plea deal with the prosecution.
 The prosecution also requested the two defendants be tried separately, in view of this.
 After that request was upheld, Caruana pleaded guilty to the charge against him.
 The prosecution suggested Caruana receive a suspended sentence.
 In view of his limited involvement, clean criminal record and early guilty plea, the court sentenced him to one year in prison, suspended for four.
 Legal Procurator Colin Galea informed the court that Gatt was pleading not guilty. Bail was not requested for Gatt, who was subsequently remanded in custody.

"Wrong to have children in prisons visitors' hall, former dean insists",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/wrong-children-prisons-visitors-hall-dean-insists.1096680,13-08-2024,005288.png,"The Commissioner for Children said on Tuesday she is seeking information from the Director of Prisons after the former dean of the University's Faculty of Social Wellbeing complained about young children seen in the prisons visitors' hall.
 Andrew Azzopardi said in a Facebook post that in visits he had made to the prisons he had seen young children in the visitors' hall. They were there to meet parents or relatives.
 The visitors' halls were totally unsuitable for children, degrading and possibly harmful to their mental state, particularly when they would have gone through traumatic events. 
 Prof Azzopardi recalled that the government had boasted that it had set up facilities within and outside the prisons for visits by children. Those facilities, therefore, were either not being used or were not being used for everyone.
 He urged the commissioner to ensure that this situation was urgently tackled by the government and that proper facilities were provided for children making visits to the prisons. 
 He made a number of suggestions, saying children should not be in the main prisons building and visits should be made in appropriate facilities. Ideally,  their relatives should not be wearing prison uniforms and searches should be tactful.
 The Children's Commissioner should also be represented on prisons structures such as the visitors' board. 
 Extended visits should be arranged on occasions such as birthdays.

Joseph Muscat requests publication of Vitals inquiry evidence against him,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/129241/joseph_muscat_requests_full_publication_of_vitals_inquiry_in_constitutional_case,17-05-2024,005318.png,"Lawyers for Joseph Muscat have asked the court which recently granted him access to the parts of the magisterial inquiry into the government’s fraudulent deal with Vitals Global Healthcare where he is mentioned, to make the documents available to the public.
 This emerges from an application filed as part of Muscat’s court case against the State Advocate and the Attorney General, through which the disgraced former Prime Minister was given a copy of all documentation relating to Muscat that had been gathered during the inquiry.
 On May 9, Mr. Justice Giovanni Grixti had ruled that Muscat was to be given immediate access to the relevant documentation. But the Magistrate before whom Muscat is due to be arraigned in the coming days, subsequently extended Judge Grixti’s order to all 23 individuals who are to face criminal charges in the coming days.
 The application filed by lawyers Charlon Gouder and Vincent Galea on Friday, states that “access to the documentation in our possession, consisting of acts from the inquiry which were deposited by the Attorney General after the April 9 decree does not remain restricted to the parties in this case, but also be deposited in the court’s registry in order to form part of the acts of this case, visible and accessible to anyone who wants to see the file.”
  The reason behind the request, according to Muscat’s lawyers, is that “as there are indications that the report is already in the hands of third parties, especially in the hands of those who had themselves instigated this inquiry, there is already the risk that someone could try and be selective in the publication of this report in order to create an imbalance.”
 In order to avoid this scenario, “and with respect to the right to a fair hearing as well as to transparency, those parts of the inquiry which are in the court’s custody and visible to the parties, upon their request, are to be left in the registry of the court, in order to be visible and accessible.”
 Muscat also took to Facebook to announce the court request.
 “As I have already stated before, after reviewing the parts of the inquiry that concern me, I am more than convinced that this is a case built on conjectures, lies, distortions of facts, and hearsay,” Muscat said in a Facebook post.
 “It is my desire to publish this report. However, if I proceed to do so, I would be breaking the law and showing contempt for the Court.
 “Therefore, through my lawyers, I have requested that these parts of the inquiry become part of the court case before the Constitutional Court. This way, they will become public, and everyone, including journalists, will be able to obtain a copy.
 “This is the only step I can take to legally publish this part of the inquiry, and I am committed to following the law. I am convinced that if this happens, it will be shown that this is just a castle of sand that will be swept away not only by a wave but even by a tsunami,” Muscat said.
 Muscat on Wednesday said he had seen two documents concerning the charges against him, and not the entire inquiry report, penned by an Irish team of experts and a Serbian court expert, which he claims carry no rationale on how the accusations were arrived at, or how the alleged scale of fraud was quantified.
 He has since had all his assets frozen, with a cautionary value of €30 million.
 Muscat did not mention the name of an Indian national who is believed to be the main source of the allegation against him. The allegation – Muscat said – is that he was pocketing €16 million a year which he had stashed in a Dubai company. “The inquiry states that there is no evidence of this cash, and yet they are still charging me... the allegation and reasoning is simply the kind of logic you hear in a bar on Sunday morning.”
 “I am looking forward to this. I am convinced that once this Calvary is over, anyone who is associated with the charges will be the cause of the Nationalist Party’s destruction,” Muscat said. “It’s the last nail in the party’s coffin.”  ",Matthew Vella ,court_and_police
Top court calls for flexibility in freezing order decisions,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/132353/top_court_calls_for_flexibility_in_freezing_order_decisions,18-11-2024,005328.png,"In a landmark judgment, the court dismissed an appeal by Keith Schembri, Konrad Mizzi, and others while urging legislative changes to allow greater flexibility in resolving complex cases involving freezing orders.

 The Constitutional Court delivered a significant ruling today, emphasising that criminal courts should take the time necessary to ensure justice when deciding on freezing orders. This came after a judge at a Criminal Court last June upheld a request by Keith Schembri and Konrad Mizzi for a constitutional review of the seven-day time-limit imposed on defendants to contest a freezing order. Schembri and Mizzi had challenged the seven-working-day limit imposed by law for contesting freezing orders, arguing that it placed them at a disadvantage.

                     While prosecutors have ample time to prepare such requests, defendants face strict deadlines to file objections. This, they claimed, created an imbalance between the prosecution and the defence, especially in complex money laundering cases involving significant assets.

 The pair face corruption and money laundering charges linked to the Vitals case. The Attorney General had objected to their request.

 The appellants argued that the Proceeds of Crime Act violated their right to a fair hearing and the peaceful enjoyment of property. They called for more flexibility, especially in cases where millions of euros were at stake and intricate legal arguments needed to be addressed.

 Earlier this year, the Civil Court in its constitutional jurisdiction dismissed their claims, stating that freezing orders fall under the discretion of the Criminal Court.

 The Constitutional Court upheld this decision on Monday, ruling that Schembri and Mizzi’s case did not demonstrate a breach of their rights. They had managed to file their objections within the seven-day limit, undermining their claim of insufficient time. However, the court acknowledged that the rigid application of time limits could hinder justice in more complex cases.

 Chief Justice Mark Chetcuti and Judges Giannino Caruana Demajo and Anthony Ellul urged lawmakers to reconsider the seven-day limit and allow criminal courts the discretion to extend deadlines when necessary.

 The judges pointed out that while strict timeframes promote efficiency and predictability, they fail to account for the varying complexity of cases.

 They stressed that each case must be assessed on its merits, with judges retaining the flexibility to take additional time when required, provided they clearly document their reasons.     ",Jordan Pace ,court_and_police

 Hamdi Habib Mohammed Shedi, a 38-year-old Tunisian migrant living at Hal Far Tent Village was arrested after being tracked down as the suspect behind the robbery.
 He was allegedly caught on CCTV footage exiting the residence on Market Street through a window, his face clearly identifiable. 
 A laptop and an amount of cash exceeding €1000 was reported stolen on the night of May 23.
 On Tuesday, Shedi was escorted to court under arrest and charged with aggravated theft. Assisted by an Arab-speaking interpreter the accused registered an admission.
 The court, presided over by Magistrate Yana Micallef Stafrace, gave him time to reconsider, warning the accused about the implications of that guilty plea which could possibly result in effective imprisonment. 
 After due reconsideration, the accused confirmed his admission. 
 In light of that admission and the fact that he was charged as a recidivist, the court condemned the accused to a two-year effective jail term.

 Ali appeared in court on Wednesday after travelling to Malta voluntarily in order to be arraigned.
  Magistrate Leonard Caruana presided over the arraignment, in which Ali did not appear in court under arrest. The defendant, through his lawyer, declared to the court that he had come to court voluntarily and declared himself as notified both on a personal basis and on behalf of Eurasia limited and Tunisian companies STE Health Co and Incorp Sarl.
 Ali alone was charged with having in the years between 2013 and 2023, being involved in organised crime and participation in the same. He was further accused of bribing former Prime Minister Joseph Muscat, former OPM Chief of Staff Keith Schembri, former Minister Konrad Mizzi, as well as Steward's - previously Vitals’ - accountant Christopher Spiteri.
 He is accused of offences relating to money laundering, trading in influence fraud, making fraudulent gain to the detriment of the Government of Malta and conspiracy to commit an imprisonable crime in Malta.
 Ali and Eurasia Ltd alone were further charged with bribery, false accounting, misappropriation, failing to declare relevant income to VAT authorities between 2017-2020, making false declarations to VAT and Inland Revenue departments in that period.
 A freezing order amounting to some €23 million was requested.
 Ali, who described his occupation as a business development consultant, replied “absolutely not guilty” when asked what he was pleading to the charges. Joseph Muscat, too, had used that phrase, during his own arraignment last week.
 At the start of the sitting the prosecution requested the separation of the proceedings against STE Health Company and those against the rest of the defendants.
 Repubblika’s lawyer, Jason Azzopardi gave notice to the court that he had filed an application earlier this morning requesting the NGO be permitted to join the suit as parte civile.
 The Registrar of Courts, Franklin Calleja, testified that yesterday the prosecution had filed a request for the exhibition of the Vitals inquiry in the acts of these proceedings, which was yet to be approved by the inquiring magistrate.
 Prosecutor Rebekah Spiteri said the prosecution had relied on the inquiry  to quantify the amount, which meant that the law had been adhered to. “Previously, the law did not impose an obligation on the prosecution to substantiate their request. Now the law does and we have kept with it.”
 “The law is clear that the court shall either issue a seize and freeze order or a temporary seize and freeze order,” replied Ghaznavi. “This means that the court is not a rubber stamp but must make some sort of evaluation before choosing which to apply.
 “In the present case, you don’t have to be a rocket scientist to see whether the offences are relevant offences or not, but when it comes to reasonable cause for seizure, the court is called upon to make an evaluation. In the case we have today, there is currently in place an attachment order which will fall when the seize and freeze order is issued. So there is no fear that these assets will somehow be diminished or disposed of for the time being.”
 He suggested that the court had insufficient evidence before it at this stage to justify the acceptance of the AG’s request. 
 The court, after having seen the prosecution’s request for the issuing of a seizure and freezing order, and after hearing the parties’ submissions on the matter, as well as referring to the law, acceded to the prosecution’s request and issued an order for freezing and seizing  over Assad Shaukat Ali for €22 million and Eurasia €1.1 million and €100,000 over Incorp. 
 The Director of the Asset Recovery Bureau was also ordered to investigate, find and list any other assets controlled by the defendants for this purpose.
 Following the issuing of this order, the defence requested the court allow Ali to withdraw an annual sum of up to €21,945 per annum in terms of law. 
 The prosecution asked the court to order Ali not to disclose or share any document submitted in court with the media or on social media. Ali would be required to give advance notice to the court should he intend to leave the Maltese islands for work or leisure and provide a personal guarantee to ensure his observance of those conditions.
 Ghaznavi said he would be objecting to the request for an order prohibiting the disclosure of documents if it only bound the defendant and not third parties who are not accredited journalists from making public statements to which the defendant would be prohibited from replying to.
 With regards to the requested guarantee, the lawyer stressed that Ali had come to court voluntarily. 
 A decree on the requests will be given in chambers, said the magistrate.
 While the parties discussed the date for the next sitting. Ghaznavi explained that the defence had been waiting for a copy of the evidence since May 21 and was yet to receive it. The magistrate said he was aware of this. 
 The case was adjourned to 9am on June 21.
 Superintendent Hubert Cini and police Inspector Wayne Rodney Borg will be prosecuting, assisted by prosecutors Francesco Refalo, Rebekah Spiteri and Shelby Aquilina.

  In an application filed in court this morning, lawyers Gianluca Caruana Curran, Marion Camilleri and Charles Merceica, said that during Azzopardi’s interview with Lovin Malta, he had committed a “flagrant breach” of a court order, by speaking about a Fenech’s pardon request and by telling the interviewer that “the evidence that was legally collected, point towards Yorgen Fenech alone as being the person who commissioned the murder.”
 Azzopardi’s declarations contradicted the testimony of a witness, represented by Azzopardi’s law firm, who had “mentioned several people as having commissioned” the murder, said Fenech’s lawyers, as well as evidence which they say, indicated “at least five” other people as principals. It also ran contrary to claims made by the Degiorgio brothers, whom Azzopardi had summonsed as witnesses to support his defence in the libel case filed against Azzopardi by former minister Carmelo Abela, as well as the prosecutors in the Fenech case, who had declared to the court in April 2021 that “nobody is convinced that everyone connected to this case has been charged.”
 Fenech’s lawyers condemned Azzopardi’s behaviour was “not correct and showed contempt both to how a free proceedings should be managed, as well as towards the intentions of the Court,” accusing Azzopardi of prejudicing the presumption of their client’s innocence. The lawyers suggested that Azzopardi might be “protecting someone” by his “categorical exclusion” of other masterminds.

"VIP parties, corruption and fraud: Lawyer ‘uncovers’ ID card racket",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/vip-parties-corruption-fraud-lawyer-uncovers-id-card-racket.1096227,08-02-2024,005421.png,"Updated 3.30pm
 A woman who organised private parties, where drugs flowed freely and Latin American prostitutes mingled with VIP guests, bragged about how easily she obtained permits for her girls thanks to her “corrupt” contacts.
 The shady dealings of the party organiser were divulged in a sworn 59-page application filed in court by lawyer and former MP Jason Azzopardi who is calling for an “urgent” magisterial inquiry into what appears to be a large-scale identity fraud racket. 
 The lawyer claimed that since 2015, some 18,000 identity cards were issued on the back of marriage certificates and other documents fabricated by Identità officials. 
 Azzopardi said he was recently approached by “a man” who claimed to have attended several parties organised by this Colombian woman, a “portly figure” (godlija) aged 40 or so, with a tattoo close to her shoulder. 
 The source shared this first-hand information with Azzopardi on condition of anonymity. 
 The woman openly bragged about how easy it was for her to get work permits for her workers through contacts at Identitá, the government agency issuing ID cards and residence permits.
 She claimed these public officials were paid “large sums of money” or offered free invites to her parties where cocaine flowed “abundantly” and prostitutes mingled with distinguished guests.
 “MPs from both sides of parliament, a government minister, doctors, lawyers, government officials and employees” attended those parties held at a rented villa in Wardija, a central Mellieħa apartment as well as an apartment in St Julian’s. 
 A male contact frequently mentioned by the Colombian woman appeared to be one of the masterminds identified by Azzopardi. 
 Several persons, including members of the police corps, stepped forward in recent weeks to share “very sensitive” information about the criminal organisation behind the alleged racket.
 Third country nationals, mostly Egyptian and Libyan, were offered “a fast-tracked” ID card in exchange for thousands in cash. Documents were issued in record time, under 30 days, Azzopardi claimed.
 Three cases involving Egyptian nationals were presented in evidence by Azzopardi.
 One case concerned a man who was charged in court some weeks ago for document fraud. 
 His wrongdoing allegedly consisted of telling authorities that he was married to an English woman to obtain a permit to live and work in Malta. 
 But he protested his innocence and his case is still ongoing.
 The Englishwoman, named as his ‘spouse’ on his marriage-for-residence certificate, denied having ever been married to him or any other Egyptian national. 
 She was tracked down by Maltese immigration police and travelled to Malta to testify in the proceedings. 
 She told the court that someone from Identity Malta had contacted her in 2022 asking her to confirm her ‘marriage’ to an Egyptian. She next heard about the matter when the police called her this year. 
 During that court sitting, the presiding magistrate ordered the police commissioner to investigate two agency officials who gave “totally conflicting” testimonies. 
 Questions by the accused’s lawyer revealed that personal details on ID or permit applications were inputted into the agency’s computer system by a former official who no longer worked at Identitá’s expatriates section. 
 Now Azzopardi is alleging that that official played an important role in the greater criminal scheme, together with other corrupt government officials.
 Together they fabricated certificates so that third-country nationals would acquire the right to live and move freely throughout Schengen states. 
 These TCNs were falsely described as being married to EU citizens, mostly from pre-Brexit UK, and were ‘unknowingly’ linked to some Maltese address with which they had no ties.
 The man identified as the mastermind had acquired a reputation among TCNs of easily securing documents through illegal channels against payment. 
 TCNs who paid hefty sums for the fraudulent documents said they were directed to Identitá’s office in Marsa after office hours. 
 The man’s “right hand” official let them in through a secondary entrance, took their photo and told them to call for the document some days later. 
 An ID card could cost anything between €2,000 and €8,000.
 Azzopardi fired an important warning. 
 None of the fabricated certificates existed and they “could not be found inside Identitá files.
 “They appear to have already been destroyed by the [agency] employees who were involved as authors or accomplices in this racket,” claimed the lawyer. 
 Two TCNs who were prosecuted and jailed after being found in possession of fraudulent documents, asked for whistleblower status to disclose the identity of the masterminds behind this racket. 
 Their request was turned down and police did not seek a magisterial inquiry. 
 When an Egyptian man was stopped at the airport because of his suspicious document, he received a call later that same day by an alleged mastermind who had evidently been tipped off about the arrest through corrupt sources within the police corps.
 A police inspector who was heading investigations was “diplomatically removed” from the case after making it clear that he intended to take criminal action against the masterminds.
 This was why a magisterial inquiry was “urgently” required.
 Servers, mobile phones, computers, CCTVs and cloud accounts linked to suspects had to be seized and preserved. 
 Those involved in the racket were liable to prosecution for bribery, criminal conspiracy, trading in influence, fraud, forgery and money laundering.
 There appeared to be enough prima facie evidence that the masterminds identified in Azzopardi’s application had “systematically” promoted the racket for a number of years. 
 This was a “textbook case of computer-related fraud and… forgery” aggravated by the fact that one of the suspects was a public official, claimed the lawyer. 
 In a statement, Aġenzija Identità reiterated it took any allegation, doubt or report seriously, and, in line with this, it had strengthened its diligence structures. 
 It added it fully cooperated with investigating authorities.
 ""Following an internal investigation by the Compliance sector and the Expatriates Unit, the agency passed on information - including evidence about some individuals - to the police, so that the Force can continue with its investigation and take any necessary action.
 ""The agency does not tolerate any form of abuse, from no one.""
 Last month Identità denied reports it had issued thousands of ID cards to foreign nationals.

Witness recalls how she found bullying victim in distress and ‘clutching her side’,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/132712/witness_recalls_how_she_found_bullying_victim_in_distress_and_clutching_her_side_,10-12-2024,005427.png,"A 15-year-old girl who was allegedly assaulted and stabbed was found visibly in distress and ‘clutching her side’ after having been allegedly subject to an attack involving a penknife, a passer-by told the Court.

 Criminal proceedings against Jake Dalli Balzan, 21, who stands accused of causing slight injury to the victim, complicity, extortion, and possession of a firearm, resumed on Tuesday.

                     A friend of the alleged 15-year-old victim testified that despite her being friends with the victim for around two years, the victim had not told her much about the bullying she had endured. She did recall, however, that on one occasion the victim had informed her through a telephone call that she had given €40 to a 13-year-old girl after she found her waiting with a knife in the school toilets.

 She further recounted how on the day of the incident, she had a presentiment that something happened to her friend once she saw an ambulance pass by.

 A passer-by also took the witness stand, testifying that during the afternoon of 21 November 2024 she noted a girl crying and clutching her side. She recalled how the girl replied that she had been stabbed with a penknife when asked if she required assistance. 

 Though she confirmed that the girl was visibly in distress, she could not confirm whether she saw blood as she had maintained quite a distance from her. 

 Once asked for her parents’ phone number, the girl lost consciousness, the witness informed the Court. The Court also heard how the girl’s mother had stated that her daughter had received threats for some time. 

 The father of the alleged victim also testified, stating how he noted distinct changes in the behaviour of his daughter as soon as the scholastic year had kicked off. He also recalled that on various occasions, he and other members of his family had noted missing amounts of money, with approximately €800 in total going missing. 

 To this end, a small camera in the kitchen was installed. Through footage obtained by said camera, the father stated, he caught his daughter in the act of taking money. 

 When confronted by her father, on the same day and in the presence of her headmaster, the daughter, the man recalled, trembled, stating that ‘they will kill me’. At this point, the girl had explained what had been taking place, with the father deciding that his daughter was not to attend school until the matter was resolved. 

 Soon after, the girl had received threatening messages on social media platform Instagram.

 Recounting the day of the attack which led his daughter to be taken to hospital, the father stated that he had been informed through a telephone call by a woman that his daughter was ‘lying on the ground’ even though, the father noted, she was meant to be at home. 

 After rushing to the scene, the father noted that he found his daughter ‘covered’ by a sheet, which led him to expect the worst. It transpired that the sheet was used as the girl felt cold. 

 The father testified that this was also not the first time his daughter wound up at the hospital, insofar as she had been on various occasions due to panic attacks. 

 When cross-examined by defence lawyer David Bonello, the father confirmed that his daughter told him that she had recognised the written tattoo on the hand of her aggressor. It was noted by Dr. Bonello that the accused does not have such a tattoo. 

 A request for bail was also denied during the sitting.     ",Thomas Cilia ,court_and_police

Vitals magistrate told prosecution to 'charge' not 'investigate further',timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/vitals-magistrate-told-prosecution-charge-investigate-further.1094231,20-06-2024,005448.png,"The magistrate heading the “voluminous” Vitals inquiry did not direct the prosecution to “investigate further” but to “charge these persons with crimes,” the prosecution stressed on Thursday.
 Attorney General lawyer Francesco Refalo was making the point when arguing that all those charged accordingly had a case to answer. 
 The inquiring magistrate had issued “clear directions,” Refalo said when money laundering proceedings against former Prime Minister Joseph Muscat, his former chief of staff Keith Schembri and former minister Konrad Mizzi resumed.
 Prosecutors allege that the former prime minister and 13 other defendants took bribes and committed acts of fraud and money laundering as part of the Muscat-led government’s project to award Vitals Global Healthcare a 30-year deal to run three state hospitals.
 The deal was annulled last year by a civil court on the basis of fraud. The decision was  confirmed on appeal, with the superior court declaring that there was “collusion” between the concessionaire and top public figures. 
 All defendants are pleading not guilty to the charges. 
 Most of Thursday’s sitting was taken up by testimonies concerning the cancer-treating cyclotron project which, according to the inquiry conclusions, did not exist. 
 Lawyers assisting companies involved in that project, namely Technoline Ltd, Mtrace Ltd and Gateway Solutions Ltd, summoned witnesses to prove that works were done at the Malta Life Sciences Park at San Ġwann to get that cancer-treatment project underway.
 Representatives for a service provider, a fire safety company, a shipping company, a freight forwarder as well as a construction worker gave an overview of the work done. 
 A ‘bunker’-like facility at level -1 in an area of the Life Sciences Park was purposely built to house the equipment that was the crux of the project originally conceived in 2009. 
 Two 40-foot-high containers of equipment were shipped from Ravenna to the Malta Freeport in November 2017. 
 They were forwarded to the Life Sciences Park and “boxes” of cargo were unloaded in an area of those premises. 
 But the project was eventually “aborted” and no permit for the installation of the machinery was issued. 
 A representative for the Radiation Protection Board said that they inspected the structure prepared for the cyclotron project and engaged a foreign expert to carry out further inspections in 2017.
 But they never saw the cyclotron itself. 
 “The cyclotron was still in boxes… The project stopped,” said the witness, explaining that he was under the impression that works were still ongoing for the project to take off. 
 Thursday’s session ended with submissions by the prosecution on whether there was sufficient prima facie evidence for the court to declare that the accused had a case to answer. 
 Muscat’s lawyers informed the court that they were not contesting that, but only to ensure that the proceedings would be concluded expediently. 
 Most of the other persons charged, including Schembri and Mizzi likewise did not contest the prima facie stage, declaring that they would bow to the court’s decision. 
 Prosecuting lawyer Francesco Refalo ran the court through a money trail that allegedly linked the persons charged to fraud, pointing out that certain funds meant for the hospitals concession served to purchase company shares.
 He insisted that evidence showed that one of those contesting the prima facie, namely Taomac Ltd, had acted as a “smokescreen” and that “there was more than prima facie” as far as that company was concerned. 
 Taomac Ltd was facing money laundering charges over a “suspicious” €62,500 transaction. But lawyer Veronique Dalli said the prosecution simply mentioned “suspicion” and nothing else when referring to charges against Taomac. 
 And the company’s name had only featured once in the Vitals report drawn up by the experts, including two foreign forensic financial analysts, who never “bothered” to send for the company’s representatives for an explanation about that transaction. 
 Nor had investigators searched the company’s offices or seized any documents. 
 Yet they concluded that Taomac Ltd had acted “as a front” simply because it had transferred its shareholding capital at the same price. 
 The company, incorporated in 2012, had a business plan with Saint James Hospital for a cyclotron project. 
 But Saint James Hospital subsequently pulled out of the plan after sensing a “lack of transparency.”
 Taomac was asked to move out of the project by Malta Enterprise after the company itself revealed in reply to due diligence questions that it was facing some proceedings in Italy over some report about the illegal dumping of materials. 
 The company was later cleared, stressed Dalli. 
 Those €62,500 represented the share capital which Taomac was instructed to hold on to by Malta Enterprise until another interested purchaser materialized, said the lawyer. 
 Taomac was totally extraneous to VGH, argued Dalli. “This is immensely dangerous,” added the lawyer who insisted that Taomac had no case to answer. 
 The case continues next week.

"Man off the hook after trying to strangle partner, threatened to kill cats",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/victim-drops-case-partner-tried-strangling-10-times-kill-cats.1093081,27-05-2024,005458.png,"A man who was facing a criminal case for trying to strangle his partner and threatening to kill her cats has walked free after the victim pleaded with the court to drop the complaint.
 Oscar Olsen, a 28-year-old from Sweden, left the court after Magistrate Abigail Critien accepted the victim’s request for the case to be dropped.
 The incident that prompted the court case started on a Saturday night earlier this month when the couple were watching television and drinking alcohol at a friend’s place. Olsen took his partner’s mobile phone and suddenly turned aggressive when he discovered she was chatting with other men, the court was told.
 His reaction prompted neighbours to call the police, while their friends tried to calm the accused, inspector Sherona Buhagiar explained in court.
 Later that night, Olsen turned up at her place and attempted to strangle her “10 times” throughout the night.
 He also allegedly called her “a whore”, a “slut,” and other offensive names, and threatened to kill her pet cats, the inspector said.
 At around 7am, the woman typed a Facebook message to the police, calling for help.
 “He’s going to kill me and then kill himself,” read the message.
 The man was arrested and charged in court.
 The accused claimed that his partner had triggered the argument and he had acted in self-defence.
 During the first sitting before Magistrate Critien, the victim – the prosecution’s sole witness – declared under oath that she did not want to testify against the accused and wanted to withdraw the case.
 The magistrate told her this was not automatic and that the court could still order that the case against the accused continues.
 Earlier this month, another magistrate, Joseph Gatt, denied the victim’s request for the case to be dropped.
 Magistrate Critien explained to the woman that should the case be dropped, the protection order that the court had issued with not have any effect.
 Defence lawyers Franco Debono and Adreana Zammit urged the court to accept the withdrawal of the complaint since she stood firm by her position and made it abundantly clear it was her wish not to press on with the proceedings when repeatedly asked by the magistrate and the prosecution to determine the voluntariness of her wish. 
 The woman told the court she understood the repercussions of her request and insisted on not testifying.
 The court acceded to the request for the case to be withdrawn and declared the accused not guilty and released from arrest.
 AG lawyers Manuel Grech and Etienne Savona prosecuted, together with Inspector Sherona Buhagiar.

Two men held under arrest after Msida drug trafficking raid,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/130956/two_men_arrested_in_msida_drug_trafficking_raid1,30-08-2024,005466.png,"A surveillance operation by the Drugs Squad has resulted in two men being accused of trafficking cocaine and heroin.
 48-year-old Jason Zammit from Pietà and Burgh Spiteri, 34, from Hamrun were arraigned before magistrate Giannella Camilleri Busuttil in two separate arraignments on Friday, accused of trafficking cocaine and heroin, possession of the drugs in circumstances indicating that it was not for personal use, within 100 metres of a place where young people gather. Spiteri was also charged with recidivism, while Spiteri was further charged with breaching two sets of bail conditions.
  The arrests came after several weeks of investigations by the police, according to an official statement. Officers had staked out the residence from where drugs were suspected of being sold. 
 Zammit was arraigned first. Inspector Pace explained that the police had been investigating for months, covertly observing a property in Msida not far from Junior College, across the road from a childcare centre.
 Police inspectors John Leigh Howard and Jonathan Pace told the court that the entrance to the property from which the drugs were allegedly being sold was blocked from the inside with a block of wood.
 After the police gained entry, five people - Zammit amongst them - were found inside. Pace said he recognised Zammit from his previous run-ins with the law. 
 The court heard that a table appeared to have been hastily cleaned, and traces of drugs were found on it. Cash and cocaine were also found inside a locked safe.
 The police Inspector added that Zammit had not answered when the police asked him why he had been sleeping at the flat, when he was supposed to be staying with his mother while on bail in connection with a previous case.
 In court it emerged that police officers had found the two men inside the property, together with three women. Several sachets of what police suspect to be cocaine and heroin were also found, packaged in a manner suggesting that they were ready to be sold, along with paraphernalia related to drug trafficking.
 Further searches by the police resulted in the discovery of a bag containing around 50 grams of a substance suspected to be cocaine, as well as a significant amount of cash.
 Zammit, who told the court that he was unemployed, pleaded not guilty to the charges. Bail was not requested, with the defence explaining that this was due to the fact that there appeared to be several civilian witnesses who were yet to testify.
 Inspector Pace told the court that the man had behaved himself with the police and appeared to have a serious addiction problem. The court made a recommendation to the prison authorities that the man receive the necessary treatment while in custody. 
 After Zammit was led away, it was Burgh Spiteri’s turn in the dock. 
 Inspector Pace said that the man had been arrested during the same raid, the police finding him in bed with a woman. Foil and the key to a safe where heroin was found were beside the bed. “Not only were people consuming drugs in this house, but drugs were being sold from there.”
 Both men had been observed using a Mercedes as well as a scooter to get around. The court heard that Spiteri had released a statement, in which he acknowledged that he sometimes sold drugs to maintain his own habit. Recorded conversations obtained by the police indicated that Spiteri would also be in contact with individuals abroad in terms of drug trafficking, said the inspector.
 Spiteri, who told the court that he worked as a dog breeder, pleaded not guilty to the charges.
 His lawyer requested bail, arguing that the man had cooperated with the police and his last conviction was in 2013, indicating an address in Ħamrun where he could reside. 
 Inspector Pace objected, telling the court that contrary to what the defence had told the court, the prosecution was informed that the defendant did not presently have anywhere to live, as last week he and his wife were separating. The police had gone several times to his previous residence to respond to reports from his partner “who wanted to throw him out of the house.” As his dog-breeding business had been a joint venture with his estranged partner, he did not have a job.
 Individuals who had been present in the property during the raid, and others who came to buy drugs while the police were there. Calls show he had been arranging drug deals. The inspector said although Spiteri didn’t appear to be a major drug dealer, around €800 in cash and sachets containing brown powder, suspected to be heroin, had been found in his safe together with documents naming both Spiteri and Zammit documenting what appeared to be drug sales.
 In his own statement, Spiteri admitted that he “might have touched” the substances discovered by the police, added the inspector.
 The prosecution expressed concerns about Spiteri’s trustworthiness for the purposes of bail. He had been granted bail in July in other proceedings, added the inspector, but had not been found at the address indicated in his bail conditions. 
 Bail was denied, with the court making a similar recommendation to the prison administration to that it had made for Zammit.
 The prosecution asked the court to issue a freezing and seizure order over his assets, which was upheld after the defence did not object.

Complaints of payment disruptions following probe into Blackcatcard issuer,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/complaints-payment-disruptions-following-blackcatcard-probe.1094364,26-06-2024,"005468.png,005469.png,005470.png","Customers of a payment card issued by a financial entity in Gżira that was searched by police in connection with alleged money laundering say they have been unable to access their funds for several months.
 A number of Blackcatcard customers told Times of Malta they have been unable to make bank transfers using the SEPA network – a system for transferring funds between European bank accounts – since at least February.
 The card is issued by Papaya Ltd, a company that hit the headlines, also in February, after it emerged the firm was the focal point of a large-scale investigation into an alleged “Russian-Eurasian criminal network”.
 Papaya Ltd insists SEPA services are available, with a “significant fraction” of Blackcatcard customers able to make such transfers.
  In February, Times of Malta revealed police had carried out searches of the financial entity as part of an international investigation into alleged money laundering.
  In a statement at the time, the company said the investigation reported in the media – which it said focused on some of its clients and not the company – did “not affect Papaya’s business”, stressing its operations were continuing as normal.
 But, according to its customers, this is not the case; Blackcatcard account holders say they have been unable to make Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) for months.
 They also say they have been left without an International Bank Account Number (IBAN), leaving them unable to transfer money to other bank accounts using alternative methods.
 Blackcatcard customers who spoke to Times of Malta on condition of anonymity said they have been unable to withdraw funds since around the time of the investigation, with one saying he had “no way to get it [the funds] back; SEPA is impossible now.”
 Another customer said he is a business customer of Blackcatcard, and the lack of bank transfer functionality had left his company “unable to transfer money, pay online with card or withdraw from an ATM [cash machine],” adding he had been waiting almost 40 days for the delivery of a new card from the company.
 “Our company has a pretty big sum on the account, I am very nervous already. Nothing is working properly in this institution over the last months.”
 
 He and others said they had been told by Papaya it had recently partnered with UK-based company Tompay to restore SEPA payments and was rolling out IBANs to customers “in batches”.
 But despite the promise, they have still not received an IBAN.
 “We were assured more than a month ago by phone from Papaya we will be in the first batch in connecting to new IBANs, but still nothing. Hours spent on [customer support] chat, but in vain,” the customer said.
 One corporate service provider said his client had been attempting “incessantly” to retrieve his funds and had also been left without an IBAN number after being promised one “weeks ago”.
 Blasting Papaya and Blackcatcard for “tarnishing Malta’s reputation,” he said the shareholders of his client’s company were becoming concerned over the lack of clarity.
  Meanwhile, a look at the company’s support channel on Telegram – which one customer said had recently been closed to new comments – reveals a host of ongoing complaints about the issue stretching back to February.
 Responding to questions, Papaya said it had onboarded a SEPA provider in January to provide customers with SEPA Instant transfers, with the new provider’s “embedment into the Blackcatcard ecosystem up and running as planned”.
 SEPA Instant is a quicker way of making SEPA payments introduced across the bloc in March following the adoption of a European Council regulation in February.
 It said that while a “significant fraction” of its customers were able to “enjoy their SEPA services as usual”, the company was rolling out the feature “in batches” due to the number of customers needing to be reconnected to the system.
 “The exact timeline for the complete restoration of SEPA functionality for every single client is hard to pin down... But rest assured, we are tirelessly working to speed up the process and to ensure that every client is reconnected to SEPA as swiftly as possible,” it said.
 The company said it was “not aware of the clients’ personas you are mentioning in your inquiry”, stressing its clients had “unrestricted access to their funds all the time”.
 It added that Papaya “has not ever had any accusations against its operations, ownership, management, or employees” and that it maintained a “strong working relationship” with Maltese and European authorities.
 The company reiterated that the investigation reported in the media did “not impact the functionality of the organisation or its services in any way” and said it had “no intentions of withdrawing from the Blackcatcard ecosystem”.
 When contacted, Tompay told Times of Malta it did “not comment on our relationships with clients, partners, service provi­ders, and financial institutions”.

Residents urge PA to take enforcement action on PAMA access road,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/residents-urge-pa-take-enforcement-action-pama-access-road.1092087,05-08-2024,005489.png,"A group of residents have filed a judicial protest against the Planning Authority urging it to take enforcement action over the opening of a new access road from PAMA supermarket into their residential area. 
 The frustration of residents of the tad-Daqqaq area in Mosta came to light in March, when residents raised concerns that they were not consulted on the opening of the access road formed through Triq il-Waqqafa. 
 While authorities maintain that this was a temporary measure to allow access to the supermarket while roadworks are being carried out in Triq Pantar and that the temporary access will be closed off once works are concluded, residents insist that the formation of this access was carried out irregularly. 
 In the protest, residents say that the law requires an exhaustive analysis that goes beyond temporary requirements and must also take into account any increase in traffic in sensitive areas.
 The residents claimed that, according to an unsigned email they received from the PA’s enforcement directorate on March 8, the works in question fall under a class 3 development notification order, which suggested that such development was permissible and that the case was closed. 
 This reply, they said, was not only inadequate but intentionally mistakes the essence of the development in question.
 This is because it ignores the fact that a class 3 DNO limits works to the “formation, preparation, alteration or betterment of roads by the government, local council or any entities engaged by them” and excludes any temporary measures that change the environment and form new transition roads. Such works, they continued, would fall under a class 10 DNO and cannot be carried out without the necessary permits. 
 Residents said they were protesting the formation of the access road because it is “not authorised and illegal” and consequently affecting the safety and security they once previously enjoyed in their homes. 
 The lack of a planning permit forbids all temporary access and goes against the principles of exemplary conduct, they said. 
 In light of this, the residents are urging the PA to take the necessary enforcement action to stop this “unauthorised access” granted to traffic and ensure the return of a boundary wall in Triq il-Waqqafa to its original state, including by reinstalling traffic signals in Tad-Daqqaq and ta’ Milt.
 The judicial protest was signed by lawyer Conrad Borg Manche.

Italian Court fully acquits Palumbo Shipyards of waste dumping conviction,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/132269/italian_court_full_acquits_palumbo_shipyards_of_waste_dumping_conviction_,13-11-2024,005502.png,"After years of legal battles, Antonio Palumbo, owner of Palumbo Shipyards, has been fully acquitted by the Messina Court of Appeal, which ruled his actions in alleged illegal dumping did not constitute a crime.

 In 2021, Antonio Palumbo, owner of Palumbo Shipyards, had won an eight-year legal battle after the Messina Court of Appeal overturned his conviction for illegal waste dumping.

                     Initially sentenced to six years in 2019 for allegedly facilitating illegal dumping between 2011 and 2013, Palumbo maintained the case was politically motivated. 

 In a press statement, the Palumbo family, stated that the Court of Appeal of Messina, with a final ruling, has fully acquitted Palumbo Shipyards. 

 Antonio Palumbo had already been acquitted in 2021 and was cleared of all charges ‘for not having committed the crime’.  However, this acquittal completely overturns the 2019 conviction for the illegal dumping of waste, where it was ruled that he had facilitated illegal dumping between 2011 and 2013.

 The Italian Court thus established that ‘the act does not constitute a crime’.     ",Jordan Pace ,court_and_police

Man jailed four years over rape of four-year-old granddaughter,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/129589/man_jailed_four_years_over_rape_of_fouryearold_granddaughter,06-06-2024,005561.png,"A Marsaxlokk man has been jailed four years and inscribed in the sex offenders register after a court found him guilty of raping his four-year-old granddaughter.
 The man was found guilty of violent indecent assault, participation in sex acts with a minor and corrupting the girl, who had been entrusted into his care.
 The abuse took place over the span of several months in 2019 and had only surfaced much later during a family holiday in Sicily, when the girl revealed to her father what her paternal grandfather had done to her when she was between four and five years of age.
  The girl said that around 10 incidents had taken place, all at her grandfather’s house. The stomach-churning encounters, which are described in detail in the judgment are not suitable for publication.
 The defendant, who wasn’t named in the judgment, had denied abusing his granddaughter, but claimed that she had once walked in on him while he was having a shower and grabbed his private parts. He admitted to having touched the girl’s genitals, insisting that he had only done so “to see her laugh.”
 The child’s mother told the court that she had been so disgusted when she heard her daughter’s story that she had left the room in floods of tears and had called Appogg after calming down. With hindsight, she had realised that this explained why the defendant would buy the girl so many sweets and allow her sips of wine.
 As for the child, she would suffer from night terrors and had lost her interest in school overnight, and would often be found crying in the headmistress’ office.
 In her extensively researched judgment, Magistrate Claire Stafrace Zammit observed that the defendant’s explanation had evolved across his three statements to the police and his court testimony, leading the court to discard it in its entirety. When asked about the alleged shower incident, the child said that no such incident had occurred, which corroborated the court’s impression that it had been made up by the defendant.
 None of the defence’s witnesses had contradicted the girl’s account, noted the court. “Instead, we saw a gross attempt at discrediting the minor as a person, which resulted in contradictory testimony and further convinces the court that the child’s account is genuine.”
 Finding the man guilty of all charges, Magistrate Stafrace Zammit sentenced him to imprisonment for four years and placed him under a one-year treatment order. She also ordered that his name be inscribed in the sex offenders register.  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police

 Seychelles-born Roddy Swinton Williams, 44, was awaiting trial for the attempted murder of  Nathalie Williams, for raping her, detaining her, causing her to fear violence against her and her family, slightly injuring her son Owen Vella and threatening public officers. 
 However, the defence and prosecution teams this week agreed on a plea deal that would send the accused to jail for 14 years.
 The case dates to October 2017, when Nathalie received a text message while on her way to work. 
 ""Hi, it's Audrey. Call me on this number,"" the text message read.
 But when she called back, her estranged husband Roddy answered the phone, demanding to meet her and threatening to kill her father and children unless she did so. 
 Scared, she agreed to meet him. But when they met in Xgħajra, they argued and he pushed her into the sea. He subsequently helped her out but eventually shoved her into an underground chamber beneath Fort Ricasoli.
 She had told court she was ""trapped like a mouse"", cold and confused. During her time underground, he raped her several times. 
 Nathalie was meanwhile reported missing by her relatives and found in the cave three  days later after Roddy told the police where she was being held captive.
 Roddy had pleaded not guilty to the charges and was eventually granted bail.
 As he awaited trial, Roddy was arrested in a drugs raid on a garage in Qormi, where he was reportedly living in 2019, and was jailed for nine months. 
 This week, Roddy pleaded guilty to all six charges in the case of the attempted murder of Nathalie, with Madame Justice Consuelo Scerri Herrera handing him the jail sentence and imposing a three-year restraint order in favour of the woman and her son Owen.
 She also ordered Roddy to pay €12,753 in court expenses.

 The 48-year-old was involved in a collision with an ambulance outside Mater Dei Hospital on Saturday evening.
 He was pronounced dead on the spot.
 A 54-year-old Romanian woman - Grech's colleague - was also hit and remains grievously injured. 
 A magisterial inquiry has been opened into the incident and a police investigation is still ongoing. 
  The loss of Grech - father to a young child - has rocked the medical community where he was known to work tirelessly, as well as that of Cospicua residents, where many grieved the loss of an active member of the local community. 
 Posting several pictures of Grech including photos with their son, his wife Lorraine Aquilina thanked the public for the solidarity shown over the tragic loss of her husband. 
 “I cannot help but mention Joseph’s joyful, impulsive and loud character, but above all else, the love and enormous devotion he had towards Our Lady of Immaculate Conception and our lord Jesus Christ,” she said. 
 “What happened yesterday meant that in the blink of an eye, I had to give him up, but he’s left us to join them, and his father and mother, whom he loved dearly.” 
 “Rest in peace Joseph, and please help me continue raising our treasure Francesco from up there, together with my parents and with the blessing of God and the immaculate gaze of Our Lady. We love you,” Aquilina wrote. 
 She also wished a speedy recovery to Grech's colleague.
  ""Devotion"" is the word many used to describe Grech’s approach to life, both in his professional life working in the ITU with some of the hospital’s most vulnerable patients as well as in his community, where his dedication to the religious feast activities was remembered fondly by many, particularly when it comes to musical and pageantry aspects of feast celebrations. 
 Former MP and Commissioner for the Rights of Persons with Disability Oliver Scicluna recalled his experience of Grech’s work first-hand. 
 “I salute you, my friend, thank you for the gentleness you showed me. I will never forget our discussions,” he said.
 Cancer support NGO Puttinu Cares also expressed sorrow at Grech’s loss. 
 “It is always shocking to lose a life. But to lose a colleague while at the workplace is too hard. Our sincere condolences to his family, we are very sorry for their loss,” the group said in a statement.
  Maria Campbell, a former colleague of Grech’s, also recalled his passion for helping others through his profession. 
 “It's with a broken heart that I must remember our dear Joseph,” she said. 
 “Joseph, in the five years that I spent working at the most critical place in the hospital, you worked far harder than I did.
 ""We needed an irreplaceable person like you to help us do our hard work, not only physically, but also morally, and with your manners and character you never failed to make everyone love you.”
  One of Grech’s friends, Bernard Busuttil, said there must have been a “crisis in heaven” for the community to have lost him. 
 He said his long-time friend was synonymous with “singing, noise, laughter and the Immaculate Conception”. 
 “I don’t know what the urgency was to call you up, but there certainly must have been a crisis in heaven if the cost is what we down here are left feeling,” he said. 
  “You were used to crises - actually, you thrived in them - both through your work in the ITU and your very beautiful qualities. A heart of gold, a head of stone, a will of steel, wide and divine faith and a social consciousness that you truly no longer find,” Busuttil continued. 
 “You were a friend to all, you stood with the suffering, you were a source of solace and joy.”

  The sale had been declared fraudulent by the courts and struck down in 2023, Earlier this year, the conclusions of a magisterial inquiry that had been launched in 2019 following an application by Repubblika, had recommended that they be prosecuted. 
 All of the defendants are pleading not guilty to the charges.  
 Sciacca Grill, one of the companies, was discharged although this does not preclude the possibility of further investigations leading to criminal charges in the future.  
 According to prosecutor Francescao Refalo, Sciacca Grill – once owned by former chief of staff Keith Schembri – had received a number of contracts to supply another catering company that had been supplying the hospitals in the PPP. “We are saying that these companies were taking a percentage of the money coming from the concession. They were skimming money off the concession,” Refalo said. 
 His argument was rebutted by Sciacca’s defence lawyer Franco Debono. “God forbid we reduce prima facie to this methodology. I did not hear a single mention of a page number, or a piece of evidence. Is this the examination that must be carried out to establish prima facie?” 
 Veronique Dalli, defence lawyer for Taumac – the company which had sold its shares in MTrace to the Vitals concession via Vitals Procurement Ltd in Jersey – submitted to the magistrate that the prosecution’s suspicion in her client was insufficiently based on one witness only. “Between April and today, someone had investigated and decided there were sufficient grounds to press charges... The prosecution is saying that Taumac should have suspected that someone recommended by the Maltese state [was committing criminal offences].” 
 Dalli said the court was right in saying that at this stage it was only empowered to establish whether there is a case to answer. “But is it not possible or probable for Taumac to sell its shares at no profit, so as not to lose its investment... is there anything extraordinary or out of the ordinary that a company tries to recoup its investment, especially when the government is telling it to leave the deal to be replaced by another company recommended by the government?” 
 Lawyer Chris Cilia, for MTrace, added that the inquiry experts who assisted the magisterial inquiry “had arrived at a certain narrative”, accusing them of ‘creating’ the storyline. 
 “Completely gratuitous assertions which make no sense... and had they taken the initiative of hearing what Dr Josie Muscat had to say, they would have realised that this narrative is nothing but a fairytale,” the lawyer said with respect to accusations levied against MTrace on its acquisition of a cyclotron machine, through money loaned by VGH. 
 The company was sold off to government investment arm Malta Enterprise in 2020. 
 Cilia queried where the crime of money laundering against MTrace arose from. “The conclusion seems to be that from day one, VGH was the actual owner of MTrace and the cyclotron. This could have easily been dispelled had they sent for Josie Muscat. In four years, they had not and so this leads to some doubts taking root.” 
 Arthur Azzopardi took to task the way the inquiry experts had worded their suspicions on defendant Brian Bondin. “On Brian Bondin, there is no appendix in the inquiry. All that is mentioned in the conclusions, the experts only say it is in the realm of possibility... ‘potential fraud.’” 
 He derided the experts’ stated definition of legal terms, such as fraud, as being ‘Wikipedia’-type definitions. “The use of the word ‘potential’ with regards to MTrace, is always less than probable, which is required for prima facie... what the experts aren’t doing is that, apart from the concession agreement itself, there is a number of other specific agreements.” 
 He attacked the expert’s contention that the government funds paid to the private concession companies, were somehow the State’s. “When it was paid, it no longer remained public funds. The moment the money became theirs, it is theirs to decide how to use it.”  
 “I want to be clear. The problem is not the fault of the inquiring magistrate. The problem is how the experts worked it out and then reported to the magistrate.” 
 By way of example, Azzopardi said that the experts claimed MTrace’s expenditure was €1.2 million one year, the next €2.5 million, and then extrapolated a €600,000 sum for Brian Bondin. He said there was nothing else in the inquiry to buttress this argument. “If what the experts are saying is true, the question arises as to why the person involved in the raising of fraudulent invoices, was not charged.” 
 Another defence lawyer, Jason Grima, made submissions on behalf of Crossbow audit employee, Jonathan Vella, who is also accused of money laundering, fraud, and falsification of documents. “Who is this Jonathan Vella? He is a simple accounts clerk working for auditor Christopher Spiteri.” 
 Grima said Vella was merely a company secretary for the Vitals holding company Bluestone. “I don’t think that merits him being charged... Vella did not choose to be a company secretary. His job is to do secretarial work and had done this job for decades, even with a previous employer.” 
 Grima also said the inquiring magistrate had not explained on what grounds he was being accused. “Nobody sent for him. Not the police, not the magistrate and not the experts. So Jonathan Vella’s testimony was not heard by anyone. It appears that they charged him without speaking to him first.”

Alleged rental contracts fraudster claimed 'others have done worse than me',maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/132459/alleged_rental_contracts_fraudster_claimed_others_have_done_worse_than_me_court_told,25-11-2024,005627.png,"A court heard that a man accused of creating fake lease agreements was under the impression that his alleged fraud would only merit a fine, noting that others had done much worse than him.

 Mamo was arraigned earlier this month where he was accused of providing false lease agreements to TCNs, allowing them to obtain residence permits illegally.

                     On Monday, the compilation of evidence against Harold Mamo, 56, kicked off, insisting his income came solely from private tutoring and rental properties he owned.

 The investigation reportedly began after Jason Azzopardi highlighted a case of a woman who reported finding a mailbox containing documents addressed to TCNs at a property in Msida.

 Inspector Karl Roberts testified that the documents were related to residency permits. An inquiry at Identità revealed that four TCNs were registered at the Msida address and over 100 at another property owned by Mamo. 

 When questioned about the registrations, Mamo cited his lack of literacy and computer skills as an explanation. A third property in Siġġiewi, which would later be found to have a link to Mamo, was found to have multiple TCN registrations.

 Anthony Attard, whose parents owned the Siġġiewi property, admitted he had allowed Mamo to use their address, adding that he knew Mamo from a barber shop and had helped by installing mailboxes at various locations. Attard eventually faced charges and received a suspended sentence.

 One of the TCNs, a Pakistani national, said he contacted a rental agency on Facebook, which connected him with Mamo. The TCN admitted he sought only an address, not a residence. Others recounted similar experiences, identifying Mamo and describing promises of accommodations that were never delivered.

 The court heard that police seized €8,940 in cash, rental agreements, and notifications addressed to TCNs during a search of Mamo’s barber shop. Financial records showed that Mamo declared significant rental income between 2019 and 2023, with 540 agreements registered in 2023 alone.

 Mamo claimed he lived a modest life and relied on his accountant for tax matters. When interrogated by the FCID, he downplayed his actions, questioning whether they warranted more than a fine and asserting that others had committed worse offenses.

 The court will decide on bail at a future hearing, with the prosecution set to present witnesses, including the TCNs, at the next hearing.

 AG lawyers Andrea Zammit and Manuel Grech prosecuted together with inspectors Farrugia and Roberts.

'I worked as long as my body could take it': women testify on prostitution ring,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/i-worked-long-body-take-it-human-trafficking-victim-testifies.1096973,20-08-2024,"005629.png,005630.png","Updated 4.25pm 
 Two women have testified in a human trafficking case about how they worked as prostitutes in Malta after being flown into the country from South America. 
 The first witness, a Venezuelan woman, 24, said she worked as a prostitute for ""as long as my body could take it"" and was told she would get her 55% cut of the earnings when she left Malta to return home.
 And the second witness, a 20-year-old Colombian woman, described how she thought she was going to get work as a waitress until she arrived in the country and her 'taxi driver' explained her conditions.
 Testifying via video conference, the first woman said she knew what she was coming for when taking up her friend’s suggestion to travel to Malta, explaining that she wanted to earn enough money to buy a house and pay for her daughter’s surgery. 
 She was the first of two alleged victims to testify on Tuesday against eight men and a woman charged with involvement in a human trafficking ring that forced women into prostitution.
 The accused are Luke Farrugia, 36, a self-employed maintenance worker from Birkirkara, Clint Lawrence D'Amato, a cab driver from Gudja, Denzil Farrugia, 19, a food shop employee from Sliema, Alexandra Suhov Pocora, a 32-year-old Romanian from St Paul's Bay, Kane Vassallo, a 22-year old barber from Siġġiewi, Gordon Cassar, a 44-year-old maintenance worker from Kalkara, Luca Emanuele Corito, 21 from Senglea, Dylan McKay, a 30-year old taxi driver from Fgura and Nicolae Efimov, 37 from St Paul's Bay.
 They deny money laundering, setting up a criminal organization, enticing people over the age of 21, through violent or fraudulent means, to travel to Malta for prostitution purposes, holding the alleged victims against their will at a brothel, and living off the earnings of prostitution.
 The woman said she started offering her sexual services the very next day after arriving in Malta, working on a daily basis.
 She was free to go out if she wished but she said that she never did, opting instead to work.
 After setting off flight ticket expenses which totaled close to €4,000, the woman said that she earned another €5,000 to €6,500 over a fortnight, until police zoomed in on the racket and entered the apartment where she and other women worked.
 Her female friend at the shopping mall where they both worked back home, first spoke to the witness about Malta and the work opportunities available.
 Her friend loved to travel to different places. 
 She told the witness that she could earn “good money in Malta” and that there would be “no problems.” 
 The two women traveled to Malta together, taking a flight from Madrid and landing at the Malta International Airport on June 24. All travel expenses were covered. 
 She had received her flight tickets for the round trip via email directly from an airline company. 
 “The boss is coming. He’ll give you all the information,” announced her friend the morning after their arrival.
 The ‘boss’ was a tall, fat and bald guy whom the witness referred to as “Miguel.” Later in Tuesday’s hearing, the woman identified Clint Lawrence D’Amato as the man who had set out her work conditions. 
  Work hours were flexible and cash payments from clients were to be shared. She was to take 55% of the takings after setting off the cost of her flight.
 She did not fix appointments with clients. Those were scheduled by 'Miguel' who would text her to “open the door” when a client stood outside. 'Miguel' spoke some Spanish but they used Google translate to help them along. 
 He also established her work rates. €50 for 30 minutes and €100 for one hour. 
 “Miguel told me to be a good worker….to be focused on work….to earn money. To have enough money to go back home.” 
 When she felt tired, she would let him know and he would tell her to rest and continue when she felt up to it. 
 She was not expected to work around the clock. 
 “I worked for as long as my body could take it,"" she said.
 Clients paid her in cash. Miguel would tell her to draw up her bills and leave all the money on a table inside the apartment. 
 She was to get her share once she decided to leave Malta. 
 “How will I get my money now that they’ve been arrested,” she questioned. 
 She set aside €25 a day to cover her accommodation and bought clothes, ice creams and other daily needs out of tips she got from clients. 
 The most she ever earned in one day was around €1,500 to €1,700. After cancelling the €3,850 debt she owed for the flight ticket, she reckoned that she had earned €5,000 to €6,500 over a fortnight. 
 She could have left once her ten-day tourist stay was over but she chose to stay. 
 “I wanted to earn more,” said the witness, explaining that she wished to buy a house and pay for her daughter’s surgery. 
 During her stay, she had forwarded €600 to her family in Colombia. Miguel had also handed her €780 for a new iPhone she wished to buy.
 She came “to work and have a better future,"" she said.
 A 20-year-old Colombian woman, who lived at the same apartment as the first witness, also testified on Tuesday. Neither women mentioned the location of the apartments but in a previous hearing, the inspector spoke of apartments in the area of Msida and Gżira.
 She heard about Malta through a male friend back in her homeland who put her in touch with his female friend who “had contacts” and could make all necessary arrangements for her to travel to the island. 
 Her friend told her to Google “Sliema Malta.” 
 “I did and I immediately liked it. I wanted to come,"" she said.
 She received a prepaid flight ticket via email and landed in Malta on August 8. Her contact had told her that she would be met by a man who would be her taxi driver, taking her around the island. 
 She meant to stay for a temporary visit, possibly working as a waitress at some café or discotheque. 
 But when she was chauffeured to the apartment, she immediately realized that she was in for some other kind of work. 
 There were condoms and other sex-related items in three of the bedrooms at the duplex apartment. A fourth bedroom was to be shared by the four women who offered their services at the flat. 
 “In Colombia it’s illegal to work as prostitute. I didn’t know that it wasn’t in Malta,” said the witness, explaining that back in her homeland she worked as a beautician.
 She had “some clients” to whom she gave sexual services as an aside.
 She wished to join her sister in Bilbao but lacked the means to cover flight expenses. But when she looked up Malta on the map, she realized that it was not too far from Bilbao.
 So she decided to come to Malta and do enough work to cover travel expenses to Bilbao. 
 “Back in Columbia, I earned very little. The work I did in Malta earned much more. I earned enough for the whole family. I did what I did for my mother who lost her job when I was 15.” 
 Her “taxi driver” who explained her work conditions and drove her to appointments outside the flat, was “Elmo.” 
 She later explained that “Elmo” was the same person whom her flatmates called “Miguel.” She too identified the “fat, bald and bearded man” as D’Amato. 
 He had told her to charge €50 for a 30-minute job, involving one penetration and €70 for an hour involving two penetrations. 
 Additional charges for extras, such as kisses, fondling or oral sex as requested by the client, were taken by her. 
 She had only been in Malta for four days when police raided the apartment. 
 During that time, she twice worked as an escort at a private residence and at “a very beautiful hotel.” 
 “Elmo took good care of us…He waited for us when he drove us to some other place,” said the witness. 
 When she first arrived at the flat, he had asked for pictures of herself “in bikinis or underwear” and also “pretty pictures of her face.” 
 She agreed to do so.
 “As a waitress, you suffer. It’s easier and more comfortable to work from home,"" she told the court.
 The case continues next week. 
 Magistrate Donatella Frendo Dimech is presiding. AG lawyers Ramon Bonett Sladden and Charmaine Abdilla prosecuted, together with Inspectors John Spiteri, Joseph Xerri and Dorianne Tabone. Lawyers Franco Debono, Marion Camilleri, Roberto Montalto, Joe Giglio, Michaela Giglio, Charles Mercieca, Kathleen Calleja Grima, Nicholas Mifsud and Etienne Borg Ferranti are defence counsel.

Keith Schembri cedes breach of rights case over ‘missing’ phone,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/keith-schembri-cedes-breach-rights-case-missing-phone.1100472,11-02-2024,005639.png,"Keith Schembri has ceded a court case in which he claimed that his fundamental rights were breached when the courts misplaced his mobile phone for weeks.
 That phone – a different one to that which he lost hours before he was first arrested in late 2019 in an unrelated court case – was being held in evidence by the courts in money laundering proceedings against him.
 Schembri, who served as chief of staff to former Prime Minister Joseph Muscat, had filed the constitutional case almost a year ago to date, claiming that the manner in which the phone was ‘lost’ and then discovered among the exhibits of a separate case was “far more serious than simply bad administration.”
 Schembri, his father and two business associates stand accused of money laundering. They are pleading not guilty.
 The saga concerning the device began when a prosecutor from the Attorney General’s office informed the court that Schembri's phone was not in the case file.
 That information led to a search, ordered by then presiding Magistrate Donatella Frendo Dimech who, within minutes, was informed that the phone had been found.
 It had somehow ended up among the records of another criminal case that was closely related to Schembri’s case.
 Following that episode, Magistrate Frendo Dimech addressed court during a brief hearing to set the record straight, stating that the devices seized during the financial crimes investigation had been exhibited in evidence.
 Three days later her deputy registrar handed them to the courts’ exhibits officer for safekeeping and that was where they remained, said Magistrate Frendo Dimech, stressing that all exhibits related to Schembri “remained in the possession and exclusive uninterrupted custody” of that officer.
 However, after that phone incident, Schembri’s lawyers filed a constitutional complaint, voicing suspicion and concern as to what might have happened “behind the scenes” and casting doubt upon the chain of custody of that piece of evidence.
 The lawyers challenged the admissibility of the phone in evidence and sought moral damages and other measures for Schembri’s alleged breach of rights.
 The judge leading that case, Mr Justice Mark Simiana, conducted an on-site visit to the courts' exhibits room last February. 
 Schembri's lawyers, prosecutors and the registrar of the criminal courts were all present for that visit, during which court expert Martin Bajada checked the exhibits, photographing and minuting the whole process.
 The case was scheduled to resume on Friday but prior to the hearing Schembri’s lawyers filed a note, formally informing the court, presided over by Mr Justice Mark Simiana, that the applicant was ceding the case.
 The case had been filed against the Attorney General, the Police Commissioner and the Registrar of the Criminal Courts and Tribunals.

"Woman jailed for breaching bail conditions, resisting arrest",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/woman-jailed-breaching-bail-conditions-resisting-arrest.1097977,09-12-2024,005650.png,"A woman who kicked up a commotion when police turned up to arrest her for skipping bail, was jailed upon conviction and warned that “no good comes out of drugs.”
 The incident occurred on Monday evening at Josianne Grech’s Birkirkara home when police officers were dispatched to take her into custody after she allegedly failed to abide by bail conditions.
 The prosecution said that the woman went out during curfew hours to source drugs.
 The 39-year-old, who had long struggled with an acute drug addiction, reacted aggressively when police went to her home at around 7.20pm, refusing to accompany them. She also tried to escape from the police car.
 She was subsequently taken to hospital where she kept up her aggressive behaviour, spitting at people and keeping up her disruptive attitude, explained prosecuting Inspector Roxanne Tabone.
 Two days down the line, “a totally different person,” appeared in court, standing silently beside the escorting policewoman and speaking calmly when addressed.
 The prosecutor explained that the defendant’s behaviour changed completely once she got treatment for her addiction.
 The woman’s lawyer, Leslie Cuschieri, confirmed that change.
 “Two days ago she was like a bolted horse. Today we can speak and communicate,” said the lawyer.
 The woman was charged with breaching bail conditions, violently resisting arrest, refusing to obey legitimate police orders, wilfully breaching the public peace, insulting and threatening the officers as well as attempting to escape from custody.
 She was also charged with relapsing.
 She registered an admission after explaining to the presiding magistrate that she was meant to attend an appointment to address her addiction next week.
 She said that she had previously spent seven months at the Drug Dependence Unit while on a waiting list to enter rehabilitation.
 The prosecutor pointed out that Grech was dismissed from the Drug Dependence Unit because she “behaved so badly” towards staff members.
 She twice started a rehabilitation programme but did not see it through.
 After hearing submissions the court, presided by Magistrate Lara Lanfranco, declared the defendant guilty and condemned her to a one-year effective jail term plus a €4,000 fine.
 The court also ordered revocation of the defendant’s bail and confiscation of one-third of the €3,000 personal guarantee linked to that bail.
 Finally, the court recommended that the prisons director offer her all help necessary to “seriously address her drug problem which appears to have taken over her life.”
 “There are many people out there willing to help, but the motivation must come from you,” urged the magistrate.
 “No good comes out of drugs,” was the court’s final word of advice.

Man charged with threatening Karl Stagno Navarra released on bail,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/131050/man_charged_with_threatening_karl_stagno_navarra_released_on_bail_,05-09-2024,005651.png,"A man accused of insulting and threatening ONE TV host Karl Stagno Navarra over an unpaid debt was released on bail Thursday, after the alleged victim testified.
 From the witness stand, Stagno Navarra told Magistrate Giannella Camilleri Busuttil that the defendant, Jean Pierre Schembri, had gone to his house carrying a crash helmet, leading the witness to fear “he was going to break down my door.”
  Schembri had gone to demand money which was owed to him for a car he had sold to Stagno Navarra.
 He had contacted the police after the man had left, he said, which had resulted in a second visit by Schembri, incensed by this fact.
 The victim said that his face had been cut by pieces of glass from a vase which the man had smashed during that visit. “He slammed the glass vase on a table and bits of glass hit me in the face…”
 Schembri had put his hand on Stagno Navarra’s throat, which the witness described as an attempt to “strangle or kill me.”
 “I had received specialised training to deal with dangerous situations when I was employed by a news agency,” Stagno Navarra said. “I saw great fury in his eyes when he found out that I had gone to the police.”
 The man had eventually calmed down and had fled when the TV presenter told him that he was going to call the Rapid Intervention Unit.
 From the witness stand, the TV presenter said that he had received threatening voice and text messages from the defendant’s number
 The witness was asked to exhibit receipts for the payments he had made, handing over 19.
 He also exhibited a ledger he kept of further payments, which the defendant would sign.
 At some point he stopped recognising his own signature “and that’s when the trouble began.”
 Asked about the car purchased from the defendant, a Nissan Qashqai, Stagno Navarra said: “He came to my workplace and told me he was going to take the car back, and I said take it back because it’s cursed.” But despite taking it back, the man had continued to demand payment, he said.
 “The blackmail was intended to cause maximum damage. I am a public person…”
 Stagno Navarra exhibited screenshots of text conversations and recordings of voice notes he had received from the accused, warning the court that they contained “a lot of blasphemy,” adding that he would have to bring the rest in the next sitting, because there were so many.
 The court ordered that the WhatsApp voice notes be played in court. The messages were indeed peppered with colourful and creative phrases, and variations on the central theme of the man telling Stagno Navarra to expect to find him “outside your house tomorrow at 7:30am.”
 A ripple of stifled laughter went around the courtroom when the defendant was heard, on the last recording to be played in court, to sign off with the phrase “u happy birthday ja pufta.”
 The menace in the man’s voice was audible, but the messages, foul mouthed as they were, did not seem to contain explicit threats, their focus being demands that Stagno Navarra bring him the money without further delay.
 Insisting that he had paid the defendant over €10,000 for the car, “I have nothing against him,” Stagno Navarra told the court. “When I would ask him for receipts and he didn’t bring them, he would lose his temper.”
 “He conveniently doesn't mention that when I bought this car, it was part exchange with another car that I had previously bought from him. A Mini Minor.”
 “Not only did he never give me a receipt, but the car had defective day running lights,” said the victim. “I was forced to drive with brights because the bulb was missing.”
 Stagno Navarra alleged that records of the payments that he would keep in his car went missing, providing the defendant with “the perfect alibi.”
 “I don’t make reports lightly. The choice I had was to either do so or to commit suicide. Had I not done so, he would have murdered me,” Stagno Navarra said.
 After the alleged victim finished testifying for today, lawyer Lennox Vella, who is assisting Schembri, requested bail.
 Lawyer Franco Debono, appearing for Stagno Navarra, told the court that his client “only asks that he be allowed to live in peace and that these incidents do not repeat themselves.”
 “He is not objecting to bail, only that he understands that if he has any claims to make, there are legal ways to go about making them,” Debono said.
 Upholding the request, the court released the man on bail, which was secured by a €500 deposit and a personal guarantee of €2,500, ordering him not to approach, directly or indirectly, or in any way follow the movements of the prosecution witnesses, specifying that Stagno Navarra was one of them. He was also ordered to sign a bail book every day and stay out of Siggiewi.
 The court warned Schembri that besides the confiscation of his bail security any bail breaches he might commit would also carry additional punishments.  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police
Social workers concerned about bail of man accused of attempted double murder,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/social-workers-concerned-bail-man-accused-attempted-double-murder.1100284,30-10-2024,005658.png,"Social workers on Wednesday said they were ""deeply concerned"" by the court's decision to grant bail to a 43-year-old man accused of trying to stab his ex-partner's young daughters to death.
 Nazzareno Dalli, known as Ronald, has denied trying to kill the 12 and 15-year-old girls in a house in Triq San Tumas in Marsa on March 9.
 But the youngest girl ""miraculously survived"" after being stabbed 16 times and losing 40% of her blood in the attack. Her older sister escaped with slight injuries after managing to slip past the attacker and hide on the roof. 
 Two hours earlier, Dalli had posted photographs on Facebook, with one captioned “vendetta"".
 On Tuesday he was granted bail. It is understood that the Attorney General will be appealing this decision to request the accused’s re-arrest. 
 On Wednesday, the Maltese Association of Social Workers (MASW) said Dalli's release highlighted a ""significant shortfall"" in the protection of vulnerable people in Maltese society.
 ""We believe the safety of the community, particularly of children, must be the primary consideration for the courts when making bail decisions,"" it said in a statement.
 ""Such decisions can not only put child victims of violence at risk of further physical harm but also cause additional psychological trauma. Especially when incidents involve members close to their family.
 ""Allowing a man accused of such crimes out on bail while awaiting trial suggests the safety and well-being of survivors and children is not a priority.""
 MASW called upon judicial and legal entities to consider the broader implications of such decisions, especially as they relate to children and other survivors of violence.
 They urged the authorities to ensure victims and their families received the support and protection they needed and to implement safeguards that prioritised the physical and psychological well-being of vulnerable people.

Man remanded in custody after slashing ex-partner's hand with knife,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/man-remanded-custody-slashing-expartner-hand-knife.1092185,05-09-2024,005660.png,"A man who allegedly attacked his ex-partner with a knife, grievously injuring her hand, was remanded in custody upon arraignment on Thursday.
 The violent incident took place on April 9 in Triq is-Santwarju, Żabbar, when a 51-year-old Kirkop resident allegedly slashed the woman’s hand with a knife when she refused to get into his vehicle. 
 He was subsequently arrested and has since been treated at Mount Carmel Hospital.
 The names of the alleged attacker and the woman have been banned from publication by the court,
 Police were alerted to the suspected crime when the injured woman turned up at the Floriana health centre and said she had been attacked by her ex with a knife. 
 She later told police the couple had been in a nine-year relationship which ended in January. 
 That evening she claimed to have met her ex to collect some money he allegedly owed her. 
 But when he insisted that she was to get into his vehicle and she refused, he got out and threatened her with a knife. He allegedly hit her on the hand with the knife, causing her grievous injuries. 
 The suspect was tracked down and arrested, tearful and telling the arresting officers that he was sorry for what he had done. 
 He was arraigned on Thursday after being medically certified fit for trial. 
 The man pleaded not guilty to grievously injuring his ex, causing her fear of violence, having a knife without a police permit, insulting and threatening her as well as wilfully breaching the peace. 
 He pleaded not guilty. 
 A request for bail was objected to by the prosecution in view of the fact that the alleged victim was still to testify and there was thus a risk of tampering with evidence. 
 After hearing submissions, the court, presided over by Magistrate Jean Paul Grech, turned down the request and issued a protection order in favour of the alleged victim.

Schembri and Mizzi claim disclosure failures ahead of Vitals charges,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/129309/schembri_and_mizzi_claim_disclosure_failures_ahead_vitals_charges,21-05-2024,005666.png,"Keith Schembri and Konrad Mizzi are claiming to have been refused access to “important documents” from the magisterial inquiry into the Vitals Global Healthcare deal ahead of their arraignment next week.
 The claims emerge from judicial protests filed earlier today, in which former Chief of Staff at the Office of the Prime Minister and the former Health Minister both allege that the Attorney General and the Commissioner of Police were refusing to hand over the unspecified documents from the Vitals inquiry, which they claim, breached their rights to disclosure of the evidence against them and to a fair trial.
 Of the individuals to be charged next Tuesday, Schembri, Mizzi and former Prime Minister Joseph Muscat are facing the most serious charges, amongst them money laundering, bribery and trading in influence, as well as creating or associating with a criminal organisation.  
  The charges follow the conclusion of a magisterial inquiry set in motion by NGO Repubblika in 2019.
 Both Mizzi and Schembri are arguing that they had not been spoken to before being charged, despite the nature of the charges requiring that an explanation be provided by the suspect before charges are pressed.
 They also argued that they had not received “effective disclosure” of the prosecution’s evidence against them. Although the law does not grant this right in cases where the suspect is not being charged under arrest, just over a week ago, a  judge decided that Joseph Muscat should receive disclosure of the parts of the inquiry in which he is mentioned.
 The prosecution had provided Mizzi and Schembri with copies of the inquiry report, in line with a court order to that effect, but not the appendices which the report makes reference to.
 In her reply the Attorney General argued that the magistrate had been clear in saying that all the prosecution was to make available to the defendants was the proces verbal and any other material evidence in the police’s possession, which may have emerged from parallel investigations.
 All the remaining documentation would be exhibited in court as part of the magisterial inquiry, said the AG.
 The defence lawyers are insisting that the Criminal Code states that all relevant evidence should have been disclosed to their clients as soon as they became suspects. 
 The right to full disclosure was also protected by the European Convention on Human Rights as part of the right to a fair trial, Mizzi and Schembri are arguing.
 Calling upon the AG and the Police Commissioner to immediately grant them “full disclosure” without further delay, the suspects warned that they would be holding them responsible for resulting damages, and declared their intention to file constitutional proceedings should the situation not be remedied with the required haste.
 Schembri and Mizzi have also filed replies to Repubblika’s request that it be admitted as an injured party in the criminal cases against them, arguing that this was a legal manouevre by the NGO in order to be involved in proceedings in which it had no legal juridical interest.
 The replies state that Repubblika’s allegations had no foundation in fact or law and go on to describe them as “more akin to Aesop’s fables” than a judicial protest.

Iklin pawnbroker admits handling stolen Grand Master's Palace artefacts,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/iklin-pawnbroker-admits-handling-stolen-grand-master-palace-artefacts.1091859,05-03-2024,005706.png,"Updated 10.30am
 A pensioner running a pawnbroker's shop was on Friday charged with possession of antique vases and a clock stolen from Valletta's Grand Master's Palace.
 Anthony, also known as Tony Stivala, 67, from Iklin, admitted to handling stolen property, knowing that the items were cultural property belonging to the government of Malta.
 Police traced the items to his home on Thursday. They were found wrapped in towels and in ""perfect condition"", court was told.
 Stivala said that he was not aware they were stolen. 
 On Friday he pleaded guilty, confirming his plea after being given ample time to reconsider. He was declared guilty and handed a two-year jail term suspended for four years. 
 His defence lawyer declared that there would be no appeal. 
 Stivala is the second person to be charged over the theft and is expected to testify against an architect involved in the restoration of the palace and who is believed to have  stolen the artefacts. 
 Last month, Ljubica Zivkovic, 52, from Serbia, denied charges of aggravated theft, unlawful possession of the cultural artefacts acquired illegally and breaching probation for similar offences.
 The architect, who also lives in Iklin, was a project manager who worked for a restoration company involved in works at the palace, according to sources.
 She joined in the last six months of the project, handling last-minute civil works. 
 Prosecuting Inspector Christina Delia informed the court that of the four items allegedly stolen from the palace only three had been retrieved.
 The fourth item - a 20th-century vase worth some €300 - was still missing. 
 When making submissions on punishment, his lawyer Roberto Spiteri, explained that the crime was only committed when Stivala heard about the theft in the media and failed to step forward. 
 Perhaps because he never had a brush with the law, Stivala erred on the side of caution, choosing not to disclose the items to police “so as not to inflate the matter”. 
 But he had now learnt his lesson. 
 Court was told that Stivala’s children had prepared some forms to be filled in by customers taking items to the pawn shop, declaring that they were not stolen property. 
 Unfortunately, their father had been “negligent” in using those forms, remarked the lawyer. 
 It was not the first time people took antiques to his shop for a valuation or as pawns. The alleged author of the theft - Zivkovic - had been to his shop several times. 
 The prosecutor said that the total value of the stolen items was €13,000 less some €350 of the still missing vase. 
 But AG lawyer Nicholas Degaetano argued that since that value was calculated by Heritage Malta and not court experts, the value was “doubtful”. 
 Prosecuting Inspector Delia pointed out that the value was forwarded in Heritage Malta’s report. 
 After hearing submissions on punishment, the court, presided over by Magistrate Leonard Caruana, declared the accused guilty.
 Upon delivery of judgment, the court warned the accused to be careful because “it’s obvious that you’re not understanding what you are facing”.
 “I'll just close shop and stay at home in peace,” the soft-spoken man said, nodding in understanding. 
 AG lawyer Nicholas Degaetano, together with Inspectors Christina Delia, Jeffrey Rizzo and Debra Camilleri for the Superintendent of Cultural Heritage prosecuted.

 According to the police, the drugs were found in about 50 packets hidden among rolls of cables in a container that arrived in Malta from the Port of Guayaquil in Ecuador.

                     The drugs have an estimated street value of around €14 million.

 Police investigations are underway. Magistrate Philip Galea Farrugia opened an inquiry into the incident.

 Earlier this month, the police seized 146kg of cocaine from a container at the Freeport. In both cases, the containers originated from the Port of Guayaqil.

 Three people have been charged with drug trafficking in connection to the first find.

 However, the three men are on the lower rungs of a multi-laywered criminal organisation.

 Tile layer Ahmad Aldzhafar Sauah, 23 from Syria, residing at Hamrun was arraigned under arrest, charged with driving without neither insurance nor a licence, as well as with driving a car without its owner’s permission.
  Inspector Kurt Farrugia told magistrate Giannella Caruana Busuttil that the man had been arrested yesterday after his vehicle was stopped at a roadblock in Marsaskala manned by Transport Malta officials and police officers.
 The defendant, who was driving, was found to have an expired driving licence and no insurance policy. Further investigations revealed the man to be residing in Malta illegally, without a residence permit, and having no return ticket.
 The defendant, who holds a Bulgarian passport, pleaded guilty to the charges, confirming his admission after being given time to reconsider.
 Inspector Farrugia suggested a six-month prison sentence, suspended for a year, asking that the court also disqualify the man from driving and impose a fine.
 Lawyer Ingrid Zammit Young, assisting the defendant as legal aid counsel, explained that the defendant had obtained an international driving licence, valid for 12 months, and had been unaware that it had expired.
 The defence agreed with the suspended sentence but objected to the driving disqualification, arguing that it was unnecessary as his driver’s licence was already invalid.
 The court, declaring the man to be guilty on his own admission, sentenced him to imprisonment for six months, which it suspended for one year. He was also disqualified from holding a driver’s licence for 13 months.
 The man gave notice of appeal, but waived his right to suspend the execution of his sentence in the meantime.
 Inspector Farrugia was granted permission by the court to withdraw the man’s passport from the acts of the case in order to avoid delaying deportation proceedings.  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police

 No serious injuries were reported in either case.
 The police told Times of Malta the first crash happened on Wednesday at 4pm on Labour Road corner with Triq Prinċep Albertu.
 The crash involved a Honda FR-V driven by a 54-year-old man from Valletta and a DAF CF driven by a 28-year-old man from St Paul's Bay.
 The Valletta man was taken to Mater Dei Hospital, where he was certified to have suffered slight injuries.

 The driver of the van was taken to Mater Dei and the road was temporarily closed.
 An electricity pole was damaged in the crash, so Enemalta personnel and Civil Protection Department officials went on-site to clear the road of any danger. 
 It was reopened to traffic at 12.30am on Friday when it was confirmed the injured man was not at risk of dying.

Cardona says that he read non-binding MOU before signing,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/cardona-says-read-nonbinding-mou-signing.1097097,22-08-2024,005762.png,"Chris Cardona said he was not involved in the Vitals hospitals discussions leading up to the 2014 memorandum of understanding, insisting that he did read the document before signing, contrary to what he claims was misreported on Wednesday.
 The former economy minister returned to the witness stand on Thursday, summoned by the prosecution in the second Vitals case against Chris Fearne, Edward Scicluna and other top public officials.
 But before answering the prosecution’s questions, the witness said he wished to inform the court about something and he wanted to do so “because today they’ll say that I changed my version.”
 Cardona referred to media coverage of his testimony at parallel proceedings against Joseph Muscat, Keith Schembri and Konrad Mizzi on Wednesday.
 “Reporting of my testimony, particularly by Times of Malta and  Malta Today, went totally against what I testified,” he said.
 “I’m informing the court because today they’ll say that I changed my version. These are malicious people…"" the former minister went on, in an animated manner.
 
 But he was cut short by the magistrate who told him that he could take appropriate action.
 “However I can assure you that this court and any other court will rely on what you say not what is reported on any news portal,” said Magistrate Leonard Caruana, promptly dealing with the issue.
 With that preliminary issue out of the way, the hearing proceeded with questions by the prosecution.
 Shown the memorandum, he said it was the same document he was shown on Wednesday in court and the one he signed as economy minister responsible for Malta Enterprise whose client was Barts Medical School.
 Discussions with potential investors, as with all memoranda, were handled by Malta Enterprise and he was not involved.
 “I presented to the court a list of memoranda signed by me in my few years as minister. It was quite a substantial list. This one [ concerning the hospitals] was not sui generis. It was run of the mill.”
 Asked directly by AG lawyer Rebekah Spiteri, Cardona said that he read the MOU before signing, “contrary to what was reported. God forbid if I didn’t.”
 It was a non-binding document, focused on Gozo and pegged on two conditions.
 The investors were to present a business plan and there was a set of deliverables related to the Barts Medical School.
 “We realised in time that what was proposed did not fit within the government’s plan for health.”
 The signing of the MOU took place at Castille.
 He and Mario Galea, from Malta Enterprise were present together with the signatories.
 Asked whether he was involved any further, Cardona replied, “Nothing.”
 And was he given any instructions to sign the MOU, asked the prosecutor.
 “The staff at the ministry informed me that we needed to sign,” he said.
 He had no background information about the investors, saying that the first time he met them was at the signing of the memorandum.
 “So after reading it, why did you sign?” the prosecution pressed on.
 It was government practice to reach out to investors showing an interest in investing in Malta.
 Such potential investors would normally ask for “something in writing.”
 But after signing such an MOU, the authorities would carry out studies on the investors.
 Verifications and background checks were “not by me,” added Cardona.
 “The minister is not there to conduct due diligence. Malta Enterprise always conducts due diligence.”
 He insisted that he had nothing to do with the business plans.
 Questioned by defence lawyer Stefano Filletti, Cardona said he met no irregularity when signing the MOU and was comfortable signing without reservation.
 “Because it was non-binding, so much so that we did not proceed. It… died.”
 “What comfort does the government have if the document is non-binding?” asked the prosecution.
 “There is some sort of understanding… government entices appetite for investment, while the investor knows that the government is interested,” explained Cardona.
 Such an MOU could be presented by the investor to source some banking facility or to acquire “accelerated audit accounts,” said the witness, stressing that whatever the reason, “it was still non-binding.”

"Yorgen Fenech renews bail request, citing legal time limits",maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/132650/yorgen_fenech_renews_bail_request_citing_legal_time_limits_,06-12-2024,005775.png,"Former businessman Yorgen Fenech has requested bail, claiming that his 30-month maximum period of preventative custody since his indictment has expired.

 Prosecutors, however, maintain that time suspensions are justified due to delays in evidence compilation.

 Yorgen Fenech is seeking bail after more than 30 months since his indictment, arguing that Maltese law entitles him to release. He is accused of masterminding the assassination of Daphne Caruana Galizia but pleads not guilty. 

                     Fenech has renewed his bid for bail, contending that the mandatory 30-month period since his indictment has expired. Fenech, who faces allegations of complicity in the 2017 assassination of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, has been in custody since his arrest in late 2019 and continues to plead not guilty. 

 Fenech appeared in court on Friday for a pre-trial hearing, where his defence team argued that he is entitled to bail under Maltese law. Article 575 of the Criminal Code mandates that bail shall be granted if more than 30 months elapse between the filing of the bill of indictment and trial in cases involving crimes punishable by imprisonment exceeding 15 years. 

 Defence lawyer Charles Mercieca argued that “the total time between the bill of indictment to date was 39 months 18 days.” Factoring in periods during which the case acts were suspended, Mercieca maintained that “today we are precisely at 30 months three days.” 

 The Attorney General’s office opposed the request, arguing that the 30-month period should exclude the time spent compiling additional evidence in the reopened magisterial inquiry. AG lawyer Godwin Cini asserted that the defence itself had requested further evidence at various stages, suspending the timeline. 

 “The legislator provided for the suspension of that time limit whenever the accused asked for more witnesses to be heard, so as to curb abuse,” said Cini. Allowing otherwise, he argued, would enable defendants to intentionally prolong proceedings beyond the time limit. 

 Cini further pointed to “prima facie evidence” that Fenech had been planning to flee Malta at the time of his arrest, citing his financial resources, overseas connections, and the risk of tampering with evidence. He also highlighted concerns over potential public disorder. 

 The defence dismissed the prosecution’s claim, insisting that no applications for additional witnesses had been filed. Instead, Mercieca argued, they had submitted notes to flag evidence overlooked by the prosecution, which did not constitute a request for additional evidence. He reiterated, “Bail is mandatory upon the lapse of 30 months.” 

 Mercieca further stated, “It will never cross Yorgen Fenech’s mind to abscond… his intention is to fight this trial to prove his innocence and he will. We do not want what is not ours, but give us what is ours by right.” 

 Presiding over the hearing, Judge Edwina Grima is expected to deliver a decision on the bail through a decree. Meanwhile, the judge ordered the police commissioner to investigate claims raised by the defence regarding podcasts allegedly aired in breach of a court ban. The commissioner is to report his findings at the next sitting in January.

 Azzopardi allegedly filmed Prime Minister Robert Abela and Justice Minister Jonathan Attard while speaking with aides inside the law courts last Monday.

                             The filming incident happened just after the Appeals Court ruled that the State Advocate is empowered to sue Steward Health Care to recoup money paid by the State as part of the hospitals concession. The case had been filed by the Nationalist Party.

 The footage had been uploaded to the Facebook page of Net News with a caption claiming the footage was shot one hour after the court ruling. NET News had described the scene as an attempt by Abela and Attard to “formulate a partisan strategy after their court defeat”.

                             It is illegal to film or take photos inside the law courts unless permission is granted by the Chief Justice and the director general of the law courts. According to the Code of Organisation and Civil Procedure, anyone caught filming or taking photos inside the law courts can be arrested for up to 24 hours, expelled from the court, reprimanded or fined up to €1,164.

                     The court proceedings kicked off on Monday with testimony from four witnesses, including Jonathan Attard.

 Eunice Grech Fiorini, the CEO of the Court Services Agency, told the court that, after seeing a video on social media that looked like it was shot inside the courthouse, she checked CCTV footage and saw that Jason Azzopardi had been passing by the moment the footage was taken.

 Played in court, the CCTV footage showed Jason Azzopardi walking past the Prime Minister and Justice Minister with his mobile held to his ear, as if he was taking a phone call.

 Attard's testimony was brief. The court played the footage that had been uploaded to social media and asked Attard to identify the people filmed. He confirmed that he and the Prime Minister were visible in the footage, as were other aides. 

 The Chief Security Officer at the Court Services Agency testified after him. He presented a pen drive with the CCTV footage to the court and explained that the footage has no sound because the security cameras have no microphones installed. 

 The Chief Marshall of the Courts also testified. He was sat down in the courthouse when the footage was taken. Defence lawyer Arthur Azzopardi asked whether he noticed Jason Azzopardi taking any videos, and he said he noticed him walking up and down the halls.

Court dismisses AG appeal against order to charge Alessandro Lia,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/judge-orders-charges-lawyer-alessandro-lia-alleged-car-transfer-fraud.1101740,29-11-2024,005784.png,"A judge has confirmed a decision directing the police commissioner to press charges against lawyer Alessandro Lia over suspected complicity in a car transfer fraud.
 The court clarified that this decision did not imply “some form of guilt” by Lia, but a criminal process was the only way to exclude the lawyer’s suspected involvement in the fraud since the police had not carried out the necessary tests in the course of their investigations. 
 The case revolved around the transfer of a vehicle which Lia’s father-in-law, Victor Sant, had decided to part with. 
 After airing his thoughts in the presence of close family members, who at the time also included Lia, his son-in-law suggested that the Renault Megane model could be scrapped.
 He offered to handle the task for Sant. 
 Later, Lia informed him that all he managed to get for the scrap material was €100. 
 But when Sant subsequently checked with Transport Malta he discovered that the car had actually been transferred to a third party rather than scrapped. 
 Sant insisted he never signed the declaration form for such a transfer and claimed the signature on the relative document presented to Transport Malta was not his. 
 Sant filed challenge proceedings against the Police Commissioner for criminal action to be taken against Lia. 
 In September, a Magistrates’ Court upheld the challenge and ordered police action, observing that although Lia had made no monetary gain, there was prima facie grounds for criminal action. 
 The alleged document falsification could only be determined by a calligraphy expert appointed by a court presiding over criminal proceedings. 
 The Police Commissioner appealed that decision asking the court to quash the magistrate’s judgment. 
 Sant’s lawyers argued that the appeal filed by the Attorney General on behalf of the commissioner was late. 
 However, the Criminal Court turned down that plea, observing that although legal time limits were to be “scrupulously” respected, in this case, the delay was not through the AG’s fault. 
 The first court’s decision and the case records had been sent late from court and consequently, the AG was not to be penalised for the shortcomings of others. 
 The court observed that challenge proceedings served as “judicial review” to determine whether the reasons for the police’s “inertia” to act upon a notice of crime were justified or not. 
 The court observed that Lia had assisted in the transfer of the vehicle by allegedly handing a copy of the owner’s ID card and thus there was prima facie evidence of his suspected role as accomplice in the fraud. 
 Although Sant appeared to have been copied in an email sent by Lia to the insurance company to stop renewal of the car policy, Sant’s testimony in court cast doubt on the AG’s argument that Sant knew that his car was being transferred rather than scrapped. 
 Sant also insisted he never signed the transfer.
 No calligraphy test was done to eliminate Lia’s suspected involvement in that transfer. 
 In his email to the insurance company, Lia said the vehicle had been transferred to a third party. The transfer took place the next day. 
 In light of all considerations, Mr Justice Neville Camilleri deemed that the first court was correct in saying that the suspected signature falsification could only be determined through a calligraphy test in criminal proceedings.
 Since the police did not carry out the necessary examinations in their investigation, Lia’s involvement could only be excluded through the criminal process.
 There was no reason to vary the first court’s decision, said the judge, clarifying that this was only on a prima facie level based on court records.
 “In no way was this court implying some form of guilt by Dr Lia in respect of charges to be pressed against him,” said the court, ordering both judgments to be served “immediately” upon the Police Commissioner for the necessary action.

 On Tuesday it was revealed that Muscat, his chief of staff Keith Schembri, former minister Konrad Mizzi and 19 other people and entities will be charged with a host of serious crimes related to corruption and the hospitals privatisation deal. 
 Negotiations surrounding the deal to privatise three state hospitals were handled by Muscat’s government. That deal was annulled by a court last year. 
 In a Facebook post, Muscat said had the charges against him not been so serious, they would have been “laughable”. 
  “Without hearing me out, the authorities have decided to accuse me and stain me with corruption, money laundering, that I set up a criminal organisation, and that I took €30 million,” Muscat said in a Facebook post. 
 Reports that some €30 million in assets had been frozen from Muscat began swirling at the time that the criminal charges had been filed, however, the figure remained unconfirmed. 
 In a section of the legal document where prosecutors listed asset freezing requests, the amount of €30 million was listed in the same line as the names of Muscat, Schembri, Mizzi and four others. 
 “These are a set of inventions that cannot be believed except by those who came up with them, just like Egrant.”
 The former prime minister said he is looking forward to “destroy” accusations built on “fantasy and lies”. 
 In a warning to those applauding the charges being brought against him, Muscat said it would take years for the case to be decided, but reminded critics that “he who laughs last, laughs best”. 
 Muscat, Mizzi and Schembri have been charged with money laundering, bribery and trading in influence, among others. If found guilty, they could each be facing a jail term of up to 18 years and a fine of €2.5 million.

 In a landmark ruling, the court ruled that while the FIAU was not an independent tribunal or impartial court, the right to a fair hearing was safeguarded provided those fined had “access to full review” before a court of law.
 Lawyers representing the firm that had contested the FIAU fine’s legality told Times of Malta they intend to contest the “retrograde” decision at the European Court of Human Rights.
 It all started in April 2021 when the Malta Financial Services Authority issued a compliance review report in respect of XNT Limited which, in turn, presented its submissions on those findings.
 In September 2021, the FIAU’s Compliance Monitoring Committee issued a €244,679 administrative fine against the company which was not invited to attend the meeting where that fine was discussed.
 XNT was subsequently informed about the fine which was triggered by various alleged shortcomings on its part in terms of money laundering laws.
 The company took two-fold legal action.
 It filed an appeal against the FIAU fine before the Court of Appeal and also filed separate constitutional proceedings, claiming that the administrative fine breached its fundamental right to a fair hearing.
 Its appeal against the fine is currently still pending, awaiting the outcome of the constitutional proceedings which reached final judgment stage on Monday.
 In July 2023, the First Hall, Civil Court in its constitutional jurisdiction had rejected all pleas raised by the FIAU and the State Advocate as respondents sued by XNT and upheld the applicant’s claims.
 That court declared that the FIAU fine breached the applicant’s fundamental right to a fair hearing since the financial watchdog was not an impartial or independent court.
 While revoking that fine, the court had ruled that the case was to continue only after the State enacted legislation to set up an autonomous and independent entity to hear and decide the case in line with all safeguards to a fair hearing.
 Both the FIAU and the State Advocate filed appeals to that decision.
 On Monday the Constitutional Court, presided over by Chief Justice Mark Chetcuti and Judges Giannino Caruana Demajo and Anthony Ellul, made extensive reference to ECHR caselaw and the so-called ‘Engel criteria’ developed to determine the nature of such fines.
 The fine imposed by the FIAU did not stem from a criminal charge but was a form of punishment meant to serve as a deterrent so that subject persons would adhere to money laundering regulations.
 In XNT’s case, the fine related to three categories of breaches: insufficient information about the source of wealth, lack of security of transactions and risks undertaken by the company without the necessary level of due diligence and the fact that the money laundering reporting officer lacked sufficient seniority and command.  
 When assessing the severity of the fine, the court said that the matter had to be taken in context on a case-by-case basis.
 In this case, the €244,679 fine was equivalent to less than 3% of the company’s net profit for 2021.
 The court deemed the fine as “not particularly harsh” but nonetheless “substantial.”
 Thus the basic safeguards to fundamental rights that applied to a person facing criminal charges, also applied in this case.
 “The FIAU is not an independent tribunal nor an impartial court,” said the judges.
 Thus the fine “was imposed by an administrative authority which, no matter what the appellants said, was certainly not objectively impartial.”
 But the matter did not stop there.
 XNT had appealed the fine and to date, the matter was still pending before the Court of Appeal in its inferior jurisdiction awaiting this final decision by the Constitutional Court.
 After citing ECHR jurisprudence the court concluded that it would follow the same line of reasoning: there was no breach of the right to a fair hearing as long as the subject person had “access to full review before a tribunal [or] in our case, a court set up by law.”
 Under Maltese law that appeal procedure was regulated in terms of the Code of Organization and Civil Procedure which allows fresh evidence to be produced at appeal stage only to a limited extent and at the court’s discretion.
 The Constitutional Court acknowledged this but observed that there was nothing stopping the Court of Appeal from authorizing witnesses to be heard, particularly a representative of the company challenging the fine.
 Such testimonies and fresh documentary evidence may be allowed if deemed “necessary and useful,” went on the judges.
 “In truth, that right lies at the court [of appeal]’s discretion. But it is wrong to make declarations before the process before [that court] takes place.
 And every court has the duty to ensure that ordinary law is applied and interpreted in such manner as to conform with fundamental human rights.
 Moreover, the burden of proof at appeal stage lies with the FIAU so as to make sure that the subject person’s presumption of innocence is “intact.”
 And although the law says that the appeal must be decided within six months, that could be extended upon agreement between the parties or for an exceptional reason. So that relatively short term did not mean that the parties would not get a fair hearing.
 When all was considered, the court concluded that article 13(2) of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act and regulation 21 under Subsidiary Legislation 373.01 did not breach the right to a fair hearing.
 It turned down XNT’s claims and ordered a copy of the judgment to be inserted in the records of the proceedings pending before the Court of Appeal.
 Meanwhile, the company’s lawyers have expressed their intention of pursuing the matter further before the ECHR.

"Police have a monthly quota for traffic tickets, officer confirms under oath",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/police-monthly-quota-traffic-tickets-officers-confirms-oath.1099140,10-08-2024,005792.png,"The police are instructed to issue a minimum of 10 traffic tickets per month, a police officer admitted under oath on Monday.
 Quotas given to officers in other locations, such as St Julian’s, are higher, police officer Clive Mallia testified.
 It is the first time that a police officer has confirmed the existence of quotas for traffic contraventions.
 Mallia made the admission as he was testifying in the case against five people accused of assaulting him and a fellow officer in Ħamrun last month.
 That altercation began when the two police officers issued a parking ticket to a car belonging to one of the accused.
 “There’s nothing official,” he initially said when asked by defence lawyer Franco Debono whether officers were required to issue a set number of contraventions each month.
 As laughter rippled through the courtroom, Magistrate Monica Vella intervened.
 “Is there a quota? And if so, would you issue tickets nonetheless even if there’s nothing wrong?” she asked the witness.
 At that point, Mallia acknowledged the existence of the unwritten rule. He said he had already exceeded his monthly quota when he booked the car belonging to his alleged assailant, Kurt Borg.
 The existence – or lack thereof – of a quota-based system for traffic contraventions has been a hot-button topic for years.
 Private firms that used to operate a community officer system – the so-called wardens – spent years vehemently denying the existence of any quota-based system.
 But in 2015, then-junior minister Stefan Buontempo tacitly acknowledged the existence of a quota system when he announced that it was to be abolished following complaints.  
 In a 2016 report, then-LESA CEO Raymond Zammit wrote that the quota system was “a source of mockery and contempt” and described it as “daylight robbery”.
 “The termination of the quota system served to liberate wardens from years of aggression and hostility which for years they had no choice but to kowtow to,” he added.  
 But officer Mallia’s testimony on Monday suggests a form of the quota system remains alive and kicking, at least within the police force.
 Questions have been sent to the Malta Police Force.

"Women are partly to blame if raped while drunk, a fifth of Maltese say",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/women-partly-blame-raped-drunk-fifth-maltese-say.1101614,27-11-2024,005807.png,"A woman is partly to blame if she suffers sexual violence while drunk or high, one in five people in Malta say, with a tenth believing women are simply playing hard to get when they turn down a sexual proposal, according to a new Eurobarometer survey.
 Meanwhile, a third of those surveyed think women make up or exaggerate rape claims, second only to Bulgaria.
 The study surveyed 537 people across Malta to get a glimpse of attitudes about sexual violence across the country. It comes hot off the heels of another EU report which found that Malta has the highest reporting of gender-based violence in Europe.
 The survey suggests that Maltese women’s safety in the online world is still elusive.
 One in four say that a woman should accept sexist and demeaning comments once they share an opinion on social media.
 And relatively few show sympathy towards women who unwittingly have their nude pictures shared online – if they’ve shared intimate pictures with somebody, they’re partly to blame if they are then posted online, according to 55% of respondents.
 
 The study finds that the Maltese generally take a dim view of physical violence among partners, although they look more kindly upon a man controlling his wife’s pursestrings than most other countries.
 A third of respondents say that it is acceptable for a man to control their partner’s finances under certain circumstances, slightly above the EU average.
 But they draw the line at snooping through their partner’s phone. Almost nine in ten, the highest number across Europe, find it unacceptable for a man to control their partner’s social media activities and phone use.
 Meanwhile, 96% say that it is unacceptable for a man to occasionally slap his partner, the third-highest in Europe, while 90% describe it as “totally unacceptable” for a man to have non-consensual sex with their partner, second only to Luxembourg.
 Malta's respondents also overwhelmingly disapprove of catcalling or ogling women, with 89% describing it as ""unacceptable"", more than any other European country.
 Nevertheless, the Maltese believe that domestic violence is widespread.
 Almost two-thirds say that intimate partner violence towards women is either very or fairly common, a little lower than the EU average of 71%, while a third say that it is also common for men to be the victims.
 But one in ten say that domestic violence is ultimately a private matter and should be dealt with behind closed doors.

Heavier punishments mulled for assault on public officials,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/heavier-punishments-mulled-assault-public-officials.1098513,25-09-2024,005809.png,"People who assault police officers could soon face significantly harsher punishment as the government is looking into toughening the law in the wake of last weekend’s Ħamrun brawl.
 A bill is yet to be drafted but sources close to the government said the amended law could empower judges to hand out heavier fines, longer prison sentences and even replace probation and suspended sentences with actual jail time in several cases.
 Consultations on the fairness and deterrent effect of the new bill are ongoing and the law would apply to assault of any public official, not just the police.
 Contacted for comment, Home Affairs Minister Byron Camilleri confirmed the process started and was optimistic, saying details of the new bill would be provided in the coming days.
 As part of the exercise, the government is running a comparative analysis study to understand how such crimes are addressed and punished in other countries.
 PN MP and home affairs spokesperson Darren Carabott confirmed that the opposition agrees with a tougher law in principle.
 On Monday, Minister Camilleri informally met police constables Clive Mallia and Aidan Demicoli, who were assaulted after issuing a parking ticket on Saturday evening in Ħamrun.
 Bystanders filmed the assault on their phones and the footage quickly circulated on social media, sparking shock.
 Also on Monday, four men and a woman – aged between 23 and 46 – were charged in court with assaulting and injuring the two officers. They stand accused of forming a mob to cause public fear, violence, insults and threats against public officers, attacking officers on duty, wilful breach of the public peace, wilful damage to public property and causing slight and grievous injuries.
 The law is already quite unforgiving with people found guilty of reviling, vilifying, threatening or causing bodily harm to any public official – not just police officers – while on duty.
 Their punishment is generally increased by two degrees, and they face as much as four years imprisonment and a €20,000 fine if found guilty.
 The law was amended to include these toughened jail terms and fines in 2014, following a bill proposed by then-opposition MP Jason Azzopardi.
 But back then, Azzopardi wanted to go even further.
 He wanted fellow lawmakers to include a clause that would not allow magistrates and judges to hand probation and suspended sentences for such crimes.
 This would mean persons who physically and severely assault public officials would inevitably have to go to prison.
 Most people convicted of such crimes are handed probation sentences and that is not a strong enough message against violence on public officials, he argued. Probation sentences are effectively considered as acquittals and offer no real deterrent.
 In the eyes of the law, a public officer is anyone who is lawfully appointed to administer work for the state and includes anyone from government officials, teachers and enforcement officers to magistrates.
 PN home affairs spokesperson Darren Carabott said he agrees with having tougher laws in principle, but that was not enough.
 “Tougher penalties would serve as a deterrent, but what’s more important is to look at other ways to stop this sort of act from happening,” Carabott said, adding one way was to address police officer shortage.
 Malta had fewer police officers in 2022 than 2014, he said, despite the surge in population.
 Furthermore, crimes have become more complicated and the police force needs more resources to investigate offences like cybercrime and money laundering. Carabott said Police Commissioner Angelo Gafa’ has also encouraged a culture of “anything goes”.
 “People now feel they will not face consequences when they break the law,” he said.
 The videos of the Ħamrun incident on Saturday caused an uproar not simply because of the aggressors’ behaviour, but also because of the officers’ seeming inability to properly defend themselves and subdue the assailants.
 On social media several people asked why the officers were not better equipped to fight back and take control of the situation while others questioned why back up officers could not arrive on site to the rescue of their colleagues earlier.
 In a reply to questions, a police spokesperson said the two officers on Saturday were equipped with pepper spray, taser, batons and one of them was also had a service firearm (glock).
 “Police officers undergo practical training covering safe weapon handling, control and restraint techniques, use of taser and pepper spray, and public order and crowd management, among other topics,” the spokesperson said.
 He added that all officers are equipped with handcuffs, pepper spray, baton, radio, and as of recently, with body-worn cameras and an upgraded baton.
 He would not say whether the force is considering revising its policies on equipment and its use.
 The law offers little guidance on what a police officer can or should do in a situation like last weekend’s, but it does make one thing very clear – that their response must be proportionate to the attack.
 The Police Act says: “Police officers may use such moderate and proportionate force as may be necessary to ensure the observance of the laws.”
 This means they cannot hit back hastily or recklessly, one police source explained, let alone use their gun in a scenario where the attackers were not wielding any weapons.
 Internal standard operating procedures (SOPs) offer officers more detailed do’s and don’ts.
 Even if they use the baton, which is usually an effective tool to defend themself and take control of the brawl, they must not hit the aggressor on the head or on other parts of the body that could cause severe or permanent damage.
 Another source said the taser only allows the officer to fire twice and only subdues the aggressor for around five seconds – which would have hardly helped in Saturday’s situation, as there were too many aggressors and just two tasers.
 “And they also cannot aim the taser just anywhere on the aggressor’s body. They cannot hit them in the eye or other critical places and the instrument cannot be used on people with heart problems and pregnant women,” one source explained.
 “Aiming safely might seem easy on paper but doing it on the spot while surrounded with that many aggressors is a whole other story.”
 These instruments, while helpful, could also backfire if the aggressors grab hold of them or if the officers are themselves hit with pepper spray or a taser shot.
 On Monday, the police confirmed the officers used pepper spray to subdue the people, who emerged from a nearby catering establishment and assaulted them after they issued a parking infringement ticket.

Case against Ħamrun brawl five to begin on October 7,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/case-hamrun-brawl-five-begin-october-7.1098556,25-09-2024,005818.png,"Five people charged with assaulting police officers in Ħamrun will appear in court on October 7 before Magistrate Monica Vella.
 Vella was assigned the compilation of evidence against the five on Wednesday, legal sources told Times of Malta.
 Magistrates are assigned cases according to a roster. 
 All five accused are pleading not guilty to a raft of charges stemming from a Saturday night brawl that erupted on Ħamrun’s high street.
 Two police officers were injured in the fracas, one seriously, and the case drew national attention after bystander videos of the incident went viral on social media.
 Home Affairs Minister Byron Camilleri has since said that he intends to propose new, tougher prison sentences for anyone found guilty of assaulting or disobeying officers.
 The Opposition has welcomed that move but called for the government to also do more to ensure the police are adequately trained and equipped to deal with criminals. 
 Magistrate Monica Vella’s assignment could potentially spark objections from defence lawyers, due to her marriage to a high-ranking police officer. Vella’s husband, George Cremona, serves as assistant commissioner in the police force.
 Under Maltese law, magistrates can opt to recuse themselves of their own volition or following a request filed by parties to a case.
 Vella has served as a magistrate for nine years, having previously served as mayor of Xewkija and with experience as both a commissioner for justice as well as a judicial assistant in the superior courts.
 All five of the people accused of assault are currently being held at the Corradino prison, after the magistrate who registered their not guilty pleas turned down their requests for bail.

"One man, two women, charged with human trafficking and money laundering",maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/129326/one_man_two_women_charged_with_human_trafficking_and_money_laundering,22-05-2024,005819.png,"Three individuals: an Italian man, his Brazilian partner and her sister, have been remanded in custody after being accused of trafficking women and forcing them to work in the sex trade in Malta.
 Magistrate Elaine Rizzo presided over the arraignments of 50-year-old Luca Tavolaro, an Italian citizen, his partner Jarleide Silva De Lima, 38, and her sister Michely Silva De Lima, 39, both Brazilian citizens, all of whom reside at the same address in St. Pauls Bay. 
 Tavolaro and Jarleide Silva De Lima were charged with laundering the proceeds of crime, while Jarleide Silva De Lima alone was further accused of human trafficking, forcing individuals into prostitution or the production of pornography, forcing individuals into prostitution by abuse of authority or trust, using physical or moral violence to isolate the women and knowingly holding them against their will for the purposes of prostitution. She was also accused of recidivism. The two sisters are further accused of recruiting persons over the age of 21 for prostitution and living off the proceeds of prostitution.
  The defendants pleaded not guilty to all of the charges against them.
 Police Inspector John Spiteri told the court that the investigation had been triggered by a report of two women being exploited which had been received by the Vice Squad. The subsequent police investigation discovered that the defendants had been luring girls from Brazil to Malta with the false promise of cleaning industry jobs, only to force them into prostitution once they arrived in Malta.
 The court upheld a prosecution’s request that one of the girls allegedly trafficked be allowed to testify.  At that moment, Tavolaro’s interpreter informed the court that he had just told her that he wasn’t feeling well and that the other two defendants, after hearing him say this, had just said the same thing. The court offered to call an ambulance, but the defendants then appeared to demur.
 The Brazilian girl took the stand, telling the court that she had only been in Malta for four months after arriving from Belgium.  She recognised the defendants in the dock, identifying Michely as wearing a green dress and Jarleide, a chequered shirt. Michely lived in the same apartment as her, she said, adding that Jarleide, whom she had first met at a Brazilian cultural event in Malta, would exchange her Euros to Brazilian Real.
 The girl, who had travelled to Malta on a tourist visa, said that she would hand over her earnings, usually between €1000 and €1200 to Jarleide, who would then use a Brazilian money transfer system to deposit the equivalent sum in Brazilian Real into her bank account in Brazil. The last time this had happened was in April, she said.
 The account in question, at Brazilian bank Caixa Econômica Federal, belonged to her, she said in reply to a question from lawyer Ilona Schembri.
 The girl explained that she did not have access to the account, but she would provide her banking details to the defendants in order to deposit the money.
 Asked, by defence lawyer Maria Karlsson, to specify her Maltese address, the girl replied that she had two: one in San Gwann and another in Gozo.
 Prosecutor Ramon Bonett Sladden asked the witness how much she would receive of the sums transferred. “Every time I would ask her to make a deposit in my account, I would have to pay her an extra €50 for ‘transport costs.’” The magistrate asked the witness, who the court was told, was leaving Malta today, what country she would be travelling to. “Brazil,” the girl replied, The court instructed her to give the prosecution her contact number, email address and residential address in Brazil, before she left the courtroom.
 A freezing order was issued against the defendants. 
 Bail was requested by the defence, the court being told that Jarlady Silva De Lima and Tavolaro had lived in Malta for the past five years. But the prosecution objected, Inspector Spiteri arguing that it was “too early a stage for the court to ensure that potential witnesses, including clients, Tavolaro’s coworkers and others, are not intimidated.” Jarleide had previous convictions for similar offences in Italy, added the inspector, “which is why she travelled to Malta in the first place.”
 Karlsson told the court that her client was the mother to a 4-month-old child, who was currently in State care. Schembri added that her client,  Jarleidi, also had a 7-year-old child, who was autistic.
 Inspector Spiteri said he was against defendants using their children as bail tokens. One of the defendants also has a severely disabled daughter, but this had not stopped her from spending her daughters disability allowance on other things. Bail was denied, amongst other reasons due to the vulnerability of the alleged victims.
 Magistrate Rizzo urged the prosecution to summons all its witnesses in as short a timeframe as possible and issued protection orders in favour of the two alleged victims.  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police

 Police inspector Sarah Kathleen Zerafa arraigned 48-year-old Marcio Malard Mayer, before magistrate Marseanne Farrugia on Wednesday, accusing him of criminal damage to Izola Bank and a nearby shop. Mayer was also charged with being drunk and unable to take care of himself in a public place and offending public decency.
  The man, who had been staying in a hotel in Valletta, was returning from a night out at 1am on Wednesday morning. In his drunken state, he had mistaken a nearby branch of Izola bank for his hotel.
 Finding the premises closed and thinking that he had been locked out, the man had picked up a large flower pot and threw it at the bank branch’s glass facade, causing damage. He also caused damage to a nearby shop.
 Inspector Zerafa told the court that the damage caused had been quantified at €240 to the bank and €73 to the shop.
 Mayer’s lawyer Simon Micallef Stafrace informed the court that the man would be pleading guilty. The court informed the man that he was facing a maximum of nine months imprisonment for the charges.
 Mayer confirmed his plea after being given time to reconsider.
 Making submissions on punishment, Inspector Zerafa recommended a suspended sentence, telling the court that Mayer had expressed sincere remorse during his statement.
 Micallef Stafrace agreed with the suggestion of a suspended sentence, reminding the court that his client had immediately admitted his guilt and “didn’t waste anyone’s time.”
 Finding the man guilty on his own admission, the court sentenced him to imprisonment for three months, which it suspended for two years, also ordering him to reimburse the injured parties for the damages within the next 24 hours, failing which his three-month sentence will become effective.
 Asked whether he understood what his punishment was, he replied that he did.

 Further investigations, including reference to CCTV footage, linked Paruzel to shoplifting from the same supermarket on May 30, when he stole bottles of alcohol and tools, and June 15, when he stole bottles of perfume and alcohol from a Swieqi supermarket.
 After Paruzel pleaded guilty, legal aid lawyer Ilona Schembri said the accused understood that what he did was wrong and wanted to change his ways.
 Noting that the accused had a previous conviction, she asked the court however to consider that he had cooperated with the police.
 The prosecution said Paruzel was given a chance to reform himself last November, but had squandered the opportunity. Punishment must now be such as to teach him a lesson, as the previous one had not worked.

 Five people have been charged with assaulting and injuring police officers in a Saturday night Ħamrun brawl. 
 The accused – four men and one woman with ages ranging from 23 to 46, -were escorted into the Valletta law courts from its main entrance on Republic Street, as a group of onlookers watched.
 Elton Anthony Borg, Erica Borg, Kurt Borg, Redeimen Aquilina and Christian Mansueto all pleaded not guilty to assaulting the officers, resisting arrest and other crimes. 
 Magistrate Joseph Gatt turned down their request for bail, noting the gravity of the case and the risk of defendants tampering with evidence. 
  The accused sat impassively throughout the arraignment, save for Erica Borg, who wept as her legs shook. 
 The Saturday night assault was caught on video by bystanders. Footage quickly circulated on social media, shocking people and drawing condemnations from both the government and the Opposition. 
 Police said the incident kicked off when two officers issued a parking ticket for an illegally parked vehicle. A group then emerged from a nearby catering establishment and assaulted the officers, who tried to subdue them using pepper spray. 
  One officer was seriously injured and the other suffered slight injuries. Both were hospitalised.
 The five accused stand accused of seven separate crimes:
 They also face two other, less serious charges of breaching public peace and damage to third-party property.
 All pleaded not guilty and requested bail. 
  Elton Borg is 46 years old and a restaurateur who lives in Msida. His partner, Erica Borg, is 42 and a housewife. Kurt Borg, 44, lives in Qormi and is also a restaurateur. 
  Redeimen Aquilina is 23, in employment and from Ħamrun, while Christian Mansueto, 33 and from Siġġiewi, is self-employed. 
 Three of the accused – Elton, Kurt and Erica Borg – were arrested onsite. The other two fled the scene but were tracked down with the use of CCTV footage and arrested at their homes. 
 Prosecutors objected to the defendants' request for bail, noting the risk of evidence being tampered with. 
 The prosecuting inspector said this had already happened. CCTV cameras at Borg's Ħamrun restaurant have been removed, she noted, and police officers were unable to obtain footage of the incident from them. 
  Furthermore, one of the accused who was arrested at home had already disposed of his clothes by the time officers came to arrest him. 
 One of the assaulted officers also lost a bodycam in the fracas, they said. The camera has not yet been located.
 Prosecutors were out in force for the arraignment – a Deputy Commissioner, a superintendent, numerous inspectors and various other officers were all present.
 Defence lawyers included Franco Debono, Arthur Azzopardi, Mario Mifsud, Jacob Magri, Matthew Xuereb, Charles Mercieca, Alex Scerri Herrera and Nicholas Mifsud.
 Lawyer Hermann Mula, a former police inspector, is representing the two police officers who were assaulted. 
  Defence lawyers took it in turns to argue in favour of their respective clients being granted bail. 
 Defendants were willing to satisfy any bail conditions imposed by the court and were presumed innocent until found guilty. All lived in Malta and have family ties here, lawyers noted. 
 The court should not be swayed by public outrage on social media, they argued, noting that the defendants had yet to give their version of events. 
 Lawyer Franco Debono said his client, Mansueto, had intervened to break up the fight. Mansueto had a clean criminal record and could provide sufficient guarantees to satisfy bail requirements as required by the criminal code, he said.
 Debono said that while defence lawyers were doing their job in representing clients, he emphasised his total respect for the police corps and their work - a point endorsed by other defence lawyers. 
 Lawyers also echoed Debono's warning for the courts to not be conditioned by social media. Freedom of expression was important, but god forbid the courts were conditioned by social media, he said. 
 Defence lawyer Mario Mifsud downplayed the disappearance of CCTV cameras and one of the defendants' clothes - every establishment in Ħamrun has CCTV cameras, he said, and it was ""routine"" for people to dispose of their clothes after a night out. 
 Attorney General lawyer Jennifer Polidano shot down that argument. Footage was missing, she said, and it was normal to change clothes after a night out, not dispose of them. 
 Even if some of the accused had untainted criminal records, they had been arrested for disobeying police orders. 
 Having heard the defence's pleas and prosecution's arguments, the magistrate turned down the bail requests. 
 He noted that the accused stood charged with very serious offences, that there was a real risk of defendants tampering with evidence and that the court was not reassured that the defendants would abide by all bail conditions set. 
 All five will be held in preventative custody at Corradino Correctional Facility until the case resumes at an as-yet undefined date. 
 Meanwhile, Home Affairs Minister Byron Camilleri on Monday informally met constables Clive Mallia and Aidan Demicoli, who were assaulted on Saturday.
 The Home Ministry said he thanked them for their service and promised government support to them and their colleagues.
 He said the government was working on further strengthening the laws on violence against the police and other public officers. 
 The minister was accompanied by deputy police commissioners Kenneth Haber and Sandro Gatt.

 Prosecutors say the man was the victim of an extortion that began when two sons of a prostitute he visited burst into the room and threatened him with a knife. 
 Three men and three women stand accused of various crimes in the case. 
 Speaking in English and testifying via videoconference for four hours on Wednesday, the victim identified four of the defendants.
 The soft-spoken witness ran the court through his various encounters, generally marked by physical violence and verbal threats, with three of the accused - brothers Clyde and Mario Mallia and their friend Massimo Fasanelli.
 He said other encounters with Chanelle Spiteri, another of the defendants, were of a different kind.
 The man had been introduced to Spiteri by Mallia’s mother. He used to meet both women separately for sexual services.
 The witness said he never met Christine and Xasnolley Schembri, the last two defendants. Their alleged involvement in the blackmail was to receive funds channelled from his account to their accounts under orders of Clyde Mallia.
 It all started on January 26, 2022 when the Mallias’ mother, whom he affectionately referred to as “Lucy” texted him, asking him to drive her to the Detox Centre where she habitually went for treatment.
 He had first met the woman in 2007 while passing through Testaferrata Street.
 “She looked nice. Nice dress. I decided to stop,” said the witness, recounting that first encounter with the woman in that red light district.
 They went to her room and had sex that day.
 For several years he used to see Lucy in that area.
 The two continued to meet and their relationship developed from one that was purely “for services” to “mutual respect,” he said. That was why he sometimes stepped in to help when 'Lucy' asked for some assistance.
 On that January 2022 day, he called for her at her Għaxaq home, and took her to detox and back. They then went upstairs to her room.
 After a few minutes, a commotion broke out outside and two men burst into the room. They were Lucy’s sons, Mario and Clyde.
 The siblings shouted at him in Maltese, pushing him onto the bed.
 Clyde had a 25-centimetre kitchen knife in hand and threatened to cut his fingers off.  
 They were “very threatening men,” said the witness, adding that he was “very frightened” at the time.
 He said Mario head-butted him on the right side of his head several times. Though not knocked unconscious, he fell onto the bed.
 Days later, he still had bruises on the right side from the ribs down to his legs.
 The brothers grabbed his phone and ordered him to transfer €5000 to Spiteri’s account. But they then upped their demand to €14,000 when they saw his account balance, he said. 
 “I was very much under duress. I thought I would be beaten again. I had no choice. I was not in a position to argue,” the witness said.
 The brothers left the house with his phone, bank cards and car key.
 While they were out, their mother dabbed his bloodied head with a damp cloth.
 Half an hour or so later, the brothers returned.
 “If you go to the police, your wife and daughter will be raped,” they warned him.
 He took his possessions and drove away.
 A few weeks later, his health deteriorated and he was taken to hospital. 
 Doctors told his family that his brain was bleeding as a result of some repetitive injury to the head.
 His family thought that he might have banged his head against the cooker hood.
 A few months later, he again began to meet Lucy and Chanelle “for services” but meetings with Chanelle were “considerably reduced” when she was pregnant.
 On May 18 2024, the victim said he was waiting for Chanelle close to her Rabat home when a car screeched to a halt next to his car.
 Three men stepped out. He immediately recognized the Mallias and another man, later identified as Fasanelli.
 They got into his car, ordered him to sit at the back and drove fast to Għaxaq.
 Back at the Mallias’ home - their mother 'Lucy' had since passed away - he was tasered by Mario.
 “I told him I suffered from a heart condition after the first shock. But there were several more.”
 Then Clyde demanded €17,000, the man testified. 
 When he told them that he did not have that much money, the three men bundled him into his car and drove him to his home.
 Fasanelli demanded to see videos that the victim had filmed of himself with Lucy and Chanelle, with their consent. 
 He directed his aggressors to the videos on a coffee table.
 Then he watched as Fasanelli “wearing gloves” took an expensive Seiko watch and cash from a bedside table. 
 Fasanelli told him to tell his wife that he needed her bank card to pay for €1000 in damages caused to Fasanelli’s Mercedes.
 That, the witness said, was “just a ploy” to get the wife’s card and then transfer €17,000 demanded by his blackmailers.
 The witness eventually took his wife’s card when she dozed off after he called for her at a friend’s house and drove her home later that day.
 The witness said that a short time later, Clyde Mallia upped the demand to €22,000 and threatened to show the videos to his wife.
 He paid the money after various visits to the bank and several transactions.
 He thought that was the end of it, but on June 1, Clyde turned up again, demanding €40,000.
 He said he had watched those videos and they “made him mad.”
 Clyde again threatened to kill him, dropping hints about the “mafia” and saying that he had African and Serbian friends.
 The victim replied that he did not have that kind of money and Clyde promptly stole his car.  
 Some days later, the victim’s phone rang at 3:45am with further threats.
 The victim said that was when he decided to tell his wife what had been going on, and he took her to “a safe place.”
 He also went to a lawyer, opened up about his ordeal and finally filed a report at Valletta police station.
 He said that he paid a global sum of €37,000.
 Under cross-examination, the witness said that he never tried to retrieve the money from the Schembri’s because “it was pointless.”
 He also confirmed that he used to visit Lucy in her last days in hospital, giving her some money for snacks. But he denied buying her drugs.
 At the end of the sitting Massimo Fasanelli was granted bail. The accused women were all granted bail previously Mario Mallia's arrest was declared invalid upon arraignment and he was discharged. Clyde Mallia is still awaiting bail.
 The case, presided by Magistrate Leonard Caruana, continues in October.
 AG lawyers Darlene Grima and Charmaine Abdilla are prosecuting together with Inspectors Stephen Gulia and Andrew Agius Bonello.
 Lawyers Franco Debono and Adreana Zammit were counsel to the Mallias. Herman Mula was counsel to Fasanelli. Mario and Nicholas Mifsud were counsel to the Schembris. Francesca Zarb was counsel to Spiteri. Michael Sciriha and Roberto Spiteri appeared for the victim.

Relief and hope for Megally family after court's autopsy ruling,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/relief-hope-megally-family-court-autopsy-ruling.1094652,29-06-2024,"005896.png,005897.png","The son, daughter and wife of a foetal medicine specialist said they cried “tears of joy” when hearing the court order hospital authorities to allow an autopsy on the corpse.
 “There is now a glimmer of light as we will be able to have the autopsy and then bury my father,” Naged Megally’s son, Polycarpus, said.
 “When all of this is over, and we bury him, we can actually start mourning,” the 32-year-old added.
 The widow, Margarita, however, said she and her family are still anxious since the hospital authorities can appeal the court’s decision.
 Everyone should have the right to ask for an autopsy on a family member when there are unanswered questions, she insisted.
 A judge concluded on Friday that the superintendent of public health and the Mater Dei Hospital CEO breached the family’s human rights after denying them a private autopsy to determine the cause of his death.
 Megally died at Mater Dei Hospital last July after spending six weeks in intensive care. He was long afflicted by a neuromuscular condition and had a long and complicated medical history, which, according to his family, was not adequately diagnosed and assessed before medication was administered during his last weeks in hospital.
 The doctor’s death followed a number of surgeries where the patient appeared to be making progress before his condition took a turn for the worse. His family said they were informed about a “mysterious” condition affecting the patient’s windpipe two days or so before his death and that was subsequently identified as the cause of death.
 But the family was unconvinced and wanted an autopsy. Attempts in court to allow a private autopsy proved unsuccessful until yesterday, when the constitutional case they instituted concluded that an autopsy should take place.
  The superintendent of public health and the Mater Dei CEO were given five days to appeal the decision. 
 “We were exhausted. A year is a long time to wait for the truth,” Polycarpus said.
 His sister, Anastasia, said that their lives have been on hold since July 2023. 
 “Everyone has had his birthday. Christmas and Easter have passed and none of us have realised it; it’s as if we’re all stuck on July 5, 2023,” she said.
 “It’s no joke to wait a year to have a funeral. All our lives have been affected; we’re all in limbo,” she added.
 So why have they insisted on having their father’s body examined? 
 “We want an autopsy to know the truth. We saw him get better over six weeks. He was breathing by himself; he was speaking to us and was even asking me to water the plants,” Anastasia said.
 “All of a sudden, he got worse and we still don’t know why,” Polycarpus said.
 In court, lawyers Tonio Azzopardi and Ryan Falzon argued that the family’s fundamental right to private and family life had been breached by the health authorities.
 Referring to European Court of Human Rights caselaw, the judge observed that foreign jurisprudence did not appear to have yet tackled the issue regarding whether the right to family life included the right to a private autopsy as requested in Megally’s case.
 The family’s relationship to the late doctor undoubtedly fell within the definition of the right to family and private life and the quality of that relationship was hardly negatively impacted by his death.
 Every person had a right to attend a relative’s funeral, Mr Justice Mark Simiana said.
 Any autopsy or organ donation without the consent or against the will of the deceased’s family fell within the parameters of that fundamental right as defined under article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.
 It logically followed that the funeral and any intervention on the corpse were acts affecting that fundamental right because they had an impact not only on the relationship between the survivors and the deceased but also affected the relationship among the survivors themselves.
 It was logical that death negatively impacted the family of the deceased and that negative effect was further accentuated when the cause of death was unknown or was being contested, as in Megally’s case, the court said.
 It followed that the family’s right to know the cause of death also fell within the parameters of article 8.
 The court pointed out that delays in releasing the corpse for autopsy were not attributable to the hospital but were caused by the criminal proceedings triggered by the family and, ultimately, rejected by the court.
 As for the family’s insistence on the unconditional release of the corpse, the judge agreed with the hospital authorities that their refusal was a justified interference to the family’s fundamental right.
 The authorities said that the cause of death was known but the family did not accept it and insisted on an autopsy. The hospital authorities agreed but the family wanted the procedure done in terms of a magisterial inquiry.
 The family insisted on the autopsy being done by pathologists of their choice and demanded possession of their relative’s corpse. The court did not agree that the corpse was to be unconditionally released.
 However, the court upheld the family’s suggestion for “alternative remedies”.
 It concluded that the family’s fundamental right had been breached and ordered the Mater Dei CEO and the superintendent of public health to authorise the autopsy.
 
 That procedure is to be performed at Mater Dei within 15 days by two pathologists selected by the family from a list of specialists on the Medical Council register and paid for by the family.
 The autopsy is to be conducted in the presence of an observer chosen by the hospital to ensure it was done according to applicable regulations.
 Payment for that procedure has already been made by the family, who must also pay a quarter of the legal expenses.

 An Enemalta substation in Gżira caught fire on Monday afternoon, sparking a power cut that impacted more than 3,000 customers for an hour. 
 Enemalta was unable to say what caused the fire that led to the evacuation of one resident of the block of flats on Triq Sir Patrick Stuart.
 Police received calls that a fire broke out on around 1.10pm and the Civil Protection Department secured the area. 
 The substation was located in a garage under a residential block, but no one was injured or needed to be taken to hospital.
  In a statement posted on Facebook, Enemalta shared a photograph of the blackened substation and said the incident led to a power cut in the area, which impacted around 3,276 customers. 
 ""Enemalta returned the service in less than an hour to the majority of homes and businesses, and there are currently around 309 customers without electricity supply which are those connected directly to this substation,"" a statement read.
 By 5.30pm, power was restored to all households. 
 The energy company said it is working on providing an alternative source of electricity temporarily until all necessary works are completed. 
 Enemalta's technical teams are on-site to assist Civil Protection Department members and to begin the necessary preparations for the repairs.
  An Enemalta spokesperson said it is still too early to indicate what caused the fire, and the technical team is carrying out an internal investigation to establish the cause.
 The accident follows recent lengthy power cuts across Malta and Gozo which Enemalta blamed on heat damage to high-voltage cables. 
 Earlier this month, some localities remained without electricity for more than 20 hours. 
 Since then, Enemalta has installed 14-diesel-powered generators in various localities to cope with the frequent power cuts.

Man who beat pregnant partner and went missing for nine months denied bail,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/man-beat-pregnant-partner-went-missing-nine-months-denied-bail.1098604,26-09-2024,005905.png,"A wanted man who turned himself in nine months after allegedly beating his pregnant partner and dragging her by the hair has been remanded in custody. 
 The police had been on the lookout for 27-year-old Dylan Magro ever since a ""trivial argument"" at his partner’s Marsascala home escalated to physical violence. 
 The man allegedly hit his eight-week pregnant partner on the head with her mobile phone, damaging the device. He also allegedly dragged her by the hair, beat her and took her car keys. 
 The woman managed to make it to the police station on foot. Meanwhile, her partner vanished. 
 The address on his ID card turned out to be an abandoned house. The police also searched the home of a close relative.
 Prosecuting officers who handled two separate court cases against Magro were also trying to track him down to serve court summons. 
 Magro was placed on the police wanted list and his photo was published along with a request for public information. 
 Following that notice, Magri’s Facebook profile was closed down.
 Months later, word got around that the man might have returned to his partner’s home. 
 Officers from the domestic violence unit dropped by at the Marsascala residence and the wanted man was there. 
 At first, he tried to keep the police out by saying he had dogs indoors. But the officers insisted on executing the arrest warrant. 
 That was when Magro fled. The officers gave chase but their target managed to jump over a wall and escaped through a construction site. 
 On Tuesday, the man finally turned himself in at the police depot. 
 Upon arraignment on Wednesday, he pleaded not guilty to a raft of charges linked to the various episodes, including slight injuries to his partner and two police officers, as well as violently resisting arrest.
 His legal aid lawyer wanted to raise the insanity plea, asking the duty magistrate to appoint three psychiatrists to assess the mental state of the defendant at the time of the alleged offences and also whether he was fit for trial. 
 Lawyer Brandon Kirk Muscat explained that Magro had long been diagnosed with “certain conditions” and his condition could deteriorate. 
 However, prosecuting inspector Audrey Micallef objected, pointing out that the defendant “knew very well what he was doing”.
 During interrogation, he told the police officer involved in the attempted arrest: “sorry for the trouble and hassle I caused”. 
 Nor did he once mention his condition when taken to the Floriana health centre after his arrest. 
 Magistrate Nadia Helena Vella turned down the request since there was no evidence supporting it at the arraignment stage. 
 The court also turned down a request for bail in view of the serious nature of the charges, the defendant’s lack of a fixed address and his untrustworthiness. 
 The court banned the publication of the victims’ names. 
 Inspector Audrey Micallef prosecuted.

Nationalist Party accuses PBS of breaching court order over budget advertisements,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/132071/nationalist_party_accuses_pbs_of_breaching_court_order_over_budget_advertisements,31-10-2024,005912.png,"The Nationalist Party has filed a legal protest against PBS alleging a breach of a court order that prohibits the broadcasting of politically partisan advert on the Budget 2025. The court's injunction was provisionally upheld on Monday following the PN's initial complaint.

 During a press conference, PN General Secretary Michael Piccinino called on the court to take immediate action and sought a remedy for the party.

                     ""According to the law, broadcasting politically-partisan advertising is illegal unless it forms part of a Broadcasting Authority scheme,"" Piccinino said, emphasising that the authority itself had previously charged PBS for airing a spot that contravened legal regulations.

 Piccinino also addressed claims from the Labour Party, asserting that the PN's actions were intended to send PBS employees to prison. ""We are not asking for anyone to be imprisoned,"" he clarified. ""It is the management of PBS that has broken the law, not the workers. For Labour, it seems that breaking the law is acceptable,"" he added.

 In a counter-response, Culture Minister Owen Bonnici criticised the PN's court actions, suggesting that their intent was to penalise PBS workers. ""What the PN refers to as Budget 'propaganda' is also aired on their own television station, NET TV,"" Bonnici said. He expressed concern that the PN's legal maneuvers could potentially lead to PBS employees facing jail time for contempt of court, condemning such behavior as “unacceptable”.

 Bonnici argued that the PN's approach reflects a disconnect with public sentiment. ""The people cannot understand why information can be broadcast on NET TV, yet when it is aired on PBS, the PN files court applications to threaten PBS workers with prison.""     ",Nicole Meilak ,court_and_police
"Police arrest 11 Maltese, Romanians in massive human trafficking bust",maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/130717/police_arrest_11_maltese_romanians_in_massive_human_trafficking_bust,13-08-2024,005917.png,"Police Inspector John Spiteri told the court that the police investigation had started with an investigation into a brothel, but it emerged that four Colombian girls who had been found there had also been trafficked. Initially there were doubts as to who was organising it, but the two-month investigation “showed that every person in this courtroom played an active role in this criminal activity.” 
 After questioning the girls who had been trafficked, the police were able to identify who was behind the operation, he said. 
 A magisterial inquiry had also been carried out in parallel with the police investigation. When the police felt that there were sufficient grounds, they obtained search and arrest warrants against 11 individuals, which were executed yesterday. 
 Every person who had been arrested had released a statement and the police found sufficient grounds to charge nine of them, said the inspector, adding that the duty magistrate had been immediately informed of the arrests.
  In reply to a question from defence lawyer Franco Debono, the inspector said the inquiry had started on 13 June.
 “During yesterday’s operation, it emerged that another brothel was also operating and another four people have been identified as witnesses,” the inspector informed the court, adding that just 3 hours before the arraignment, he had discovered that another trafficked woman had been due to arrive at the airport from where she would be picked up by one of the defendants. 
 All the defendants pleaded not guilty. Bail was requested.
 The prosecution requested protection orders be issued in favour of the trafficked women, which were upheld by the court.
 Bonett Sladden objected to the bail request. “Here we are dealing with a complex, planned, criminal operation. If released on bail, there is a risk that the operation will resume and further crimes be committed. The victims are doubly vulnerable, by the fruit of their being trafficked and the fact they don’t speak any local languages.” 
 Some of the defendants are recidivists.
 “We aren’t talking about a one or two-man operation, but an organisation. There is the possibility that the police will discover further individuals involved.
 “Inspector Spiteri told the court that although every defendant had their own particular circumstances, they formed part of a singular criminal organisation. Releasing any of them from arrest is not only premature, but would put justice at risk.
 Debono argued that requests to deny bail had to be supported by evidence. “I believe that in this case, safeguards must be applied with greater rigour,”  said the lawyer. Some of his clients had no prior convictions. “When I have a person with a clean criminal conduct, and the AG asks what he would do if granted bail, I would say probably the same thing that he had done for his entire life without conviction.”
 The lawyer suggested that even in drug trafficking cases, where the punishment is much larger, defendants had been granted bail. 
 Inspector Spiteri countered that there had not been any attempts at suborning the witnesses in the previous months because they had been held at a secure location. The defendants thought they had been deported, explained the inspector.
 “This is a textbook case where every witness is vulnerable to be suborned in every possible way, including through threats to their families back in Colombia, as has happened before.”

"Technoline was fraudulently acquired using concession funds, court hears",maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/129821/live_case_continues_against_joseph_muscat_keith_schembri,20-06-2024,005920.png,"Prosecutors have claimed that Technoline Ltd, which was granted an exclusive procurement contract by Vitals Global Healthcare, had been fraudulently acquired by another company using concession funds illicitly loaned to it by Steward Healthcare.
 This emerged during the compilation of evidence against disgraced former politicians Joseph Muscat, Konrad Mizzi, as well as Muscat’s Chief of Staff Keith Schembri, eleven others and nine companies which continued this morning, picking up from where it left off yesterday.
  A number of witnesses gave evidence before magistrate Rachel Montebello today, their testimony being largely focused on one aspect of the fraudulent hospitals concession to Vitals Global Healthcare - the construction of a cyclotron to simplify the supply chain of medical radioactive isotopes.

 READ MORE:  A hand in every cookie jar: The projects Schembri and Mizzi sought to profit on
 Towards the end of the sitting, prosecutor Francesco Refalo made submissions on whether the court should declare that it had seen sufficient prima facie evidence to justify the defendants being indicted and eventually tried by the Criminal Court.
 The inquiry conducted by magistrate Gabriella Vella had examined the involvement of Technoline and Gateway in detail, said the prosecutor.
 Gateway had been loaned €5 million by Steward to acquire GAE Holdings and Technoline. Refalo told the court that the €5 million had been fraudulently paid using funds intended for the concession.
 Technoline was then made the sole provider of medical equipment to the hospitals, which meant that there was a prima facie ground for indictment, argued Refalo.
 MaltaToday has previously reported that public funds from the Governments’ public-private partnership with Vitals Global Healthcare (VGH) had been used in the acquisition of medical equipment supplier, Technoline, and that investigators believed that the company which acquired it, Gateway Solutions Ltd was intended to be owned by former OPM chief of staff Keith Schembri and disgraced former minister Konrad Mizzi.
 Auditor Jonathan Vella had, together with fellow auditor Chris Spiteri, created false documentation and made false declarations to a public authority, added the prosecutor.
 The evidence showed that Vella had been in contact with several individuals, including some of the accused in these and connected proceedings, and had been assisting Spiteri in some cases. “He was aware of the crimes and had been assisting their commission,” the prosecutor submitted.
 Taumac Ltd’s lawyer slams ‘dangerous’ prosecution practices
 The court was told today that Taumac had sold its shares in MTrace to the concession - to Vitals Procurement Ltd in Jersey, for the same price that it had acquired them. This fact indicated that Taumac had been holding the shares on behalf of third parties, which was identified as a Jersey-registered company related to Vitals.
 “We have a voluminous inquiry, a detailed report by the inquiring magistrate, detailed reports by the experts in the inquiry. All this had led the inquiring magistrate to say not ‘investigate further,’ but ‘prosecute,’” Refalo said.
 But Taumac's lawyer, Veronique Dalli, condemned what she said was the haste with which the charges had been filed. “Someone abdicated their responsibilities. Had anyone sent for a representative from the company, they would not be here today, but neither the experts, nor the inquiring magistrate had sent for them and strangely neither did the police,” said Dalli. 
 The company was facing a solitary charge: money laundering and the AG had requested a freezing order of €62,500, said the lawyer, questioning how the AG had arrived at this figure. “There is nothing in the evidence about it. Taumac is only mentioned in an expert’s report, stating the dates that it was set up and the dates it was closed. 
 “Had the investigators done their job, they would have sent for Taumac and asked them about this odd-looking transaction, ” said the lawyer.
 “Had anyone bothered to investigate, they would have seen that Malta Enterprise had ordered Taumac to withdraw from the deal.”
 This was because Taumac’s representative had informed Malta Enterprise that the company was being investigated in Italy over illegal dumping of waste, of which it was later acquitted, Dalli said.
 Malta Enterprise had suggested that Taumac transfer its shareholding to another company in order for it to retrieve the sums it had already invested. 
 “There was a simple explanation for the transaction and had the AG done its job properly and bothered to ask Taumac about it, the explanation would have been immediately apparent.”
 Dalli argued that there was “no tangible evidence” against Taumac, which had only been mentioned en passant in the inquiry and had been “completely extraneous” to VGH , having left the project.
 “It is extremely dangerous to press charges in this way,” warned the lawyer. “Did nobody bother to check the company’s accounts on the MBR, order a search at its offices?…I submit that with respect to Taumac, there is no case to answer.”
 The case will continue on June 25.

Police discover drugs at home of suspect linked to cannabis postal deliveries,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/police-discover-drugs-home-suspect-linked-cannabis-postal-deliveries.1096568,08-09-2024,005927.png,"A man allegedly linked to several postal parcels containing some nine kilos of cannabis, was remanded in custody upon arraignment on Friday. 
 Pedro Da Costa Masi, a 29-year-old self-employed Brazilian national from Mellieħa, was arrested on Thursday after police were informed about a man, identifying himself as “Paolo Gonzales,” who called for a parcel at Maltapost offices. 
 Investigators from the drug squad had been following the case ever since a one-kilo package of cannabis grass was discovered at Maltapost head office in Qormi through a random check by customs officials earlier this month.
 That package was addressed to a person at a Pieta’ residence, explained prosecuting Inspector Mark Anthony Mercieca when giving an overview of the events leading up to the accused’s arrest during Friday’s arraignment. 
 Another parcel containing some two kilos of cannabis grass was subsequently tracked down at another courier company by customs officials who noted the suspicious parcel. 
 That parcel was addressed to the same recipient at the same address as the previous package. 
 But when investigators ran a search on the police system, the recipient did not feature at all. His name was not registered and he was linked to no work or residence permit. 
 Moreover, the address on the parcel turned out to be fictitious. 
 On Thursday, police were alerted to a customer who turned up at a postal office to claim the parcel, identifying himself as “Paolo Gonzales.” 
 The suspect was arrested. 
 A search at his Mellieħa home yielded half a kilo of cannabis grass, eight kilos of cannabis resin and some 80 grams of ecstasy. 
 Police also found six cannabis plants, which is over the legal limit. 
 The man, later identified as Da Costa Masi, was charged with involvement in a conspiracy to import, sell or deal in cannabis grass and cannabis resin, possession of both drugs and ecstasy under circumstances denoting that they were not intended for his personal use as well as unlawful cultivation of cannabis. 
 He pleaded not guilty.

Helena Dalli's son spared jail time in appealed drug conviction,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/helena-dalli-son-spared-jail-time-appealed-drug-conviction.1092949,24-05-2024,005950.png,"Jean-Marc Dalli, the younger son of European Commissioner Helena Dalli, has been spared jail time for a drug conviction after an appeals court decided to mitigate his sentence. 
 He was convicted of drug trafficking and sentenced to a three-month effective jail term in prison, eight years after the incident took place. 
 Dalli had appealed the conviction handed down by the Magistrates’ Court over the incident which took place on the night of September 8, 2013. 
 He had been partying with friends at the old prison in Corradino when police monitoring the event spotted the youth handing something over to a male friend from a bag that was in his hand.
 Sensing police presence, the youth, later identified as Dalli, next handed the bag to a female friend as two officers approached.
 That bag contained three pills that were later confirmed to be ecstasy.
 Six more pills were then discovered in the male friend’s pocket.
 When arrested, Dalli told police that he had sourced the drug for his friend who wanted to consume it at the party.
 He reaffirmed that version before the inquiring magistrate saying that he had paid €60 for the pills and recovered the money from his friend.
 It was clear that Dalli made no profit from the deal, observed Madam Justice Edwina Grima who presided over the appeal.
 Although the court agreed with the first court that the prosecution should have produced other witnesses, including the policeman involved in the arrest as well as Dalli’s two friends, the evidence was sufficient to confirm the conviction.
 However, the court upheld the defence’s argument that Dalli deserved to benefit from a legal amendment introduced in 2021 which provided for a mitigation of punishment.
 The Attorney General agreed too.
 And after examining the evidence the court concluded that the facts of the case fell within the parameters of that provision of law.
 The court also took note of a social inquiry report which said that Dalli had a stable life and a job with considerable responsibilities. It also found that he does not have any addiction issues and has since become a father. 
 The probation officer recommended that he ought to continue pursuing this stable life.
 In light of all considerations, the court varied the punishment by suspending the three-month jail term for one year and a fine of €650.

 A magistrate has upheld an application for the holding of a magisterial inquiry into an alleged scam which saw the government's identity agency Identita' issue Maltese ID cards on the basis of forged documents.
 The application was made on July 31 by lawyer Jason Azzopardi who also publicly claimed that some 18,000 ID cards were issued.
 On Tuesday he hailed the magistrate's decision as historic and urged people to come forward with information. 
 ""Everyone has a duty to stand up for what is right, do not let them steal your identity and our dignity,"" Azzopardi said in a Facebook broadcast. 
 The duty magistrate, he said, issued a 17-page decree on Monday, upholding the application. 
 ""This involves the biggest ever corruption scandal in this country by a government agency or department,"" he said.
 It involved corruption and money laundering for the granting of Maltese ID cards to foreigners on the basis of forged documents.
 In his sworn declaration, Azzopardi explained, he had named two persons, Bernard Attard and Maria Spiteri. Spiteri was in the Brexit section of Identita' and Attard collected money - running into several thousand euros each time - from those who received the ID cards.
 The falsified documents included marriage certificates, certificates from UK local councils, and the Malta Business Registry. They were not falsified internally within those organisations but by those involved in the scam. The scam also saw the addresses of many people being stolen. 
 Azzopardi said the authorities, including Police Commissioner Angeo Gafa' had known about this racket from at least October 2022. 
 ""Please understand the moment,"" Azzopardi said. Why had no action been taken about this by the authorities? Was it possibly because a proper investigation would lead right into the Office of the Prime Minister and the Cabinet Office? 
 Azzopardi said the inquiring magistrate had established that there was enough evidence for a magisterial inquiry to be opened. The people mentioned in the application had two days within which to appeal. Should an appeal be made, the criminal court would decide the matter. If matters went ahead, lots would be drawn to designate a magistrate to hold the inquiry. 
 The inquiry will investigate corruption, money laundering, falsification of documents, trading in influence, conspiracy, and membership in a criminal organisation.
 Azzopardi asked why the minister responsible for Identita' - Byron Camilleri - had not spoken up about this scandal.
 ""It is easier to find Casper the friendly ghost than this minister,"" he remarked.
 In comments to Times of Malta later on Tuesday, Camilleri said he  welcomed further scrutiny through an investigation and insisted that the state agency has always done its duty and reported illegalities to the police. 
  Azzopardi said he was being 'bombarded' by people who described how they had been receiving at their addresses correspondence addressed to foreigners they did not know and who had never lived there. 
 People who had received such mail needed to speak to him, or to the magistrate, he said.
 And now was the time for people directly involved in the racket to speak out as whistleblowers, before it became too late for them. If they did not speak up ""I will become your worst nightmare,"" Azzopardi said. 
 As assassinated Italian judge Giovanni Falcone used to say, the mafia could only be destroyed when people spoke up, he stressed.  
 In a reaction, Identita' said it would collaborate in any investigations.
 It said that after an internal investigation by its Compliance Unit it had itself submitted information and evidence about some individuals to the police for further investigation and action if necessary. That investigation was sparked by regular audit procedures within the agency.
 The Compliance Unit investigated any suspicions and people had been sent to prison as a result.
 It also pointed out that over the past few years it improved its governance.

"Christian Borg failed to declare €4.7 million in business incomes, FCID tells court",maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/131252/christian_borgs_companies_failed_to_declare_47_million_earned_since_2015_inspector_tells_court,17-09-2024,005982.png,"Christian Borg and his construction and rental car companies had claimed VAT refunds on invoices, issued at a time when the issuing person had in fact been behind bars, a court was told today. 
 It was just one of a number of astonishing discrepancies discovered during a tax fraud investigation into Borg, his companies and associates, that were detailed in the compilation of evidence against Borg, his girlfriend Monique Mizzi, and company director  Joe Camenzuli on Tuesday.
  Amongst other things, defendants are accused, together with a number of companies, of defrauding “millions” in VAT and other taxes.
 The couple are charged alongside companies Princess Construction, Princess Holdings, Princess Operations, Zing Rental, No Deposit Cars and Lion Funding.
 Borg, 31, and Mizzi, 26, are accused of money laundering and criminal conspiracy. Camenzuli was also in the dock,  in representation of the defendant companies.
 Inspector Robert Azzopardi from the Financial Crimes Investigation Department testified about the multi-pronged investigation into tax evasion, VAT fraud, as well as money laundering. 
 The police investigation revealed that Borg also had business interests and bank accounts abroad in the UK, Germany and Cyprus, as well as cryptocurrency wallets in the British Virgin Islands and Cyprus.
 After the police obtained information from Germany and Cyprus, searches were carried out at the No Deposit Cars showroom in Qawra, Borg’s flat in Swieqi, and properties in Tarxien, Birkirkara.
 Borg’s auditors, Nathaniel Borg and Roderick Galea, told police their professional relationship with Borg started in 2021, and that they had found substantial discrepancies between declared income and actual income and assets. They required Borg to settle the issue before taking up the brief, upon which Borg sent them a volume of documents – mostly invoices for car rentals over the years – to allow them to compute the income and settle the tax dues.
 Since 2015, the figure for undeclared total income stood at €4.7 million, the inspector said, exhibiting a digital copy of the audit data in court. 
 Police inquiries with counterparts overseas also revealed that Borg had bought a €710,000 yacht in the UK, where three other companies were registered in Borg’s name.
 The second prong of the investigation was into VAT fraud, suspecting Borg that he was claiming VAT refunds for expenses which were either inflated or fabricated altogether. The claims were made on repairs and spray jobs for cars and for renovation works at properties which Borg or the companies had bought or leased.
 The VAT department noticed that all the vehicle repair invoices were issued by the same supplier, mechanic Anthony Balzan. But some invoices had been issued at a time when Balzan was in prison, and could not have possibly provided the services claimed.
  In addition, one company – Stronghold Construction – had somehow issued four VAT receipts before it had even been assigned a VAT number. “Stronghold had just two employees and at a time when his business was apparently flourishing, Balzan had just one who, Jobsplus records show, had been made redundant due to lack of business.” Some had no employees at all.
 The €1 million in expenses that had been declared by Borg and his companies for the purposes of VAT refunds, implied that Stronghold should have shown at least €1 million in declared income, but the court was told that this was not the case.
 The court was told that Borg and his companies had even claimed VAT refunds on simultaneous, but mutually-exclusive, works, such as excavation and construction works at the same site.
 Inspector Azzopardi testified that invoices which had been issued by mechanic Anthony Balzan had raised suspicions due to their generic, repetitive description and the fact that they specified dates that were “so close to each other that it was impossible for the work to have been done in that time.” Some invoices lacked even the number plate of the vehicle allegedly serviced.
 In connection with his planning application for a subterranean car-wash, Borg had claimed €80,000 for garage doors, “when there was no garage there,” said the inspector, going on to list other fictitious claims: VAT claimed on air-conditioning units which weren’t there and on similarly phantom furnishings.
 The Luqa car-wash turned out to be “literally just a yard, small office and a toilet and a tent at the back to wash cars” and did not reflect the construction work described in the invoices.
 “The more the VAT department looked, the more discrepancies they found,” he said.
 The compilation of evidence will continue in October.
 The defendants are being assisted by lawyers Stephen Tonna Lowell, Albert Zerafa, and Ana Thomas. 
 Police Inspectors Tomjoe Farrugia and Robert Azzopardi are prosecuting, together with lawyers Francesco Refalo, Rebekah Spiteri and Mauro Abela from the Office of the Attorney General.  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police
Updated | Attorney General denies Repubblika access to Vitals magisterial inquiry,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/129024/repubblika_demands_access_to_vitals_magisterial_inquiry_in_letter_to_courts1,06-05-2024,005996.png,"The Attorney General will not provide a copy of the magisterial inquiry report into the privatisation of state hospitals to the anti-corruption NGO Repubblika, the same organisation said on Monday.
 Repubblika had requested that the Attorney General passes on the full magisterial inquiry report into the privatisation of state hospitals that was recently concluded by Magistrate Gabriella Vella.
 However, the organisation has revealed that the Attorney General will not provide this report to Repubblika as criminal proceedings will be filed in relation to the investigation. 
  ""We also note that the Prime Minister and Justice Minister were provided a copy. This is unacceptable and we will continue insisting on a full copy.""
 The inquiry has caused a storm inside Labour, where the criminal inquiry – the report of which was filed by Repubblika back in 2019 – could sell serious charges for former prime minister Joseph Muscat as well as former minister Konrad Mizzi, as stewards of the privatisation of three hospitals to the unknown medical consortium Vitals. A slew of other charges could affect other former and sitting ministers.
 Repubblika has filed a written request to the AG on Monday to supply the NGO with a copy of the inquiry report.
 No acknowledgement to two such requests was received by Repubblika, so the NGO proceeded with an official letter to the Courts.
 “We believe such a refusal goes against the provisions of the Constitution as well as the European Convention for Human Rights,” Repubblika said.  ",Matthew Vella / Nicole Meilak ,court_and_police
Chris Cardona did not read memorandum with Vitals investors before signing it in 2015,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/130822/joseph_muscat_and_others_back_in_court_over_vitals_hospitals_scandal,21-08-2024,006001.png,"Former economy minister Chris Cardona has told a court that he had only read the Memorandum of Understanding between the Government and the investors in the hospitals deal after being called to give evidence before the National Audit Office.
 Cardona, a lawyer, testified in the case against former Prime Minister Joseph Muscat, his Minister Konrad Mizzi, and Chief of Staff Keith Schembri, among 14 individuals and 9 companies accused of crimes including money laundering, fraud, conspiracy, and involvement in a criminal organisation.
  In addition to the money laundering, fraud and conspiracy charges, Muscat and Mizzi are charged with having accepted bribes and corruption in public office, while Schembri stands accused of offences relating to the solicitation of bribes and abuse of his office to exact an unlawful advantage.
 ‘They asked me to sign it and I signed it’ - Cardona
 In his 30 minutes on the witness stand, Cardona attempted to distance himself from the Memorandum of Understanding which he had signed in his ministerial capacity. 
 He told the court that he had not read the document before signing it and had only done so in preparation for his testimony before the National Audit Office.  When asked by both the prosecution and the court why he had signed it, Cardona first replied that he had done so because he had been asked to. “I was the minister responsible for Malta Enterprise. They asked me to sign it and I signed it.”
 But Cardona’s explanation changed later in his testimony, after he attempted to downplay the MoU’s importance by saying that the government had subsequently withdrawn from the agreement.
 “Why was it signed, then?” asked the Magistrate.
 “To see whether it could provide this kind of deliverables.” Cardona replied.
 Although the former minister was unable to recall who had been present for the signing, he told the court that he believed it had been signed at the Auberge de Castille, home to the Office of the Prime Minister.  “I believe that there were no other officials bar Malta Enterprise officials,” he added moments later. Asked whether a representative from the OPM had been present, Cardona said he did not remember, but was more certain that Muscat had not been present, when asked directly about this by the court. “Madame, if he had, I think I would remember it,” said the former minister.
 During cross-examination by one of Muscat’s lawyers, Cardona said that he had not seen anything that stood out or that he was unhappy with in the MoU. “Absolutely not.”
 The witness also stated that he had never been pressured into signing the MoU “by Muscat or anyone else.”
 He insisted that the MoU had fallen through because it “did not specifically address the government’s plan to modernise the health sector,” leading the magistrate to ask him once again why it had been signed in the first place. Cardona replied that an MoU is “a preliminary non-binding agreement to test the waters, to see the deliverables, whether there is a business plan that compliments the Government’s plan.”
 PwC saw no red flags
 Also testifying today were several senior figures from PriceWaterhouseCoopers, which had been approached by Singapore-based company Bluestone Special Situation in October 2014 to assist in the preparation of a business plan to be pitched to the Maltese government.
 They confirmed that the ultimate beneficial owner (UBO) of Bluestone was Mark Pawley and that the designated point of contact for the project was Ram Tumuluri.
 Initially PwC had been engaged to advise on a planned project involving the Gozo hospital. A second engagement came later, this time to assist Bluestone prepare its submissions for the Request for Proposals (RfP).
 The RfP was not limited to Gozo and was completely separate to the Gozo project, the court was told.
 Michel Ganado, a management consultant at PwC, was also asked by the defence whether the firm had noticed any “red flags.”  “At the time, no,” Ganado replied.
 He explained that Bluestone was an investment company and that VGH had been incorporated into the Bluestone structure further down the line. “Bluestone Special Situation was the Ultimate Beneficial Owner (UBO) of VGH,” he told the court.

Stagno Navarra offers to drop assault case in dispute over unsettled debt,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/stagno-navarra-offers-drop-assault-case-dispute-unsettled-debt.1098529,25-09-2024,006032.png,"Broadcaster Karl Stagno Navarra on Wednesday offered to drop a court case against a man who allegedly assaulted him in a dispute over an unsettled debt.
 Jean Pierre Schembri, a 47-year-old maintenance worker from Żebbuġ, was taken to court earlier this month and accused of having harassed, violently insulted and threatened Stagno Navarra. 
 The broadcaster said the harassment had included threatening messages and calls, with the matter culminating when he was assaulted in his own home.
 The dispute stemmed from the sale of a car by Schembri to Stagno Navarra in a part exchange agreement.  Schembri claims Stagno Navarra had stopped making payments, despite his persistent efforts.
 Schembri was initially refused bail. 
 When the case continued on Wednesday, the broadcaster's lawyer, Franco Debono, informed the court that his client wished to drop charges as long as the violent episode did not repeat itself. 
 The TV host wanted to live his life in peace and did not want to face further harassment, he said. And if Schembri had any expectations against him, he should seek legal advice and resort to lawful measures.
 Schembri’s lawyer, Lennox Vella, informed the court that the accused had since the arraignment been suspended from his job as a public worker. 
 In light of that information, Debono said that the court might set the next hearing at a close date. 
 Magistrate Giannella Camilleri Busuttil observed that some of the charges were prosecutable ex-officio by the police and thus could not be dropped.  But other charges could be withdrawn at the victim’s request. 
 The parties agreed to thrash out the matter and the way forward at the next sitting in October. 
 The case was deferred to next month.
 Lawyer Marion Camilleri also represented Stagno Navarra.

Lilu King in trouble again after fight with motorist,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/lilu-king-trouble-fight-motorist.1096514,08-09-2024,006034.png,"'Lilu King' is expected to be charged in court later after he was involved in a fight with a motorist on Thursday night, just five months after being granted bail. 
 Mohamed Ali Ahmed Elmushraty, the Paceville entrepreneur and social media 'influencer' who loves flaunting his wealth on social media, beat up a driver following a car crash in St Julian's, sources said.
 The incident happened after curfew hours, which means the Libyan national could be facing serious repercussions, the sources added.  
 Lilu King was arrested and charged last year alongside two other suspects over his alleged involvement in an organised crime group linked to drug trafficking and money laundering.
 It is the second time he has been in trouble since he was given bail last March. In June, he was ordered to pay €10,000 but did not lose his personal liberty after admitting to an early morning argument with police during a boxing match at Ta’ Qali.

Daniel Meli denied bail in fresh attempt to fight extradition to the US,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/daniel-meli-denied-bail-fresh-attempt-fight-extradition-us.1101237,19-11-2024,006047.png,"Extradition proceedings against a young man wanted in the United States to face charges of selling illegal malware on the dark web started again on Tuesday afternoon.
 Daniel Joe Meli, a 28-year-old check-in agent is being sought by the US authorities for his alleged illegal dealings on the dark web between December 2012 and June 2022. 
 He is contesting his extradition.
 Magistrate Leonard Caruana presided over the rehearing of the extradition proceedings after previous proceedings were declared null following a legal battle that dragged on since February this year – when he first appeared in court over the case.
 He has been in preventative custody since then.
 After hearing a fresh case for bail on Tuesday, Caruana denied the request, meaning Meli is set to remain in custody. 
 The case had to start from scratch after, earlier this month, Meli was handed a lifeline when a judge ruled that he could have a fresh court hearing thanks to legislation rushed through parliament last month. 
 When first arraigned in February this year, he consented to extradition. 
 Subsequent to his arraignment, assisted by new lawyers, he appealed, arguing that the first court should have assured itself that he was in a sufficiently sound state of mind when consenting to extradition.
 That appeal was dismissed and Meli then filed constitutional proceedings. 
 His lawyers summoned a long line of medical professionals who described Meli as “very bright” but suffering from “great social anxiety” and “very low self-esteem.” His psychological problems became worse when he was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis. 
 They argued that his right to a fair hearing was breached because the court of appeal did not assess fresh evidence which would have shed light on his mental state when consenting to the extradition.
 Meli lost the constitutional case in July and was held in custody pending his extradition.
 But in August the government announced it was drafting legislation that would allow him to contest his extradition once more.  
 The law came before parliament as soon as MPs returned from the summer break, and passed through all stages unopposed, with the Opposition having backed it.
 The law introduced procedural safeguards allowing a wanted person “adequate time” to reflect before deciding whether to accept being extradited to face trial in a foreign country. 
 It also provided that any person awaiting extradition from Malta at the time of the coming into force of the law after having declared that he was willing to be extradited may file an application before the Court of Criminal Appeal to request recommittal to the court to declare once more whether he was still willing to be extradited.
 Meli's lawyers immediately filed an application in terms of the newly amended law and Mr Justice Camilleri on Tuesday quashed the court's previous extradition decision and ordered a rehearing.
 Lawyers Franco Debono and Arthur Azzopardi are representing Meli.
 Police Inspector Mario Cuschieri and lawyers Sean Scerri de Carlo and Daphne Baldacchino from the Attorney General’s office are prosecuting.

 The prosecution objected to a request for bail as there was a fear that he could tamper with evidence, given that his wife, the alleged victim, is still to testify.
 Defence lawyer Silvan Pulis told the court that the man’s children were willing to provide him with an alternative residence in Safi, which was far away enough from the couple’s home.

 Magistrate Lara Lanfranco heard how the woman told police that her ex-partner threatened he would “slit her open, from her private parts to her mouth, with a penknife” and kill their child unless he was allowed to remain in their life.
 The man, a 31-year-old from Cospicua, pleaded not guilty to threatening and slightly injuring the woman, causing her to fear for her life and that of her child, and breaching bail conditions.
 Police Inspector Christian Cauchi said that on Thursday police received an email that was sent to Home Affairs Minister Byron Camilleri. The email claimed that a woman was being beaten up and police were not doing anything. 
 Police contacted the woman and called her to the domestic violence unit where she filed a report against her ex-partner. 
 She said they had been together for about two-and-a-half years and had a seven-month son. Their relationship was tumultuous.
 She said that in June they had an argument in her Cospicua home and he punched her in her left eye.
 She went to the health centre where a doctor certified that she had slight injuries.
 She claimed that the accused destroyed the certificate when he went to her home again sometime after. The inspector called the doctor who confirmed the eye injuries since the medical certificate could not be found.
 The woman also claimed that on July 28, her ex went to her home and insisted that he wanted to remain involved in their son’s life.
 “She said that he told her he would slit her open, from her private parts till her mouth, with a penknife and that he would kill the boy if he could not enjoy being with him,” the inspector said.
 The inspector said that the man was arrested and denied the allegations saying that his partner was still in touch with him via email. He said she sent him chats with other men to tease and provoke him. The inspector added that the accused was currently out on bail and had been given a three-year probation on similar cases.
 Magistrate Lanfranco granted him bail on the condition that he does not approach his ex-partner and the child and was bound by a deposit of €1,000 and a personal guarantee of €5,000.
 The court issued a protection order prohibiting him from going anywhere near the woman and baby.

PM schedules meeting with Nicolette Ghirxi's family after initial refusal,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/pm-declines-meet-nicolette-ghirxi-family.1098422,23-09-2024,006122.png,"Updated 3.55pm
 The prime minister has scheduled a meeting with the family of murder victim Nicolette Ghirxi, the government said on Monday afternoon, hours after Times of Malta revealed that a meeting request had been declined.
 Ghirxi was murdered in her Swatar apartment on August 11, allegedly by her former boyfriend Edward Johnston, who was later shot dead by the police in St Julian's after a three-hour standoff.
 Ghirxi's family has complained of failures by government agencies in the run-up to the murder and has called for an independent public inquiry. Family lawyer Joseph Borda revealed that a request to meet Robert Abela had been turned down. 
 Speaking to Times of Malta earlier on Monday , Borda said that talks between the government and the family had stalled and were “at breaking point”.
 He said that after a brief virtual exchange a few weeks ago, the prime minister directed him to three ministers. 
 Nicolette’s father Manuel and her three siblings John, Susan and Daren, accompanied by their lawyers, met ministers Michael Falzon, Jonathan Borg and Byron Camilleri on September 2.
 During that meeting, the family explained the need for an open and transparent inquiry, while the government hinted it was ready for the terms of reference to be drafted in agreement with the family, Borda said.
 
 “But it turned out that the government wanted to restrict the inquiry to the services offered to Nicolette by the government's Foundation for Social Welfare. The family wanted broader terms of reference,” he continued.
 “A few days later, the government’s legal counsel suggested an inquiry led by the justice ministry in conjunction with the social policy ministry. But an inquiry that would be other than all-encompassing would be totally useless,” the lawyer insisted.
 Borda said he could understand why, with domestic violence being a top priority matter, the government had proposed compartmentalised internal inquiries behind closed doors.
  “It is crystal clear that the government’s intention is to sweep the murder and any of the state’s failings under the carpet. The Ghirxi family have now had enough and are determined to uncover the truth,” the lawyer said.
 In reply to questions, the Office of the Prime Minister said: “The government reaffirms its commitment to the victim’s family and its dedication to providing them with the answers they seek.”
 It said that while talks with the victim’s family are ongoing, three inquiries were underway regarding this murder: the magisterial inquiry, an internal inquiry by the Ministry for Home Affairs, and another inquiry by the Ministry for Social Policy.
 “The government believes that the discussions should remain confidential, not only to avoid prejudicing the ongoing inquiries but also out of respect for the victim and the victim’s family.”
 Nicolette Ghirxi had first filed a domestic violence report against Johnston on April 22.  The day after her murder, on August 12, police commissioner Angelo Gafà went on record saying that Ghirxi had refused to take a risk assessment.
 A few days later, e-mail exchanges surfaced showing Johnston had mocked the police when they summoned him for questioning, telling them he was “topping up” his tan in Dubai.
 The Ghirxi family is insisting on an independent inquiry since it believes that the police failed to protect Nicolette by failing to act on the harassment reports, even when she informed them that Johnston had returned to Malta.
 On August 19, the OPM announced that the Independent Police Complaints Board had been tasked to review police conduct.
 On August 25, Times of Malta published the transcript of a WhatsApp voice note sent by Ghirxi to her friend stating she had been “talked out” of taking a risk assessment as she sat down for her evaluation to begin.
 FSWS denied its  Aġenzija Appoġġ professionals had discouraged her from taking a risk assessment and published affidavits and the names of the two risk assessors present on the day Ghirxi filed a report.
 On August 27, the social policy ministry announced it had set up an inquiry board under the Inquiries Act, led by Judge Lawrence Quintano, to investigate the professional support the victim had received. But the family and her friends kept pushing for an independent inquiry, with a broader remit “to establish the facts leading to Nicolette’s tragic death”.
 The family wants to be involved in the drafting of the terms of reference to establish all the circumstances that led to Nicolette’s murder: whether any act or omission by any state entity facilitated her killing or failed to prevent it. The family is also represented by Matthew Xuereb.
 'PM ignoring Ghirxi family like he ignored Sofia family': PN
 Reacting before the government's statement, the PN said the prime minister was once again ignoring a family going through a difficult time, just as he had done with Isabelle Bonnici after the death of her son Jean Paul Sofia.
 ""Robert Abela has learned nothing from his past mistakes and is now refusing to meet the family of Nicolette Ghirxi. To him, people are just numbers.
 ""While once again displaying his utter insensitivity to the suffering endured by the family of a victim who lost her life in a tragic manner, Abela refuses to even appoint a public and independent inquiry in this case, which is the family's wish,"" the party said in a statement. 
 PN Leader Bernard Grech has meanwhile met the Ghirxi family.
 The PN supports its request for a public and independent inquiry to uncover the whole truth in this case and will offer its full support to the family.
 ""Nicolette Ghirxi's family has the right to know the reasons and circumstances that led to the failure of our country’s institutions in fulfilling their positive obligation to protect Nicolette Ghirxi's life.
 ""In contrast, Abela is showing insensitivity and weakness in how he deals with others, just as he did in the case of Jean Paul Sofia, where he told his mother, Isabelle, that she was being used over the death of her son. Even then, he refused to accept the family’s request for a public inquiry until he was backed into a corner and had no choice but to make a U-turn.""

 The victim told police she was ambushed by five individuals, including the schoolmate who had previously bullied her.

                     According to her testimony, the 13-year-old tried to stab her three times with a penknife, while Dalli Balzan punched her head and kicked her in the stomach, while another girl allegedly kicked her.

 A passer-by found the girl lying on the ground in severe pain and called the police. The victim was rushed to Mater Dei Hospital, where she recounted the attack, identifying her attackers by voice and a tattoo on Dalli Balzan's hand.

 The victim claimed that her 13-year-old assailant had been bullying and extorting her at school, after the alleged victim had been offered cocaine. The court heard that the girl had been coerced into giving €800 over several months, money taken from her father. 

 Screenshots of threatening messages were presented in court, including one where the 13-year-old bully demanded €200 and threatened to stab the victim if she refused.

 CCTV footage from a Fgura shop suggested Dalli Balzan was in Fgura, not Mqabba, at the time of the attack. He was seen cycling to the shop at 3:21pm, six minutes before the alleged attack. Dalli Balzan claimed he was in his Fgura garage with his girlfriend and cousin that afternoon. 

 The 13-year-old also denied being in Mqabba, asserting she was in Fgura but could not recall the exact location.

 The victim also mentioned an earlier encounter in an alley where a masked man threatened her with a gun, demanding money. This part of her account was not initially disclosed to her parents due to fear. Police investigations into this claim are ongoing.

 Prosecutors presented evidence, including CCTV footage and testimonies, while defense lawyers questioned the timeline and credibility of the victim's account. Investigations continue as not all alleged assailants have been identified or charged.     ",Matthew Farrugia ,court_and_police
Agreements signed to soften conditions for Vitals - auditor in damning testimony,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/agreements-signed-soften-conditions-vitals-auditor-damning-testimony.1096503,08-08-2024,006136.png,"Agreements signed by the government with Vitals throughout the hospitals' service concession were often changed to “soften the conditions” for the concessionaire, the court heard on Thursday. 
 “We felt that every addendum went against government interests,” said Charles Deguara who was called to testify on Thursday in the money laundering proceedings against Joseph Muscat, Keith Schembri, Konrad Mizzi and other people who are linked to the fraudulent privatisation deal struck down last year by the courts. 
 The Auditor General testified at length about three reports, which his team of investigators had worked on after receiving a formal request by parliament’s Public Accounts Committee and a later request by former health minister Chris Fearne. 
 The first report focused on the tendering process, the request for proposals and the bids leading up to Vitals Global Health Care clinching of the deal for the three government hospitals. 
 The auditor general’s office focuses on issues of good governance.
 And right from the start, there were red signs for the office. 
 One of the issues that “worried most” the investigators was the fact that a memorandum of understanding was signed some five or six months before the request for proposals was published. 
 That ran counter to public procurement regulations which are the “Bible” for good governance, said Deguara. 
 There were media reports about that MoU yet when the NAO asked Malta Enterprise for a copy, they were told it could not be found. 
 They then asked the Office of the Prime Minister and were met with the same reply. 
 Some two weeks after the auditor’s office had published its first report, news came from OPM informing that the MoU had been found. 
 A copy was sent to the Auditor General and a report about it was published as an addendum to his audit report on the hospitals deal. 
 But that MoU was just one of many shortcomings as far as good governance was concerned. 
 The project was handled by then-Energy and Health Minister Konrad Mizzi.  However, most of the input came from the energy side. Health was not involved in the project that was essentially health-related, observed Deguara. 
 “We concluded that health should have been given a more active role and consulted more” on the “the biggest” project undertaken by the government. 
 Vitals' bid “should not have been accepted” Deguara said, adding that “it was too ambitious.
 Vitals could never keep those timelines, they had no experience in running hospitals and never set up medical tourism which was one of the reasons why they did not invest in the project. 
 The feasibility study was also inadequate.
 A project of such magnitude which, if it were to continue was estimated to cost some €4 billion, called for “a much more robust feasibility study.” 
 When granting the concession, the government reserved an option to grant an extension for 69 years. 
 Vitals took that option as a fact when making their financial workings, taking it for granted that they would get the extension “automatically”.
 Risks and rewards ought to have been apportioned between the government and the concessionaire. 
 However, the auditor noted that the “government continued to bear the risks while Vitals got advantageous conditions.” 
 He said: “It was unfair on the government.” 
 Signed agreements between the government and the concessionaire were often subsequently altered, “sometimes within a matter of days,” in such manner as to “soften conditions” for Vitals.
 “That was something we didn’t like at all as far as good governance was concerned,” said Deguara. 
 One addendum the auditor felt was “totally against government interests” meant that the government “lost much of its power” in enforcing milestones on the concession. 
 That addendum meant the government “lost its strength in keeping the concessionaire accountable”.
 Vitals also did not file any audited accounts during the first four years of the concession. 
 Accounts by an independent auditor were presented later “making obvious Vitals' financial difficulties.” 
 The auditor who signed them off made a written note, voicing doubt whether the concessionaire could move forward. 
 There were “great issues,” said Deguara. 
 “What could the government do once those financial statements were not published?” asked Attorney General lawyer Rebekah Spiteri. 
 “It could impose sanctions… but I cannot answer why it didn’t. For some reason the government decided to stay put,” replied Deguara. 
 His office also flagged concerns about the manner in which the takeover by Steward from Vitals was handled.
 The move was authorised by Mizzi as then Tourism Minister.
 “But we were given no documentation as to how these contacts happened… How did Steward enter the scene?”
 Government representatives told the auditor general’s team that it was Steward which approached the government first. 
 “But we got conflicting versions.”
 It was a “hasty” process and the auditor’s office could not understand the need for “such urgency.” 
 Yet when they commented about the haste, they “got no reply.” 
 The case continues later this month.

"Wasteserv officials deny involuntary homicide, negligence charges over 2022 fatality",maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/130491/wasteserv_ceo_and_five_officials_to_be_charged_over_2022_fatality,30-07-2024,006140.png,"Updated at 12:50pm with court sitting details
 Wasteserv CEO Richard Bilocca and five other officials have denied accusations of criminal responsibility for a fatal incident at the company’s incinerator in Marsa, two years ago.
 Bilocca, 39, from Zurrieq was charged by summons -and not under arrest-  before magistrate Gabriella Vella on Tuesday, together with Health and Safety Manager Stefan Salamone, 42,  35-year-old engineer Ryan Mark Cachia from Tarxien, facility manager Ryan Cauchi, 32, from Mosta and Health and Safety Officers Silvan Borg, 51, from Marsaskala and Aylin Fleri, 32, from Valletta.
  All of the defendants entered not guilty pleas.
 The charges, which include involuntary homicide, relate to an incident at the Marsa Thermal Treatment Facility on May 10, 2022 that caused the death of 38 year-old Joseph Ellul from Marsaxlokk. Ellul had been found, dead, beside an elevator at the facility, with lacerations to his throat.
 A magisterial inquiry into the fatal incident had highlighted significant safety failings, amongst them the lack of safety features on the hatch to the lift where the incident occurred. Court experts appointed during the inquiry had established that Ellul died while attempting to inspect malfunctioning equipment by putting his head through the inspection hatch.
 In addition to the involuntary homicide charges, Cachia, Cauchi, and Bilocca are also charged with refusing or failing to take the necessary precautions to prevent this type of incident from happening.

 When the arraignment began, the court noted that an application had been filed by the defence, in which it was objecting to the appointment of one of the inquiry experts.
 The magistrate gave the prosecution until 15 September to acquaint themselves with the request and file their reply.
 The case was adjourned to 3 October.

Man admits to grievously injuring rival in Paceville argument over girl's attention,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/131001/man_admits_to_grievously_injuring_rival_in_paceville_argument_over_girls_attention,02-09-2024,006147.png,"An argument over a girl in Paceville sparked a vicious assault that resulted in one man receiving a suspended sentence on Monday after he admitted to related charges.
 Police Inspector Eman Hayman and prosecutor Julian Scicluna arraigned 21-year-old Iverson Pierre Daniel, a construction worker from the Dominican Republic, under arrest before magistrate Nadia Helena Vella.
 Inspector Hayman explained that at 4:00am during the night between Saturday 31 August and Sunday 1 September police officers in Paceville were approached by both parties, and told that they had been involved in a fight in the St Rita’s steps area. “The victim was unable to move his shoulder and was bleeding profusely from the nose,” the inspector told the court.
 An ambulance arrived after the police cleared the area of members of the public. It emerged that the fight had followed an argument about a girl, said the inspector.
 The defendant, who did not appear to have been injured, was taken to the police station, where it was explained to him that he was under arrest. 
 The victim’s injuries were certified to be grievous. 
 The entire incident had been captured on CCTV, added the inspector. The footage showed a group of Italian youths apparently being spoken to by the defendant. Although the interaction appeared to be good-natured initially, Inspector Hayman explained that at one point, the defendant is seen to react as if shocked at something that was said and then punching one of the men, before turning towards the victim and savagely attacking him, delivering repeated blows to his face and torso.
 Exactly what had been said remains unclear, added the inspector, but said that Iverson told the police that he had been insulted. Before the incident, he had been flirting with a girl, but the group of other men had then captured her attention.
 Iverson pleaded guilty to the charges and confirmed his admission of guilt after being given time to reconsider.
 When discussing punishment, both prosecution and defence submitted that a custodial sentence was “not ideal in this case.” 
 The court declared the man guilty, and sentenced him to imprisonment for one year, which was suspended for two years.

Melvin Theuma's evidence in phantom jobs case declared inadmissable,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/melvin-theuma-evidence-phantom-jobs-case-declared-inadmissable.1101200,18-11-2024,006148.png,"Melvin Theuma’s refusal to face cross-examination in a case concerning a phantom job means that all his testimony linked to that case has been declared inadmissable. 
 The court decision stemmed from a request filed by lawyers for Keith Schembri, Yorgen Fenech and three other individuals facing criminal prosecution over their alleged involvement in giving Theuma, who has confessed to being the middleman in the plot to murder journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, a phantom job.
 Theuma had testified in separate proceedings about how he had been given a government job five months before the journalist’s assassination. He had then been invited to an audience with Schembri, the former OPM chief of staff, at Castille.
 Based on those claims, police pressed charges against Schembri as well as Fenech, now-awaiting trial as alleged accomplice in the murder, former head of customer care at OPM Sandro Craus, ex-family ministry private secretary Anthony Mario Ellul and former CEO of state-owned Housing Maintenance and Embellishment Co Ltd, Anthony Muscat.
 All five are pleading not guilty to theft and misappropriation of public funds.
 When summoned as a witness in the proceedings, Theuma refused to face cross-examination by the defendants’ lawyers.
 He declined to answer any questions after he was cautioned by the court about his right not to answer any self-incriminating questions.
 At that stage, doubts arose as to whether he was covered by a presidential pardon he was granted in connection with the Caruana Galizia murder case.
 The situation persisted when Theuma was summoned back to the witness stand on other occasions, with the latest being in May last year.
 His lawyer informed the court that at that stage, Theuma would not be testifying so as to avoid self-incrimination.
 All questions put to him by the defence from then on were met with the standard reply, “I choose not to answer.”
 Following that unfruitful testimony, the defendants’ lawyers jointly requested that Theuma’s previous testimony, including that at the magisterial inquiry, was  to be expunged (physically removed from the records of the case) since it had not been checked through cross-examination.
 On that occasion, prosecuting Inspector Nicholas Vella objected to have that testimony “expunged” but agreed with the defence that it was to be discarded in evidence.
 The court, presided over by magistrate Monica Vella, has now delivered a lengthy and detailed decree concluding that by refusing to face cross-examination, Theuma went against various legal principles, leaving the court with no alternative but to uphold the defence’s call for his testimony to be removed.
 Theuma continued to refuse to testify even when the prosecution stated in open court that there was no plan to press criminal charges against him in relation to the phantom job.
 There was no doubt that Theuma was not considered as a suspect and to date there appeared to have been no action against him, observed the court. Thus his refusal to testify was legally unfounded.
 Delving into EU and local jurisprudence, Magistrate Vella declared that cross-examination was always a “sacrosanct right” of the defendant.
 Theuma had a duty to testify, observed the court, noting further that his lawyer ought to have explained to the witness that there was no cause for him not to testify.
 Prosecutors had also stated that their superiors had assured them that Theuma’s presidential pardon extended to this case.
 They had, however, failed to present a copy of the pardon despite repeated requests by the defence. When asked whether he had seen the document, prosecuting Inspector Nicholas Vella first said that he never did and acted “on the instructions of his superiors.”
 Pressed further by the defence and the court, he said, “I saw the pardon…No I don’t have access to it.”
 To date, Theuma’s status in these proceedings remained unknown, remarked the court.
 Both the defence and the court had no clue as to whether Theuma was covered by the pardon and thus immune to criminal action over the phantom job.
 Theuma had “no reason to choose not to testify under cross-examination and the fact that he did so probably also breached the conditions of the pardon,” went on the court.
 The prosecution “was and is to take note of this and take all necessary steps it deemed adequate and opportune.”
 Since the court could not verify whether Theuma was covered by the pardon, any doubt went in favour of the accused.
 Theuma’s refusal went against various legal principles including the defence’s right to cross-examination, equality of arms and full disclosure.
 In light of such considerations the court had no alternative but to uphold the defendants’ request, declaring Theuma’s testimony as inadmissible.
 The court ordered the removal of this testimony from the records of the case, including the records of the magisterial inquiry which formed part of the documents exhibited in evidence.

 In a statement, the police said that they received an anonymous tip regarding the suspect’s TikTok account. He was allegedly selling fake luxury watches and only accepted cash payments, as police say that this was an attempt to launder money. 

                     The man was also allegedly advertising sirens and beacon lights for private vehicles. 

 Following a surveillance operation, the man was allegedly found to be driving a vehicle fitted with beacon lights and a siren that were switched on, as the vehicle was also found to be unregistered and without the proper license. 

 Police searched the man’s home, where they found a number of fake watches, bags, and jewellery. They also seized pepper spray ready to be sold as well as cash. 

 The seizure further included cloned cards used for credit card fraud. The police’s investigation also allegedly found that the suspect was advertising counterfeit cash, and would be paid for such products in cryptocurrency. 

 Police said that their investigations uncovered a business on the darkweb, where illegal substances would be sold from China and would then be shipped to be sold in another country.

Police commissioner: ‘We had no visibility of Vitals magisterial inquiry’,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/129908/police_commissioner_we_had_no_visibility_on_vitals_magisterial_inquiry_,25-06-2024,"006155.png,006156.png","Police Commissioner Angelo Gafà has insisted in court that the police were kept in the dark throughout the magisterial inquiry into the hospitals concession to Vitals Global Healthcare. 
 Gafà took the witness stand before Mr. Justice GIovanni Grixti on Tuesday, as the human rights case filed by former Prime Minister Joseph Muscat continued. 
 The disgraced former prime minister, who stands accused of corruption in the Vitals hospitals PPP, had unsuccessfully sought to have the inquiring magistrate Gabriella Vella replaced, and is now claiming to have suffered a breach of his right to a fair trial. 
  Muscat’s lawyer Charlon Gouder asked Gafà about a Facebook post by Repubblika lawyer Jason Azzopardi – referring to a search at Muscat’s house – and whether the post had been investigated, as it implied that the information had been leaked to Azzopardi. 
 Gafà replied that he knew of no such investigation. 
 Superintendent James Grech also testified on Tuesday, explaining how the search at Muscat’s residence had been planned for Monday, 17 January 2022, but the day before it was due to happen, Repubblika’s lawyer, Jason Azzopardi, had published a post on Facebook that seemed to indicate foreknowledge on his part. “The post was ambiguous, it wasn’t clear, but he had said something to the effect that the reason behind [the post] would become clearer soon.” 
 The timing of the post led the police to suspect that he was referring to the inquiry-related raid. 
 The inquiring magistrate spoken to Grech after court expert Keith Cutajar informed her that he was being “bombarded” with phone calls from Azzopardi.  
 A conference call was held with the magistrate and the Commissioner of Police. “The magistrate was very frustrated, as were we. Then we had to find another date for the plan.” 
 A meeting aimed at containing the damage caused to the inquiry by the leak, was held on that Sunday afternoon. 
 Referring to the search of Joseph Muscat’s private residence in 2023, commissioner Gafà was unable to state to whom the order for the search was made. “I don’t know but there was a plan drawn up.” the Commissioner replied when asked about it. “Every time the magistrate asked us to carry out searches, we would ask that the request be made in the form of an application.” 
 Simultaneous searches necessarily required coordination between several officers, he said in reply to another question, as Muscat’s lawyer attempted to whittle down the number of possible culprits behind the leak, by asking about who would have known about the search in advance. 
  Gafà said Muscat’s case was one of many cases discussed in a monthly briefing at the FCID, initially held with former deputy commissioner Alexandra Mamo, and after she left the police force, with Superintendents James Grech and Sandro Camilleri. More recently, Deputy Commissioner Sandro Gatt and Assistant Commissioner Fabian Fleri would attend the meetings. 
 Gafà also told Muscat’s other lawyer, Vince Galea, that he had discussed the possible leak of information regarding the searches that were due to happen at Muscat’s house, with Mamo, Grech, inspector Anthony Xerri, court expert Keith Cutajar and the inquiring magistrate. He insisted that he did not remember what was said in that meeting other than that the date of the search had to be pushed back. “We were all concerned, your honour,” Gafà told the judge. “After this alleged post, we made other arrangements…” 
  No visibility of magisterial inquiry 
 Gafà said his office would constantly ask for information because it had no visibility over the Gabriella Vella inquiry. “Neither what the experts were saying, nor who was testifying.” 
 Gafà said that on 8 May, 2023, he requested from the magistrate a list of the experts she had nominated in the inquiry and asked that they communicate with the police. He said it appeared that the magistrate had upheld the application the next day, but that neither Inspector Borg nor Superintendent Grech had received word. 
 When asked why the police hadn’t investigated the Vitals case in parallell to the Vella magisterial inquiry, Gafà referred to the court application filed by the NGO Repubblika on 11 May 2023, in which it asked the inquiring magistrate to proceed with the arrests of certain individuals. He repeated that the police had subsequently sent an application to the magistrate, seeking direction on this matter, but said that it was not decreed. “I must stress that if these are the alleged leaks we are talking about, we were constantly asking the inquiring magistrate for guidance because we had no visibility of the inquiry,” the Commissioner of Police repeated. 
 Gafà said that without the experts’ reports, “which were not received by the magistrate for some time, the police could not investigate the hospitals deal, and so needed the direction of the magistrate.” 
 He said that the police did not have the opportunity to see the full picture put together by the financial crime and cybercrime experts appointed by the magistrate, until the inquiry was concluded. 
 Replying to a question about the leaks, Superintendent Grech told State Advocate lawyer Isaac Zammit that the police had not communicated with Azzopardi, but had spoken directly to the magistrate. 
 “So is it being implied that it was not Cutajar who leaked the information,” Zammit suggested. Grech did not agree with that statement. “It could have been anyone.”  
 Other people had been involved in the search of Muscat’s residence besides the court expert in question, not least a number of foreign experts, Grech continued. At 10am, some three hours after the search began, a journalist had also turned up, he said. 
 But the court experts had not directly participated in the search. “Until I left the scene, the foreign expert had been explaining to Muscat what was being sought.” Muscat had handed over the information requested, he said, but explained that the police could not simply take him at his word and still had to conduct their search. 
 Grech later left Muscat’s house to assist with another, related search, leaving Inspector Xerri behind. 
 After Grech stepped off the witness stand, Galea informed the court that he intends to call Jason Azzopardi to the witness stand at the next sitting, which will take place in September.   ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police

 A Maltese fugitive couple that was on Europol’s most wanted list has been found in Libya, with one of the two dead.
 Jomic Calleja Maatouk was caught and arrested by Libyan troops on Thursday evening. Arresting officers told Maltese authorities that his wife, Marzia, 24, was found dead.
 The couple vanished last August, days after Calleja Maatouk was sentenced to five years in prison for importing explosives and attempting to buy a lethal poison on the dark web.
 Their disappearance triggered a Europe-wide manhunt and led to Europol listing the couple on its list of most wanted fugitives. At the time, intelligence sources said they believed the couple  fled Malta by sea and was hiding in Serbia.
 Work to track them down continued in the ensuing months, with the couple believed to have spent time in Italy before making their way to North Africa.
  On Wednesday morning, the Calleja Maatouk couple was located roughly 90 minutes east of Tripoli, and Libyan authorities were immediately informed through diplomatic channels.
 Sources said Maltese-trained Libyan troops were dispatched to the area within hours. There, they are understood to have found a dead body that matched the description of Marzia Calleja Maatouk.
 Jomic, 38, was found alive following a search of the surrounding area.
 An autopsy will be carried out on the dead body in the coming days, to confirm the identity and cause of death.
 Marzia's brother Marvin Zammit posted a tribute to her on Friday morning, seemingly confirming the death. 
 ""I won't see you again, I can't believe it,"" he wrote on Facebook. 
  Jomic Calleja Maatouk, who is now in Libyan custody, is expected to be extradited to Malta, where he is wanted for having skipped bail.
 He was described as a “lethal weapon” by a magistrate last year after the court heard how he first tried to purchase doses of radioactive material Polonium-210, killer poison Ricin and the highly potent synthetic opioid fentanyl online.
 He told dark web vendors that he was targeting a person between 165cm and 175cm tall, and that he needed five doses initially but would later need more.
 
 When he was unable to source those toxins, he ordered an explosive, C-4, instead. Maltese police were tipped off about that shipment and caught Calleja Maatouk through a controlled delivery operation.
 It was a familiar criminal pattern for the Żebbuġ-based Calleja Maatouk: a few years earlier, he had been charged with importing gunpowder without a permit.
 His wife, Marzia, was not involved in his dark web case. But she had her own legal troubles after she was caught with 340 grams of cannabis in a car in 2019. Jomic, at the time her boyfriend, was also in that car. 
 In the same month that Jomic Calleja Maatouk was sentenced to five years in prison for importing explosives, Marzia received a 15-month jail term for cannabis possession with intent to traffic.
 Within weeks, they both vanished.
 Marzia Calleja Maatouk’s family told Times of Malta they found the house the couple shared in disarray, and said they  feared for Marzia's safety.
 The Libyan operation will further strengthen diplomatic relations between Malta and Libya’s Government of National Accord.
 Malta has placed significant emphasis on improving its ties to Tripoli in recent years and regularly raises Libya-related issues in its interventions at EU level.
 Malta has discussed ambitious energy plans with Libya, agreed on a  secretive migration-related pact with the country and dispatched  soldiers and rescue workers there last year following disastrous flooding.

 As the officials found that Hossen, 27, was driving without a driving license or insurance cover, they also noticed that his Greek identity document had expired, prompting them to involve the police. 
 The police surmised that Hossen had overstayed his time in Malta and was effectively in the country illegally. 
 He was charged with driving without a license or insurance cover, driving an unlicensed vehicle, failing to wear a seatbelt while driving and using a mobile phone while driving. 
 Appearing in front of Magistrate Gianella Caruana Busuttil, Hossen admitted to all of the charges, confirming his decision after being given time to consider his plea. 
 The prosecution said that in light of Hossen’s full cooperation and early admission, it was recommending a lighter sentence, with Camilleri adding that he was aware that the accused did not have the means to pay considerable fines. 
 On top of that, Camilleri said the case is now being looked into by immigration police, with the intent of deporting Hossen back to Greece.
 Defence lawyer Noel Bianco explained to the court that Hossen has a medical condition that prevents him from flying and this is why he had remained in Malta and not returned to Greece to renew his documents.
 This condition had also prohibited him from working, he said. 
 After reviewing the submissions Magistrate Caruana Busttil found Hossen guilty on his own admission and sentenced him to a four-month jail term, suspended for two years as well as a €260 fine.
 She also banned him from driving for 13 months.

 The first case took place in Mosta at 6pm when an argument turned into a brawl involving a 39-year-old man from Valletta and a 40-year-old man from Tarxien.
 The incident happened in Triq Patri Ġużè Delia. The 39-year-old was hospitalised with serious injuries. The other man was treated at Mosta health centre. 
 In the second case, at 7.30pm a man was injured in a brawl in Triq San Edwardu, Birżebbuġa.
 The man was found on the ground and had a head injury. He was hospitalised.
 Initial investigations revealed that he was involved in an argument with a 34-year-old man from Santa Luċija. The identity of the victim is not yet known.

Man jailed over Żabbar robbery has conviction annulled for a second time,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/man-jailed-zabbar-robbery-convicted-annulled-second-time.1098730,28-09-2024,006235.png,"A man originally sentenced to seven years in prison for robbing an elderly couple 15 years ago has had his sentence annulled for a second time.
 Christopher Scerri was cleared on appeal over a technical shortcoming in the judgment.
 Scerri, who is now 46, was originally charged alongside his partner in crime Freddie Delia over the robbery which took place at around 7:45am on September 6, 2009 at the elderly couple’s Żabbar home.
 The two suspects were subsequently charged with aggravated theft. Scerri was separately charged with breaching a suspended sentence, a probation order and also relapsing.
 They were convicted by a Magistrates’ Court, but that judgment was annulled following an appeal lodged by Scerri.
 In 2019 he was sent back to the Magistrates’ Court for his case to be decided again.
 Another Magistrates’ Court delivered judgment in 2020, confirming Scerri’s conviction on all charges and condemning him to a seven-year jail term.
 He got two years for the Żabbar robbery, two years for a previous suspended sentence, one year for another suspended sentence and two years for breaching the terms of a conditional discharge.
 Scerri again appealed that sentence.
 The first argument put forward by his lawyers was that the judgment was null since the Magistrates’ Court had not cited one of the articles of law in terms of which the accused was found guilty.
 In terms of article 382 of the Criminal Code, when delivering judgment the court “shall state the facts of which [the accused] has been found guilty, shall award punishment and shall quote the article of this code or of any other law creating the offence.”
 In this case, the operative part of the judgment did not cite the article on the basis of which Scerri was found guilty of breaching the conditional discharge.
 While declaring that Scerri was guilty of all offences as charged, the Magistrate cited the relative provisions of law but not those related to the breach of the conditional discharge.
 The Court of Criminal Appeal, presided over by Mr Justice Neville Camilleri, made reference to a long line of caselaw on such technical shortcomings in the judgment, such as quoting the wrong article or law or failing to quote the article.
 These shortcomings may also be flagged by the court ex officio, observed the judge.
 In light of a similar defect in Scerri’s sentence, the court upheld the appeal, annulled the judgment and sent the records back to the Magistrates’ Court for judgment to be delivered again.
 In line with jurisprudence on the subject, the court declared that the appellant was to be placed in the same position he had been in immediately prior to sentencing.
 Lawyers Franco Debono, Marion Camilleri and Adreana Zammit were counsel to the appellant.

 In a press release on Thursday, the union said it had taken the step because the Agency was denying a number of its workers the right to be represented by the union of their choice.
  As a result of the lack of progress made towards resolving this issue with the agency, which is entrusted with the management of the courts, the GWU said it had been forced to declare an industrial dispute and warned that it intended to take industrial action if necessary.
 The GWU said it had made several attempts to resolve the issue with the Agency's management but had not been successful. 
 “The Agency's denial of the workers’ right to be represented by the union of their choice is a violation of subsidiary law 452.11 and the Constitution of Malta. The majority of the workers have become paid-up members of the GWU, and the union believes that the workers should have the freedom to choose their representation.”
 Following the GWU announcement, MaltaToday approached CSA CEO, Eunice Grech Fiorini for comment. Fiorini explained that the disagreement was an industrial dispute over which of two trade unions has the right to represent workers at the Court Services Agency.and that the agency had decided to refer the issue to the industrial tribunal for a resolution.
 ""The Agency, as it has always done and will always do, is committed to upholding workers’ rights and will abide by the tribunal’s ruling."" Grech Fiorini said.

Romanian prince’s constitutional case to be reassigned after judge abstains,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/130006/romanian_princes_constitutional_case_to_be_reassigned_after_judge_abstains,01-07-2024,006248.png,"A constitutional case filed by a Romanian prince, who is fighting extradition to his homeland to serve a jail sentence for corruption, will have to be reassigned to another judge after the abstention of Mr. Justice Mark Simiana.
 Prince Paul Philip Al Romaniei, also known as Paul Lambrino, lives in Italy but had been visiting Malta in April for an international ceremony organised by the Knights of St. John when he was arrested in the middle of it.
  Lambrino had fled Romania in 2020 after being sentenced to three years and four months in jail by a Romanian court. The court had found him and 17 other defendants guilty of corruption-related offences, including trading in influence, as well as aiding and abetting a crime when he attempted to “recover” properties which he claimed ownership of as heir to the Romanian royal family.
 The Romanian State argued that Lambrino had no right to the properties, and estimated the damages caused to the State to be in the region of €145 million.
 Lambrino has been fighting extradition since his arrest by Maltese police in April, in the execution of a European Arrest Warrant.
 Although the request for his return was initially refused, that decision was overturned after the Attorney General filed an appeal. The case was remanded to the Court of Magistrates, differently presided, which found no bar to extradition.
 The Romanian had subsequently filed an appeal to that judgement, as well as a separate constitutional case in which he claimed that he would be held in inhuman and degrading conditions in Romania and that the proceedings in his homeland were politically motivated.
 When the constitutional case was called before Mr. Justice Mark Simiana on Monday morning, Lambrino’s lawyers explained that they had previously declared their intention to file a request for an interim measure, which would include their client’s release from arrest, in the acts of this case.
 The lawyers pointed out to the judge that in recent days, Labrino had filed two applications for bail before the court of magistrates, both of which had been refused. Last month, Mr. Justice Simiana had subsequently rejected an appeal from one of those refusals.
 Lambrino's lawyers told the judge that they were fully confident in his impartiality and integrity, for which reason were not requesting the judge’s recusal, but the judge chose to recuse himself anyway, after it was explained that the lawyers would again be seeking an interim measure. 
 “As it appears to the present judge that this decision would materially influence every future decision on the request for interim measures, he is of the opinion that he should abstain from presiding over the court that will decide this case,” he said.
 The judge sent the acts of the case back to the registrar to be reassigned.
 Lawyers Jason Azzopardi and Kris Busietta assisted Lambrino, while lawyers Julian Farrugia and Nicole Fenech Cutajar represented the State Advocate in the proceedings.  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police
Court lifts asset freeze order on Yorgen Fenech,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/131980/court_lifts_asset_freeze_order_on_yorgen_fenech__,28-10-2024,006252.png,"Updated with Justice Ministry reaction 

 A Maltese court has lifted the freeze on Yorgen Fenech’s assets, which was imposed on him after his 2019 arrest.

 Fenech is awaiting trial for allegedly masterminding the murder of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia.

                     Judge Edwina Grima, set to preside over Fenech’s trial, ordered the cancellation of the asset freeze earlier this month, citing a failure by the Attorney General’s office to quantify the frozen assets by the required deadline.

 A public notice of this decision was posted on the Asset Recovery Bureau’s website.

 A spokesperson for the Attorney General’s office declined to comment, citing a court order issued by the same judge that prohibits any commentary or reporting on the murder case beyond what is publicly stated in court.

 In comments to Times of Malta, the office of the Attorney General only said that “justice” is being actively pursued, a goal which they believe is “shared” by all

 Fenech, who has been in preventative custody for five years, faces additional charges, including a “phantom job” for Melvin Theuma, money-laundering involving a gaming company, and illicit weapons transactions on the dark web. 

 He also remains a suspect in a corruption inquiry involving former officials Keith Schembri and Konrad Mizzi. Fenech denies all charges.

 Opposition slams Attorney General’s ‘incompetence’

 Reacting to the announcement, the Nationalist Party slammed Attorney General Victoria Buttigieg’s “incompetence” and “misconduct”.

 “This recent development is even more serious when considering that the proceedings before the Criminal Court involve Yorgen Fenech, the owner of the corrupt company 17 Black and the individual accused in court of masterminding the assassination of Daphne Caruana Galizia,” Opposition Justice spokesperson Karol Aquilina said. “This grave situation is also the result of poor legislation that Jonathan Attard, as Minister for Justice, passed through Parliament and his blind trust in Victoria Buttigieg.”

 He said the PN expects Jonathan Attard and Victoria Buttigieg to immediately take responsibility and step down from their respective positions. “This is the only honourable path left for Jonathan Attard and Victoria Buttigieg.”

 He said the PN reminds and emphasises that it had warned that the changes proposed by the Government regarding anti-money laundering laws were rushed and would weaken institutions, “benefitting only criminals.”

 “Now everyone knows that the priority of the Labour Government is to appease those involved in corruption, money laundering, and abuse of power,” he said.

 ‘The actions of a mafia state’ – Repubblika

 Also slamming the decision, NGO Repubblika said this was possible because the Attorney General failed to enforce the law.

 “Attorney General Victoria Buttigieg did not apply the law, and by failing to do her duty, Yorgen Fenech regained his temporarily frozen assets. This is a serious failure by the Maltese state. Minister Jonathan Attard changed the law, and Attorney General Victoria Buttigieg did not enforce it,” the NGO said. “If this was a genuine mistake (which we do not believe it was), Jonathan Attard and Victoria Buttigieg should resign immediately. If it was not a genuine mistake, then this is the action of a mafia state.”

 Justice ministry reacts

 Reacting to the Nationalist Party’s statement, the Justice Ministry “strongly” refuted its “baseless accusation” that recent amendments to various laws on criminal proceeds have weakened the country’s institutions.

 “Without delving into the specifics of any particular case and in respect of the Court's prohibition order on the case referenced in the Opposition’s statement, the Ministry wishes to clarify that following amendments to laws governing criminal proceeds, institutions now have the authority to determine the value of criminal proceeds in order for a seizure or freezing order to take effect or remain in place. This process is conducted through the courts, with the final decision resting on the evidence presented before the Court,” the ministry said.

 It insisted such legal amendments were made to achieve greater proportionality in orders of sequestration, freezing, and confiscation, in line with the criteria set out in judgments by the European Court of Human Rights.     ",Karl Azzopardi / Jordan Pace ,court_and_police
FCID sat on offer of information about social benefits fraud for months,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/129977/fcid_sat_on_offer_of_information_about_social_benefits_fraud_for_months,28-06-2024,006255.png,"The Financial Crimes Investigation Department (FCID) left a would-be whistleblower’s offer of information about the €10 million benefits-for-votes fraud racket hanging for two months, until a Superintendent from another unit read about it in media reports and questioned him.
 The claim is one of several emerging from the reply filed today to an application by FCID inspector Shaun Friggieri in the compilation of evidence against Roger Agius and alleged co-conspirators Silvio Grixti, Emmanuel Spagnol, Dustin Caruana, and Luke Saliba.
  Agius, one of the five men accused of running  Labour’s fraudulent medical-benefits-for-votes scheme has now formally brought the matter to the attention of the presiding magistrate, Rachel Montebello.
 In the reply, lawyers Jason Azzopardi and Kris Busietta on behalf of their client, Agius, a former canvasser and driver for junior minister Andy Ellul, said they wanted to bring the court up to speed on the facts which had preceded the application.
 On November 28, last year, Agius had written to the Whistleblower Unit at the Office of the Prime Minister. “He had wanted to reveal sensitive, confidential and very grave details about how a ‘criminal octopus’, organised by the Ministry for Social Policy and the Office of the Prime Minister was the cause of the multimillion-euro social benefits fraud,” said the lawyers.
 READ ALSO:  Medical benefits fraud: 'FCID were ordered to investigate only 'from the doctor, down' would-be whistleblower says
 The criminal conspiracy that Agius wanted to talk about allegedly involved public officials at the Office of the Prime Minister and a person of trust appointed by the Social Policy Minister, “who to this day are protected by the police, the Social Policy minister and the Prime Minister himself.” reads the application.
 Agius said that during one of his interrogations at FCID, he had told Inspector Shaun Friggieri that he could provide information about another large-scale fraud racket, involving police officers presenting fake sick leave certificates. This request was made repeatedly during his interrogation, both by the suspect and his lawyer, but the Inspector had steadfastly refused to take him before the duty magistrate, Agius said.
 Instead, the application reads, Inspector Friggieri had told Agius that another police unit would be getting in touch with him about the information, and nearly two months later, he had been called in for questioning on April 16.
 Agius says that he had received no further communication from the police since that day and none of the people that he identified had been charged.
 He alleges that while he had been giving that statement, the Superintendent who had sent for him had told Agius and his lawyer that she had done so because she had read a news article about the claims made in one of Agius’ applications and that nobody from the police force had spoken to her about it.
 During that interrogation, he says, he had only been asked questions about individual citizens who he had helped obtain fake medical certificates, instead of being asked about the police officers that he had offered to inform on.
 “The court should know that in the last few months, Roger Agius has both spoken and written publicly, accusing Marc Calleja, a person of trust employed by Minister Michael Falzon, known as Gulija of being the ringleader and the brains behind the social benefits abuse racket, and that he had accepted many thousands of euros worth of bribes, and had even given him a burner phone to communicate with him only about this racket, and that up till 2023, Roger Agius was still delivering the paperwork and applications for other social benefits to this Marc Calleja so that certain individuals pass the medical board.”
 “Bearing all this in mind, Roger Agius is declaring that not only does he have a crumb of trust left in the Police, especially the FCID leadership and the Commissioner of Police, but he is determined and decided that never and under no circumstances will her entrust a smidgen of information to the Police, which to date, has done everything possible to protect the ringleader of the criminal organisation behind this racket. Such is its zeal to protect the politicians and public officials involved in this racket that it has not requested a magisterial inquiry into one of the biggest scandals involving fraudulent use of public funds that we have seen in decades.”
 Agius alleged that the determination to protect the Minister and Social Policy Ministry from the criminal consequences of their actions and omissions was so great that the FCID had left it up to the same ministry to email them the files they wanted, instead of seizing them from the ministry building themselves. This resulted in the files relating to social benefits abuse involving residents of the 9th and 10th electoral districts - “which also happen to be the Social Policy Minister’s constituencies” not being sent to the FCID for investigation.

Young driver admits to causing death of his friend in car crash,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/young-driver-admits-causing-death-friend-car-crash.1101585,26-11-2024,006008.png,"A 22-year-old driver on Monday admitted to causing the death of his friend in a Swieqi car crash two years ago and was handed a suspended sentence.
 Maxime Asacha Muehlematter was driving a rented Renault Zoe in the very early hours of September 24 when he crashed into a wall surrounding a private property in Triq il-Madliena.
 His 17-year-old girlfriend was seated next to him in the front passenger seat. Their friends, 21-year-old Ben Laferla and his 20-year-old Chilean girlfriend, sat at the back.
 The driver and front passenger suffered slight injuries but their friends fared worse. The female passenger was grievously injured while Laferla suffered critical injuries and died a few days later.  
 Initially, Muehlematter's girlfriend told police she was the one driving the car. She later confessed that she had lied to police as she thought that she would not be charged as she was underage. She received a conditional discharge.
 Muehlematter was accused of the involuntary homicide of his friend, causing grievous injuries to his Chilean passenger, damaging the car through driving negligently and involuntarily damaging to private property.
 He was further charged with negligent and reckless driving as well as driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs and breaching traffic regulations.
 He initially pleaded not guilty.
 During the proceedings, a number of residents and passers-by who witnessed the aftermath of the crash were summoned to testify.
 A couple and their son who were driving home that night in the company of two English guests, recalled that it was dark and they could hear screaming from the back of the crashed car.
 One of the witnesses explained that he knew “Ben” as well as Muehlematter since they sometimes met at a bar years before.
 He was the one who pulled Laferla out of the wreckage and administered first aid after sensing the victim was not breathing.
 A bottle of Jäegermeister and rum, both three-quarters empty, were found inside the crashed vehicle.
 When the case resumed on Monday, the accused changed his plea and registered an admission.
 When delivering judgment, Magistrate Leonard Caruana observed that the prosecution had withdrawn three charges relating to reckless and negligent driving as well as driving under the influence.
 Those charges were dropped because there was no material evidence that could lead to a conviction.
 Another charge concerning the alleged breach of traffic regulations was contraventional and subject to a three-month prescription. The court observed that that charge was time-barred.
 Muehlematter was found guilty upon admission of involuntary homicide, involuntarily causing grievous bodily harm to the 20-year-old female passenger, damaging the car and the private property.
 When meting out punishment, the court took note of the fact the accused had cooperated with investigators and had a clean police record.
 However, such offences could not be taken lightly “especially since driving a vehicle in itself requires a considerable degree of constant attention and even the slightest distraction could have fatal results as is the present case.”
 Although the punishment had to reflect “the seriousness and severity” of the case, the court said an effective term of imprisonment was “not advisable given the situation of the accused”.
 In light of such considerations, the court condemned the youth to a two-year jail term suspended for four years and banned his driving licence for one year.
 The accused was also ordered to pay €5,397 in court expert expenses.
 Inspector Jean Paul Attard prosecuted.
 Lawyer Stefano Filletti was defence counsel.

Russian ‘banker for criminals’ set to be stripped of Maltese passport,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/russian-banker-criminals-set-stripped-maltese-passport.1102471,15-12-2024,006029.png,"A Russian man who ran a “professional banking service for criminals across the world” is set to be stripped of his Maltese citizenship.
 Semen Kuksov, who acquired Maltese citizenship in 2022 under the government’s controversial passports scheme, was  jailed in the UK this year for his role in a billion-dollar money laundering network.
 A spokesman for Community Malta, the passport scheme’s regulator, said the responsible minister promptly instructed the start of procedures to deprive Kuksov of his Maltese citizenship.
 Asked when the home affairs minister gave the order for procedures to begin, the spokesperson said: “I confirm that the process is ongoing in accordance with the relative provisions of the law”.
  Kuksov was jailed in February after admitting to laundering over €14 million in “cash”, together with an associate.
 Further details about the money-laundering network were revealed by the UK’s National Crime Agency this month as part of an investigation codenamed Operation Destabilise.
 Operation Destabilise uncovered a complex scheme in which the networks collect funds in one country and make the equivalent value available in another, often by swapping cryptocurrency for cash.
 Kuksov “admitted” to operating an underground cryptocurrency exchange.
 The crime agency said the investigation exposed and disrupted Russian money laundering networks supporting crime around the world.
 As part of the network, Kuksov and an associate helped launder over €14 million during a 74-day period.
 The NCA said Kuksov directed and exercised influence over others involved in money laundering. He did this over a significant period and across borders, demonstrating a high degree of planning.
 Kuksov’s network used physical tokens for cash handovers, described by the NCA as a common practice for cash-based money launderers.
 Tokens are usually low-denomination bank notes that bear a unique serial number. This serial number is passed on before a cash handover takes place, and when the two parties meet, the person collecting the cash will produce the bank note to prove that they are the intended party. The token is usually then handed over, acting as a receipt that the handover has taken place.

Man accused of shooting cat dead in Marsa,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/no-bail-man-accused-shooting-dead-cat-marsa.1094342,24-06-2024,006057.png,"A 24-year-old from Għaxaq was hauled into court accused of having shot dead a cat in Marsa earlier this month.
 Clyde Mallia stands accused of shooting and killing a cat in Marsa, as well as causing it unnecessary pain and suffering, after witnesses reportedly filmed the incident as it occurred.
 Police inspector Sarah Kathleen Zerafa told the court that the incident dates back to June 1, when a person reported the alleged shooting to the police, saying they had filmed the incident.
 According to Zerafa the footage shows a car coming to a stop and a shot being fired out of the car at the cat, which happened to be walking in the street.
 The cat was hit and could be seen shaking and convulsing, until it lost all signs of life and collapsed on the street, she said.
 The footage had captured the car and its number plate clearly, with police managing to trace it back to its owner, a woman.
 The woman told police that the car actually belonged to her daughter’s ex-boyfriend, the accused, and that the vehicle was only registered in her name.
 Some days later, Mallia was spotted driving the same car and a warrant was issued for his arrest, Zerafa said.
 In the meantime, when questioning Mallia’s ex-girlfriend, the woman told police that she had been with Mallia in the car at the time of the shooting and was able to give them exact details of where and how the incident occurred.
 Police subsequently went to Mallia’s home and executed the warrant for his arrest, conducting a search of his home, where they found a box of bullets and air gun pellets, but no guns.
 Zerafa added that an autopsy on the deceased cat had discovered bullets lodged in the body that matched those found in Mallia’s home.
 Mallia was charged with illegal possession of a firearm, shooting and killing the cat as well as causing it unnecessary pain and suffering.
 He also stands accused of driving without a licence and without insurance cover, breaching four different sets of bail conditions and recidivism.
 Mallia pleaded not guilty to the charges.
 The prosecution objected to a request for bail, saying that there was a fear of tampering with evidence as civilian witnesses were still to testify. They also argued that Mallia could not be trusted to keep the court’s conditions, having been accused of breaching four previous bail conditions.
 Lawyers Franco Debono and Adreana Zammit argued that, given that the incident had occurred three weeks prior, there had been ample time to tamper with evidence, but this did not occur.

'Not about intimidation’: Jason Azzopardi charged with filming in court,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/jason-azzopardi-charged-filming-inside-law-courts.1102202,12-09-2024,006114.png,"Updated 5pm with minister's comment
 Justice Minister Jonathan Attard insisted there were no intimidation motives behind the decision to charge lawyer Jason Azzopardi with filming a video inside the law courts without permission.
 The case revolves around a video published by NET news showing Prime Miister Robert Abela and Justice Minister Attard in a conversation at the courts on December 2. 
 Filming inside the law courts is prohibited without authorisation from the director general or the chief justice.
 Azzopardi, a former Nationalist Party MP appeared in court at 2pm on Monday, following an order from court authorities. He declined to comment on the case but told journalists: ""The world's upside down"".  
  The short video, filmed near Hall 19, was published on Facebook by the PN-owned NET News shortly after a court ruling that empowed the State Advocate to recover funds from Steward Health Care.
 NET News claimed the footage showed the prime minister and justice minister discussing a ""partisan strategy"" following the government's legal defeat. 
 Court Servies Agency CEO Eunice Grech Fiorini, told the court she directed security officers to review CCTV footage from the corridor where the footage appeared to have been taken and it matched Azzopardi’s location at the time.
 Grech Fiorini said she alerted the chief justice after identifying the footage, as filming in court without authorisation from the director general or chief justice is prohibited. After seeking legal advice, she was told to file a criminal complaint.
 Another clip shown in court shows Azzopardi walking past the prime minister's team after exiting hall 20 where the three judges presiding over the appeal had delivered judgment in connection with the hospitals deal. The court authorities said the footage corresponds to the Facebook video.
 Chief marshal John Micallef testified that the CEO had instructed him to report the incident to police.
 When asked by defence lawyer Arthur Azzopardi whether Azzopardi had been caught filming, Micallef replied, “I only saw him walk past, as I do a thousand times a day.”
 During Justice Minister Jonathan Attard’s testimony, Azzopardi loudly remarked, “It seems you have nothing better to do,” before being silenced by his lawyer.
 Attard said he and the prime minister had been reviewing the ""80-page judgment"" before Abela gave comments to the press. They got to know about the footage later at Castille, he said. 
 The agency’s lawyer said the only evidence left is the court expert and the editor of Net News to confirm the contentious footage. The court is told that prime minister Robert Abela and secretariat member Aaron Zahra will probably not testify.
 The case has been adjourned to January 15. 
  Exiting the law courts, minister Attard insisted that the arraignment had nothing to do with intimidation but about ensuring order inside the courts of justice. 
 ""The court administration did what it had to do. This has nothing to do with intimidation,"" the minister said. 
  Azzopardi told reporters he would not comment about the ongoing case but thanked the overwhelming support he received, including from the opposition. 
  It is illegal to take any photos or video inside the law courts without the express permission of the director general of the law courts and the chief justice.
 According to the Code of Organisation and Procedure, anyone caught doing so can be arrested for up to 24 hours, expelled from the court, reprimanded or fined up to €1,164.
 In a social media post, Repubblika's honorary president Robert Aquilina pledged support for Azzopardi.
 ""If Robert Abela thinks he can destroy one of us, he's very mistaken. Now is the time for unity and determination,"" he said.
 PN expresses solidarity with Azzopardi
 In a statement, the PN expressed ""full solidarity"" with Azzopardi, saying Abela took the ""most vindictive and dangerous step"" because he was still bitter about losing the case filed by the Opposition over the hospitals' deal.
 ""Abela’s decision is solely intended to intimidate anyone willing to expose information about him and the significant abuses he and his ministers are committing,"" PN spokesperson for justice Karol Aquilina said.
 ""This decision is not only disproportionate but also cowardly, as it seeks to obstruct activists fighting for the rule of law in exercising their constitutional rights.""
 Aquilina added that Abela had learnt nothing from the ""illegal and abusive arrest"" ordered under his predecessor against journalist Norman Vella, allegedly for taking a photograph of Kurt Farrugia and Ramona Attard in a public place at Malta International Airport.
 ""It is scandalous that Abela is using the current circumstances to intimidate anyone with information about him, discouraging them from sharing it with journalists and media outlets,"" Aquilina added.
 The Labour Party reacted to the PN statement, saying that it appeared that for Bernard Grech there is a law for the gods and another for the people.
 ""Jason Azzopardi speaks frequently about contempt of court, but then expects that no one should take action against him if he does it himself,"" the PL said. 
 ""Respecting the rule of law, Bernard Grech and Jason Azzopardi should stop practicing double standards on offenders.
 While it is the institutions that decide guilt or not, today we have had another confirmation about the hypocrisy of the Nationalist Party.
 The court agency is being represented by lawyer Alfred Abela and Rene Darmanin.
 Abela minuted that Azzopardi was not brought under arrest and  there would be no need for any request for bail.
 The case has been adjourned to January 15.

NGO il-Kollettiv support call for inquiry into murder of Nicolette Ghirxi,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/ngo-ilkollettiv-support-call-inquiry-murder-nicolette-ghirxi.1096945,20-08-2024,006130.png,"Updated at 7.00 pm with Malta Women’s Lobby and PN statement 
 Civil society NGO il-Kollettiv is supporting calls for an independent inquiry into the death of murder victim Nicolette Ghirxi at the hands of her ex-partner.
 Members of the Ghirxi family and the victim's lawyer, Joseph Borda, have called on the authorities to open an inquiry similar to the one that took place after the murder of Bernice Cassar. 
 The office of the prime minister has said that the Independent Police Complaints Board will be reviewing the police force’s conduct in handling Ghirxi’s case. 
 In a statement on Tuesday, il-Kollettiv said that there were systemic issues to be addressed. 
 The group highlighted how in a 2020 report, the Council of Europe’s Group of Experts on Action against Violence against Women and Domestic Violence (GREVIO) had identified a number of areas that required “urgent improvement”. 
 These shortcomings included police officers having “minimal” training related to domestic violence and “no training whatsoever” in preventing domestic violence against women. 
 The GREVIO report also found that the police force isn’t trained in the dynamic of domestic violence and fall short in ensuring the victim’s protection. 
 The group added that the report mentions cases of police offers allegedly refusing to receive certain reports, interviewing victims in an insensitive manner and the ineffective collection or loss of evidence in cases of domestic violence and rape. 
 The judiciary, it added, has also been singled out for delivering sentences that are not appropriate for such serious crimes. 
 “Il-Kollettiv emphasises the need for a profound reform in the operations of the police force when it comes to gender-based violence, and fully supports the efforts of numerous non-government entities in the protection of victims,” they said. 
 “A serious change in attitude is required on the part of a number of authorities and government entities, in a way that the victims of violence do not face omertà, prejudice and blame for things they haven’t done, while the national broadcaster should seek to promote an agenda against violence and discrimination of every type, also through the use of educational campaigns.”
 Ghirxi, who was 48 years old, was found stabbed to death in her apartment last week. Her former partner, Edward Johnston, who had been harassing her for months, was later shot dead by police after a three-hour standoff in St Julian’s.
 Borda previously told Times of Malta that magisterial inquiry, which is focused on preserving evidence and determining criminal responsibility “is insufficient to serve Nicolette with justice because the perpetrator is dead”.
 “Nicolette’s family have a right to know what led to her murder, and if her death could have been avoided,” Borda said, adding that this should not be a matter of controversy. 
 ""This is the only way we can identify the state’s failings and how it failed Nicolette,” he said.
 Later on Tuesday, the Malta Women’s Lobby demanded a “thorough investigation” into the “failures” that led to Ghirxi’s murder. 
 ""We call on the government, law enforcement authorities, and all relevant bodies to take immediate, decisive action,"" their statement read.
 ""Women in Malta deserve to live without fear. The safety of women should not be compromised by bureaucratic inefficiencies or political inaction. We’ve absolutely had it up to our eyeballs with predictable political rhetoric, victim-blaming and the usual paying of lip service.""
 The statement said Ghirxi’s murder is a reminder that the “systematic failure to protect women” in Malta continues to cost lives. 
 ""While political leaders and officials offer promises they seem to have no intention to honour, we remain unimpressed and increasingly frustrated by the lack of tangible results. The time for numbers and empty assurances is over. What we demand now is accountability.""
 They questioned how despite 70% of the recommendations from Bernice Cassar’s inquiry have been implemented, women like Ghirxi continue to die. 
 ""This tragic case raises serious questions about the effectiveness of these so-called implemented measures and how this “progress” is being calculated.""
 They also slammed the “constant victim-blaming”.
 “Women should not be blamed for not undergoing risk assessments, instead, they should be provided with the protection and support they desperately need, especially if the perpetrator openly defies and mocks the police as happened in this case,” the statement read. 
 On Tuesday, Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech also called for an independent inquiry, stating it was the only way to ensure that women can be protected before it’s too late. 
  “We want to see that, with full commitment, the requested changes are implemented,” he added.

 The lack of clarity as to the precise charges and the surrounding circumstances come as a result of the press being ordered out of the courtroom by Magistrate Lara Lanfranco.
 The defendant, a regular guest on television talk shows in recent years, appeared in court on Monday, when he was arraigned by summons by Inspector Sherona Buhagiar. 
  But before the sitting could begin, much less the charges be read out or a plea entered, the magistrate objected to the presence of reporters in the courtroom. ""I'm not comfortable with journalists being present for domestic violence cases"" she said to the prosecution.
 Defence lawyer Frank Anthony Tabone told the court that “in fact, we were going to request a ban on the publication of the name of the defendant.”

Inquiry into death of Mount Carmel detainee awaiting bail on arson charge,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/130524/inquiry_into_death_of_mount_carmel_detainee_awaiting_bail_on_arson_charge,01-08-2024,006155.png,"An inmate detained at Mount Carmel Hospital’s forensic unit, Jesmond Gatt from Ħamrun, was found suffering from head injuries in a pool of blood earlier this month, before fatally succumbing to the injuries on Wednesday evening.
 Gatt, 54, was charged with arson last April after allegedly setting fire to the main door of a Ħamrun house while an elderly man was inside.
 He was awaiting release on bail when he was found in a pool of blood on 13 July, on the ground in his room where he was housed with two other inmates.
 Gatt died on Wednesday evening. The exact circumstances of the incident remain unclear. 
 The forensic unit, located within Mount Carmel psychiatric hospital grounds, is managed by the prison authorities. The police are investigating and a magisterial inquiry is ongoing. Prison director Chris Siegersma said that the Correctional Services Agency had been informed that Gatt had “slipped and hit his head.”
 Siegersma cautioned against the isolation of inmates who had mental health problems, and said that the CSA had procedures in place to address the needs of such patients and to prevent harm.
 CCTV footage retrieved by the police allegedly showed Gatt setting the door on fire but the flames went out. He then returned to set it alight again, according to the prosecution.
 Gatt had a long criminal record and was recently released from prison after serving a four-year jail term, according to court records. His initial bail request on the charge of arson had been denied, leading to his detention at the forensic ward. He was then granted bail on 9 July on a €500 bail bond and a personal guarantee of €14,500, with conditions to be home by 7pm and to undergo treatment.
 The Nationalist Party took the government to task for not publicising the death in custody of an inmate sooner than later.
 “The communication of this information, with responsibility and respect towards any judicial process, should be announced by the government entities or the responsible ministries to uphold the principles of transparency, good governance, and accountability,” the PN said.
 “The Nationalist Party cannot understand why the Government kept this case secret and, while expecting public answers regarding the conclusions of what led to this death, hopes that a Magisterial Inquiry has been initiated.”  ",,court_and_police
"Psychiatrists find Noel Azzopardi incapable of forming criminal intent, AG may contest findings",maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/131062/psychiatrists_find_noel_azzopardi_incapable_of_forming_criminal_intent_ag_may_contest_findings,06-09-2024,006156.png,"A court-appointed panel of psychiatrists has concluded that Noel Azzopardi, the man accused of shooting Eric Borg dead in Rabat on New Year’s Day, was incapable of forming the criminal intent required to be found guilty, due to serious mental illness and intellectual difficulties.
 The panel had been appointed to assess the defendant after, during a previous sitting, it had emerged that Azzopardi, who is accused of fatally shooting Eric Borg in Triq Fidloqqom, in the Nigret area of Rabat on January 1, 2024, had spent three months in a psychiatric hospital in 2012, where he was treated for aggressive behaviour and temper outbursts.
  The report was handed over when the compilation of evidence against Azzopardi resumed before magistrate Marseanne Farrugia on Thursday.
 In their conclusions, the panel said that Azzopardi was afflicted by persecutory delusions, which had a significant impact on his life and which were not the result of drug use. “Azzopardi suffers from serious mental illness and intellectual difficulties….it appears that Noel Azzopardi is not fit to stand trial…[he is presently] still suffering from symptoms of Delusional disorder and intellectual disability. From our examination it appears that at around the time of the alleged crime, Mr. Azzopardi was in a state of insanity and therefore had neither the capacity of understanding or desiring the outcome of his actions (la capacita’ di intendere e la capacita’ di volere.)
 In May, the Court had raised the plea of insanity itself, using its powers under the Mental Health Act, after a psychiatrist informed it that Azzopardi was no longer seeking psychiatric treatment. The inquiry was then suspended and a panel of experts was appointed to report on whether the defendant was both fit to stand trial and whether he was insane at the time of the offence. 
 But in spite of the experts’ findings, whether or not this will result in Azzopardi’s acquittal is yet to be seen, as the law gives the Attorney General one month to contest the finding of insanity, in which case that point will be decided by an insanity trial, known as a Ġurin. Were that to happen and should the potential insanity trial declare the defendant to have been sane at the time of the offence, he will then be tried  for murder, which is punishable by imprisonment for life.  But even if declared insane, Azzopardi will likely be committed to a psychiatric facility for the rest of his life.
 After retiring to chambers for some time to consider the application filed by the defence, requesting the matter be referred to the Criminal Court, the court ordered the acts of the case to be sent to the AG who has a month to reply.
 The defendant will be detained under arrest at Mount Carmel Hospital.

"Thief who stole gold medals had no idea they were worth €400,000, lawyer says",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/thief-stole-gold-medals-no-idea-worth-400000-lawyer-says.1091945,21-06-2024,006186.png,"A man who stole two gold medals valued at €400,000 from the Maritime Museum in Vittoriosa, “never imagined what they were worth,” his lawyer argued in court this week after his client admitted to the crime. 
 Justin Mallia, the 25-year-old Cospicua resident, was arrested in March, hours after two very rare 19th-century medals went missing from the museum.
 He had only been out on bail for a few days when he was targeted as the prime suspect behind the theft. 
 Mallia, who was well known among police circles, was clearly identified on CCTV footage linking him to the theft of the precious artifacts. 
 Police said he managed to slip into the museum by posing as an education official delivering documents while an event for schoolchildren was taking place.
 According to Heritage Malta, the medals or coins were awarded between 1800 and 1801 to leaders and distinguished members of the National Congress battalions who fought to liberate Malta from French rule.
 The suspected thief was tracked down within hours and arrested at his home.
 He handed over a pouch containing the stolen medals when police knocked at his door. When questioned, he told officers that he had stolen the medals to settle some pending debts. 
 On March 19, Mallia was charged with aggravated theft, unlawful possession of the medals which were government property as well as defrauding the Maritime Museum. He was also charged with allegedly breaching three previous bail decrees. 
 Mallia initially pleaded not guilty and was remanded in custody. 
 Prosecuting Inspector Paul Camilleri told the court that the medals had suffered “irreversible damage” because they brushed against other items inside the pouch where Mallia had placed them. 
 When the case continued this week, Mallia changed his plea and registered an admission.
 Since proceedings were still at an early stage and Mallia had cooperated with investigators, AG lawyer Etienne Savona explained that the prosecution would not insist on a maximum punishment. 
 
 A five-year effective jail term would be appropriate, argued the prosecution.
 That punishment did not appear to be contested by defence lawyer Joseph Brincat who pointed out further that the stolen medals had been retrieved on the day of the accused’s arrest. 
 “Never did he imagine what they were worth,”[Qatt ma kien jobsor x’valur għandħom] the lawyer said when making submissions on punishment.
 The court, presided by Magistrate Nadine Lia, deferred the case for judgment.

Manuel Delia challenges gag order on discussion of Daphne trial,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/manuel-delia-challenges-gag-order-discussion-daphne-trial.1098509,24-09-2024,006192.png,"Civil society activist Manuel Delia has called upon the court to reconsider its recent order banning all comments and publications outside court hearings related to Yorgen Fenech’s murder case.
 The request was made by means of an application filed on Tuesday challenging the ban handed down last week by Madam Justice Edwina Grima who observed that there are “people who feel they may breach court orders with impunity.”
 The judge ordered NEWZ.mt to pull down comments made by Delia on the same day that the judge issued a similar order in respect of an interview published by  Lovin Malta with the Caruana Galizias' lawyer, Jason Azzopardi.
 After observing that previous court orders had been “repeatedly ignored,” Judge Grima issued a complete ban on writings, whether printed or otherwise, declarations and discussions about the murder case and the defendant.
 While declaring that he fully respected the court, Delia is now requesting the judge to reconsider her decision, a few weeks ahead of the annual protests marking the journalist’s assassination.
 Delia said that he wanted to make sure that the protests could go ahead as usual and since the October 16 anniversary was a few weeks away, he requested the court to consider his request with urgency.
 The applicant said he never meant to breach any court orders and had full respect for the court’s work.
 He said he has never breached any such orders because those orders concerned information contained in police notes which he did not have access to.
 With reference to Judge Grima’s latest order, Delia argued that the ban was “too wide and not necessary in a democracy.”
 It also ran counter to Article 10 of the European Convention which provided for the right to freedom of expression.
 The ban was based on Article 517 of the Criminal Code which banned writings, printed or otherwise, about the court case or the accused.
 But in this case, the judge had also banned public declarations or discussions on the subject on the media or social media.
 Such a ban went beyond the parameters of article 517, argued Delia.
 It meant that “certain unequivocal facts” could not be discussed.
 As for the alleged prejudice to the accused’s rights to a fair hearing and his presumption of innocence, Delia argued that such prejudice could only come about if statements were made by a public authority.
 According to ECHR caselaw, even a “virulent press campaign” did not necessarily result in prejudicing the accused’s rights.
 The court could not prevent a breach of the right to a fair hearing by placing an outright ban on any form of discussion related to the case which impacted our country’s history to such an extent, argued Delia.
 Lawyers Eve Borg Costanzi and Matthew Cutajar signed the application.

Court confirms conviction for drug addict who lived off prostitution proceeds,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/court-confirms-conviction-drug-addict-lived-off-prostitution-proceeds.1098590,26-09-2024,006198.png,"A drug addict who was sentenced to jail for living off the earnings of prostitution through services offered at a massage parlour has had his conviction and punishment confirmed on appeal.
 Johan Sultana was arraigned alongside his partner, Pawlina Cutajar, in 2019 and charged with involvement in running a brothel at a Fgura massage parlour, unlawful use of the shop, living off the earnings of prostitution as well as money laundering.
 Sultana was also separately charged with unlawful possession of heroin, possessing tools normally used in break-ins, stealing while under probation, relapsing and breaching four convictions.
 Investigations had started when the police stopped Sultana at the wheel of his car. A search of the vehicle yielded heroin, a balaclava, a woollen glove, a latex glove, a hammer and weighing scales.
 The suspect explained that he used woollen gloves when driving his racer. He wore the balaclava beneath his driving helmet. As for the hammer, that was an accessory intended to be used in an emergency, smashing the windows in case the car plunged into water.
 The scales were meant to weigh gold items, Sultana sought to explain.
 But forensic tests on his mobile revealed a different picture.
 It was clear that Sultana was involved in running a massage parlour where “extras” were offered to clients, the court was told.
 He denied that when summoned back for questioning, insisting that he only texted about vehicle parts and some gold items.
 However, police surveillance outside the shop confirmed the regular presence of male clients entering and exiting the premises.
 Some of them admitted, when asked by the police, that they got sexual services against payment.
 Meanwhile, Sultana was found carrying €1460 in cash when summoned back to the police station. More cash, totalling over €6000, was found at his home.
 In 2022, he was found guilty by a court, presided over by magistrate Donatella Frendo Dimech, and was condemned to a three-year effective jail term.
 All his property was to be confiscated, the shop licence cancelled and he was also fined €110.
 Moreover a copy of the judgment was to be served upon the Director General Social Services in view of the fact that Sultana admitted that he got €600 in monthly social benefits.
 The court also directed the Commissioner for Revenue to investigate any capital gains due on the shady transfer of the shop and further investigations against the shop owner and the notary who drafted the deed.
 Sultana lodged an appeal on numerous grounds.
 The Court of Criminal Appeal, presided over by Mr Justice Neville Camilleri, rejected each of those arguments.
 The prosecution had proved beyond reasonable doubt that the funds in Sultana’s possession were linked to prostitution the court said. 
 He also admitted his drug addiction, saying that a gram of drugs cost €35 and that he needed that dose or slightly more every day.
 He also admitted that he got €600 in monthly social benefits.
 Yet the shop owner who said that she sold the premises, was paid over €20,000 in cash. The transfer was described as a ‘donation’ and that gave rise to further doubts.
 When the police seized Sultana’s mobile phone, he had no trouble buying another one for €600.
 As a father, he also had to cover maintenance payments.
 Since the appellant could offer no explanation for all that money, the sums must have obviously been derived from another source, observed the court.
 The case records showed that the “only source” related to the sexual services rendered by his partner, Cutajar.
 The prosecution, therefore, had sufficiently proved that Sultana had funds at his disposal stemming from the crimes of which he was accused.
 Although in his appeal the accused argued that he was not assisted by a lawyer during interrogation, the judge who watched the audio-visual recording observed that Sultana had come across in combat mode.
 After signing his refusal for legal assistance, Sultana hit back at each and every allegation made by his interrogators.
 He did not seem to be in a bad mental state, observed the judge.
 When all was considered, the court confirmed the conviction and the punishment in its entirety which, also in light of Sultana’s criminal record, fell squarely within the parameters of the law.

 Claude Junior Jouvency, 29, from France, had come to Malta three weeks ago to work and ended up unemployed, sleeping in a boat moored off Manoel Island.
  He was arrested yesterday morning, following a botched robbery at a jewellery store in Sliema, in which he scuffled with an employee who tried to prevent him from leaving the shop.
 Police inspectors Michael Vella and Stephen Gulia charged Jouvency after the man tried to steal a gold bracelet and choker from a jewellery shop in Sliema. The female shop attendant had managed to take the necklace out of the man’s hand, but she was unable to do the same with the bracelet, as the thief put it down his trousers.
 During his arraignment before Magistrate Abigail Critien on Thursday, the man, who was assisted by legal aid lawyer Ingrid Zammit Young, pleaded guilty to a charge of theft, aggravated by violence and value.
 The prosecution informed the court that the defendant was a squatter, who lived in a boat moored near Manoel Island. The stolen items were in the process of being returned to their rightful owners, inspector Gulia said, as the prosecution recommended a prison sentence.
 Zammit Young told the court that Jouvency had only been in Malta for a few weeks. “He was robbed, and went to the police but found no help from them and so decided to steal something.”
 Gulia confirmed that this was the case, adding that the thief was arrested around an hour after the robbery, still carrying the stolen bracelet.
 The court adjourned the case to 3 September for sentencing. Bail was not requested in the interim.

Two admit causing grievous injuries in fight at nightclub's carpark,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/two-admit-causing-grievous-injuries-fight-nightclub-carpark.1102216,12-09-2024,006203.png,"Two teenagers on Monday pleaded guilty to grievously injuring four youngsters in a fight at Gianpula car park in the early hours of October 26. 
 All the victims were aged under 18. Two of them were seriously injured, with one of them needing corrective surgeries because of nasal fractures and other injuries below the eyes.
 Four teenagers, all male, were arraigned on Monday, facing identical charges. While two of them aged 17 and 19, pleaded guilty, the other two, aged 18, denied the charges.
 The court was told that 12 hours after the fight one of the victims turned up at Siġġiewi police station with his parents to report the case. He did not go earlier because he needed medical assistance in hospital. 
 Magistrate Monica Vella granted bail pending judgement for the two who had pleaded guilty, and imposed a curfew between 10pm and 6am. The accused were also ordered to deposit €500 and a personal guarantee of €3000 each. 
 During arguments over bail for the other accused the prosecution objected mainly because of the fear of tampering with evidence. Once their friends were sentenced, they would be compellable witnesses too. The fear of tampering had increased twofold after two of the teens admitted, argued AG lawyer Jurgen Dalli. 
 The court stated that a decision on bail would be delivered in chambers.
 Upon a joint request by all defence lawyers, the court ordered a ban on all names of both defendants and victims since some of them were minors. 
 AG lawyer Jurgen Dalli and Inspector James Mallia prosecuted. Lawyers Arthur Azzopardi, Jacob Magri, Dustin Camilleri, Nicholas Mifsud, Charlon Gouder and Ramona Attard assisted the defendants. Lawyers Franco Debono and Marion Camilleri appeared for one of the victims. 
 Debono told the court that all they requested was a protection order and adequate bail conditions to safeguard the minor who “after all was minding his own business when attacked.”

Comments about murder suspect Yorgen Fenech outside court hearings banned,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/comments-murder-suspect-yorgen-fenech-outside-court-hearings-banned.1098303,20-09-2024,006206.png,"All comments and publications outside court hearings related to Yorgen Fenech’s murder case have been banned by a judge who observed there are “people who feel they may breach court orders with impunity”. 
 The court-imposed ban was detailed in a decree on Thursday - a copy of which was to be affixed at the entrance to the law courts and published in the Government Gazette and two local newspapers - one in Maltese and another in English. 
 The decree was prompted by an application filed by Fenech’s lawyers drawing the judge’s attention to comments made by civil society activist and blogger Manuel Delia on NEWZ.mt.
 The judge ordered the removal of Delia's comments, which were made on the same day that Madam Justice Edwina Grima ordered the Caruana Galizia family lawyer Jason Azzopardi to delete his Facebook posts about Fenech, including comments he had made during an interview with  Lovin Malta. 
 During that pre-trial hearing on September 5, the judge voiced concern about the possible prejudice such comments could cause to the trial.
 She ordered that no party was to make any public comment about “the guilt or otherwise of the accused who was to date an innocent person”. 
 That order was intended so that potential jurors at the upcoming trial would not be compromised. 
 But that same day, more comments in a similar vein by Delia were published on NEWZ.mt. 
 On Thursday the judge imposed a ban on all such declarations - written or otherwise - until Fenech’s case was over. 
 A previous order confirmed by the Court of Criminal Appeal had banned references on all news portals and social media to certain evidence that was judged to be inadmissible, she said, adding that evidence was not to be brought to the knowledge of potential jurors. 
 Sharing or publication of any documents from the records of the case was also prohibited. Yet those court orders were being “repeatedly ignored,” said Madam Justice Grima on Thursday.
 It appeared there were ""people who feel that they can breach court orders with impunity”.
 “They think that they have the right to say what they will without considering the serious consequences of their actions, doing so under the pretext of the right to freedom of expression.”
 “That right was not to hinder the right to a fair hearing,"" she added. 
 Citing article 517 of the Criminal Code, the judge decreed that until Fenech’s case came to an end, any declaration or public discussion - in favour or against the accused - was prohibited. 
 That ban did not extend to reports on hearings in open court where media presence was allowed.
 Whoever breached this court order would be guilty of contempt, warned the judge, ordering the publication of this decree and also ordering NEWZ.mt to pull down every declaration or evaluation of evidence expressed by Manuel Delia on September 5. 
 Following that decree, NEWZ.mt announced that they were taking down the relative  Manuel Qal episode as ordered by the court but said that they were doing so “under protest"".
 They said they were consulting with their lawyers over any possible future action.

Man accused of sexually assaulting 12-year-old boy at Birżebbuġa square,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/129795/man_accused_of_sexually_assaulting_12yearold_boy_at_birebbua_square,18-06-2024,006222.png,"A man was remanded in custody on Tuesday after being accused of groping a-12 year-old boy in a public square in Birżebbuġa.
 Police Inspectors John Spiteri and Andrew Agius Bonello, assisted by prosecutor Jennifer Polidano, arraigned Jar Annabi Mohammad Abdallah from Sudan before magistrate Caroline Farrugia Frendo.
  Abdallah remonstrated with his interpreter in a loud voice standing in the dock before the arraignment began. 
 The defendant, who was assisted by legal aid lawyer Ingrid Zammit Young, pleaded not guilty to charges of committing a non-consensual act of a sexual nature on the 12 year-old boy in Birżebbuġa, offending public morals and harassing the boy. Abdallah ws also accused of subjecting the victim to an uninvited act of physical intimacy and being drunk and incapable of taking care of himself in a public place.
 Abdallah told the court that he was 22 and that he resided “outside,” at Birżebbuġa. The prosecution explained that the man had no fixed place of residence and was unemployed. 
 Bail was not requested. 
 The court upheld the prosecution’s requests for a ban on the publication of the name of the alleged victim and for a protection order in favour of the victim and members of his family.
 When he was asked to sign the protection order towards the end of the sitting, Abdallah once again started to shout, leading the court to warn him that if he raised his voice again he would be made to regret it.
 Eventually, inspector John Spiteri dictated a note in the acts of the proceedings, stating that the defendant had chosen not to sign the order, even though it had been translated to him by the interpreter.  
 The magistrate highlighted the fact that a protection order’s authority and validity emerges from the court and would be imposed regardless of whether he chose to sign it or not.
 The man was remanded in custody. The police investigation into the incident is ongoing and related arraignments are understood to be a possibility at this stage.  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police

 Anwar Aboshhiwa, a 30-year-old Libyan man living in Msida, was arraigned under arrest before Magistrate Gabriella Vella on Tuesday, accused of assault and inflicting grievous bodily harm.
  The prosecution said that the police had found the victim sprawled on the floor, covered in blood as a result of the attack, which appears to have been preceded by an argument. The victim suffered facial injuries and was taken to hospital for observation. Mifsud declared to the court that all damages, including civil damages, would be settled by his client today. Aboshhiwa had already been on police bail, said his lawyer, who did not object to the prosecution’s request for a protection order in favour of the victim.
 Aboshhiwa was released from arrest and ordered to sign a bail book three times a week. His compliance with his bail conditions was secured by a personal guarantee of €10,000.
 A protection order was issued in favour of the victim.
 Police inspector Michael Vella prosecuted, with the assistance of prosecutors Valentina Cassar and Mariah Mifsud from the Office of the Attorney General.

"Police did nothing as Nicolette Ghirxi's murderer mocked them, her lawyer says",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/police-nothing-even-nicolette-ghirxi-murderer-mocked-them-lawyer-says.1096750,15-08-2024,"006281.png,006282.png,006283.png","Nicolette Ghirxi could still be alive if the police had done their job instead of allowing her murderer to toy with them, her lawyer has said.
 Edward Johnston mocked the police when police summoned him for questioning last April, telling them he was abroad to “top up my tan"" in Dubai and challenging them to “notify Interpol” if they wanted to speak to him.
 Those email exchanges, published on Wednesday by Ghirxi’s lawyer Joseph Borda, date back to April. Ghirxi had told police that her ex-boyfriend was harassing her.
 Ghirxi was found stabbed to death at 2am on Monday night. Johnston was shot dead hours later after he pointed a gun – later discovered to be a replica – at the police.
 Speaking to Times of Malta, Borda said police had failed to adequately protect Ghirxi by not acting on harassment reports she had been filing since April. They could have also acted after he ignored their requests to interrogate him, the lawyer added.
 “The crimes that were allegedly committed by Johnston are punishable by jail.  Had they issued an arrest warrant, she could have still been alive,” he said.
 “How could the police tell her there was nothing they could do?” he asked.
 He said that the police had “allowed Johnston to toy with them and play the fool”.
 Ghirxi and Johnston had been together for 18 months, but Johnston broke off the relationship last December.
 Borda, who had known Ghirxi for 30 years, started legally representing her last April, when fake social media profiles run by Johnston started posting personal information about her.
 She reported those posts to the police, filing reports with the force’s Gender Based and Domestic Violence Section.
 Email exchanges published by the lawyer indicate Johnston was not too concerned about that.
 Police told Johnston to visit the Police HQ in Floriana “to be spoken about a report filed against you”.
 Johnston replied, writing as his business persona 'Edward Sambora': “As I already informed you, its [sic] not possible to attend, tell the judge I am on a business trip”.
 “You will just have to red flag me and notify Interpol,” Johnston challenged the Malta Police.
 “I want to top up my tan in Dubai before I come back to Malta,” he ended one message.
  On April 23, Johnston also told the police that he was about to get on a flight to Dubai, “so I will have to take a rain check, on your 48hrs notice interview”.
 Johnston proposed an online meeting.  
 “You fancy doing a zoom call instead???” he quipped.
 He also hinted he would be back in Malta “in July, for some fun in the sun”.
  It is understood that Johnston returned to Malta in the first or second week of August.  
 Last Thursday, a few days before Ghirxi was murdered, she told the police that her Tinder account marked that Edward Johnston was just a few kilometres away.
 Police have since said that Ghirxi did not want them to take legal action against Johnston.
 Her lawyer says that is not true.
 “It is not true that she had signed papers whereby she did not want to proceed against him.  Had this been true she would not have informed the police about his presence in Malta,” he said.
 During a crime conference last Monday, the police also said that Ghirxi had declined, in writing, to take a domestic violence risk assessment, saying that she did not feel at risk at that moment in time.
 
 Borda believes people in similar situations to her should be made to take a risk assessment by default.
 He said Ghirxi, who he considered a friend, “could not take it any longer”.
 Police could have saved her life by issuing an arrest warrant against Johnston, he said, because had they done so he would have been arrested the moment he landed in Malta.
 Had they issued an international arrest warrant, he would have been arrested abroad and brought to Malta to face justice, he added.
 But the system failed Nicolette, Borda said.
 In the first reactions from Ghirxi's family, they told Times of Malta earlier this week that she had reported the posts to the police, who did not consider them life-threatening.  
 “We don’t know what they could have done, to be honest,"" the family member, who asked not to be named, had said on Monday, in the hours after the murder.
 Meanwhile, sources close to the investigation have told Times of Malta that they have managed to establish that Nicolette Ghirxi’s killer is the same man involved in two separate police stand-offs in Glasgow and Liverpool within a week in 2012.
 Johnston threatened to kill people and pointed a replica Uzi machine gun at police in Liverpool in February 2012, and one week later made a bomb threat in a Glasgow restaurant in 2012, sparking a lengthy stand-off with police.
 In a statement, the Maltese police said they could not comment on allegations of Johnston using fake social media profiles given that an investigation into the case is ongoing.

Heirs get compensation docked over quarry victim’s illegal wage,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/heirs-get-compensation-docked-quarry-victim-illegal-wage.1091657,29-04-2024,006309.png,"The heirs of a 32-year-old man who died when he fell four storeys into a quarry where he worked in 2009 had their compensation docked by almost €400,000 after an appeals court found that part of the wage on which the payout was calculated was illegal.
 The court, presided over by Chief Justice Mark Chetcuti and judges Christian Falzon Scerri and Josette Demicoli, ruled that a substantial part of the wage used to calculate the compensation by the first court was not declared with the tax authorities and was therefore illegal.
 It was ruling on an appeal filed by Polidano Brothers Limited which complained about the €591,360 it had been ordered to pay to the heirs of Louis Cassar, a 32-year-old worker who died at their Tal-Qawwi quarry in Triq Lapsi, Siġġiewi on April 8, 2009. Cassar succumbed to his injuries on April 25.
 The court heard how Cassar boarded a vehicle parked close to the quarry’s edge to move it as it was in the way. As he leaned over its side, where the ignition was, he slipped and fell down a height of four storeys.
 The company argued that the worker was solely responsible for the accident, even suggesting it was a suicide due to alleged family problems. This line of defence earned the company strong condemnation by the court which described it as “highly insensitive”.
 The court noted that although the company expressed sympathy over the death, it went on to suggest that Cassar had taken his own life by jumping from a height.
 “The court is not at all impressed by this argument which it even included in writing in the appeal application. Apart from being highly insensitive, considering that Cassar lost his life while he was going about his work for the company, there was not the slightest hint of concrete proof that the accident happened because Cassar had some problems that could have pushed him to take his own life,” the court said.
 It observed that the account given by Cassar’s colleagues who were with him at the edge of the quarry when he fell off was identical to the description given by Cassar to his relatives on his deathbed.
 The judges went on to confirm the responsibility attributed to the company by the first court, which found a lack of health and safety measures that caused the fatal fall. They also noted that the health and safety engineer who had drawn up a risk assessment had not visited the quarry for 18 months before the incident.
 On the provision of health and safety equipment, the court heard how Cassar was not wearing the provided safety helmet and how this would have been useless anyway since it did not have a fastener to keep it in place in event of a fall.
 It said the employer’s obligation goes beyond the simple provision of equipment and protective clothing. The employer must ensure that the protective equipment is worn and even discipline those who do not wear it.
 “In light of all these considerations, this court cannot but conclude that the company systematically failed in its obligation to maintain a good system to protect its workers, particularly Cassar,” the court ruled.
 As it considered the company’s argument related to the sum awarded to the heirs, the court found that according to Cassar’s last income tax declaration, he earned just over €8,200. However, according to evidence, Cassar was earning two wages: one issued on a Polidano Group letterhead which he declared for tax purposes, and another identical one, for a similar amount, but without the group logo.
 The court noted that the company could not explain this and the company representative was “very evasive” when asked about this “because he had something to cover up”.
 The judges said that unlike the first court – which said it would be committing an injustice if the illegal wage was not included for the purposes of compensation – they could not allow an illegal payment to be included in his total earnings. They therefore recalculated the compensation due to the heirs and lowered the original €591,360 to €217,892.
 The court further ordered that the Commissioner for Revenue be notified of the judgment for any action he deemed necessary over the fact that Polidano Brothers Limited was issuing two salaries to Cassar as well as an investigation into Cassar’s tax evasion.

"Repubblika mistaken in claiming 'injured party' status in criminal case, Muscat lawyers say",maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/129243/repubblika_mistaken_in_claiming_injured_party_status_in_criminal_case_muscat_lawyers_say,17-05-2024,006310.png,"Lawyers acting on behalf of Joseph Muscat have objected to Repubblika’s request to be admitted as the injured party in the criminal case against him.
 The NGO, which was set up following the murder of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia in 2017, and which has been campaigning against corruption ever since, filed an application on 13 May, requesting that it be admitted to the proceedings as the injured party.
 But in a reply filed on Thursday, Muscat's lawyers Vincent Galea, Ishmael Psaila, Charlon Gouder, Etienne Borg Ferranti and Dominic Micallef, argued that Repubblika was wrong when it claimed to be the injured party who triggered the magisterial inquiry in 2019.
  “Why is it being said that Repubblika is mistaken when it says that it had been the injured party that initiated the magisterial inquiry? Because a magisterial inquiry is not begun by the injured party,” argued the lawyers. The relevant section of the Criminal Code does not speak of injured parties, but of “a person who is not the Attorney General or a police officer. The word used by the law is “a person” not “offended party,” as Repubblika is trying to imply.”
 It was pointed out that similar requests by Repubblika had been rejected in Constitutional Court decisions from 2018, in Simon Busuttil’s case against the Attorney General, and May 2023, in a case filed by Repubblika against the State Advocate, as well as a First Hall (Constitutional Jurisdiction) case by Muscat against the State Advocate decided in July 2023.
 In order for Repubblika, or any other person, to be admitted as the injured party in the Criminal Law sphere, they must show that it had suffered damages as a result of the crimes with which the defendants are charged and that it was the victim of the crime.
 The fact that Repubblika had filed a number of applications in the acts of the inquiry, to bring information to the attention of the inquiring magistrate made it an interested party, but not an injured party. 
 Even if it were to argue that the State was a victim, the State is already represented in the proceedings by the State Advocate, and the NGO “should not usurp the functions of the State and assign them to itself,” argued the lawyers.
 In addition, the law only allowed individuals and not organisations to be admitted as an injured party in criminal proceedings. 
 Neither did Repubblika satisfy the criteria for victimhood under the Victims of Crime Act, argued the lawyers, describing the NGO’s court application as “simply an attempt to give rise to a different interpretation to that which is clearly stated in [the law]....with the aim of being admitted as the injured party in these proceedings when clearly it is not meant to be.”
  Repubblika honorary president Robert Aquilina said in a reaction that through the NGO’s lawyer Jason Azzopardi, two official letters were sent to Joseph Muscat and his “friends” informing them they intend to recover the funds “stolen from the Maltese and Gozitans.”
 “Perhaps Muscat does not know or does not remember that around this time five years ago, his accomplices Konrad Mizzi, Chris Cardona, and Edward Scicluna had brought up the same argument they made today, and the Courts had said it made no sense and therefore rejected it,” the Aquilina said on Facebook.

 The group said that they reported the man for hunting protected birds during the closed season after they observed him targeting wader species, allegedly making use of electronic callers and plastic decoys in the coastal area of Ta Qalet Marku. 
 The man was apprehended by officers from the Environmental Protection Unit, with an investigation and court case expected, they said.  
 BirdLife Malta said it is likely the man was making use of a rabbit hunting license to pass off his activities as legitimate, while supposedly targeting protected species. 
 While the rabbit hunting season does coincide with the migration of these birds, the practice is rarely seen next to the coast. 
 ""Wader species such as Dunlins, Curlews, Oystercatchers, sandpipers, Avocets, greenshanks and redshanks and multiple other species have already started their migration to wintering areas, arriving all the way from Arctic regions, coinciding with an open rabbit hunting season which hunters keep abusing of to target these protected species,"" BirdLife Malta said. 
 ""Rabbit hunting is seldom practiced on the coastline and the season is open between 1st June and 31st December. The hunting season for birds only opens from the 1st of September.""

Man charged with harassing ex-partner hits courtroom door after being denied bail,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/130427/man_charged_with_harassing_expartner_hits_courtroom_door_after_being_denied_bail,26-07-2024,006365.png,"A man accused of repeatedly contacting his estranged partner, in defiance of a court order issued just two days before, was remanded in custody on Friday.
 Inspector Audrey Micallef charged the 42-year-old stevedore from Fgura with harassment and misuse of telecommunications equipment, as well as with breaching a restraining order and committing an offence while under a probation order.
  The inspector explained that the police Domestic Violence Unit had received a report from the alleged victim on July 24, informing the police that the man had been calling her repeatedly despite the restraining order that had been issued two days prior.
 The reason for the repeated calls appears to be related to a child which the former couple have in common.
 After obtaining a warrant for the man’s arrest, he had been taken into custody, said the inspector, adding that although he had been very cooperative, he had ignored recommendations that he consult with a lawyer before speaking to the police.
 The man was subsequently taken to hospital complaining of chest pains, where he had proceeded to cause a scene and had resisted being discharged back into police custody, the inspector said.
 Lawyer Martina Herrera, appointed to assist the man as legal aid counsel, informed the court that he would be pleading not guilty to the charges and was requesting bail.
 Inspector Micallef objected to the man’s request to be released from arrest as this would potentially jeopardise witness evidence and the real risk that the man, who was described in court as untrustworthy, would commit further crimes. The man also had no fixed address, telling the court that he had been staying at a homeless shelter, and had told the police that he had no money.
 Herrera emphasised that the man was presumed to be innocent at this stage, adding that several defendants had been granted bail while residing at the homeless shelter in question, in the past. The man had recently found a job but still had very limited finances, said the lawyer, asking the court to bear this in mind should it impose a deposit for the purposes of bail.
 But the court, noting that the alleged victim had not yet testified and in view of the serious nature of the offences the man was being accused of committing just two days after being issued with a probation order, rejected the bail request.
 “I’m sorry but you’ve only heard one side of the story,” piped up the accused, unbidden, addressing the court directly, prompting the court to urge the man’s defence lawyer to explain the preliminary nature of an arraignment hearing to her client. 
 The man kicked benches while in the courtroom and continued to remonstrate with the police outside the courtroom, at one point hitting a door while inexplicably not handcuffed, before being led away to be held in preventive custody at the Corradino Correctional Facility.

Grech asks judge in civil case against Vitals to permit the exhibiting of related criminal charges and court orders,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/129078/grech_asks_judge_in_civil_case_against_vitals_to_permit_the_exhibiting_of_related_criminal_charges_and_court_orders,08-05-2024,006385.png,"The leader of the Opposition PN party, Bernard Grech, has asked the judge presiding over civil case filed by the Nationalist Party, for the recovery of the millions paid out of the public coffers to Vitals Global Healthcare, to order the exhibition of recent court orders and criminal charges issued in connection with it.
 Earlier today, lawyers Edward Debono and Nicholas Debono filed an application on Grech’s behalf, informing presiding judge Toni Abela that “several worrying developments” had taken place since the last sitting on May 3, in connection with the recission of the emphyteutical concession of the St. Luke, Karin Grech and Craig hospitals.
 The courts apply the maxim quod non est in acti non est in mundi,  which means that the court can only decide on an issue using the evidence exhibited before it.

 In view of this fact, the PN leader’s lawyers have requested the court summons the Registrar of the Criminal Court “to exhibit a copy of an attachment and investigation order issued by Criminal Court judge Edwina Grima, together with copies of the criminal charges issued yesterday by the Court of Magistrates.
 “It would be useful that, before this court passes judgement it would have a copy of these acts which are intimately connected to the merits of this case, not only so that judicial recognition of these developments be taken, but also so that copies of the same be inserted in the acts of this case.”
 These significant developments had taken place at a stage when the plaintiffs had declared they had no further evidence, explained the lawyers, necessitating the judge to authorise them to call the Registrar to the stand and exhibit copies of the acts in question.

Man fined after causing damage to boutique hotel while drunk,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/131140/man_fined_after_causing_damage_to_boutique_hotel_while_drunk_,10-09-2024,006409.png,"A man has admitted to causing damage at a boutique hotel in Naxxar after returning from an alcohol bender so extreme that he needed to be hospitalised for several days.
 40-year-old Vincent Falzon from Ghajnsielem in Gozo appeared in the dock before magistrate Caroline Farrugia Frendo on Tuesday, accused of causing less than €2,500 worth of damage to the hotel and insulting or threatening a police sergeant.
  Inspector Joseph Mallia, prosecuting, further charged Falzon with disobeying legitimate police orders, being drunk and disorderly in a public place, breaching the peace and breaching previous bail conditions.
 “We meet again Mr. Falzon,” remarked the magistrate as the sitting began.
 It is understood that the man had returned to the hotel where had been staying on 29 September, after a night of heavy drinking. Hotel staff had spoken to the drunk guest, during which conversation he had damaged the receptionist’s mobile phone by throwing it against a wall.
 Such was the level of his intoxication that the man had to be taken to hospital, where he spent four days before being discharged.
 The man pleaded guilty to the charges during his arraignment on Tuesday.
 When asked by the court, Inspector Mallia confirmed that the damages Falzon had caused to both the hotel and the receptionist had already been settled in full.
 Lawyer George Anton Buttigieg, assisting the defendant, submitted that his client had cooperated with the police, adding that he deeply regretted his actions and was formally apologising to the police sergeant.
 Finding the man guilty on his own admission, the court fined him €2,000, which he must pay within the next six months and ordered the confiscation of his €1,000 bail security.  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police

 The former prime minister, Konrad Mizzi, Keith Schembri, and 20 other individuals and companies are facing accusations of bribery, trading in influence, money laundering, and various other crimes.
 Unless you've been living in a bubble, you will be aware that the lead-up to today's first court hearing has been rife with accusations,  denials, and  political salvos. 
 And after dozens of coffees for the Times of Malta team at our Mrieħel offices and outside the law courts in Valletta - we're done. We plan to be back with you tomorrow to give you the live proceedings of the second group of accused. 
 Keith Schembri and Konrad Mizzi emerge from court insisting they have now been instructed by the court not to give any comments.
 Accompanied by cheers, Muscat said he would have liked to hold a press conference but he had to abide by the court's gagging order. 
    
 8.25pm The magistrate is back. 
 The court prohibits the parties and their lawyer from handing any parts of these records to third parties. Only the faithful reporting of court proceedings are to be allowed.
 ""The case is tried in court and court alone, not through the media. So the parties and their lawyers are banned from handing any of the data to third parties or making any public comments about any testimonies or evidence in the proceedings.""
 As for travel restrictions, the court will not prohibit the accused from travelling abroad but they must make sure to appear for every sitting so as not to stultify the proceedings.
 The court also reserved the right to set out further conditions at the next sitting or in the interim.
 To make sure they abide by this obligation the court imposed a personal guarantee of €25,000 on each of the accused.
 All defence lawyers register their objection to all experts nominated in the magisterial inquiry. They will put forward their reasoning at a later stage. There’s a show of hands. All defence lawyers register this objection.
 The case is adjourned to June 13 and June 19. 
 7.40pm The magistrate has suspended the hearing for the last time. She’ll be back within 15/20 minutes with her decree on the last requests by the prosecution, including whether there should be a ban on public comments. 
 Stay with us.
 7.18pm Speaking at a PN rally this evening, Bernard Grech said it was confirmed during today’s court sitting that the police did not actively investigate the hospitals case. This, he said, was shameful.
 He said he was warning Police Commissioner Angelo Gafa’ that he should not continue to serve those who had put him in his post and ""controlling him"". 
 7.15pm In a nutshell, at the moment, most of the defence lawyers are lining up one by one, urging the magistrate to turn down a request by the AG's office to impose conditions on the accused, including restrictions on travel, and banning them from commenting publicly.
 7.03pm Lawyer Edward Gatt said never in his years of practice was there any such ban on public comments as that requested by the AG's office.
 ""What effect would this have on any future trial by jury? So others can comment and say all sort of things about Konrad Mizzi and Keith Schembri, waving their pictures in public but we get an order imposed by the court? Potential jurors would hear only one side of the story.""
 Franco Debono says he is astonished that the AG had nothing to say about Repubblika’s request to be admitted as an injured party. 
 7pm Lawyer Veronique Dalli says her client Taomac was not even served notice of charges and got to know they were implicated when WhatsApp chats were being circulated in April. They approached the police voluntarily and cooperated all along.
 The company’s legal representative is a Maltese national with a family here. The person accused was the last one to get to know.
 ""As for the requested ban, it’s unfair. We’re getting information from the media and it’s not fair that if there’s some untrue allegation we cannot request a right of reply because of such ban. This would impinge upon the right to freedom of expression,"" Dalli said.
  6.52pm Galea quotes a Facebook post from lawyer Jason Azzopardi referring to Muscat allegedly going to Turkey this evening.
 ""Is he really going abroad today,"" the magistrate asks.
 The lawyer replies: ""It's 6.45pm now. No, he's not going abroad today.""
 Magistrate: ""Is he going away when the case is ongoing?""
 Giannella de Marco also objects to the AG’s request for court conditions to be imposed. All those charged came to court today and there was no tampering with evidence.
 David Meli and Mario Gatt made no social media posts, let alone try to abscond nor interfere in the course of justice. There was no allegation in their regard and so the AG’s request for conditions is unjust.
 6.45pm Lawyer Galea hits back. He says the right to freedom of expression is foremost and the AG appears to want to limit that.
 ""Sweeping statements before the court are not on. Refalo simply threw these statements without bringing evidence. Dr Muscat is here today like all other accused.""
 In what appears to be a veiled reference towards Repubblika lawyer Jason Azzopardi, Galea says “My client is muzzled but a certain party who is not present today can say what he likes on social media.”
 6.40pm Refalo from the AG's office comes with another request - and a strong statement seven hours into the sitting.
 He says they want to make sure that this case continues, so he was requesting that whenever one of the accused wants to go abroad they are to seek court authorisation.
 He says the prosecution is basically asking the court to impose some bail conditions even though the accused were not charged under arrest.
 “And we’re asking this especially after seeing certain public comments and statements and spin after these charges were filed. We want to avoid that this case is reduced to a trial by media. We want to protect the proper administration of justice, and so, while this case is ongoing we want the accused to refrain from further public comments.
 ""Those comments are more appropriate to some TV series... And they may undermine the proper administration of justice.""
 He is asked to specify who was attacking the prosecution.
 Refalo points to comments by Muscat, Mizzi and Spiteri on social media as well as statements made during press conferences.
 6.20pm Lawyer Edward Gatt asks about that “Sam”, a superintendent in the UK.
 ""Did you ever meet Sam at the AG’s office before this inquiry?""
 The magistrate asks what is the relevance.
 ""If it’s for your personal satisfaction it’s not necessarily relevant,"" says the magistrate.
 ""I want to know if Scerri knows he had done work at AG’s office because I intend to challenge this expert who was involved in the Vitals inquiry and gave his opinion.""
 Scerri says he was aware this expert had been involved in other inquiries.
 ""Were experts given a magisterial warrant?""
 ""They were appointed by the magistrate. There was a list,"" Scerri says.
 But did the experts have a search warrant, asks Tonna Lowell.
 ""No, the police had,"" replies Scerri.
 Chris Cilia asks if minutes were recorded about the search. Scerri says they were not, but after each search, all those involved would go straight to the inquiring magistrate to testify.
 Muscat's lawyer pushes on:
 ""You went to a former PM’s home. I don’t think you ever did anything like that before. So do you recall if the foreign experts also searched the place?""
 Scerri: ""Experts were with us. But I cannot exclude with certainty that they didn’t search too.""
 Scerri says he was not involved in the search at Muscat’s Sa Maison office.
 He leaves the stage. He is the last witness for today.
 6.15pm Scerri is asked about the search at Muscat’s home in 2021 by lawyer Galea.
 ""Did you tell your subordinates beforehand?""
 ""Normally those would only be told a day ahead. We postponed Muscat’s search to the next day.""
 ""Why?""
 ""Because there was some leak in the media and so we decided to postpone by one day. We practically swapped the dates.""
 ""Did you investigate that leak? Didn’t the magistrate ask about that? I personally was not involved but Supt James Grech and Alexandra Mamo were informed.""
 ""What did the magistrate tell you when the leak was in the media? Nothing? Didn’t she say anything?
 The AG lawyer intervenes: ""What’s the relevance of these questions?
 ""It’s for the validity of the inquiry when we come to it,"" Galea says.
 Scerri says the magistrate did not say anything. Police searched for a particular document that was handed over by Muscat himself.
 ""It was given to the experts who were present. Police simply took the document, sealed it and gave it to the experts.""
 ""What was that document?""
 ""As far as I know it was a contract of work.""
 6.08pm Meanwhile, away from the courtroom, the Nationalist Party expressed solidarity with journalists who were intimidated outside the law courts on Tuesday morning.
 In a statement, the party said journalism was an important pillar of democracy and journalists should be allowed to go about their duties. Furthermore, it was thanks to the work of journalists that the country got to know about corruption in the hospitals deal which saw Vitals and Steward pocket €400m of the people’s money.
 Meanwhile, PN candidate Peter Agius said the EU Commission's rule of law report had recommended to the government the need to ensure a safe environment for journalists to do their work.
 ""Today’s insults at journalists and towards Daphne Caruana Galizia by Muscat’s supporters in Valletta confirms that this recommendation has also been ignored,"" Agius said, pledging that the recommendations are implemented and not remain on paper.
  6.02pm Scerri says that every letter and document was kept by the magistrate.
 ""That was the procedure followed before I joined the investigation and that’s how it remained.""
 Police also presented newspaper reports to the magistrate - one in particular was a report about two foreigners.
 The magistrate ordered them to be questioned if they were brought to Malta.
 5.55pm Lawyer Edward Gatt asks if police were present during meetings between the magistrate and experts.
 ""No,"" Scerri says, but cites Sam l-Irlandiz who would bring along around seven foreign colleagues.
 The experts went to FCID to detail the police about keywords and tips to look out for during the searches which were carried out in coordinated manner.
 Scerri says this was the first time he worked with these experts.
 Lawyer Vince Galea chips in: ""What keywords?""
 ""The keywords normally consisted of three letters or so. But I don’t recall exactly. For example, KYC or words. Experts would tell us to show them any resulting matches.""
 He is asked if 'JM' was ever flagged.
 ""No,"" Scerri replies. 
 5.45pm Former inspector Anthony Scerri takes the witness stand next. He recalls that in April 2021, he was to assist the magistrate in the inquiry which started in 2019.
 ""I assisted Stivala in the search at Nexia BT's archives in a Qrendi garage.""
 Experts were instructed by inquiring magistrate to search and seize. After each search, the police would go immediately to court and testify in the inquiry.
 In 2022 he was asked to search Sladden’s family home in Xagħjra. All those involved in the search would testify before the inquiring magistrate. 
 Vitals auditor Chris Spiteri was asked to testify and the magistrate ordered a search at his home and offices. More documents and devices were seized.
 Scerri says that in November a newspaper mentioned two foreigners who could have useful information to the Vitals inquiry.
 A request was made to Interpol but as far as Scerri knew, these two did not come. The Ta' Xbiex office of Vitals accountant, ID Malta offices and Joseph Muscat's home was also searched.
 Lawyer Jason Grima cross-examines Scerri, asking about the searches he had carried out on Spiteri.
 “Did you know that Spiteri had already testified four times before the magistrate before the searches?” he asks.
 Scerri confirms that Spiteri had cooperated. 
 5.30pm The court session started at 11.30am. The crowds gathered two hours before that - and a few dozen are still waiting outside the court room to applaud Muscat at the end of today's session. 
  5.25pm Stivala is asked about searches at the homes of David Meli and Mario Gatt. He recalls a black box file taken from Meli.
 ""Did you see what was seized as far as Meli was concerned?""
 ""No,"" he says, adding that he was not personally present but his officials would have called to inform him about what was being seized.
 He instructed them to look for evidence linked to the hospitals concession.
 ""What did you seize from Gatt?""
 ""I wasn’t the one to seize the items.""
 Stivala could not recall if police gave seizure notes to Gatt.
 Stivala says there was a police file about the Vitals concession. But police made no parallel investigation because there was a magisterial inquiry that had started.
 ""Until April 2021, until my time there, I believe no one was indicated as suspect.""
 5.20pm Superintendent Rennie Stivala from the economic crimes unit at Asset Recovery Bureau is up next. He says court experts were appointed and devices were seized during police raids in 2020.
 Police had asked Technoline to hand over copy of all receipts issued to VGH. Stivala had questioned Ivan Vassallo not under interrogation but to get an idea of the extent of Technoline’s operations.
 Vassallo was willing to hand over his diaries.
 ""Did you ask Vassallo to testify before Magistrate Gabriella Vella?"" his lawyer Arthur Azzopardi asks.
 ""No. All that I gathered I exhibited in the inquiry.""
 5.05pm Tax commissioner Joseph Caruana takes the stand. His office made a request to investigate Christopher Spiteri over under-declarations of tax, filing a written request to the police.
 Tax commissioner granted dispensation to the police to investigate and take action against Spiteri. But the tax authorities themselves did not investigate Spiteri.
 5pm Edward Gatt, lawyer for Schembri and Mizzi reads from page 82 of the  proces verbal: “Funds going to key players. The sums involved are debatable but….”
 In the case of Schembri and Mizzi, the table included in that page says it is “not applicable.""
 But the magistrate has already decided. The court cannot decide on admissibility or otherwise of evidence re-issuing of freezing order. The court does not have competence to decide on the guilt or otherwise of the accused. 
 After hearing the prosecution state under oath that there is valid reason for property to be confiscated, the court upheld the request.
 The bottom line is that all those amounts listed in the charges are now hit by the freezing order.
 This means the accused are prohibited from transferring their property within those indicated amounts. The court order will be published in the government gazette and asset recovery bureau will prepare a compendium of assets of each accused.
 4.50pm The magistrate rejects the request for the prosecution to identify between amounts when the accused is charged in a personal and vicarious capacity.
 When deciding upon the request for the freezing order, the court must make no distinction between property subject to seizure that ends up in accused’s possession, be it personally or vicariously
 4.40pm Lawyer Giannella de Marco says the court should distinguish between personal and corporate liability. Other lawyers agree with the argument. 
 Refalo from the AG's office says that the prosecution was not bound to distinguish between persons and companies. But de Marco insists that a line should be drawn between personal and vicarious liability.
 Lawyer Charles Mercieca says that Meli was charged with making illicit gains in relation to Steward.
 ""Does the court have the tools to distinguish between the personal gains and those by the company? That distinction was not even made by the inquiring magistrate,"" he says.
 4.30pm Lawyer Franco Debono, representing Sciacca Grill, says that justice must not only be done, but must seen to be done. The prosecution is to indicate the pages where the alleged illicit gains feature.
 ""I’m publicly asking the prosecution to indicate the basis for that freezing order. Although there are many co-accused, there are different proceedings, one for each accused. So the court must deal with each one individually, not en masse,"" he says.
 The magistrate tells the defence not to repeat previous requests the court has already decided upon.
 4.15pm Hillman's lawyer says his client was not even spoken to while the inquiry was being drawn up.
 ""Experts were appointed to assist and they usurped the role of the inquiring magistrate. Experts are meant to report technical or scientific facts about which the magistrate lacks skill or knowledge. In this case, the magistrate relied on the conclusions of those experts.""
 In Hillman's case, they said that he had a relationship/contact with a number of persons/companies with a shady reputation - and that was enough to trigger suspicions he may have been involved in money laundering, the lawyer says.
 Filletti says the recent amendment to the law on freezing orders was to avoid carpet bombing, a blanket freeze.
 ""But we’ve come round full circle, back to what the legislator said should not be done. So the request for the freezing order should be turned down.""
  4.10pm The court observed that the amendments introduced recently granted the prosecution the right to set an amount.
 The law does not make it obligatory for the court to hear evidence to determine whether the prosecution’s request is valid and thus to be upheld.
 The AG must have reasonable reason to make that request and, in this case, the court deems that such reason exists. Even if the inquiring magistrate indicated lesser amounts for this purpose, the freezing order covers all property, illicit gains and thus subject to confiscation.
 There could be interests on invested funds. The amounts could even be greater than the sums laid down by the AG.
 The court may issue a temporary freezing order and deems that it cannot rely on some witnesses.
 The court therefore rejected the defence’s requests.
 4pm We are back in court to learn about the magistrate's decision in connection with the freezing orders and whether the prosecution should substantiate its request.
 3.45pm In a televised interview, Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech described Tuesday as a “black day” for Malta, as crowds rallied outside the courts to support Muscat, even though they were charged with serious crimes over the hospital scandal. 
 “Justice is taking place, but it is still a black day. We would all prefer that this country is not experiencing today, a day where our country is being perceived as a jungle as we witness the scenes outside these courts,” Grech said.
 We will soon have a separate report of that online. 
  3.40pm A lot has been written about the hospitals scandal as well as the political fallout. It is, after all, the first time that a former prime minister is being criminally charged. It also happens to be one of the most popular prime ministers. 
 This is the editorial published in Times of Malta today. We will have another one on the matter tomorrow. 
  3.15pm Meanwhile, the situation outside court has calmed down though dozens of Muscat supporters are still in the area waiting for the former prime minister to emerge from court. 
 According to our reporters, the general sentiment among the crowd is that the magisterial inquiry and the criminal charges are politically motivated in an attempt to overthrow the Labour Party from the government. 
 ""You have no chance of ever getting into government,"" was a message repeatedly yelled at reporters. Many others lauded Muscat's term in office, saying he was the one who got them out of poverty.
  2.50pm The court now briefly suspends the hearing to decide on the other requests by the defence. We might be in for a long session. 
 2.40pm To sum up the legal arguments being made in court, the defence are saying that once the AG came up with those amounts for the freezing orders, they must bring evidence to substantiate their request.
 And then the defence needs time to go through all that evidence formally presented just minutes ago.
 Lawyer Jason Grima says his client could not continue to exercise his profession since he was targeted by the attachment order.
 ""His life has been totally disrupted. The same goes for Jonathan Vella. There’s not a single line mentioning illicit gains for Vella. As for Spiteri there was a €50,000 bonus which the AG deemed to be illicit gains. Did he expect Spiteri to work for free? I think it’s the AG who did not read the inquiry. The AG cannot tell us what evidence there is to support those amounts.”
   2.25pm We don't know how long this court hearing will last, but if Jason Azzopardi is right, Muscat will need to be out of there by 6pm. The Repubblika lawyer and former PN MP claims Muscat will be catching a 7.15pm flight to Istanbul this evening, and will be using the ministerial lounge to do so.
  Meanwhile, lawyer Michael Zammit Maempel finds it intriguing that police did not cordon off the law courts using security barriers. They were quick to do that during anti-government protests outside parliament in 2019, he recalls. Those barriers around parliament, by the way, are still there to this day.
 2.25pm Refalo from the AG's office says that the evidence consists of the  proces verbal just presented.
 His reply triggers some ripples of laughter among the defence.
 The AG lawyer seeks to explain: ""There are the conclusions of the inquiring magistrate. Even those 1,200 pages given to all lawyers - and I trust they read them all - are enough. The last 100 pages give conclusions where the magistrate also indicated the amounts representing the illicit gains.""
  2.15pm Lawyer Jason Grima says auditor Chris Spiteri was never given the right to legal assistance, not even when he was a suspect. The magistrate herself told him “you don’t need to get a lawyer.”
 He was, of course, very surprised when a few days later the police went to his offices and seized half those boxes lying before you, Grima tells Magistrate Montebello.
 2.12pm Filletti fires a list of questions about Hillman and the same questions are put to registrar about Muscat. But he cannot answer about any transaction or amounts concerning both Hillman or Muscat.
 Lawyer Edward Gatt asks if the defence will get a copy of the inquiry once it’s been presented in evidence.
 The registrar says they’ve taken measures to ensure those copies are done. But he cannot give an indication how long that will take.
 “I don’t know what’s in those boxes,” Calleja says.
 2.05pm The first witness is the Criminal Courts Registrar Franklin Calleja. He presents the  proces verbal of the inquiry triggered by NGO Repubblika. There are 78 boxes and a number of devices that are separate from those boxes.
 Filletti asks Calleja if he saw the contents. He says he didn't.
 He had testified in some part of the inquiry, adding that on April 25 the inquiry was sent to AG, together with the laptops. They came back to court from AG on May 24.
 ""Do you know what happened to those acts while at the AG office?""
 ""No.""
 ""So there’s a gap during which the court did not have control over those devices?""
 ""No.""
 Filletti is heard raising his voice - and he has no choice - the crowd outside court is getting rowdy again.
  2pm Debono says Sciacca Grill was not mentioned anywhere in the inquiry, but the AG deemed fit to hang a €20 million freezing order over the company.
 ""All those boxes do not impress me! We don’t know what those boxes contain. Dr Refalo should state under oath how that request for 20 million emerges. They were not spoken to, no disclosure. Here we’re talking about fundamental rights,"" the lawyer charges.
 Refalo says he has nothing to add. 
 All defence teams agree that the AG should substantiate the request for the freezing order. The court deems that it should hear evidence in support of that claim. 
 1.55pm The magistrate points out that the court cannot reject the request but must issue a temporary freezing order.
 AG lawyer Refalo says the amounts were gleaned through the 1,200-page inquiry as well as an indication by the inquiring magistrate.
 1.40pm Meanwhile, inside court the lawyers are persisting over the arguments related to the freezing order. 
 Lawyer Jason Grima says Jonathan Vella’s case is even worse. There’s not one single line in the 1,200-page inquiry which says that he took one cent. But the AG wants a freezing order of €30 million.
 Franco Debono adds that it’s rather amazing how the AG could have read all those pages of the inquiry in a matter of days. The formerly draconian law on freezing orders was changed but the effects of the law are still basically unchanged.
 Tonna Lowell, representing Brian Tonna and Cini says that the two and Nexia made no illicit gains, according to the inquiry report.
 ""But here the AG officials are telling the court to ignore all this and issue freezing orders for the amounts they’re citing. Before taking that decision, the court should hear the prosecution explain how they got those amounts.""
 Speaking on behalf of Meli and Gatt, Giannella de Marco says that when the AG asks for such freezing orders, first they must indicate on what basis they’re basing that claims.
 ""One cannot just uphold the request by seeing all these boxes here. They must show that the funds actually went through their [accused’s] accounts.""
 1.40pm Meanwhile, Opposition leader Bernard Grech has labelled Muscat and Co “political pirates” for their roles in the hospitals deal and slammed the prime minister for continually jumping to their defence.
 “You deserve better than a government whose mind is occupied with defending those who’ve robbed you. You deserve better than a Prime Minister that has lost so much control over his own party members that they’re out protesting against his will,” he said.
 The PN leader is expected to hold a televised address at 2.15pm
  1.35pm Lawyer Filletti steps in too. He says the defence were only given conclusions of the inquiry. The request for freezing order did not come from the inquiry but from the AG.
 ""So that means that the AG went through all the inquiry and came up with the amounts to be frozen. There’s not one euro attributed to misappropriation by Hillman. So how can the AG say that Hillman made 30 million in illicit gains?,"" he says.
 Lawyer Arthur Azzopardi agrees with his colleagues’ arguments. In case of Bondin, he is hit by a €12 million freeze but the inquiry only mentioned €2 million.
 1.30pm First witness is a representative from the tax commissioner. 
 But lawyer Franco Debono, defending Sciacca Grill Litd, interrupts. The freezing order request should be tackled first, before hearing the witness, he says. The police had not spoken to his client, and the letter of rights not given. 
 ""We’re not talking about minimal amounts here, but millions,"" Debono argues.
 The AG lawyer disagrees: it should first be the witnesses, then that request.
 ""It’s for consistency’s sake. We should follow chronological order as is normally done.""
 Lawyer Edward Gatt has something to add. He says the AG will now present the proces verbal and the duty for disclosure lies with the AG.
 ""Schembri and Mizzi had asked the court to order the AG to grant full disclosure. The prosecutor has now said that he will support the charges and request the freezing order with further evidence. So far, the defence was not given anything, not even the appendices to the proces verbal,"" he tells the court.
 ""How can we challenge the amounts to be frozen without having seen that evidence?"" Gatt argues.
 The magistrate does not accept that argument.
 ""Under what legal provision do you expect all evidence beforehand?"" she says.
 1.10pm All those in the court room are pleading not guilty to the charges levelled out.
 When asked to enter his plea, Muscat says: ""absolutely not guilty"".
 The representatives of the companies charged also plead not guilty. 
 1pm The prosecution’s requests for an attachment and freezing order for each person charged - and the amounts are massive: It's €30 million for Muscat, Mizzi, Schembri, Spiteri, Vella, Hillman and Sladden; €32 million for Meli; €20 million each for Tonna, Cini; €11 million for Vassallo; €7 million for Gatt; €12 million for bondin; €1 million for Conger Thompson .
 The prosecution also requested partial or general interdiction in case of finding guilt.
 12.50pm If you're just catching up, we are waiting until the charges continue to be read out in court. It's an unprecedented case in our legal history, so it's no surprise to see dozens of comments posted on social media.
 Academic and radio presenter Andrew Azzopardi said it is no longer a case of 'PN vs PL' but one of 'good vs bad'. 
  12.30pm Our reporters Daniel Ellul and Mark Laurence Zammit tried to elicit some comments from the supporters present. The verdict is that Muscat is completely innocent and cannot believe the former prime minister is facing justice after all the good he has done.
 We have an updated vox pop here. 
  12.25pm We've compiled a clip showing former chief of staff Keith Schembri arriving in court. Schembri is charged with several crimes over the hospitals' deal. 
  12.20pm Meanwhile, the charges are being read against the accused. Our court reporter (and lawyer) Edwina says it's the longest charge sheet she's ever come across!
 We are not bothering to repeat it here because they're explained (in hopefully simpler terms) at the beginning of this blog post. 
 12.05pm Manuel Cuschieri, the radio presenter who organised today's demonstration, has made an exit.
 He declined to answer reporters' questions as he walked through Republic Street and away from the law courts, but there was no shortage of Labour supporters rushing to shake his hand, squeeze his shoulder or applaud him. One of Cuschieri's minders tried to confront journalists, but Cuschieri quickly stopped him.
  European Parliament president Roberta Metsola weighs into the discussion after the demonstration outside court. 
 ""The scenes outside the law courts today are not what Malta should be about... We need real leadership. We need this constant Government-fuelled tribalism to stop. Our politics needs to go beyond the Prime Minister's hyper-partisanship,"" she writes on social media. 
  11.51am Meanwhile, outside the court room the sizeable crowd is dispersing, with many seeking shade. Some will probably stay on site to greet Muscat upon exit. 
 Daphne's memorial appears untouched, with candles still burning, despite having been surrounded by supporters. Our reporters heard several curses towards the slain journalist though.
  11.50am The AG starts off with Joseph Muscat's criminal record and money laundering investigation order, then onto Mizzi, Schembri, Conger Thompson and Christopher Spiteri.
 The magistrate initials and numbers each batch of documents. Next up are Jonathan Vella, David Joseph Meli, Ivan Vassallo, Mario Victor Gatt, Brian Bondin, Adrian Hillman, Pierre Sladden, Brian Tonna and Karl Cini.
 Now details are taken of the companies facing the music, including Sciacca Grill, Kasco Engineering Ltd, FSV Limited, MTrace plc, Gateway Solutions Ltd, Technoline Ltd, Eurybates Ltd, Taomac and Nexia BT.
 11.45am Lawyer Filletti says Hillman came to Malta out of his own will and was declaring that he renounced from the start his 'right of speciality' (which requests the State that the offender is tried only for the offence for which extradition is granted). Since he lives in the UK, he came to Malta voluntarily to contest the charges.
 11.40am The magistrate warns everyone that these are judicial proceedings and all those in the hall must behave properly. No signs of disapproval will be tolerated.
 Court says lawyers must address the court in an orderly manner. One lawyer from each team is to make submissions/questions to the  court. The magistrate insists on order in the sequence of persons charged as listed on the charge sheet.
 This is not an ordinary case and proceedings have to be conducted in an orderly manner. Given the large number of persons charged and lawyers involved, the court has set some guidelines at the very start.
 11.35am The magistrate takes her seat. There are 78 boxes of evidence positioned in front of the deputy’s bench. 
 The magistrate is taking down the accused’s attendance, reading out each name. 
 11.30am The attention now shifts to the court room. Journalists are on one side of the room, the families of the accused on the other. Magistrate Rachel Montebello warns there should be no photos taken. 
 The defence teams include Stefano Filletti, Jason Grima, Arthur Azzopardi, Sean Zammit, Mark Vassallo, Edward Gatt, Marion Camilleri, Franco Debono and Chris Cilia, Dean Hili, Veronique Dalli, Andre’ Portelli, Giannella De Marco, Charles Mercieca, Stephen Tonna Lowell, Luke Dalli, Vincent Galea, Rachel Powell, Charlon Gouder, Dominic Micallef, Ishmael Psaila and Etienne Borg Ferranti, Shazoo Ghaznavi, David Bonello, Alex Scerri Herrera, Jessica Formosa and Jeannine Depasquale.
 The prosecution are on the opposite side. There are Attorney General lawyers Francesco Refalo, Rebekah Spiteri, Shelby Aquilina and Anthony Vella, and superintendents Fabian Fleri and Hubert Cini and inspector Wayne Rodney Borg.
  11.15am We were expecting this to happen, but the court building is now packed with people. The area outside Hall 22 is milling with people: persons charged, their legal teams, police, securities, family, media... For lawyers getting through a normal workday it's a headache.
  11am As expected, Muscat's arrival outside court is greeted with a roar, with many chanting ""Joseph, Joseph"" before breaking into the Labour Party anthem. He is accompanied by Michelle, his wife. 
 We apologise for the poor connection during our Facebook live stream. It was out of our control. Here are some other clips:
   10.55am To chants of 'viva l-Labour', former health minister Konrad Mizzi is given a rapturous welcome as he arrives outside court. Mizzi resigned in disgrace in 2019 and has since been accused of multiple crimes. 
 Speaking to reporters outside court, Mizzi lashes out at the magistrate's inquiry, saying it is full of conjectures, biased and lies and that he never received any money.
   10.35am  Mark Laurence Zammit has spoken to Muscat supporters outside court. All of them say they have no doubt the former prime minister is innocent. But the focus is more of the ""good"" he's done for the country.
  10.30am Daphne Caruana Galizia's sister Mandy Mallia writes on social media: ""Daphne always - correctly - said that there are ‘two Maltas’.  Today, there is further proof of it in the hundreds who have turned up outside court in support of disgraced prime minister #JosephMuscat, who is facing a raft of serious criminal charges.""
  Nationalist MEP David Casa also pays tribute to Caruana Galizia. 
  10.15am Meanwhile outside court hall 22, there are a number of familiar faces: Adrian Hillman, Brian Tonna, Karl Cini, Christopher Spiteri, David Joseph Meli, Pierre Sladden and Brian Bondin. They are all seated and the atmosphere is tense. 
 Interesting to note that some of the persons charged today are still going through criminal proceedings linked to separate money laundering charges which started three years ago. 
  10.05am Magistrate Rachel Montebello has turned down a request by Repubblika to be admitted as injured party in the proceedings. 
 For Repubblika’s application to succeed it had to show a concrete and identifiable interest and that it is ‘injured’ by the crimes allegedly committed. This is even more so in proceedings like these where some of the persons charged held top government posts. 
 The applicant had to show an identifiable interest including physical, material, social or emotional damage, or direct or indirect financial loss, the magistrate said.
 In this case, the identifiable victim directly targeted by the commission of the alleged crimes is none other than the State itself or, as far as alleged misappropriation or illegal profits are concerned, the government.
  10am Our journalist Jacob Borg asked Keith Schembri why he was using a fake e-mail to communicate with Vitals. He got no response. 
  9.55am Our journalist Mark Laurence Zammit is trying to get comments from the crowd. The verdict is that Muscat did no wrong and that just like Christ, ""he's being crucified"".
 Here's a sample of what we have so far. We'll be bringing you a full clip shortly. 
  9.40am We have reporters outside court and we're being told the crowd's really riled up. There's a strong police presence outside - with one officer assigned to each journalist on duty. 
  9.30am Our court reporter Edwina Brincat says a number of those to be charged are already inside the halls of court. These include Pierre Sladden, Brian Bondin, Ivan Vassallo and Adrian Hillman. 
  9.20am Muscat's supporters have been told to gather in support at 10am but a sizeable number are already outside the law courts in Republic Street. 
 Chants of ""viva l-Labour"" and ""ġo kastilja ma tidħlux"" (you will never enter Castille) echo through the area.
   9am Activists from Occupy Justice spruced up the memorial to assassinated journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia on Monday night - the monument lies right in front of the court entrance - where a number of those she wrote about will enter to face justice. 
  8.50am There has been palpable anger in the run-up to today's arraignments. Many have expressed their disgust over the way money intended to be routed towards health services have ended up routed elsewhere.
 Former PD deputy leader Anthony Buttigieg, a doctor, summed up the sentiments of many through a Facebook post. 
  
 Charges have been issued by the Republic of Malta vs Joseph Muscat and co.
 All 14 individuals and nine companies stand charged with money laundering. They are variously charged with misappropriation, fraud, making fraudulent gains, involvement in a criminal association, setting up a group of more than 10 to commit a crime subject to imprisonment of more than four years. 
 Muscat, Schembri and Mizzi sought or accepted bribes, money or other advantages. 
 Schembri is separately charged as chief of staff for soliciting money or other benefits he was not entitled to. He is also charged with openly or secretly taking private interests in a tender or contract, leaking confidential information and committing crimes he was duty bound to prevent. 
 David Meli allegedly bribed Muscat, Schembri and Mizzi.
 Tonna and Cini allegedly assisted Muscat in receiving those bribes. They also assisted Muscat, Schembri and Mizzi in trading in influence. 
 Thompson and Spiteri allegedly accepted bribes. Spiteri, as auditor, made false declarations in a public document, divulged professional secrets, made under-declarations for tax purposes on behalf of Shaukat Ali and his relatives. He also breached accountancy laws, committed document fraud and committed perjury when testifying in the magisterial inquiry. 
 All persons and companies will be jointly and variously charged under summons, not arrest. They must all be present for the case to take off. The court can issue an arrest warrant against any of those who fail to turn up when duly notified. 
  In 2015, the government signed a multi-billion agreement to redevelop and operate three public hospitals with a private company called Vitals Global Healthcare (VGH) Ltd, a company with no previous experience. 
 Deadlines for several projects are missed as questions are asked over whether the investors can deliver on their pledges.
 The National Audit Office said in 2020 that the government’s work to verify the deal with VGH and its capacity to run three public hospitals was “grossly inadequate”.
 The contract was transferred in 2018 to a US company named Steward Health Care.
 That same year, then PN leader Adrian Delia files a court case to rescind the concession. The case would eventually conclude in February 2023, with the courts cancelling the deal altogether, describing it as ""fraudulent"".
 
 A Times of Malta investigation last year showed Muscat got close to €482,000 in various consultancy payments in year of resignation.
 Fast forward to earlier this month and a magisterial inquiry - four years in the making - recommended serious charges against a number of high-profile individuals and companies, sparking a political war. 
 The last of three reports by the auditor general published revealed that a total of €456 million was paid to Vitals and Steward throughout the concession period. Investigators believe Vitals – and later Steward – stakeholders had no intention of running Maltese hospitals for the 30-year lease period they agreed to.
 Last Sunday, our online editor Bertrand Borg pieced together the complex web of the deal, which appeared designed to divert public money into private pockets.
 This included a catering company suspected to be involved in a 10% kickback scheme, a medical equipment supplier which had hidden owners, and a secret shareholder who received monthly €100,000 consultancy payments.
 All those charged deny wrongdoing.

Pregnant woman and man admit to using forged documents to flee Malta,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/132608/pregnant_woman_and_man_admit_to_using_forged_documents_to_flee_malta,04-12-2024,006505.png,"Two individuals have admitted to using forged documents to flee Malta for a better life in Belgium, after being arrested at the Malta International Airport during a temporary reintroduction of border control.

 Police Inspector Karl Roberts gave a description of what happened to the Court. He explained that two individuals, Sarah Kebe, and Mouri Kuruma, were arrested on 4 December 2024 at around 5:40am at the Malta International Airport. This came after the temporary lifting of Schengen Area travel to ensure public order and security surrounding the 31st Ministerial Council of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE).

                     Kebe and Kuruma were both arrested after they were caught using Gambian passports issued for other persons, and “completely counterfeit” Italian Identity Cards, as recalled by the police inspector.

 They were subsequently taken to the nearest police station, where they admitted to the acts which they had done. Both of the accused individuals said that they wanted to flea Malta, with Kuruma mentioning that there was a language barrier since he only speaks French and is unable to understand Maltese.

 The inspector said “they both wanted to flee Malta for a better life in Belgium” whilst describing what the accused said in their statements at the Police Station.

 Upon being examined by the Court, both Kebe and Kuruma pleaded guilty, and upon the Court asking them a second and third time, they confirmed their pleas.

 It was revealed by the prosecution that the woman, Kebe, was pregnant, however the inspector stated, “The law is equal to everyone, even though the woman is pregnant”.

 He mentioned that there is a medical team at the Corradino Correctional Facility which is there to assist women who are pregnant whilst undergoing an imprisonment sentence. The prosecution was therefore of the opinion that there should be an effective jail sentence nonetheless.

 This is an ongoing case and the accused individuals will be sentenced at a later date.

 The prosecution was led by Inspector Karl Roberts.     ",Jordan Pace ,court_and_police
Magistrate orders police to identify and investigate public officials behind Siġġiewi voter fraud,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/129209/magistrate_orders_police_to_identify_and_investigate_public_officials_behind_siggiewi_voter_fraud,15-05-2024,006509.png,"A magistrate has ordered the police to investigate and identify the public officials and entities who had manipulated voters into changing their address to a Siġġiewi construction site ahead of the upcoming local council and EU elections.
 The order was handed down by Magistrate Donatella Frendo Dimech, in her capacity as the Revisory Official in several cases filed by the PN, in which the party is requesting the revocation of the recent changes in address of several voters.
 Last week, Magistrate Frendo Dimech had conducted an in-person site visit to see for herself before taking into account the PN’s claim that the Binja Silvio Parnis housing project in Siggiewi, where 99 voters from other districts had been registered as residing, was actually uninhabitable.
 When the cases were called on Wednesday afternoon, a police officer stationed at Żebbuġ was called to the witness stand to exhibit bodycam footage showing the magistrate’s site visit at the housing project.
  The court, after thanking the officer and sending him on his way, proceeded to hand down judgement.
 Ruling that there “could be no doubt” that the voters in question had not taken the initiative to register themselves at the specified address, the magistrate said that it was “shameful that they had been taken advantage of and manipulated by people who were entrusted with looking after their interests and wellbeing.”

 The magistrate said that is was disconcerting that one of the voters had been promised social housing in October 2021, but was only allocated an apartment earlier this year with contracts still being drawn up.
 She also expressed concern at the involvement of Malita Investments PLC - a company set up to build social housing in Malta, in which the Government is the majority shareholder and which has five of the seven-strong board of directors, appointed by the Government.
 Noting that the law speaks of the ordinary place of residence in deciding which electoral district voters fell under, the court said it had “seen first hand that nobody lived there, be it ordinarily or extraordinarily and that the occupants had not even been given the keys to the properties, which were meant to be handed over upon signing the contract.”
 A witness from the Identita’ agency had confirmed that it had been officials from Malita’s CEO Jennifer Falzon who had contacted Identita' to send officials on site to meet the persons allocated apartments in the block, “precisely inside room 711 in entrance 7,” in order to change their ID card address. “The haste with which this change of address was carried out is evidenced by the fact that many of the required fields are blank, but they were nonetheless accepted by Identita.” Every application for connection to the water and electricity service with ARMS had also been submitted by Falzon herself, said the magistrate, submitted two days before the electoral application was filed and at least 48 hours later, the apartment had been connected to the water and electricity grid.
 Frendo Dimech expressed astonishment at the extraordinary efficiency with which the change of address had been processed, and quipped that she hoped that this efficiency would be applied to every applicant going forward.
 The electors who were sent to change their ID card address when their ordinary place of residence was still not habitable had effectively been induced into making a false declaration to a public authority, observed the magistrate.
 “False declarations to a public authority are a crime and it is worrying that electors had been instructed to make illegal declarations, potentially making them complicit in the crimes mentioned.”
 The magistrate also ordered that copies of the judgement be served on the commissioner of police and recommended perjury charges against one applicant, who had lied under oath when he told the court that he had a key and had signed the contract “around a week or two” before giving evidence in court.
 The PN’s requests were upheld and the changes in address were revoked, with the magistrate also ordering the Electoral Commission to review the electoral register to reflect this.  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police
Man accused of raping his ex when she called for her ring,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/man-accused-raping-ex-called-ring.1091716,29-04-2024,006524.png,"A man who allegedly raped his ex-partner when she went to his apartment to collect her engagement ring after their break-up, was denied bail on Monday. 
 The woman turned up at St Julian’s police station on Saturday, claiming that her former fiancé had raped her. 
 The two had been engaged for a couple of years and ever since breaking up they remained in an “on-and-off relationship” for the past six months or so, occasionally also having consensual sex. 
 But that was not the case last Friday, the prosecution explained when charging the man in court. 
 The alleged victim went to the St Julian’s apartment at around 6am to collect her engagement ring, having forwarded the agreed amount of some €400 beforehand. 
 When she told him she wanted to leave, he allegedly grabbed her and raped her.
 The man, a 27-year-old Norwegian i-gaming employee, pleaded not guilty to non-consensual sex, holding his ex against her will, slightly injuring her, attempting to use force against her, insulting and threatening her as well as causing her to fear violence. 
 The prosecution objected to bail because of the early stage of the proceedings, the serious nature of the charges, the fact that the main witness is still to testify and also the risk of tampering. 
 His lawyer, Franco Debono, countered that not only was the accused gainfully occupied and living in Malta but the case presented conflicting versions.
 The accused claimed that the woman did what she did after he refused to see her any longer because she was “seeing other men”.
 Moreover, she had testified before the inquiring magistrate and could not testify again unless authorised by the court. 
 Throughout the hearing the man was seen in tears, turning round to make eye contact with a woman seated behind him, occasionally taking her hand until the magistrate ordered him to sit properly. 
 Magistrate Caroline Farrugia Frendo turned down the bail request and issued a ban on the names of both parties, because of the sensitivity of the case.

"Attempted murder trial: 'If the brick hit him it would've split him in two,' forensic expert says",maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/132648/attempted_murder_trial_if_the_brick_hit_him_it_wouldve_split_him_in_two_forensic_expert_says,06-12-2024,006526.png,"The Court has heard graphic details of the attack on Mario Grech, including evidence of bricks and oil being hurled into a courtyard, raising questions about the speed of the thrown objects and the potential consequences.

 The trial of Paul Borg, accused of attempted murder in a violent courtyard attack in Żebbuġ, has seen disputes over video footage and expert analysis of the speed and force of objects hurled at the victim.

                     The case goes back to 12 September 2020 when at around 10:30am at a residence in Żebbuġ, the victim was sitting in the courtyard of his son's residence doing some work on the ladder on a wall separating the property from that of the accused. Borg allegedly climbed onto the roof leading into the courtyard where Grech was working and hurdled several objects.

 The Court continued to hear more testimonies on Friday. A doctor from the health centre explained the injuries suffered by Mario Grech when he was allegedly beaten by the Borg family. He said that he had several bruises and cuts on his head, some of which had to be closed with stitches.

 A worker who was at the residence on the day of the attempted murder also testified. He said that he was in the garage when he suddenly heard some shouting.

 “At first I didn’t go out into the yard to see what was happening but the shouting increased and when I did, I saw two bricks on the ground, some broken floor tiles and black oil in the pool” the witness recounted. He went on to say that he immediately saw the accused throwing another can of oil and the police ordered him to stop throwing things.

 The jurors also heard the testimony of the carpenter who carried out restoration work on the openings and the front door of the residence. During cross-examination, the defence raised doubts about the ‘quotation’ made by the carpenter because instead of a signature, he put down a ‘carpenter’s signature’. The witness replied that he wrote such a quotation but could not remember how he signed it.

 An engineer appointed as a technical expert by the Court testified that he was hired to determine the speed of the bricks when they were thrown, particularly the one that passed near the victim. He explained that from the security camera footage he could see the height of the wall, because part of the rows were exposed. It was seen how the footage was recorded at “30 frames per second” and the height of the wall is 6.92 meters. When he made his calculations, it turned out that from the roof to the floor, the brick did not take a second to arrive but took a little less than half a second.

 The defence and the jurors raised doubts about the amount of frames in the footage because yesterday the Court-appointed expert on videography testified that the footage is eight frames per second. The jurors asked the engineer how accurate the system by which he established the amount of ‘frames’ in the video is. The witness replied that the system is “very accurate” but lawyer Mark Vassallo disagreed and said that when he himself checked the ‘properties’ of the video he found that it has eight ‘frames per second’ as the videography expert had said.

 The defence asked the Court to have the video uploaded onto a ‘laptop’ and the ‘properties’ of the video checked immediately, in order to establish such an issue. The Court granted the request, and it resulted that the video has eight frames per second. In light of this, the engineer explained that this means that the 30th frame showed eight different images in the video. The defence did not agree with this argument.

 The last witness of the trial was Mario Scerri, appointed as a forensic doctor by the Court.

 “If the brick had hit him, it could have split him in two,” Scerri testified without hesitation. He explained that after watching the video and a copy of the engineer’s report, from that height, with that speed and with the force that the accused used when throwing the brick, it would have had fatal consequences.

 The prosecution is being led by lawyer Ramon Bonett Sladden and Darlene Grima on behalf of the Attorney General's Office.

Drunk football fan damages 17 cars in Swieqi rampage after his team drew,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/drunk-football-fan-damages-17-cars-rampage-team-drew-euros.1094115,18-06-2024,006551.png,"A man went on a drunken rampage on Sunday, causing damage to 17 vehicles after his football team ended the match in a draw. 
 Johannes Herfuld Molgaard Trosborg, a 27-year-old Danish customer service employee working in gaming, landed in hot water after watching his national team held to a 1-1 draw by Slovenia in a European Championship on Sunday evening. 
 After the match, he allegedly went on an alcohol-fueled spree on the streets of Swieqi, leaving 17 damaged vehicles in his wake. 
 Still wearing his team’s red and white colours, the now-sober youth was escorted to court on Tuesday, charged with wilfully damaging the string of vehicles and disobeying lawful police orders.
 He was also charged with being drunk in public and wilfully disturbing the public peace. 
 The accused, appearing at the docket dishevelled and one left-hand finger bandaged, pleaded guilty after consulting his legal aid lawyer. 
 He confirmed his “guilty” plea after being given time to reconsider. 
 The prosecution said that the accused had cooperated fully and had registered an admission at the earliest stage. 
 In view of that, they suggested a suspended sentence and a fine as punishment. 
 Defence lawyer, Ingrid Zammit Young, explained that the accused was drunk at the time.
 “He’s very sorry for what he did,” said the lawyer, adding that the accused was willing to cover all damages he had caused. 
 “Do you still confirm?” asked the court. 
 “Yes,” replied the accused. 
 After hearing submissions Magistrate Caroline Farrugia Frendo condemned the youth to an 18-month jail term suspended for four years and a fine of €150.
 The court observed that it could not order the accused to pay damages since there was nothing in the records of the case about the amount of damages wreaked.
 The prosecution said that they were not yet in a position to quantify the damages. 
 “Drink with moderation…Don’t get drunk again,” warned the magistrate after handing down judgment, explaining that the suspended sentence was applicable in any other EU member state. 
 “I will go to treatment,” said the accused.
 “Good. I’m happy to hear that,” was the court’s final word.

Man remanded in custody after drugs found during Paola traffic stop,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/132357/man_arrested_in_paola_after_traffic_stop_uncovers_suspected_drugs,19-11-2024,006555.png,"A 22-year-old man from Valletta was remanded in custody after police found drugs suspected to be cocaine, heroin, and cannabis during a traffic stop in Paola.

 Kyle Pace has been arrested following the discovery of suspected drugs hidden in his trousers and in his car during a police traffic check in Paola. The court denied bail, citing fears of further offences and evidence tampering.

                     The accused, Kyle Pace, a 22-year-old man residing in Valletta, was arrested after being found in possession of several packets containing substances suspected to be cocaine and heroin, as well as packets of suspected cannabis.

 The inspector recalled how on 17 November 2024 at around 3:30pm, during a traffic check carried out on Triq Giuseppe Garibaldi in Paola, police noticed a vehicle whose driver, upon seeing the officers, reversed into a field entrance and stopped.

 The officers immediately approached the vehicle, and the driver informed the police that he did not have a driving license. Due to reasonable suspicion, a search was conducted in the vehicle, where the police found two packets of suspected cannabis as well as a sum of cash of around €1,400.

 Subsequently, as the officers were about to search the man, he took out two bags hidden in his trousers and threw them into a nearby water reservoir. These bags were immediately retrieved by the police and were found to contain several packets with white and brown substances suspected to be cocaine and heroin.

 The man was arrested on the spot, and a recount of the total amount of substance found was taken. 

 The accused’s mother along with his girlfriend were present in court, both of which highly emotional throughout the entire proceeding.

 The defence did not contest the validity of the arrest of the accused. The accused pleaded not guilty, and the defence requested the release of the accused’s arrest.

 The prosecution objected on the fact that there is an aggravated possession of drugs, and in the case of a guilt, the accused faces an incarceration term not possible suspended. There is a magisterial inquiry which is currently ongoing, and there are fears that the accused might commit another crime. The prosecution voiced fears of the tampering of evidence due to the very early stage of the entire case. 

 The prosecution further added that the accused is untrustworthy after throwing two bags, containing several packets with white and brown substances suspected to be cocaine and heroin, hidden in his trousers and threw them into a nearby water reservoir.

 The defence counter-argued that there is an open magisterial inquiry. “The evidence is preserved” lawyer Amadeus Cachia said, further saying that there is no question over the fear of the tampering of evidence.

 The Court ordered a freezing order on the accused’s assets and rejected the defence’s request for bail. The accused was thus remanded in custody until a compilation of evidence for this case proceeds. 

 This is an ongoing case.

 Issam Jamaano Alhaj Yousef, a 26-year-old Syrian national from Żebbuġ, was arrested following a report by his ex who claimed that he had been insulting and threatening her.
 During a risk assessment, the alleged victim also claimed that her ex had been harassing her ever since they broke up some two months ago.
 The estranged couple had exchanged some messages.
 The alleged victim, an MCAST student, claimed that her ex had once turned up at the college to look for her. On that occasion he was escorted out by security, she told police.
 Matters appear to have come to a head on Monday in an incident that allegedly also involved the alleged victim’s mother. A police report was filed against the youth.
 On Friday, Yousef was charged with causing his former girlfriend to fear violence, harassing, insulting and threatening her.
 He pleaded not guilty.
 During the hearing, prosecuting Inspector Antonello Magri confirmed that the defendant had filed a police report some three or four weeks ago against his ex’s family.
 The couple had apparently been in an on-off relationship but her family expected him to marry her.
 In his statement prior to today’s arraignment, Yousef gave his version of Monday’s incident.
 He said that he had been driving in the area of Ħamrun and Pieta’ when he crossed paths with his ex’s mother who was driving her car. The woman looked daggers at him.
 She then tailgated him, he claimed.
 The woman called him later and he could hear his ex shouting insults in the background. Her family had even threatened to “have him deported,” Yousef claimed.
 At his arraignment, his lawyers requested bail.
 The defendant had been living in Malta for the last ten years and had filed a report against his ex’s family weeks ago.
 However, the prosecution objected to bail mainly because the alleged victim and other civilian witnesses were still to testify.
 In light of such objections the court, presided over by Magistrate Noel Bartolo, turned down the request.
 Lawyers Franco Debono, Marion Camilleri and Adreana Zammit are defence counsel.
 Lawyer Noel Bianco appeared parte civile.

New law will allow Daniel Meli to contest US extradition,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/new-law-allow-daniel-meli-contest-us-extradition.1096872,18-08-2024,006577.png,"The government is drafting legislation that would allow Daniel Joe Meli to contest his extradition to the US, where he is wanted to face charges of selling  hacking equipment on the dark web.
 Legislators plan to introduce procedural safeguards on extradition, allowing a wanted person “adequate time” to reflect before deciding whether to accept being extradited to face trial in a foreign country, according to government sources.
 The new law would include a transitory provision, allowing Meli, currently remanded in custody at Corradino Correctional Facility, to have his extradition case heard again, sources said.
 The government told Times of Malta that it is  evaluating all legal parameters to ensure that those who break the law in Malta face justice locally.
 It would also ensure stronger safeguards in the process through which a person voluntarily agrees to be extradited, the government said.
 The plan comes as 27-year-old Meli faces extradition to the United States after a grand jury in Georgia issued a bill of indictment over alleged malware sales on the dark web between December 2012 and June 2022.
 Meli was arraigned in February and initially consented to the extradition, but later retracted his consent after hiring new lawyers who argued that the Magistrates’ Court had not verified whether he was medically fit and capable of understanding his decision.
  His new lawyers, Franco Debono and Arthur Azzopardi, have filed constitutional proceedings as they seek to stave off their client’s extradition.
 In those proceedings, Meli’s lawyers argue that fundamental human rights must be considered in extradition cases, including the requirement that the individual understands the implications of an extradition request.
 The new law would legislate those provisions into law and supersede the constitutional court case.
 For Meli to avail of that law, parliament would have to pass new legislation ideally before the constitutional court makes a final decision in his case.
 On Friday, the Nationalist Party said Meli should not be extradited to the US and should face trial in Malta instead.
 They said the government should not simply accept Maltese citizens being extradited overseas to be indicted in a foreign court when it is clear that the crimes that the person is being investigated over were committed in Malta.
 In their statement, the government acknowledged the PN’s suggestion and reiterated it was closely following the case.

 Petronela-Claudia Ciubotariu, a Romanian nail technician who has no fixed place of residence, had been charged with committing thefts from 20 victims, as well as money laundering. The woman had stolen thousands of euros in cash and other items over the span of just over two weeks - between June 8 and 23. She was also charged with money laundering.
  The woman, whose total haul amounted to some €7,025 in cash, had targeted shoppers at shops in Burmarrad, St Paul’s Bay, Mdina, and Valletta, had been apprehended at the airport while trying to leave the country.
 Ciubotariu, who initially denied the charges, subsequently reversed her plea and admitted guilt, which she confirmed after being given time to rethink her decision.
 The woman had no prior convictions in Malta, and some of her loot had been returned to their rightful owners, magistrate Kevan Azzopardi observed in his sentencing considerations, also taking into account her cooperation with the police.
 The court sentenced Ciubotariu to imprisonment for 15 months and ordered the confiscation of the €7,025, as well as the return of the stolen items to the payment of their value.

Wanted Romanian prince detained in Malta after arrest over corruption,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/wanted-romanian-prince-detained-malta-arrest-corruption.1091703,29-04-2024,006627.png,"A Romanian prince convicted of corruption has been detained in Malta after he was arrested while visiting the country for an event organised by the Knights of Malta.
 Prince Paul-Philippe fled Romania in 2020 when he was convicted and sentenced to almost 3.5 years in prison for corruption related to the illegal restitution of real estate near Bucharest, to which he falsely claimed ownership.
 The 75-year-old was arrested in Malta on Sunday on the strength of a European Arrest Warrant and taken to court on Monday, where he was denied bail due to the seriousness of the charges against him.
 Appearing in court accompanied by his wife Lia, he gave his profession as a ""member of royal family""and said that he was residing in Paris. 
 He objected to the extradition.
 His lawyer Jason Azzopardi told the court he had been in Malta for an event organized by the Knights of Malta and was “humiliated in front of dignitaries from all over Europe"" during his arrest on Sunday evening. 
 Prosecuting inspector Roderick Spiteri presented documents including the European Arrest Warrant, digital copies of judgments and the Attorney General's certificate greenlighting the request.
 The prosecution presented a fingerprints sample sent by the Romanian authorities along with a photo of the wanted man to prove the arrested man was the prince.
 The inspector told the court the accused is wanted for corruption to serve a jail term of three years and four months.
 Defence lawyer Jason Azzopardi said that the prince understands what he is wanted for but although documents said so at face value, ""that document was politically motivated.""
 The lawyer rebutted that the European Arrest Warrant is based on corruption allegations in Romania. He presented a decision by the Court of Appeal in Paris last year, concluding that there was systematic failure of the system in Romania.
 In June 2022, he was apprehended on the street in Paris but the Paris Court of Appeals refused to extradite him to Romania.
 Azzopardi described the European Arrest Warrant as an act of ""vindictiveness"" by the prince's enemies in his homeland. 
 The defence also presented evidence of decisions handed down by the courts in Paris last year, declaring the arrest warrant as ""nonsense"", Azzopardi claimed. 
 “This shows how a serious European country, namely France, dealt with the illegal request for the arrest of this gentleman,"" he said.
 A decision handed down by the Court of Appeal was confirmed by the Court of Cassation and that in itself was ""quite exceptional"".
 His lawyers offered a fixed address at a Valletta residence belonging to a Marquis. It was just round the corner from the police station and the prince was willing to go sign the bail book “even three times daily” if necessary. 
 But the court presided by Magistrate Caroline Farrugia Frendo still turned down the request after the prosecution objected to the seriousness of the charges and the fact that the defendant is wanted to serve a sentence. 
 The court declared that European Arrest Warrants were “sui generis” (particular) proceedings.
 In comments following the case, the Sovereign Military Hospitaller Order of St John of Jerusalem of Rhodes and of Malta moved to clarify that the prince had no links to them.
 ""Prince Paul is not a member of our order and has never been invited to any of our events,"" the Ambassador of the Sovereign Order, Augusto Ruffo di Calabria told Times of Malta.
 The Sovereign Military Order of Malta claims continuity with the original Knights Hospitaller.
 Prince Paul was convicted in December 2020 for buying influence and complicity in the crime of abuse of office against the public interest. 
 He was found to have been involved in the illegal restitution and then sale of land in an upmarket area near Bucharest that belonged to his family before it was nationalized by the communists.
 Romania's High Court found that the scheme cost the Romanian state more than €145 million.
 Although he is known as Prince Paul or Prince Paul-Philippe of Romania, his claim to the throne is disputed.
 He is the grandson of King Carol II of Romania, through a commoner Zizi Lambrino, in a union that only lasted one year before it was annulled in 1919.
 He was never acknowledged by Romania’s last king, Michael I, who died in 2017 and was was the son of Carol II by his next wife, Queen Helena of Greece and Denmark.
 The prince, visibly distraught when his bail request was turned down, was remanded in custody pending continuation of proceedings.
 The case will now be assigned to a different magistrate for a first hearing on May 9. 
 Inspector Roderick Spiteri prosecuted. Lawyers Jason Azzopardi and Kris Busietta were defence counsel.

Man arrested and charged with rape of ex-girlfriend upon return from Sri Lanka,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/129074/man_arrested_and_charged_with_rape_of_exgirlfriend_upon_return_from_sri_lanka,08-05-2024,006640.png,"A man from Gżira was remanded in custody on Tuesday after being charged with the rape of his ex-girlfriend.
 Technician Mathihul Akmal Mohamed Jabir, 32, from Sri Lanka, was arraigned before magistrate Joseph Gatt by police inspectors John Spiteri and Sherona Buhagiar, assisted by prosecutor Cynthia Tomasuolo.
 The magistrate read out the charges and informed the defendant of his rights.
 Jabir is charged with the rape of a woman, understood to be his ex-girlfriend, holding her against her will, subjecting her to a non-consensual sexual act, harassment, causing her to fear violence, stalking her, directing insults and threats at her and misusing electronic telecommunications equipment.
  Inspector Spiteri told the court that the defendant had already left Malta on a flight to Sri Lanka when police officers had initially tried to arrest him. He was detained upon his return.
 The inspector pointed out that the Attorney General had not consented to the case being decided by the Court of Magistrates, meaning that it could potentially be tried by a jury.
 Defence lawyer Joseph Calleja Parnis told the court his client was pleading not guilty and requested bail.
 The bail request met with several objections from the prosecution, which cited the gravity of the offences, the early stage of the proceedings, the fact that the victim had not yet testified and the defendant’s knowledge of where she resided. Besides the risk that he would tamper with evidence, there was also that of him absconding from Malta, as he did not have any strong ties to the islands, argued prosecutor Cynthia Tomasuolo from the Office of the AG.
 Inspector Spiteri concurred. “We understand that he is innocent until proven guilty and that detention should be the exception not the rule, but this is a textbook case of the exception.”
 Malta had no bilateral treaties with Sri Lanka, so should the man abscond there was no way to bring him back to face trial, explained the inspector.
 “It is good to also note that the accused allegedly installed a tracking device on the victim’s vehicle. The fear that this person will interfere with our witnesses is real and manifest,” he concluded.
 Calleja Parnis submitted that the alleged victim had filed a police report on 19 March about harassment, “then this alleged rape came up as a side note, while she was lodging her report with the police.”
 The charges say the alleged rape took place on 24 February, almost a month before the report was filed, added the lawyer. “If she was really serious about this alleged rape, she would have gone to report it there and then or the next day, not a month after and only mention it as an aside.”
 The prosecution disagreed. “First of all to come out and ask why the person didn’t report the rape immediately…marital rape is tough to come to terms with. She reported this because she was totally fed up and unable to continue to handle the behaviour of the accused. On another note, we did have time to collect all the technical evidence but the victim still needs to testify.”
 Calleja Parnis argued this problem would remain if bail were to be granted at a later stage.
 The court denied the request for bail. A protection order was granted in favour of the alleged victim, whose name is subject to a publication ban.

"Man admits to stealing five AC compressors, selling three for scrap metal",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/man-admits-stealing-five-ac-compressors-selling-scrap-metal.1096839,16-08-2024,006647.png,"A man who admitted stealing five air conditioning compressors was remanded in custody along with his alleged partner in crime who insisted she was unaware of the theft.
 Anthony Zammit, a 39-year-old construction worker from Qormi, pleaded guilty to five separate instances of aggravated theft and wilful damage to the property of one of the victims.
 He was also charged with driving without a licence and third-party insurance, and with committing the offences while under a suspended sentence. 
 Police started looking into the matter earlier this month when the owner of an old house in Xgħajra reported a missing ac compressor.
 Similar reports by other property owners followed, with one of the alleged victims claiming the indoor air conditioning unit had also been stolen. Car tyre rims were also reported stolen. 
 Acting on information about a particular vehicle linked to the suspected thefts, police finally tracked down a van near a boċċi club in Qormi. 
 Two of the missing compressors were found inside the van.
 The other three had been sold for scrap metal for a total of €180, explained prosecuting Inspector Kurt Farrugia. 
 The car tyre rims were subsequently found inside a Paola residence where Zammit and his alleged accomplice, 34-year-old unemployed Madeline Cuschieri, were living temporarily. 
 The house key was found in the woman’s possession. 
 Under questioning, Zammit admitted his involvement in the thefts. 
 He confirmed that admission upon arraignment.
 However, his accomplice, who was only charged with handling stolen property and allegedly committing the offence while under a suspended sentence, pleaded not guilty. 
 The prosecution requested the court to authorise the separation of proceedings. Zammit’s case was subsequently put off for judgment, while proceedings against Cuschieri were to continue.
 Legal aid lawyer Mark Busuttil said the woman insisted “she did not know at all about the theft”. 
 She was “not street-wise” and simply went along with others who exploited her naivety, argued the lawyer when requesting bail for the woman. 
 However, the prosecution objected.
 Proceedings were still at a very early stage and there was a real risk of tampering with evidence, argued AG lawyer Joseph Camilleri Azarov. 
 Since Zammit had admitted to the charges, he would also be produced as a witness against Cuschieri. 
 After hearing submissions, the court, presided over by Magistrate Kevan Azzopardi, said it had a duty to strike a balance between the rights of the accused and the proper administration of justice. 
 The accused was innocent until proven guilty but in this case, the court lacked peace of mind that if granted bail Cuschieri would abide by court conditions. 
 She was remanded in custody alongside Zammit whose judgment is expected next week.

 That bar has since been sealed off by police along with another eatery and a garage in Fgura as well as some rooms with an adjoining field at Fort Benghajsa which are all linked to Kurt Scicluna, the 31-year old chef currently also charged in relation to the alleged conspiracy.
 Roderick Camilleri, the 44-year old port worker from Birzebbugia, was arrested together with fellow worker Darren Dimech, 46 from Fgura, just as the pair were driving a truck out of the Freeport on November 12.
 The truck driver and passenger were stopped by security officers who had been instructed to inspect every vehicle exiting the Freeport.
 Two of those officers testified on Monday when proceedings continued against Camilleri and Dimech.
 When asked about some sacks tucked away behind one of the seats inside the truck, Camilleri and Dimech had simply shrugged off the question saying there was “nothing.”
 They also had no documentation to show in respect of the contents of those sacks and that triggered further suspicion.
 The security officers informed their superiors who, in turn, alerted the police.
 Proceedings also kicked off on Monday against Scicluna, the third man arrested in connection to the alleged drug trafficking conspiracy.
 Lead investigator Mark Anthony Mercieca testified about how police had traced calls and WhatsApp messages between Scicluna and Camilleri with many taking place in the morning and afternoon of November 12.
 In one of those calls, Camilleri allegedly told Scicluna that he had “managed to extract three sacks from the container.” He was to get further information about where he would meet Scicluna once outside the Freeport.
 Following his arrest, Dimech told police that he had been roped in by Camilleri “for a sum of money.”
 Camilleri later said that he had been promised €150,000 for the job.
 It all started around June when Camilleri was approached by Scicluna at a bar in Bulebel where he used to grab a bite.
 Scicluna allegedly proposed a deal.
 Camilleri was to “extract something from the Freeport.”
 The promised €150,000 appealed to him.
 More recently, Scicluna informed him that the expected container had arrived “or almost.”
 Then one day at the bar, Scicluna handed him a paper indicating the exact parking spot of the expected container, further directing Camilleri to film the process of opening the container.
 That footage was discovered on Camilleri’s mobile phone, said Mercieca.
 On November 19, Scicluna was arrested at the Bulebel eatery. He was in the kitchen when police turned up.
 Various documents, cash, mobiles and Scicluna’s Yamaha motorcycle as well as CCTV footage were seized at the bar.
 Other items were seized from a Fgura restaurant, a Zejtun farmhouse and other property at Fort Benghajsa where Scicluna lived.
 The next day he was interrogated. He chose not to answer self-incriminating questions.
 All items seized were exhibited in evidence, including the properties that were formally-not physically-presented by the prosecution.
 The bar, restaurant and garage were sealed off by the police. The rooms and field at Benghajsa were “fenced off” and an aerial photograph with the property circled in red was exhibited in court.
 Both cases, presided over by Magistrate Elaine Rizzo, continue.

 She warned that if this continued, she would order the proceedings to be heard behind closed doors. The warning came in a sitting during which she ordered Jason Azzopardi, who is representing the Caruana Galizia family as parte civile, to delete Facebook posts deemed prejudicial to the case.
 During a sitting on Thursday before Madame Justice Edwina Grima called Azzopardi to the witness stand. The judge informed Azzopardi that she had ordered that he be notified with a note filed by the defence, in which the court was asked to take action against the lawyer over statements he had made in an interview with Lovin Malta.
 The defence also told the court that Azzopardi had been making statements about the defendant on his Facebook page.
 While under oath, Azzopardi was asked about three Facebook posts.
 He confirmed that he had authored the posts in question, but denied the suggestion that the last one had been uploaded last week.
 The judge ordered the lawyer to stop reading out the whole post and asked him to confirm whether they were still online, adding that if so, she was ordering him to delete them.
 “I confirm on oath every word [I wrote], but what I find worrying is that the note indicates that I have violated the decree you issued on Friday 30 August,” he said.
 But when Azzopardi alleged he had been discriminated against, the court interrupted him, reminding him of a previous court order banning the parties from making any reference to Fenech’s request for a presidential pardon.
 “Orders aren’t only binding in court,” said the judge, adding she was “very unhappy with both parties.""
 The judge warned that she would have to start holding hearings in this case behind closed doors, if these incidents were to continue.
 Fenech’s lawyer Charles Mercieca alleged that the breach had taken place a day after the order, leading the court to remark that “everyone is trying to mislead the court.”
 The lawyers continued to bicker loudly, talking over the judge, who then ordered all the lawyers out of the courtroom and into her chambers.
 Emerging around 20 minutes later, the judge noted the application which requested the interview and a number of Facebook posts put up by Jason Azzopardi be taken down.
 The judge ordered Azzopardi to take down his posts and that “no party make any reference in public to the guilt or otherwise of the accused, who is today still presumed innocent and this in order to avoid stultifying the judicial process.”
 The judge also ordered the journalists in the courtroom not to reproduce the contents of the posts that Azzopardi had read out on the witness stand, and reminded all that the publication ban on the contents of the acts of this case had been put in place to avoid compromising the trial by jury.
 After sending the acts of the case back to the court of magistrates in order for court expert Martin Bajada to testify and complete tasks that he had been given by the Criminal Court, the sitting was adjourned to 18 October.  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police

 Thursday’s arraignment came five years after the pardoned middleman in the murder case, Melvin Theuma stated that Schembri had kept the murder’s alleged mastermind Yorgen Fenech up to date with developments of the police investigation.

 The perjury charge involves Schembri’s testimony on 18 December 2019, where he denied instructing Fenech on what to say to the police, informing him of progress in the murder investigation, and telling the alleged mastermind that his phone was being tapped.

                         But before Schembri could be charged, his defence questioned whether magistrate Gianella Camilleri Busuttil, who was to be overseeing the sittings, had ever worked on cases involving Schembri when she was a prosecutor in the Attorney General’s Office. Camilleri Busuttil had been appointed as a magistrate in 2023.

 The magistrate said that she definitely had acted as prosecutor in the case against the Degiorgio brothers, with the defence stating that many of the witnesses that will testify in this case were probably witnesses summoned by the magistrate when she was a prosecutor.

 After a short discussion with their client, the defence requested the recusal of the magistrate.

 The request was upheld by the magistrate, noting that the case will be re-assigned.

Man charged after throwing broomstick at his partner's head during an argument,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/man-charged-throwing-broomstick-partner-head-argument.1098659,27-09-2024,006739.png,"A man who threw a broomstick at his partner during a heated argument was granted bail upon arraignment while his partner, who missed hitting him with a glass object, is to face charges under summons.
 The accused, a 40-year-old gas distributor from Żejtun, turned up at the domestic violence unit two days ago to report that his partner had attacked him that evening when a verbal argument escalated to physical violence.
 The woman allegedly flung a glass object at him but missed.
 He reacted by throwing a broomstick at her, hitting her on the head and causing slight injuries.
 A risk assessment was carried out, resulting in a high score of 15.
 The man was arrested and escorted to court on Friday, pleading not guilty to slightly injuring the woman, who was the mother of his minor daughter, insulting and threatening her as well as relapsing.
 A request for bail was not objected to in view of the circumstances of the case.
 Prosecuting Inspector Omar Zammit explained that charges were also to be pressed against the woman under summons at a district sitting.
 However, the prosecution requested that the defendant move out of the couple’s home and that a protection order be issued in favour of the woman.
 Defence lawyer Anne Marie Cutajar said that although the couple were living in a property that belonged to the defendant, he was willing to move to his mother’s home.
 A protection order would benefit both parties, said the lawyer requesting, however, that such an order would not block the defendant’s access to his young child.
 The court, presided over by Magistrate Jean Paul Grech, upheld the request and granted bail under several conditions, including an order not to approach prosecution witnesses in any manner, to sign the bail book twice a week and to abide by a curfew between 9 pm and 4.30 am.
 He was ordered to deposit €500 and bind himself under a personal guarantee of €2000.
 The defendant was warned not to contact his partner in any way but that order was not to block his access to the couple’s child.
 The court clearly explained the implications of those orders and the consequences if those orders were breached.

Former MGA CEO guilty of Yorgen Fenech leak,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/former-mga-ceo-guilty-yorgen-fenech-leak.1093127,28-05-2024,006740.png,"The former chief executive of the gaming authority, Heathcliff Farrugia, has been convicted of revealing official secrets when he informed alleged murder mastermind Yorgen Fenech about an upcoming audit at a rival casino.
 Magistrate Ian Farrugia conditionally discharged Farrugia for three years after he found him guilty of the charges brought against him.
 Farrugia resigned in October 2020 shortly after he was questioned by police and  subsequently charged over his communication with Fenech, an alleged conspirator in the murder of Daphne Caruana Galizia and a casino owner.
 Fenech served as CEO of Tumas Gaming and the Portomaso Casino.
 Inspector George Frendo told the court that he had been tasked with investigating a number of chats that emerged from an in-depth analysis of Fenech’s phone, which was seized by police investigators when he was arrested in 2019 over allegedly commissioning the murder of investigative journalist Caruana Galizia.
 One of the chats was between Fenech and Farrugia who at the time was CEO of the Malta Gaming Authority. Among the chats extracted by Europol experts, the police analyzed this particular chat over the suspected release of official and professional information.
 Frendo explained that this particular communication contained 24 pages of texts on September 23, 2019, between 9 and 10pm.
 From this communication, it was established that Fenech had spoken with Farrugia after saying that he felt disappointed with the result of the anti-money laundering compliance review at Tumas Gaming Limited which owned Oracle Casino and Portomaso Casino.
 Fenech told Farrugia that the purpose of this review was just to give his organisation a bad reputation. He was not worried about the fine but the negative consequences on the firm.
 Farrugia had tried consoling Fenech by telling him that the findings of the review of Tumas Gaming were not public and would try to buy time and delay the release of the report.
 In the same chat, Farrugia revealed that another inspection was also going to take place inside Casino Malta, which is not owned by Tumas.
 In light of these facts, the court concluded that Farrugia was disclosing this information to a person who was not meant to know these details.
 The court noted Farrugia’s explanation that he had said that to Fenech to calm him down and to show him that they also carried out similar inspections on other casinos. The date of the inspection happened several weeks later
 The court noted that the prosecution had proven its case against the defendant. On his part, while not denying that he was the one who sent those messages to Fenech, Farrugia explained he had done it to calm his anxiety and to show him that there was no form of discrimination against him and his casinos.
 The court ruled that internal information about a list of entities that had been chosen for an anti-money laundering investigation was secret and sensitive information and was meant to remain strictly confidential between whoever is authorized to have that information.
 He therefore found Farrugia guilty of revealing professional secrets and discharged him, on condition that he does not commit another crime within three years.
 Farrugia has given notice of appeal. 
 Lawyer Ezekiel Psaila was defence counsel.

Murder victim was ‘talked out’ of a risk assessment,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/murder-victim-talked-out-risk-assessment.1097201,25-08-2024,"006742.png,006743.png,006744.png","Femicide victim Nicolette Ghirxi had agreed to take a risk assessment for domestic violence but told a friend and her lawyer that she was “talked out of it” by professionals when she attended her evaluation.
 Evidence obtained by Times of Malta reveals that on April 22, Ghirxi was dissuaded from taking the risk assessment after it was suggested that the messages she received from her former boyfriend did not contain threats but insults.
 It was then that Ghirxi walked out of the room without taking the risk assessment.
 Ghirxi was found murdered in her Swatar apartment on August 12. Her ex-partner Edward Johnston was shot dead by police hours later.
 Just a few hours after Ghirxi’s body was discovered, police commissioner Angelo Gafà told journalists that Ghirxi was offered a risk assessment but declined – in writing – saying she did not feel at risk.
 The Foundation for Social Welfare Services told Times of Malta that the risk assessors on the day categorically denied they tried to talk out the victim at any point from carrying out the assessment.
 The risk assessors in question have given a written statement to FSWS management and will be confirming it under oath through an affidavit.
 “The FSWS stands by the version given by its professionals and would like to point out that that was the only time that the risk assessors or other FSWS professionals had any contact with the victim.” 
  But a close friend of the victim, whose identity is being withheld, begs to differ.
 “I was with Nicolette at the police headquarters in Floriana while she was filing the domestic violence report. I was with her when she accepted to take the risk assessment.”
 Speaking to Times of Malta, she says that neither friends nor relatives or lawyers are allowed to be present when victims of domestic violence take risk assessments and that is why she left after Ghirxi had filed her police report.
 “I offered to wait for her outside but Nicolette told me to go home and said she would contact me once she’s done.”
 The friend reveals how later that night on April 22, she received a voice note from Ghirxi describing how the risk assessor had harped on the futility of the exercise considering that the messages she had received from her former boyfriend contained insults, not threats. 
 In the voice note, in Maltese, heard by Times of Malta, Ghirxi said:  “Ok just got home, erm... ir-report... m’għamilulix ir-risk assessment għax qalli m’hemmx theddid. Qalli insulti.  Qalli ħa jiġi zero, kind of. Qalli però jekk ‘forsi jerġa’ jikkuntattjak u jagħmel harassments, kemm iċċemplilna u nerġgħu nagħmluh.’”
 “Ok just got home, erm… the report… [he] didn’t do the risk assessment because he told me there are no threats but insults. He told me that [the assessment] would score zero, kind of. But he [the risk assessor] told me that ‘should he [the former boyfriend] contact you again and harass you, just call us and we’ll do it again.’”
 The friend’s version of events is corroborated by the victim’s lawyer, Joseph Borda, who is clearly frustrated about the way things played out.
 “The police have adopted a habit of asking the victims whether they want to take a risk assessment. This should be made by default,” he told Times of Malta.
 Borda recalls his anger when Ghirxi informed him, over the phone that same night, how she had filed a domestic violence report without taking the risk assessment.
 “At this point I ask myself whether Appoġġ are doing their duty or not,” he said.
 Borda argues that this is why he will keep insisting on an independent inquiry that will show how the state has failed to protect Ghirxi.
 This week, the government announced it had tasked the Police Complaints Board with assessing the implementation of the recommendations arising from the Valenzia inquiry report following Bernice Cassar’s death.
 Cassar was killed by her estranged husband in November 2022. The Valenzia inquiry was published in February 2023.
 
 The Office of the Prime Minister said the board will also review the conduct of the police force concerning established standard operating procedures and relevant legislation.
 “Are we joking!”, Borda hit back, explaining that the PCB is limited in scope and can only review police conduct when other players are involved like Appoġġ, immigration authorities and the police’s Standard Operating Procedures.
 “This goes beyond the police. I believe the state did not offer Nicolette enough protection and this can only be established through an independent inquiry with wider terms of reference that will enable it to look into the failings of the state.”
 Ghirxi was murdered in the apartment Johnston once shared with her, which he left last December. After a three-hour stand-off with the police in St Julian’s, Johnston pointed a weapon at the officers which later turned out to be a replica gun. He was shot dead.
  The victim’s friend recalls her anger when she heard the police commissioner say that Ghirxi had refused a risk assessment.
 “This is way beyond the truth,” she insists.
 She said Ghirxi had spoken to her about the content of e-mails and messages that Johnston had been sending her for a while.
 Ghirxi blocked Johnston on all social media platforms but he became so obsessed with contacting her that he even sent her messages via PayPal, an online payment app on which messages are only allowed between users who transfer money.
 “He sent her one cent via PayPal just to make sure that he could send her a message over that platform.”
 The only other platform Johnston could use to message his former girlfriend directly was Gmail. 
 “Ghirxi reached out to Google and asked them to stop Johnston sending her e-mails but they said they could not do anything.”
 She also described how on April 22, Ghirxi walked into the police headquarters in Floriana and proceeded to file a report against her former partner.
 “I was with her. She handed the police 12 to 15 printouts of e-mails and messages she had been receiving and which she considered harassment.”
 The session lasted for 45 minutes and the standard procedure was recorded.
 “While filing the report, the police discussed whether some of those messages were harassment or contained threats. In the end, Nicolette was told the police would try to contact Johnston to get his version of events and then she was offered to take a risk assessment.”
 Ghirxi accepted. 
 Later that evening, Ghirxi would send her friend a voice note informing her she had not taken the risk assessment after all because she was told that “it would score zero”.
 The friend remembers how Nicolette had taken the Appoġġ risk assessor to his word. 
 “They are the professionals. Who are we to question their advice?” she told Times of Malta.
 “Just make an effort and put yourself in Nicolette’s shoes.  She had already taken a very brave step to go there and file the report. A lot of doubts must have crossed her mind. And when a professional told her she was not at risk, she trusted him.”
  In the following weeks, Ghirxi became the target of several social media posts uploaded to Facebook and Instagram from fake social media profiles under the name of Ricardo Raspini and Lisa Campo. 
 These posts, which later transpired were being managed by Johnston, would seek to tarnish Ghirxi’s reputation by making allegations about her sexual behaviour and to get her into trouble with her employer.
 Ghirxi also kept in touch with the police forwarding any such e-mails and messages that she received but, as far as is known, she never returned to file a second report in person or to take a risk assessment.
 “The last time I met Nicolette was on Tuesday 6th August. She had just returned from a cruising holiday.” 
 The following Sunday she was murdered.

Former refugee welfare agency CEO guilty of embezzling public funds,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/132397/former_refugee_welfare_agency_ceo_guilty_of_embezzling_public_funds_,21-11-2024,006755.png,"A former CEO of the Agency for the Welfare of Asylum Seekers (AWAS) was yesterday sentenced to two years imprisonment suspended for three years after being found guilty of embezzling public funds related to the Agency.

 Joseph Michael Baldacchino, 61, who served as the CEO of the Agency between 2016 and 2018, faced a number of charges including embezzlement and misappropriation. This followed an investigation by the Financial Investigation Directorate within the Internal Audit and Investigation Department, which concluded he used the agency’s funds to purchase items for himself and even used the agency’s employees to work for him privately, including during their official hours of work. He was only found guilty of the first charge: embezzlement.

                     In its judgment, the Court presided over by Magistrate Rachel Montebello first analysed a refund claimed by Baldacchino for a €38.75 meal at a Ta’ Xbiex restaurant, which meal, according to Baldacchino, was a ‘Compensation Meal’ rewarded to a female coordinator within the agency who, according to him, saved the agency ‘thousands of euros’ and ‘was outstanding in her work’. Baldacchino also claimed that he gave her a €100 voucher, which was also funded by the agency.

 Yet, when testifying, the coordinator denied that she had ever attended the lunch in question.

 Baldacchino then ‘radically’ changed his version of events when testifying before the Court. He claimed that in actual fact, he had said lunch with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.

 He stated that although he was not authorised by the Permanent Secretary to use agency funds for meals with persons other than agency employees and although he was expressly instructed not to host lunches with others at the expense of the agency, he nonetheless defied such instructions owing to the fact that he disagreed with them.

 He claimed that he presented the meal bill to be refunded as petty cash and said that he had instead had lunch with the coordinator.

 The Court also heard how a man employed at the rate of €4 per hour by the agency as a cleaner at the Hal Far open centre carried out work on Baldacchino’s boat, even during work hours.

 The cleaner testified that in June 2017, over a period of three days, he was picked up by Baldacchino’s son from the tent village and taken to a Kalkara garage wherein the accused’s boat was stored. It was in this garage that he spent some 26 hours cleaning Baldacchino’s boat.

 Although Baldacchino claimed that he had entrusted his son the sum of €120 in order to pay the cleaner, the latter testified that he did not receive a single penny from the Baldacchino family for his work.

 Documentation and evidence concluded that the cleaner would ultimately be paid for the cleaning work by the Agency, with the cheques to this end being signed by Baldacchino, who, the Court contended, could not possibly have been unaware of the fact that the relevant payments forwarded to the cleaner included sums relating to the work carried out on his own boat.

 Another event considered by the court related to Baldacchino’s request for one of two shower trays purchased by the Agency to be taken to his own home in Birkirkara.

 The tray was in light of this request transported to Baldacchino’s residence by a car which was used by the accused as CEO of the Agency.

 Soon after, the accused told Agency employees that he was unable to find anyone who could install the shower tray, with Senior Technical Officer Brian Zammit subsequently offering to affect such installation himself alongside Agency workers.

 To this end, Zammit alongside two other agency employees installed the shower tray on a Saturday, outside their working hours. Although the agency workers refused payment, Baldacchino stated that he had provided them with a bottle of whiskey as a sign of gratitude. 

 In this vein, the Court condemned Baldacchino’s behaviour, noting that although he was in view of his role entrusted to ensure that the agency’s property would be applied for the benefit of the agency, he instead made use of the property for his own gain.

 Zammit also testified that Baldacchino had on various occasions instructed him to buy a pump, paints and a stainless-steel pipe. The purchases of the pump and paints were made by way of cheques issued by the Agency, with the stainless-steel pipe also being delivered directly to Baldacchino’s home.

 In reaching its decision, the Court took into account Baldacchino’s unchequered criminal record and the fact that the value of the objects and funds in question were not particularly substantial.

 Yet, it simultaneously noted that it could not ignore the fact that Baldacchino abused of his position as CEO of the Agency by systematically using agency employees and funds for his own personal benefit. It was noted that upon appointment, Baldacchino evidently decided that the Agency was to be run not only in line with its legal aims, but also in order to satisfy his own needs. The Court condemned this behaviour, noting that the accused breached the trust placed in him in order to administer public funds. Whilst it appreciated the strenuous nature of the role of Chief Executive Officer, such pressure could never justify the accused’s conduct.

 In addition to the suspended sentence of imprisonment, Baldacchino was also ordered to return the sum of €602 as compensation for the losses incurred by the agency as a result of his conduct. He was furthermore subjected to a perpetual general interdiction.     ",Thomas Cilia ,court_and_police
Court upholds €5 million asset freeze on Technoline citing public interest,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/129840/court_upholds_5_million_asset_freeze_on_technoline_citing_public_interest,21-06-2024,006760.png,"A court has denied the medical supplies company Technoline – accused in the Vitals PPP corruption case – a request to revoke a €5 million asset freeze.
 Technoline stands accused of money laundering, apart from other corruption-related charges in the hospitals’ concession saga.
 In its submissions, the company claimed the prosecution had not indicated which assets or cash were directly originating from any criminal act, and that its €5 million valuation was not based on an exact estimation of the alleged proceeds of crime.
  Madam Justice Edwina Grima turned down the request, saying the voluminous magisterial inquiry carried out by Magistrate Gabriella Vella and court experts had led to a wide array of criminal charges against companies as well as businesspeople and former politicians - among them former prime minister Joseph Muscat - and that there was “the supreme interest of society at large in seeing that the alleged criminal proceeds are seized.”
 The company’s asset freeze is part of a series of monetary and asset freezes ordered by the magisterial inquiry on various individuals and companies. “The wide implications this case has concerns the allegedly criminal use of monies from public funds, so the prosecution’s request for the asset freeze is justified and proportionate to the alleged criminal proceeds that run into the millions of euros,” Grima said.
 Madam Justice Grima said the State was duty-bound to recover any possible criminal proceeds, and to see that none of this alleged wealth can be dissipated, especially due to the fact that it was paid out from the public coffers.
 “It stands to reason that Maltese society is justified in expecting that these monies are returned to the State should the accused be found guilty, and this public interest supersedes that of the accused society’s enjoyment of private property.”
 The judge pointed out that the acquisition of the company Technoline by one of its employees, was carried out using a loan from the hospitals’ PPP concessionaire Vitals Global Healthcare, which VGH planned to use for the exclusive supply of pharmaceutical and medical supplies.
 The €5 million loan was paid back with €815,511 interest back in December 2023, members of the Technoline defence team told MaltaToday.
 VGH’s former CEO Armin Ernst told the inquiry, that “the cash to buy Technoline was wrong taken from the funds provided by the Government of Malta to VGH for the running of the Maltese hospital concession”, with court experts saying that this created a legitimate claim for the government to ownership of Techoline and all its accumulated profits.
 The transition to a new legal regime introduced on 9 February regulates, amongst other things, freezing orders and the problems faced by defendants in financial crime cases whose entire asset bases are frozen by court orders, often for years, until their case is decided.
 Under the new legal regime, prosecutors applying for freezing orders must now specify what property or how much money is to be frozen, within a 90-day period starting from the arraignment, which may be extended twice at most, only if the court deems it necessary.
 One predictable upshot of this is that prosecutors are now faced with the additional, often complex and difficult task of establishing the provenance of every asset belonging to a defendant, and to do so within a restricted time.  ",Matthew Vella ,court_and_police
"Police sometimes had no evidence bags at crime scenes, officer testifies",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/police-sometimes-no-evidence-bags-crime-scenes-officer-testifies.1094108,18-06-2024,006763.png,"Police sometimes ran out of evidence bags for items lifted from crime scenes or searches and instead relied on A4 envelopes, testimony on Tuesday revealed.
 The revelation emerged as a cybercrime unit police officer was being cross-examined by defence lawyer Franco Debono about the way in which he handled a laptop seized from Silvio Grixti’s office in November 2021.
 “We have evidence bags, but not always,” the officer said when pushed to explain why he could not recall if the seized laptop had been placed inside a sealed evidence bag.
 The admission prompted Magistrate Rachel Montebello to interject and ask if there was a particular reason evidence bags were not available.
 “We would not always have ones available,” the officer said, saying police sometimes placed devices seized from crime scenes in A4 envelopes. “It was something quite new for the unit. Now the practice is more established.”
 That prompted incredulity from Debono, who was carrying out the cross-examination. 
 “We’re talking about three years ago. This was not 1900!” he exclaimed. “Didn’t you think to ask your superiors for more evidence bags?”
 The police officer said he was not prepared for the search that time and that officers had gone to Grixti’s office “with what we had in hand.”
 The court stopped further questioning about the matter, saying “it’s evident now that they didn’t always have the resources.”
 Testimony was being given in the case against Grixti, a family doctor and former Labour MP and four others.
 The five all stand accused of having perpetuated a massive social benefit fraud which saw beneficiaries classified as severely disabled through the use of falsified documents.
 During Tuesday’s hearing, the court heard that one of the co-accused, Roger Agius, sought whistleblower protection last November.
 Agius’ lawyer told a court that his client had written to the whistleblower unit at the Office of the Prime Minister on November 28, offering information about the crime.
 By that point, police had already investigated and prosecuted various people in connection with the racket. Times of Malta revealed details of the fraud and Grixti’s role in it in an investigation  published on September 2 of that year.
 Speaking in court on Tuesday, defence lawyer Jason Azzopardi said Agius had followed up his initial letter to the whistleblower unit with a reminder on December 2, then a judicial protest on March 14.
 He finally met with representatives of the unit on April 8, when he made serious allegations about Mark Calleja, known as Il-Gulija.
 Calleja is a person of trust of Minister Michael Falzon within his Social Affairs Ministry.
 Agius has previously claimed that an official at Falzon’s ministry had assured him that “ 'As long as the minister [Michael Falzon] remains there, we will never have trouble'.""
 Falzon has denied any knowledge of the racket.
 
 A court heard on Tuesday that the whistleblower unit wrote to Agius on April 26 and advised him to speak to the police about his allegations.
 By then, Agius was already a criminal suspect and facing charges concerning his alleged involvement in the racket.
 The police on Tuesday asked the court to direct them on how to handle Agius’ claims and testimony, given that he is now an accused person.
 Prosecutors have also filed a note to cap the freezing orders in terms of recent amendments. A 90-day limit lapses on July 14. The matter is still to be decided.

Court orders Jason Azzopardi to delete Facebook posts on Yorgen Fenech,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/court-orders-jason-azzopardi-delete-facebook-posts-yorgen-fenech.1097637,09-05-2024,006776.png,"A judge has ordered Jason Azzopardi to delete Facebook posts concerning Yorgen Fenech, who is accused of involvement in the murder of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia. 
 During a pre-trial hearing on Thursday, Madam Justice Edwina Grima raised concerns that public comments could undermine the judicial process. 
 Azzopardi, a lawyer representing the Caruana Galizia family, had shared posts and an interview on his social media account, which Fenech's defence claimed were prejudicial. 
 Fenech's legal team argued that the posts risked influencing the jury ahead of the trial. They requested the court's intervention and the issue was the focus of Thursday's sitting.
 The judge asked Azzopardi to take the witness stand to explain the comments and confirm whether he had uploaded three Facebook posts related to the case.
 Azzopardi admitted to posting them but claimed he had not been formally notified about an additional court filing from Fenech's legal team regarding the posts. 
 “I want to know if those posts are still on your Facebook page,” Justice Grima insisted.
 When Azzopardi could not locate one of the posts, he was shown printed copies by the defence, and confirmed they were uploaded by him. 
 Tensions rose when Azzopardi suggested he was being treated unfairly. 
 “Don’t speak to me about discrimination,"" Justice Grima replied firmly, before reiterating the importance of a previous court order banning any reference to Fenech’s request for a presidential pardon.
 If that court order was breached, whether in court or outside, then “any court decision would be in vain. We’d be wasting time,"" she warned.
 “The court is very upset… you’re not realising what this means to these proceedings… The court might consider continuing these proceedings behind closed doors.""
 Azzopardi argued that one of the posts pre-dated that court order. Two more recent posts were not uploaded after the last court decree about the Lovin Malta interview. 
 But Charles Mercieca, for the defence, insisted that the dates on those posts spoke for themselves.
 Azzopardi mumbled something in court, which was inaudible to reporters. 
 “There! He’s just breached court orders again. Right here in court!” said Mercieca, pointing at the lawyer across the hall. 
 The judge had had enough. 
 Standing up and gathering her papers, she sternly ordered the parties’ lawyers to follow her in chambers. 
 A few minutes later, all re-emerged and the judge minuted the way forward. 
 She ordered Azzopardi to immediately remove the posts exhibited in court and further ordered that no party was to make reference in public about “the guilt or otherwise of the accused who was to date an innocent person, so as not to stultify the judicial process.”
 Finally, the court ordered the media not to publish what Azzopardi had read out from those Facebook posts in court today, because “that would be rubbing salt in the wound”.
 The court reminded all about the importance of the ban on publication it had issued about documents in the case file.
 That was intended so that future members of the jury at Fenech’s trial would not be compromised and that was for the best administration of justice.

  He said that until late last year, when he had been working at OPM,  he had been “acting as a runner for ‘il-Gulia,’” referring to the nickname by which Mark Calleja, employed at Michael Falzon’s ministry on “a person of trust” basis, is known.
 Although he had applied for whistleblower status last year, offering to reveal who was behind the scheme, Agius’ application had gone nowhere, he said. 
 “I caught the police passing on the information I was giving them,” he told Azzopardi on Saturday. “On 12 October, the Financial Crimes Investigation Department handed over the information to the Prime Minister,” he said, adding that he was inviting “anyone to take me to court right now about this.”
 “I don’t trust the police because they leaked my information,”  Agius went on, telling the host that he learned that, the day after he had named a sitting cabinet minister in one of his statements to the police, that same minister had complained to a third party that Agius had mentioned him.
 Agius went on to allege that in December 2021, the police had requested files related to the suspects. “The FCID took a month or a month and half to send them, and sent them by email to an office in the same building.” 
 The aims of the medical benefits fraud had been to garner votes “and money… for those who organised the medical boards.”
 The police inspector investigating the case had been playing him for a fool, he said. “Last week the inspector said he wanted to re-investigate me in order to assess me for whistleblower status. He wants me to tell him everything I know and then he can tell me it’s not enough for whistleblower status.”
 Jason Azzopardi, asking the Chamber of Advocates “to take note,” alleged that last year one of his clients had been approached by a messenger sent by Castille, who offered to spare him prosecution on condition that he repaid the 5 years worth of benefits he had received  - and that he drop Azzopardi as his lawyer. 
 Agius said the FCID inspector’s superior had ordered him to investigate “from the doctor down,” and not to seek out the person behind the scheme.
 “I begged him on my knees to take me there [to an office in Valletta] so I could throw all the doors open. He told me it was theatrics. 
 Do you know what the real theatrics are? That they took my mobile phone and placed it in a locker [before interrogation] while the inspector kept his, playing with it under the table.”

Brian Tonna’s fundamental rights breached by Speaker’s ruling,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/131635/brian_tonnas_fundamental_rights_breached_by_speakers_ruling_,08-10-2024,006837.png,"Brian Tonna’s fundamental rights were breached by a ruling by the Speaker of the House and the Parliamentary Accounts Committee’s witness guidelines, a court has ruled today.
 Mr. Justice Giovanni Grixi, presiding over the First Hall of the Civil Court in its Constitutional jurisdiction, handed down judgement in the constitutional case filed by Tonna, the former owner of accountancy firm Nexia BT, over a May 2021 ruling by the Speaker during Tonna’s grilling over the Electrogas deal.
  Tonna had been called to appear before the PAC during discussions on the results of a 2018 National Audit Office investigation into the award of the power station tender to Electrogas. 
 He had initially invoked his right to remain silent, but this right was expressly excluded by the Guide for Witnesses appearing before the Public Accounts Committee of the House of Representatives.
 A ruling was requested from the Speaker of the House on this matter.
 On April 19, 2021, the Speaker had ruled that a witness called to testify before the PAC, must answer questions if he is not the subject of related criminal proceedings but could not be forced to potentially incriminate himself.
 The Clerk of the House had later written to Tonna, informing him that the Speaker’s decision was clear and did not permit him to invoke the right to silence.
 Tonna’s lawyers had argued that his right to silence was not being respected and that the PAC and the Speaker’s ruling breached his right to a fair hearing. It was also argued that, because the non-observance of PAC guidelines for witnesses by refusing to reply to questions was punishable by imprisonment for up to six months, he had also suffered a potential breach of his right to personal liberty.
 In filing the case, Tonna had asked the court to declare the Speaker’s ruling and the PAC guidelines for witnesses in breach of the Constitution and the Convention for Human Rights and order the expunging of all of the testimony and documentation that he had given the PAC be removed from the parliamentary proceedings. Damages were also requested.
 In the judgement handed down on Tuesday, Mr. Justice Grixti observed that the right to silence was intended to protect the fundamental right not to incriminate oneself. In a scenario where a person is at the centre of allegations such as those against Tonna, that right assumed a greater importance, “not only because he was already a defendant, but also because he had already assisted and was still assisting in pre-trial proceedings.
 “Therefore, the Ruling and the guidelines when speaking of criminal proceedings, or rather pending charges, fail to protect the right to a fair hearing.”
 The judge declared the Guide for Witnesses appearing before the Public Accounts Committee of the House of Representatives breached Tonna’s right to a fair hearing, as protected by the European Convention on Human Rights and the Constitution of the Republic of Malta, insofar as they obliged him to respond to the questions put to him by the members of the PAC, which could prejudice his position in other proceedings.
 The Speaker’s Ruling had also breached his right to a fair hearing for the same reason, said the court, as it ordered the expunging of Tonna’s testimony and the documentary evidence he had submitted.
 No damages were awarded, however, with the court noting that it “saw no reason for him to be given any non-pecuniary compensation or give other directives,” ordering the costs of the case to be borne by both parties in equal measure.  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police
Constitutional Court judges refuse recusal request by Vitals defendants,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/131341/constitutional_court_judges_refuse_recusal_request_by_vitals_defendants,23-09-2024,006860.png,"Malta’s highest court has thrown out a request for the recusal of the three judges presiding over it in their contestation of the freezing orders against disgraced former Prime Minister Joseph Muscat and his fellow defendants in the criminal proceedings over the government’s ill-fated hospitals deal with Vitals Global Healthcare.
 Muscat, together with Konrad Mizzi, Keith Schembri, Clarence John Coger Thompson, Christopher Spiteri, Jonathan Vella, David Joseph Meli, Ivan Vassallo, Mario Victor Gatt, Brian Bondin, Adrian Hillman, Pierre Sladden, Brian Tonna, Karl Cini, Sciacca Grill Limited, Kasco Engineering Company Limited, FSV Limited, MTrace plc, Gateway Solutions Limited, Technoline Limited, Eurybates Limited, Taomac Limited, Nexia BT Limited had filed a court application in August, asking that a copy of the case file from the criminal proceedings - not against them, but against the second cohort of defendants to be prosecuted over the fraudulent hospitals deal be exhibited in the acts of the constitutional case they had filed to attack the short timeframe provided by law to file appeals on freezing orders.
  When the court rejected that request, the appellants had jointly demanded the recusal of the three judges presiding the Constitutional Court: Chief Justice Mark Chetcuti, Mr. Justice Giannino Caruana Demajo and Mr. Justice Anthony Ellul.
 The defendants had pointed at the fact that the same judges had, in the civil case filed by Adrian Delia, had dissolved the contract granting hospitals concession on the grounds of collusion and fraud, and argued that this would result in a breach of their right to a fair hearing, citing article 734(d)(i) of the Code of Organisation and Civil Procedure, which allows the recusal to be requested when the judge had already “given advice, made submissions before the court or written about the case, or about anything related to the case or which depends on it.”
 “The issue at hand today is about shortcoming which the appellants are alleging in the Proceeds of Crime Act where the Seizure and Freezing order against them is concerned, and this in regards to their fundamental right to a fair hearing and peaceful possession of property. An issue which was not the merits of the [case filed by Adrian Delia].”
 The reference to the judgement which the appellants claim had been made in the magisterial inquiry into the hospitals deal, did not impinge on the impartiality of the judges, they said, adding that “in any case [the court] had made no judgement about the appellants in their personal capacities. This court is not going to pass judgement on the merits of the charges which the appellants are facing in the criminal proceedings against them. That is the competence of the courts of criminal jurisdiction.”
 “The only thing said in the 2 September decree was that the outcome of the appeal did not depend on what might have happened in other criminal proceedings to which the appellants are not parties,” the judgment read.
 After examining the arguments made by the appellants the court said that it was of the opinion that there were “no legitimate reasons that could lead to an objective justification that the judges are not impartial in the issue being examined in the appeal.”
 The recusal request was therefore rejected with the court also ordering that the related costs be borne entirely by the appellants.  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police
Russian man who became Maltese citizen ran ‘bank for criminals across the world’,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/russian-man-maltese-citizen-ran-bank-criminals-across-world.1102187,12-09-2024,006862.png,"A 24-year-old Russian who became a Maltese citizen ran a “professional banking service for criminals across the world” as part of a wider billion-dollar money-laundering network, the UK’s National Crime Agency (NCA) has said.
 Semen Kuksov, who acquired a Maltese passport in 2022 together with his father, has been linked to a network allegedly used to support “serious and organised crime”, ranging from Russian ransomware attacks to drug dealing in the UK.
 Details about Kuksov’s role in the network feature in an NCA-led investigation codenamed Operation Destabilise.
 Operation Destabilise uncovered a complex scheme in which the networks collect funds in one country and make the equivalent value available in another, often by swapping cryptocurrency for cash.
 Kuksov “admitted” to operating an underground cryptocurrency exchange.
 The crime agency said the investigation exposed and disrupted Russian money laundering networks supporting crime around the world.
 As part of the network, Kuksov and an associate helped launder over €14 million during a 74-day period.
 Times of Malta and OCCRP had revealed in April how Kuksov featured on the latest list of people granted Maltese citizenship in 2022 under a government scheme to sell citizenship to wealthy individuals.
 Rob Jones, the NCA’s director of operations, said Operation Destabilise has exposed billion-dollar money laundering networks operating in a way previously unknown to international law enforcement or regulators.
 Kuksov was this year jailed for five years, seven months for his role in the network.
 The NCA said Kuksov directed and exercised influence over others involved in money laundering.
 He did this over a significant period of time and across borders, demonstrating a high degree of planning.
 Kuksov’s network used physical tokens for cash handovers, described by the NCA as a common practice for cash-based money launderers.
 Tokens are usually low denomination bank notes which bear a unique serial number. This serial number is passed on before a cash handover takes place and when the two parties meet, the person collecting the cash will produce the bank note to prove that they are the intended party.
 The token is usually then handed over, acting as a receipt that the handover has taken place.
 An NCA operations manager said Kuksov ran what amounted to a professional banking service for criminals around the world, who could not access the legitimate banking system due to the source of their funds.
 Kuksov arranged collection of cash from groups that wanted to get rid of it and delivered cash to groups that needed it, the NCA said.
 While money-laundering is often seen as a victimless crime, the NCA said without the services of people like Kuksov, the business model of criminal groups they are enabling would be broken as they would not be able to access their ill-gotten gains.
 Kuksov’s father Vladimir, a Russian businessman who also bought a Maltese passport, has not been linked to the case and has distanced himself from his son.
 A spokesperson for Community Malta Agency, the government entity responsible for administering the passports scheme, said back in April that it was “reviewing” the documentation about Kuksov’s case.

"Take your time when deciding on freezing orders, top court tells judges",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/take-time-deciding-freezing-orders-top-court-tells-judges.1101190,18-11-2024,006867.png,"Criminal courts should “take all the time necessary” before making a final decision on freezing orders, the country’s top court decreed in a major judgment on Monday.
 While it dismissed an appeal filed by Keith Schembri, Konrad Mizzi and other applicants, the constitutional court said it would be better if the law allowed the courts to extend permissible time limits, rather than impose a blanket seven-day limit for appeals.
 The priority, it said, was to ensure that the fundamental rights of those targeted by such orders are not placed at risk.
 The important pronouncement was delivered on Monday in an appeal filed by Schembri, Mizzi and a number of other defendants among the first tier of individuals and companies facing criminal prosecution linked to the Vitals magisterial inquiry.
 Schembri and Mizzi were fronting a challenge to current laws, which give defendants who are targeted with a freezing order seven working days to contest such orders.
 Defendants who filed the legal challenge argued that caused an inequality of arms between the prosecution and defence. While prosecutors had plenty of time to draft requests for freezing orders, they only had seven working days to object to them.
 Moreover, given the complexity of certain money laundering cases, seven working days to contest a freezing order possibly worth millions of euros and an equal term within which the judge must decide, was not enough, they said.
 Schembri, Mizzi and others said article 36(8)(ii) of the Proceeds of Crime Act resulted in a breach of their rights to a fair hearing and the peaceful enjoyment of property.
 In July, the First Hall, Civil Court in its constitutional jurisdiction dismissed their grievances, concluding that they had suffered no breach of rights and that such issues concerning freezing orders fell “entirely within the discretion of the Criminal Court.”
 The applicants appealed that decision.
 On Monday the Constitutional Court, presided over by Chief Justice Mark Chetcuti and Judges Giannino Caruana Demajo and Anthony Ellul, rejected the appeal but sent out a significant direction to Criminal Court judges.
 They concluded that Schembri and Mizzi could not argue that the seven-day time limit was insufficient in their case, as they had had filed their request to revoke the freezing orders within the seven days allowed by law.
 In general, the law lays down a time limit so as to avoid unnecessary delays, to promote efficiency and also so that the parties can know beforehand the time frame within which they are to expect a decision.
 However, there are cases which due to various factors, such as their nature and the number of defendants involved, call for a degree of “flexibility.”
 “Unfortunately the legislator put all cases in one basket as though all cases are the same, when they are not,” said the judges.
 It would be more appropriate if the law were to grant courts the opportunity to extend the seven day time limit after clearly stating the reasons for doing so.
 In any case, pending a final decision on freezing orders, such orders remain in force and thus there is no risk that any proceeds are lost.
 “Obviously the interpretation of these dispositions of law lies within the competence of the criminal courts,” went on the judges.
 Each case needs to be assessed on its merits and the Criminal Court is best placed to decide what time it needs to reach its decision, bearing in mind that such issues must be decided within a reasonable time.
 Consideration must also be made to the effects which such orders have on the subject person whose assets are targeted by the freeze.
 In Schembri and Mizzi’s case, the court was not convinced that the seven-day time limit breached their rights.
 But should the Criminal Court sense a “genuine and necessary” need to hear witnesses or should there be a legitimate reason to take more than seven working days before deciding whether to confirm, vary or revoke such orders, then it must do so.
 In such cases, if the court were to apply “strictly” the statutory time limit, the defendants’ claims might not be fully assessed and that could obstruct their right to an effective remedy.
 The Constitutional Court thus “invited” the Criminal Court to proceed in this manner, minuting clearly why it needed more time beyond the seven days without unduly prolonging its decision.

 A spokesperson told MaltaToday that the two men, Albanian nationals, were working on a construction site when they jumped on a neighbouring roof.
  This caused the roof of the house to collapse, including the ceilings of the two floors beneath them.
 After the three-storey fall, the workers were taken to hospital. They were later certified as grievously injured.
 Police, BCA and OHSA officials are on site.
 The owners of the house were not on site at the time of collapse.
 Police and OHSA investigations are still ongoing, as magistrate Antoine Agius Bonnici has launched an inquiry.
 Roof collapse ‘evident from day one’
 Corinne Farrugia, one of the grandchildren of the owners, told MaltaToday that it was “evident from the start” that the contractors next door were being negligent. She said works wouldn’t be carried out with the proper materials, and on one occasion, the family found a hole in the roof of the house.
 “Our architect spoke with the BCA and other authorities but never got anywhere,” she said.
 Farrugia said her grandparents were moved out of the house because they felt something like this was bound to happen.
 “In 2020 the site was excavated. In 2022 the existing owner took over and started construction. It was evident from the start that they were being negligent.”
 The construction site is being developed into an apartment building by Neville Agius. Architect Elena Borg Costanzi is overseeing the projects. The BCA cleared the works in September 2022.

EASO employee cleared of forging ICT qualifications document,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/easo-employee-cleared-forging-ict-qualifications-document.1096141,31-07-2024,006910.png,"The “highest ranking candidate” for a vacancy at the European Asylum Support Office has been cleared of accusations that he presented a forged certificate related to his job as ICT coordinator.
 Igor Biskupic held an IT managerial post when he applied for the vacancy advertised by EASO in June 2013. 
 He was awarded the job after satisfying all requirements related to formal qualifications and professional experience.
 A senior policy officer at EASO, who was a member of the selection panel, later testified that Biskupic was “the highest ranking candidate” and a “cut above the rest,” performing “very well” at the interview.
 He was selected for the post by “unanimous agreement” among the panel members. 
 He commenced employment in November 2013 and throughout his time at EASO “improved [the office’s] ICT capabilities.” 
 Then one day in February 2014, he was summoned to the office of the Head of Administration and Human Resources where he felt “a general sense of panic” in view of an upcoming audit. 
 His superiors had just discovered there was something missing in his employment records. 
 So they asked him to present all personal certificates and documents related to his work experience. 
 Out of all those documents, they chose one and added it to his personal file. 
 That document was a certificate issued by a printing company in his homeland, operated by his sister-in-law and her husband, where he had received training in 1988 and 1989. 
 An investigation by the European Court of Auditors, followed by a probe by the European anti-fraud office OLAF into the recruitment process of the ICT coordinator at EASO, raised doubts over that document. 
 Former superintendent Raymond Aquilina testified that he had received an OLAF report through the Attorney General’s Office, recommending criminal action against Biskupic.
 The EASO official was charged with making a false declaration in the document presented to a public authority to gain a personal advantage and of document forgery. 
 Biskupic protested his innocence. 
 During the proceedings, the court heard that OLAF had checked with the home affairs and infrastructure ministries in Croatia to confirm the authenticity of that certificate. 
 Doubts surfaced because the company was not yet incorporated when the document was issued. 
 When interrogated by OLAF, Biskupic insisted that he had trained at Grafoprint “back in those days” but could not recall who had issued and signed the document.
 It turned out that the document had been prepared by the accused’s sister-in-law who testified to that effect. 
 But it was created as an “unofficial” document and she never had any idea of it being retained and used as a valid document. 
 Biskupic insisted he simply requested some form of confirmation that he had attended training but he never asked for any formal certificate. 
 When delivering judgment the court, presided over by magistrate Kevan Azzopardi, concluded the defendant did not present the document with the alleged false application when applying for the job. 
 It was added at a later stage when an audit was in the offing. 
 Nor did the prosecution prove he was a public officer. 
 As for the second charge, the court said that it was time-barred. 
 The court pronounced an acquittal.

 In a decision handed down on Thursday, Magistrate Claire Stafrace Zammit declared that there are sufficient grounds to charge Lia with complicity in fraud, malicious use of false documents and making false declarations to a public authority.
  The challenge proceedings, aimed at obtaining a court judgement that would force the police to prosecute, had been filed by Magistrate Nadine Sant Lia’s father, Victor Sant, in March, alleging that Lia - his son-in-law at the time-  had fraudulently transferred Sant’s car to another man instead of scrapping it for him, and had forged his signature to do so.
 Magistrate Stafrace Zammit noted that in his detailed testimony Sant had explained how he had spoken about potentially scrapping his car while talking to his daughter and her then husband, Lia. Sant claimed that Lia had immediately offered to handle the process for him, and so he had handed over his logbook to the lawyer.
 But after some time passed without hearing back from Lia, Sant had asked him about what happened with the car, to which Lia allegedly replied he had only received €100 for the scrapped vehicle. Suspecting that something was not right, Sant had phoned Transport Malta and was informed that the car had not been scrapped and transferred to another owner instead.
 But in order for that transfer to take place, Lia would have needed a copy of Sant’s ID card, which he had previously provided him with for other purposes, as well as the man’s signature. 
 Magistrate Stafrace Zammit ruled that although it appeared that Lia had made little to no financial gain, there still was evidence pointing to fraud. The forgery issue could only be determined in the course of criminal proceedings against the Commissioner for Justice, and informed the Commissioner of Police that there was a prime facie case to answer in this regard.
 Victor Sant was assisted by lawyers Franco Debono and Edward Gatt.  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police
Latin American women forced into prostitution by Maltese trafficking ring,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/latin-american-women-forced-prostitution-maltese-trafficking-ring.1096674,13-08-2024,006946.png,"Foreign women were being brought to Malta and forced into prostitution by members of a human trafficking ring arrested in a series of police raids on Monday.
 The women were coerced into coming to Malta from Latin American countries and then forced to engage in prostitution either in brothels or in locations chosen by clients, such as their apartments, police sources said.
 Eleven arrests were made in Malta. All those arrested are Maltese, except a man and a woman who are Romanian.
 Police believe that the mastermind behind it all is 36-year-old Luke Farrugia, known as ""tal-beret"", sources told  Times of Malta. Farrugia is known to the police and has faced  similar charges in the past.
 The other arrested individuals were allegedly scheduling appointments for the women, managing the brothels, and driving the women to their appointments.
 Farrugia was arrested in Gżira by members of the police force's Special Intervention Unit. Other raids were made in St. Paul's Bay, Siġġiewi, Fgura, Gudja, Paola, Żebbuġ and Senglea.
 In the raids, police seized expensive watches and cars as well as a 'considerable' amount of cash, according to a statement.
 The Criminal Investigation Department, Financial Crimes Investigation Unit, the Gender-Based and Domestic Violence Unit, and the Asset Recovery Bureau were involved.
 A spokesperson for the Foundation for Social Welfare Services said that it had been working with the police to assist the alleged victims in the case. 
 All have been provided with professional support and a place to stay in a shelter setting so as to provide them with as much protection as possible.
 Sexual exploitation is one of the predominant forms of abuse that human trafficking victims in Malta face. 
 In 2022, police and Aġenzija Appoġġ identified 14 foreign trafficking victims, 12 for sexual exploitation.

"Malta should have ‘Romeo and Juliet’ law for consensual teen sex, experts say",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/malta-romeo-juliet-law-consensual-teen-sex-experts-say.1093684,06-10-2024,006972.png,"Malta needs ‘Romeo and Juliet’ laws that decriminalise underage, consensual sex between close-in-age teens, according to child ambassadors who believe that dropping the age of consent from 16 to 14 is not the solution.
 Children’s Commissioner Antoinette Vassallo, the National Youth Council and the president of the Eurochild network Marie-Louise Coleiro Preca also agreed on the need for better sex education.
 The issue came to the fore when a 15-year-old boy and his 14-year-old girlfriend ended up in court after she give birth to their baby. Social welfare officials flagged the matter to the relative authorities, triggering police investigations which ultimately led to criminal charges against the underage parents.
 The teens were cleared as they chose not to testify against each other but Magistrate Abigail Critien suggested considering lowering the age of consent from 16 to 14.
 If not, she said, the legislator should at least consider decriminalisation in cases where both underage minors of approximately the same age and same degree of maturity engage in consensual sex.
 Vassallo, who has been Commissioner for Children for two years, said she disagreed with lowering the age of consent to 14 because it could put young people at risk of abuse.
 “Minors under the age of 16 who engage in sexual relations with one another should not be criminalised as long as they were consensual and neither of the parties involved in the relationship was abused. The office calls for the decriminalisation of such an act so as to prevent children and adolescents from entering the justice system and for them to be able to access the necessary services,” she said.
  In Malta, the age of consent was officially lowered from 18 to 16 in 2018 in a move that was welcomed by the National Youth Council.
 But the council does not believe that lowering it further is the answer.
 “When it comes to legal definitions, we highly favour the introduction of Romeo and Juliet laws, or a similar mechanism, to ensure a close-in-age exemption applies for younger persons engaging in consensual sex together, but not an overall lowering of the age of consent to 14,” the council said.
 Romeo and Juliet laws, used in the US, provide that a person can legally have consensual sex with a minor provided that he or she is not more than a given number of years older, generally four years or less.
 Coleiro Preca also agreed with decriminalising underage sex for close-in-age teens but said that lowering the age of consent will not solve this issue.
 “Criminalising on its own will not usher in maturity or resolve.  A comprehensive sex education policy, and an education programme to empower young people to make the informed choices are paramount.”
 The policy, she said, should apply from a young age with information of what consent, responsibility and rights are all about.
 “Malta also needs a serious and constructive discussion on the different ages stipulated in different legislation where minors are considered mature to take on certain responsibilities.  A typical example is when children at the age of 16 years are allowed to marry with the consent of their parents. We have been called out as a country to address this issue of child marriage,” she said.
 The National Youth Council spoke about the need for a comprehensive and intersectional sexual education programme to replace the current outdated one – the guidelines for which have not been updated since 2013.
 “Leading global authorities, including the WHO and the UN, have shown that sex education in fact delays the initiation of sex, and empowers younger persons to identify and speak up in cases of abuse,” the council said, noting that Malta’s sexual health policy has not been updated in 14 years.
 The outdated 2010 policy was originally meant to be released in 2021 but was sent back to the drawing board, because the research it was based on was found to be years out of date.  Its revision was further delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Health Minister said it will be launched for consultation by the end of 2024.

Man remanded in custody after allegedly inflicting psychological damage to wife,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/132296/man_remanded_in_custody_after_allegedly_inflicting_psychological_damage_to_wife,15-11-2024,006990.png,"A 44-year-old man from Mellieħa has been remanded in custody after being accused of inflicting psychological harm on his wife.

 Speaking in court on Friday, a police inspector said a police report was filed on 13 November by an aunt of the victim.

 The inspector said that the aunt reported the accused, a 44-year-old man from Mellieħa, on the basis that he was allegedly inflicting psychological damage on his wife, the victim.

 The prosecution said the accused used to call and visit her whilst she was working. The inspector further added that the accused used to allegedly lock up the victim during the night. 

 The defence said the accused and victim had been married for around 14 years, and such behaviour from the accused had previously occured. The defence further added that the accused needs help in order to address the psychological issues that he is facing.

 The man initially pleaded guilty to the charges, but when the magistrate entered the chambers he began to cry. Once the magistrate returned, he pleaded not guilty.

 The accused pleaded not guilty, and the defence counsel did not bail. The accused was thus remanded in custody.

 A protection order was ordered in favour of the victim, where the accused is prohibited from contacting her and any third-parties who Brahmi might be able to contact the victim through.

 Inspector Christian Cauchi led the prosecution, whilst legal aid lawyer Thomas Barbara Sant appeared for the accused.     ",Jordan Pace ,court_and_police
"Schembri, Mizzi request for constitutional review of freezing order time limit upheld",maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/129954/schembri_mizzi_request_for_constitutional_review_of_freezing_order_time_limit_upheld,27-06-2024,006993.png,"Keith Schembri and Konrad Mizzi have won the right to challenge the constitutionality of the legal proviso that gives defendants seven days to challenge a freezing order.
 The pair, who face corruption and money laundering charges linked to the Vitals case, claim the seven-day limit was discriminatory when considering that the prosecution had no such limitation. The Attorney General had objected to the request.
  Judge Edwina Grima upheld Schembri’s and Mizzi’s request for a constitutional reference, saying that the issue was neither frivolous nor vexatious.
 The judge ruled that freezing orders could trigger “draconian consequences” and impact the defendants’ fundamental right to enjoy their property.
 A freezing order shuts out the defendants’ ability to enjoy their property while criminal proceedings continued. The law does not allow defendants to claim ulterior revisions of the court order.
 Schembri and Mizzi were slapped with a multi-million euro freezing order when the Vitals corruption case got underway last months.
 The judge noted that the law had to strike a balance between the defendants’ rights and ensuring that proceeds of crime will not continue being used. However, she said the seven working days limit imposed on defendants to contest the freezing order was too short a period and thus it was right for the Constitutional Court to examine its validity.
 The judge ordered that the matter be referred to the Constitutional Court and the statutory seven-working day limit to be suspended until the constitutional matter was decided.
 However, in the meantime, the freezing order issued by the Magistrates’ Court in the Vitals case still stands.

 But the IĠM also called out hecklers who gathered in support of those charged outside the courthouse and threw insults at the journalist. 
 On Tuesday, the former prime minister, his chief-of-staff Keith Schembri and former minister Konrad Mizzi pleaded not guilty to bribery, corruption and other crimes. The three were among 14 individuals and nine companies charged during one long court sitting.
 
 Throughout the day, hundreds of people spent hours outside the court building to show support for the former Labour PM.
 Another 14 individuals, two companies and a legal firm - including former minister Chris Fearne and Central Bank Governor Edward Scicluna - were charged in court during an 11-hour sitting on Wednesday that was eventually  annulled.
 In a statement on Thursday, the IĠM thanked the Malta Police Force for ensuring that members of the media covering the cases worked in a safe environment and were afforded the utmost protection during the course of their duties. 
 The feedback received by IĠM was very positive and the institute said it looked forward to collaborating with the police on similar future initiatives. 
 The IĠM wrote to the Police Commissioner to ensure journalists’ safety during the events, which were expected to draw crowds to the capital. 
 The institute also thanked the court administration for ensuring journalists could cover the court cases from inside the court hall. 
 ""While noting the lack of physical incidents involving members of the media, the IĠM condemns the name-calling of journalists by members of the public.
 ""The institute believes this was the direct result of a climate of hate instigated against journalists by the highest authorities.""
 It again called for an ""immediate halt to the propagation of hate towards journalists, making them seem as though they are enemies of the people"".

 Police had been in the process of issuing a European Arrest Warrant for Christopher el Shoushani, 48, who they had believed to be in the UK, when he walked into the Sliema police station, Police Inspector Joseph Mercieca told Magistrate Victor Axiak on Friday.
 Shoushani, a Sliema resident, had been charged over his alleged involvement in a hold-up in 2018, but had to be placed on the police’s wanted list after apparently vanishing three months after being granted bail in September that year.
 Inspector Mercieca explained that the police had been informed that Shoushani had moved to the UK and had been preparing a European Arrest Warrant and an extradition order requesting his return to Malta.
 It seems as though the wanted man had returned to Malta on his own steam and had somehow passed through passport control at the airport unchecked.
 He had been taken into custody yesterday when he had gone to the Sliema police station to report that he had lost his wallet. His name had triggered an alert when it was entered into the police database and he was immediately arrested.
 El Shoushani pleaded not guilty to charges of breaching his bail conditions and recidivism.
 A request for bail was rejected due to the absence of a fixed local address Magistrate Axiak refused a request for bail because the man was unable to provide evidence of a fixed address.

"Rise in WhatsApp attacks, police urge vigilance",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/rise-whatsapp-attacks-police-urge-vigilance.1097191,24-08-2024,007041.png,"Multiple reports of WhatsApp account hacks have been reported to the police, who urged users to take extra precautions to secure their accounts.
 The Malta Police Force shared a public alert on social media on Saturday, advising users to be wary of any messages asking them to forward a six-digit code. If this code is shared, users risk losing access to their WhatsApp account.
 According to the police, the scam, which has been ongoing for about a week, begins when victims receive a message from a known contact whose WhatsApp account has already been compromised.
 The message typically reads: “Hi, sorry, I accidentally sent you a six-digit code via SMS. Can you forward it to me? It’s urgent.”
 However, the wording may vary slightly, and messages could also be in Maltese.
 Police emphasised the importance of not sharing any code received via SMS, as doing so would give hackers full access to the WhatsApp account.
 ""You need to remain vigilant,” a police spokesperson said. “If you receive such a message, block the number immediately and delete the message.”
  While several people have fallen victim to the scam, police have not disclosed the exact number of reports, noting that it is not classified as a crime, making it difficult to track the total number of cases.
 Among those affected are Kurt Sansone, executive editor of MaltaToday, and Andrew Azzopardi, an academic and radio host.
 Sansone explained that he had been discussing a gate access code with a friend when he received the six-digit code. Believing it was related to their conversation, he forwarded the code, inadvertently giving hackers control of his WhatsApp account.
 “I’m still kicking myself,” Sansone admitted. “It’s very frustrating because now my contacts are at risk, and I can’t do anything about it.”
 He remains locked out of his account.
 Azzopardi also fell for the scam but noted that the message he received was in Maltese and used the word “urgent,” which added emotional pressure. The message came from a friend who has been frequently in and out of the hospital, making the request seem credible.
 “I was just trying to be efficient,” Azzopardi said. “There’s a sense of urgency we’ve created around social media that can cloud our judgement. This hacking is no joke, especially when you rely on WhatsApp for work.”
 Azzopardi managed to regain access to his account after WhatsApp informed him that a re-login window would be available after around 11 hours.
 The extent of the danger of the latest scam is not yet known. Some reports say scammers could find out personal details about you and your contacts from your messages. This information could be used to access other important accounts, target you with more scams, or even blackmail you.
 To prevent further incidents, the police recommend three key actions:

Court rejects request to declare Lilu King arrest invalid,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/132003/court_rejects_request_to_declare_lilu_king_arrest_invalid,28-10-2024,007043.png,"A magistrate has rejected a bid to have the arrest of Libyan boxer and alleged drug dealer Mohammed Ali Ahmed Elmushraty declared illegal, after the prosecution substituted the charge of slight bodily harm to grievous.

 The decision was taken by magistrate Kevan Azzopardi in the most recent case against Elmushraty, who is the accused in a number of ongoing cases. 

 Police Inspector Eman Hayman, prosecuting, asked the court to permit the prosecution make an amendment to the charges, explaining that although the victim’s injuries had initially been classified as slight, the medical expert who had been appointed by the court to examine both the alleged victim and the defendant, at the defence’s request, had reported that the victim suffered broken bones in his leg and one of ribs, which translated into grievous injuries. Elmushraty had suffered slight injuries, he added.

 When called to stand, the expert explained that the Floriana health centre, where the victim was initially examined, was not equipped to carry out X-rays. When the victim was subsequently X-rayed in hospital, he was found to have suffered a broken leg and a broken rib.

 This changes everything, observed the magistrate, because while the Court of Magistrates could decide a case of slight bodily harm, grievous bodily harm exceeded its remit. 

 Elmushraty’s defence lawyers Jose Herrera and Franco Debono argued that the proceedings had to start afresh and the charges read out again. They insisted that if a plea was not going to be entered today because the case must be reassigned to a compiling court, Elmushraty “must immediately be released from arrest,” argued Debono, pointing to the Andre D’Amato case where, he said, “the same thing had happened.” 

 Inspector Hayman argued that a request for bail had already been made during the arraignment and reminded the court that it had been the defence who requested the expert to examine the victim.

 Debono dictated a note: “on the change in charges, the defence argues that it is at the discretion and prerogative of the police. But the defence also argued that once the charge, as corrected or changed must be read out again and a plea entered anew before a competent court. As this court is not competent, this arrest is now invalid.”

 The lawyer added that the original arrest would be on the strength of a warrant issued by the duty magistrate or in flagrante. This is not happening here, so the arrest is invalid.

 Inspector Hayman insisted that this change did not render the arrest invalid: “How was this loophole discovered now? The defence had asked for the appointment of the expert and created this loophole, changing the dynamics of the case, which they are now trying to exploit.”

 The magistrate retired to his chambers to deliberate on the matter. When he emerged, half an hour later, the court handed down its decree. “About this, the court begins by indicating that nothing of the facts have been changed by this correction. The crime remains an offense against the person, the change only being that the nature is more serious than originally thought….”

 “This emerged from the opinion of the medico-legal expert, who testified that the injuries turned out to be grievous. The arrest had been convalidated during the defendant’s arrest…Because, as already said before, nothing has changed in all this, the court does not find any reason to declare the arrest to be invalid,” ruled the magistrate, ordering that the acts of the case be sent back to the registrar in order to be reassigned according to law. 

 The defence was clearly unhappy with this outcome. “So….” Debono began. “A decree has been given, dottore,” interrupted the court.     ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police
Nuns miss court sitting on alleged child abuse at Lourdes Home,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/nuns-miss-court-sitting-alleged-child-abuse-lourdes-home.1101192,18-11-2024,006754.png,"Two nuns linked to allegations of abuse at Lourdes Home orphanage in Gozo did not turn up to testify in court on Monday due to medical reasons.
 Sr Josephine Anne Sultana and Sr Dorothy Mizzi informed the court through lawyers that they could not attend to testify due to medical appointments. They will be testifying online during the next sitting appointed for January 27 – on the request of lawyer Lara Dimitrijevic who is representing the victims.
 The nuns were meant to take the stand before Mr Justice Mark Simiana, who is presiding over the constitutional case filed by two of the victims: Carmen Muscat and Rosanne Saliba.
 
 In their case, filed against the State, the two women are claiming that the State failed to protect them and are seeking compensation for their ordeal.
 Earlier this year Muscat and Saliba told a court how they were subject to sexual abuse and regular beatings in the Church-run orphanage, run by the Dominican Sisters, they lived in during the late 1970s and early 1980s.
 Abuse at the Għajnsielem home is alleged to have stretched for decades.
 The Church first acknowledged it in 1999, when it set up a commission which concluded that the allegations were unfounded.
 Claims then came to public attention in 2006, when survivors ranging in age from their 20s to 40s described horrific abuse on the TV show Bondi+.
 In 2008, a second Church commission found evidence of “inadmissible behaviour involving minors” at the home.
 The Gozo Bishop at the time, Mario Grech, issued a statement asking survivors for forgiveness and ordered that the commission’s recommendations be implemented.
 The police could not arraign anyone as the case was time-barred.
 In 2011, police launched a probe into Lourdes Home and two of its nuns, Sr Josephine Anne Sultana and Sr Dorothy Mizzi, in connection with an abuse claim filed by a boy dating back five years prior.
 Two of the survivors then initiated a constitutional case against the State for failing to take action.
 In January a third nun implicated in the case died: Sr Carmelita Borg was the Mother Superior for the Dominican nuns and was responsible for the Lourdes Home orphanage in Għajnsielem at the time the alleged abuse took place.

 Anthony Chircop had the Nissan Skyline GT he was driving at the time of the crash returned to him on due to a procedural error by the prosecution in his initial criminal conviction.
 The sports car, an appeals court noted, had never been formally listed in the acts of the case. Therefore, there were no legal grounds on which it could be confiscated, it concluded.
 Chircop filed an appeal after a court handed him a two-year prison sentence, suspended for four years, after it found him guilty of the involuntary murder of 30-year-old Stephanie Rapa.
  In separate, civil proceedings, he was ordered to pay €324,000 in compensation to Rapa's heirs.  
 Rapa was crossing the street in Gżira in October 2017 when Chircop, driving at 140km/hr, ran her over. Rapa’s body flew more than 3m into the air upon impact. She was rushed to hospital but pronounced dead a short while later.
 Chircop asked the court of appeal to order the return of his confiscated vehicle, to revoke an €11,646,87 fine imposed on him and to strike off a two-year driving ban imposed on him.
 The court of appeal agreed to return the car due to the procedural error but threw out his other requests.
 Chircop, it noted, was driving at “extreme” speed and had a history of dangerous driving: he was convicted in 2001 of reckless driving, of driving without a licence in 2014 and drunk driving in 2006.
 The fine and driving ban imposed on him by the first court was “more than deserved”, the court said.
 Chircop was represented by lawyers Franco Debono and Marion Camilleri.

Carmelo Abela wins libel case against Jason Azzopardi over HSBC heist claims,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/jason-azzopardi-comments-carmelo-abela-defamatory-court-rules.1098786,30-09-2024,006764.png,"Updated 3.45pm
 Former minister Carmelo Abela has won a libel suit against Jason Azzopardi over claims of involvement in a bank heist, with the court awarding him €7,000 in damages.
 The libel suit was sparked by a 2021 Facebook post in which the former PN MP claimed the minister was linked to a failed armed robbery at HSBC Qormi back in 2010.
 While Abela was not named in the post, the court ruled that the ordinary reader could understand who it referred to ""with no stretch of the imagination"".
 In a short reaction on Facebook, Abela shared an excerpt of the judgment, along with the comment: ""Justice was served today"". 
  Prime Minister Robert Abela said there was ""no place in our society"" for ""throwing mud with the purpose that something might stick"".  
 When testifying in July of 2021, Azzopardi claimed that days before that botched heist, Alfred Degiorgio - one of the alleged hitmen in the Daphne Caruana Galizia assassination - had been handed plans for the robbery and a set of false keys. 
 He alleged that Vince Muscat, a self-confessed and convicted hitman in the Caruana Galizia murder plot, had accompanied Degiorgio to a Fleur-de-Lys apartment for the meeting wherein the plans, footage and false keys to the bank premises were supplied in the presence of former minister Chris Cardona and Abela. 
 Back then, Abela was a senior insurance and statistics officer at HSBC’s Security, Health and Safety Department at the Qormi head office that was targeted in the failed coup. 
 At the time of Azzopardi’s Facebook comments on April 9, 2021, Abela was a Cabinet minister at the Office of the Prime Minister.
 On Monday, the court said Azzopardi’s comments were written in “a rhetorical tone”: without expressly stating that Abela was guilty of complicity, the inference from his comments taken in context was “manifest”.
 That inference could easily be understood by the ordinary reader with no stretch of the imagination, the court added.
 Azzopardi’s “euphemistic and suggestive tone” did not lessen in any way the defamatory nature of his statements. 
 “Rather... insinuations guised in suggestive terms were sometimes more insidious and upped the intensity of the defamatory sting,” observed the court. 
 Moreover, the very day after uploading his post, Azzopardi was interviewed by Andrew Azzopardi on his 102.3FM show on RTK. In that interview, Azzopardi named Abela as the minister targeted by the Commissioner of Standards for having abused public funds. 
 He immediately followed up that statement with a reference to a “Cabinet Minister who was not Minister Herrera” who had been involved “in a very serious crime” and against whom no political action was taken. 
 But above all, Azzopardi himself did not contest the fact that his comments were directed towards Abela. His line of defence was mainly to seek to justify his view that Abela was indeed involved in the crime. 
 On the other hand, Abela had shot down those allegations as “blatant lies and total conjectures”.
 He highlighted the fact he sought immediate action by contacting the police and suing Azzopardi for libel. 
 But his reputation was tarnished. 
 His name was splashed all over the media in connection to the failed hold-up and his political career suffered. Although elected to parliament, he was not given any ministerial portfolio ever since. 
 Magistrate Montebello observed that Azzopardi’s comments did not simply cast “suspicion” upon Abela but his words were clear. He expressed no reservations about Abela’s alleged complicity. 
 He made a “specific allegation that [Abela] committed a crime”. 
 Nor was there any evidence to show that the applicant had been or was being charged as an accomplice, or that he was viewed as a suspect by the police. 
 Such an allegation doubtlessly undermined the applicant’s integrity, tarnishing his esteem among the public in general. It also gravely affected “in an adverse manner the attitude of other people towards the person”. 
 The court noted that the statement by the Degiorgio brothers, expressly mentioning Abela, was done after the publication of Azzopardi’s Facebook post. 
 The court turned down all the defendant’s arguments, including his plea that the comments were his honest opinion. He failed to support his allegation with sufficient facts. 
 His public statements covered by the media, were not sufficient. That was not what the legislator intended by the defence of honest opinion. 
 The yardstick should not be the defendant’s opinion but that of an honest person. Most of the stories published on news portals prior to Azzopardi’s post were related to comments made by the lawyer himself who began to drop hints about the alleged complicity of a government minister in the HSBC failed heist. 
 Copies of documents from criminal proceedings against the perpetrators, produced in evidence by the defendant, were not duly authenticated and were not official court documents. 
 The court did not give them much probatory value. 
 Based on the evidence, a reader could only share Azzopardi’s opinion if he was “eager for political scandals, resorting to speculation, conjectures and stretching his imagination beyond reason to stir up theories about the guilt of a minister as an accomplice in a notorious crime"". 
 And more so when there existed “no investigation, prosecution and less so no conviction against the applicant,” said the court in a strongly worded  42-page judgment. 
 The magistrate condemned Azzopardi’s “irresponsible” manner, publishing his views on the subject simply because he felt he was right, rather than resorting to the competent authorities. 
 The right to freedom of expression could not be interpreted in that manner, concluded the court, declaring Azzopardi’s comments as defamatory.
 The court, presided over by Magistrate Rachel Montebello, awarded Abela €7,000 in damages plus costs.
 Azzopardi has said he intends to appeal the decision and is prepared to take the case to the European Court of Human Rights.

 The man, whose name was banned from publication in view of ongoing investigations, was arraigned following his arrest on Tuesday. 
 Police chanced upon him when they went to arrest another man who lived at the same Birzebbugia residence and was being investigated for offences relating to the financing of terrorism.
 
 While checking the accused's documents, the police also checked his mobile phone and found terrorism-related material.  
 A closer look at his phone allegedly revealed much more material than originally perceived, said the prosecution. 
 The man was charged with knowingly provoking terrorist acts by posting public messages, possessing and sharing terrorist material, recruiting or encouraging others to commit such acts, training others in the use of explosives, receiving training in the production and use of explosives, weapons, firearms or toxic substances and travelling through EU states to plan or carry out terrorist acts.
 No request for bail was made but the defendant’s lawyers requested the court to recommend to the principal immigration officer to suspend the running of the 30-day period after which the accused would be deemed an irregular migrant. 
 That 30-day period would likely lapse while the criminal proceedings are ongoing, argued the defence.

Increase in risk assessments following domestic violence reports,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/increase-risk-assessments-following-domestic-violence-reports.1096733,14-08-2024,"006825.png,006826.png","Updated 12.57pm with PN statement below.
 The number of risk assessments carried out on victims who filed domestic violence reports increased from 562 in the first six months last year, to 770 during the same period this year, the Foundation for Social Welfare Service said.
 The statement was issued a few days after the femicide of Nicolette Ghirxi, who was stabbed to death by her ex-partner, Edward Johnson on Sunday night.
 Ghirxi had filed harassment reports - in April and May – but turned down the offer to undergo a risk assessment as she did not feel her life was at risk at that moment in time.
 Women’s rights experts have come out saying that her murder was a wake-up call and highlighted the urgent need to address the often-underestimated dangers faced by victims of intimate partner violence. They called for stricter policies in place to investigate each harassment report with the strictest force of the law.
 In the statement, the Foundation for Social Welfare Services did not give a reason for the increase in risk assessments, but explained the reporting system when a person suffers any form of domestic violence.
 A report is first filed at the Gender-Based and Domestic Violence unit at police headquarters in Floriana, or at the Santa Luċija hub.
 This happens after the police explain to the victim what happens once a report is filed, in the presence of a risk assessor.
 The FSWS said that the risk assessment service is based on the value of client self-determination. The wish of the victim has to be respected. 
 The majority of those who file a police report agree to have a risk assessment but some refuse – either because they feel their life is not at risk, or they would have already carried out an assessment in the past and thought they would get the same risk ranking.  
 Throughout 2023 Appoġġ carried out 1,317 risk assessments for 1,104 people. Between January and June 2023 there were 562 assessments involving 506 people.
 In the first six months of this year, the risk assessments shot up to 770 assessments for 671 people.
 When a risk is deemed to be high, the case is referred to an MARAM – a Multi-Agency Risk Assessment Meeting.
 The introduction of the MARAM system was one of the recommendations by Judge Geoffrey Valencia in his  inquiry into the femicide of  Bernice Cassar in 2021.
 MARAM is made up of different entities that work directly with victims of domestic violence and their children. Its main role is to facilitate, monitor and evaluate cases of high-risk domestic violence victims and produce action plans to protect victims and their families.
 The Bernice Cassar inquiry also pointed out that risk assessment tools used to determine the level of danger a particular domestic violence victim faces must be fixed or changed. The tool had deemed her ""low risk"".
 The tool, known as the DASH system - Domestic Abuse, Stalking and Honour Risk Identification - has faced a build-up of criticism ever since it was introduced in Malta back in 2018.  This has since been changed to the Danger Assessment (DA) tool that started being used in the past month.
 Opposition leader Bernard Grech said on Wednesday that following a meeting with the Opposition members on parliament's social and family committees, the Opposition would be writing to the government, proposing a convening of both committees to meet stakeholders to discuss ways how tragedies such as that on Monday could be avoided.
 It was not enough to change the laws, he said. It needed to be ensured that the authorities were effective in their implementation.

Rangers contact police after waste left by Red Tower following big wedding,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/rangers-contact-police-waste-left-red-tower-following-big-wedding.1094384,24-06-2024,"006829.png,006830.png,006831.png,006832.png","The Malta Ranger Unit has filed a police report after heaps of equipment and litter were left next to the historic Red Tower in Mellieħa for more than a day following a glitzy wedding at the site. 
 The rangers said the wedding reception had left rubbish and equipment at the site for more than 24 hours in violation of the law.
 In a Facebook post, the unit said it had filed a report with the police’s Environmental Protection Unit (EPU) and the Environment and Resources Authority (ERA).
 A video shot by the rangers on Sunday night shows catering and lighting equipment, bins, trucks and heaps of open rubbish bags strewn about next to the Grade 1 listed building, which lies within L-Aħrax, a Natura 2000 site.
 Natura 2000 is a network of protected sites across Europe identified as “core breeding and resting sites for rare and threatened species and some rare natural habitat types"".
  When Times of Malta visited the site on Monday morning, litter and staging remained at the site though workers were onsite working to remove them.
 Speaking to Times of Malta, a spokesperson for the rangers said that not only had the wedding organisers “defaced a public space within a protected area, but also left all waste in open bags and on the ground for more than 24 hours.”
 The rangers stressed there should be “no exceptions” for adherence to environmental regulations, regardless of who the offender is.
 Responding to the controversy, the groom called the video uploaded by the rangers “misleading” and said the wedding had been ""covered with all relative permits,” adding he and others were “committed to returning the site in the best possible condition"".
 On Saturday night, more than 1,500 guests attended the glitzy wedding at the heritage site in Mellieha.
 But by Sunday evening, waste left over from the wedding had not been cleared from the site, with an inspection by the rangers that night finding heaps of rubbish, electronic equipment and scaffolding at the site.
  In a Facebook post on Monday morning, the rangers said the organisers had “surpassed the 24-hour deadline stipulated in SL. 549.40 [waste disposal regulations], to clean up after the event.”
 The unit said that due to the leftover waste ""being in the vicinity of a heritage site and also going into the protected nature site, the MRU has filed a report for aggravating circumstances both with the Environmental Protection Unit Police and ERA.”
 On Monday, the unit said it had reported waste at the site three times to ERA; on Friday while the place was being set up, on Sunday night and on Monday morning.
 “Not only did they deface a public space within a protected area, but also left all waste in open bags and on the ground for over 24 hours,” the unit said.
 “As rangers, we report people who don't contain waste and authorities report individuals who don't sort their household waste. There are no exceptions for this event whoever the offender is.
 Contacted for a response on Monday, the groom David Debono from db Group said the event was covered with all relative permits.
 “The permits included that the place is cleared and cleaned within an established period and, in fact, this morning, the first working day after the event, our contractors were on site to carry out the clearing process,” he said.
 ""It is misleading that the video which was uploaded on Facebook was taken very early this morning before the work started. It is normal for such a clearing and cleaning operation to take some time, but we are committed to returning the site in the best possible condition.”

Watch: Man attacks Valletta property with crowbar,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/watch-man-attacks-valletta-property-crowbar.1093859,06-12-2024,"006852.png,006853.png,006854.png","A family of Valletta residents was left in shock when a man in a helmet attacked their property with a crowbar on Monday, smashing a glass window. 
 The perpetrator was caught on CCTV camera walking along the pavement past the property on St Paul Street, and then returning to the property to smash its glass.
 In the footage, the man can be seen hitting the glass with all his might around six times before proceeding down the road.
 Dressed in black and wearing a closed helmet, he was not identifiable from the footage.
 The property is owned by architect Chris Briffa, who flagged the attack in a Facebook post.
 Although one perpetrator was seen on camera, Briffa spoke of two people involved in the incident with one waiting on a moped. 
 “Masked men from head to toe, attacking our property with a crowbar in the middle of a Monday night.
  “Our guests, staying one flight of stairs up had the shock of their lives, on their last night in Malta.
 “My family and I, a couple of floors up, have not been able to sleep properly since.”
 Briffa questioned whether it was an attempted break-in, or a direct attack, adding “we will probably never know”.
  But reactions of support to his post pointed out that it appeared to be “very much premeditated and meticulously planned”, given the choice of attire, ‘tools’ carried and the covered number plate of a motorbike.
 Police investigations into this case are currently underway after a report was made early on Monday morning.
 It stated that at around 1.30am, a guest at a residence in St Paul Street heard loud banging on the glass window, the police said.
 ""Once the guest went to check from the balcony, the unknown person, who had damaged the glass, had already left.""
  Briffa said the “two cowards” ran off when the lights from the guests’ bedroom came on.
 Commenting on the state of Valletta in 2024, he said he has lived in the city for almost 25 years, “in a safe environment, sometimes not even locking our front doors. Not any more it seems.
 “Valletta’s degeneration takes new heights.”
 Artist Alfred Camilleri, offering his solidarity on Facebook to Briffa and his young family and guests, echoed his thoughts, saying “Valletta seems to have been left to its unfortunate fate.
 “The plea of its residents for tranquillity and safety has been disregarded for far too long while the city is fast losing its charm and security.
 “Pity and shame!”

Latin American women forced into prostitution by Maltese trafficking ring,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/latin-american-women-forced-prostitution-maltese-trafficking-ring.1096674,13-08-2024,006855.png,"Foreign women were being brought to Malta and forced into prostitution by members of a human trafficking ring arrested in a series of police raids on Monday.
 The women were coerced into coming to Malta from Latin American countries and then forced to engage in prostitution either in brothels or in locations chosen by clients, such as their apartments, police sources said.
 Eleven arrests were made in Malta. All those arrested were Maltese, except a man and a woman who were Romanian.
 Police believe that the mastermind behind it all is 36-year-old Luke Farrugia, known as ""tal-beret"", sources told Times of Malta.  Farrugia is known to the police and has faced  similar charges in the past.
 The other arrested individuals were allegedly scheduling appointments for the women, managing the brothels, and driving the women to their appointments.
 Farrugia was arrested in Gżira by members of the police force's Special Intervention Unit. Other raids were made in St. Paul's Bay, Siġġiewi, Fgura, Gudja, Paola, Żebbuġ and Senglea.
 In the raids, police seized expensive watches and cars as well as a 'considerable' amount of cash, according to a statement.
 The Criminal Investigation Department, Financial Crimes Investigation Unit, the Gender-Based and Domestic Violence Unit, as well as the Asset Recovery Bureau were all involved.
 Sexual exploitation is one of the predominant forms of abuse that human trafficking victims in Malta face. 
 In 2022, police and Aġenzija Appoġġ identified 14 foreign trafficking victims, 12 for sexual exploitation.

Man remanded in custody after slashing former partner’s hand with knife,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/129098/man_remanded_in_custody_after_slashing_former_partners_hand_with_knife,09-05-2024,006901.png,"A 52-year-old man was remanded in custody on Thursday, after he allegedly slashed his ex-partner’s hand with a knife.
 The Kirkop resident, whose name is subject to a publication ban, was arraigned before magistrate Jean Paul Grech, charged with attacking and grievously injuring the woman.
 Police inspector Christian Cauchi, assisted by lawyer Jurgen Dalli from the Office of the Attorney General, told the court that on April 9, the police officers had gone to the Floriana Health Centre and escorted a woman who was being treated there. The woman had told doctors that her ex-partner had attacked her with a knife and hurt her.
  She told the police that she had been in a nine-year relationship with the defendant, which had ended last January. On the day of the alleged assault, the woman had gone to the defendant to collect some money that he owed her.
 The man had repeatedly asked her to get into his truck. When she refused to do so, the man disembarked and pulled out a knife, hitting her in the hand with it at some point.
 Inspector Cauchi added that when the man was arrested, he had burst into tears and told the arresting officers that he was sorry for his actions.
 In court this morning, the defendant pleaded not guilty to the charges. His lawyers, Franco Debono and Marion Camilleri, requested that he be released on bail, arguing that the man had psychiatric problems which required treatment at Mount Carmel Hospital.
 The prosecution objected to bail, due to the fact that the victim had not yet testified and could therefore be approached and intimidated by the defendant.
 The court denied bail and upheld a prosecution request for a protection order in favour of the woman. The defendant will be held at the Forensic Unit in order to receive the necessary psychiatric treatment.  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police

Prosecutors ordered to be specific with Fr Luke Seguna's freezing order,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/prosecutors-ordered-specific-fr-luke-seguna-freezing-order.1093968,14-06-2024,006904.png,"Prosecutors who have accused Fr Luke Seguna of money laundering have been ordered to identify which of the priest’s assets they want confiscated. Should they fail to do so, a blanket freezing order that Fr Seguna is currently subject to will cease to have effect, a court declared. 
 The decree stemmed from a request filed by lawyers assisting the former Marsaxlokk parish priest, who stands accused of money laundering, fraud and misappropriation.
 Fr Seguna was arraigned almost two years ago over charges of having allegedly misappropriated some €500,000 from 150 parishioners over a 10-year span.   He denies the charges and his case is still ongoing before the Magistrates’ Courts.
 The priest came under investigation after various bank transactions he made were flagged as suspicious. Prosecutors say he held hundreds of thousands of euros in various bank accounts, along with five motorbikes, two cars and a garage purchased for €34,000 despite a relatively meagre income as a clergyman. 
 Moreover, investigators allegedly traced payments totaling some €148,000 to payment processing companies linked to a porn site and several cheques issued by a third party to the priest. 
 Upon arraignment, all of Fr Seguna’s assets were confiscated under a blanket seizure and freezing order, as the law provided for at the time. 
 However, earlier this year those laws were amended to require prosecutors applying for a freezing order to indicate a specific amount of funds or assets which are to be confiscated. 
 As part of those legal changes, people facing money laundering cases – as in Fr Seguna’s case – were given the opportunity to ask for their freezing order to be brought into line with the new legal regime. 
 Seguna’s lawyers filed an application along those lines, requesting the court to vary the freezing order over the accused’s assets by limiting it to specific money, assets, or both. 
 The court, presided over by magistrate Rachel Montebello, observed that prosecutors were still presenting their evidence against Seguna in the case. 
 During the proceedings, a former police inspector who had been involved in the investigations testified about the priest’s bank accounts.
 Deposits between 2015 and 2022 totaled €449,373, including some €200,000 in cash deposits and €75,000 representing his total clergyman’s salary.
 Police traced no other sources of funds such as donations or inheritance. 
 There were also several vehicles registered in the accused’s name, the purchase of a garage and some €148,000 spent on three sites during that same period of time, the former investigator testified. 
 In terms of the recent amendments if the court concluded that the freezing order was to be regulated according to the new regime, it was to order the prosecution to indicate which of the accused’s property was subject to confiscation and that information was to reach the court within 90 days. 
 When all was considered, the court upheld Seguna’s request, thereby ordering the prosecution to list the assets or specific sum of money or both subject to confiscation on a reasonable basis. 
 
 That order was to be complied with within 90 days from the date of the decree. 
 The court could also issue further instructions to determine the specific amounts or assets to be confiscated.
 However, if the prosecution failed to fulfil that order within the statutory time-limit, the seizing and freezing order would cease to have effect in terms of law.

Man who hid 4.8kg of cannabis under a loaf of bread jailed for 10 years,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/man-hid-48kg-cannabis-loaf-bread-jailed-10-years.1094179,22-06-2024,006910.png,"A man who was found guilty of cannabis possession in a case that dates back to 2008, has been jailed for 10 years after being found guilty last year.
 Jesmond Mary Vella, known as Il-Bulgaru, was found guilty of aggravated possession after 20 cannabis resin blocks were discovered inside a truck outside a Mosta garage some 16 years ago.
 Back in 2008, Vella was under police surveillance as they suspected he was involved in illicit drug activity, with officers noting that he frequently visited a garage in Triq in-Naġġar, Mosta.
 While a search of the property and two cars parked within did not yield any results, a Bedford truck parked outside proved to be a different story.
 In a bucket-like container and stashed away under a loaf of stale bread, they found 20 blocks of cannabis resin with a total weight of some 4.8 kgs.
 The substance was later examined and certified as having 8.2% purity, with a market value of €30,943.
 During the trial, Vella’s former employer and the owner of the truck testified that, due to having an open flatbed, unknown people would dump “all sorts of rubbish” in the truck all the time.
 He said that, though he was listed as the vehicle’s registered owner, it was Vella who primarily drove the truck as he found it too cumbersome.
 At the time of the discovery, the truck had been parked outside for a month or so since it had developed some fault and its owner had decided not to renew its licence once it expired.
 In 2021, Vella was arrested in Libya and arraigned in Tripoli over alleged involvement in organised crime, drugs and human trafficking.
 It is understood that these proceedings in Libya caused some delay in the delivery of Vella’s final judgment in this case.
 A jury found Vella guilty of cannabis possession six votes to three in December 2023, with Madam Justice Consuelo Scerri Herrera handing down her sentence just last month.
 The office of the attorney general had initially sought a life sentence for Vella. He has remained in preventive custody throughout this time.
 Vella was sentenced to a 10-year effective jail term as well as a €20,000 fine. He was also ordered to pay €1,820.11 in court expenses.

 The man, who cannot be named due to a publication ban, was arraigned on Sunday morning following a police report filed by his girlfriend, who also cannot be named due to the same orders.

                     He pleaded not guilty to a number of charges, including rape, holding his partner against her will as well as slighly injuring her and committing non-consensual sexual acts.

 Inspector Omar Zammit informed the Court that the alleged victim, who is five months pregnant with the man’s child, had filed a police report on Friday alleging that her partner locked her up in his apartment, assaulted her and threatened her with a screwdriver.

 She furthermore alleged that she had been raped on three separate occasions in June.

 The man also filed a police report alleging that he had been assaulted by his partner, with a medical certificate stating that he suffered slight injuries.

 Although the couple had briefly broken up, they rekindled their relationship a few months later.

 The defence requested bail and that the names of the accused and alleged victim be banned from publication. Whilst the prosecution did not object to the latter request, an objection was raised in relation to the request for bail.

 Whereas the defence cited that the accused has a clean criminal record as well as a fixed address and regular job, the prosecution noted that the victim was yet to testify.

 The request for bail was ultimately rejected. It was noted that precautions had to be taken owing to the alleged victim’s pregnancy and that a domestic violence risk assessment deemed the victim to be at high risk.

‘My boss asked me to find someone to kill his wife’,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/my-boss-asked-find-someone-kill-wife.1097800,09-09-2024,006934.png,"A Maltese business owner asked his employee to find him a hitman to murder his estranged wife, the employee has claimed under oath. 
 The worker says his former boss was willing to pay thousands to have someone strangle his wife while she slept at home.
 He also declared that the husband had installed equipment both inside and outside her apartment to monitor her movements and record her conversations.
 The alleged plot was revealed in court by a foreign worker in Malta, who said that his Maltese boss repeatedly pressured him to arrange for a killer to strangle his foreign-born wife in her bed.
 The disturbing details emerge from court documents accessed by Times of Malta nearly a month after the  murder of Nicolette Ghirxi, who was stabbed to death by her former partner on August 8.
 The names of the parties involved in the alleged murder plot are being withheld on legal advice, but the wife’s lawyers want the details published, claiming it shows police inaction in cases of domestic violence.
 The couple married in 2005 but separated after 13 years of marriage.
  The worker, a skilled tradesman, was originally hired to work for the Maltese family business, located in the south of Malta, at the end of 2017.
 He told the court that his boss had approached him to help him kill his wife after learning that the worker’s brother was in prison in their native country.
 The Maltese man allegedly believed this connection would enable his employee to source a hitman.
 “He thought I could easily find someone to kill his wife because of my brother’s situation… He even drew a plan showing how the hit should be done,” the employee said.
 According to the testimony, the businessman plotted to have his wife suffocated at 3am, ensuring their young daughter would not witness the crime.
 He allegedly promised his employee €10,000 to facilitate the killing and asked him to bring the hitman to a seaside town in the east of the island, where he would stay for two weeks before returning home after completing the job.
 Despite the pressure, the employee never followed through with the plan, and he eventually provided police with the conversations and plans that his boss had shared with him.
 The woman reported the claim to the police’s Gender-Based Domestic Violence Unit on March 11, 2021, after receiving a WhatsApp voice call and voice notes from the former employee, who by then had gone back to his country of origin. 
 The former employee then returned to Malta last November to testify under oath.
 Last January, fielding questions from the woman’s lawyer in court, a police inspector testified that she had spoken to CID investigators about the claim that her husband was plotting to kill her.
 In addition to the murder plot, the court heard how the husband had beaten the wife, with one particular incident leading to his arrest in March 2019.
 The husband had also installed surveillance equipment in their home, including a hidden camera and a microphone, which he used to spy on his wife’s conversations.
 The witness testified that he was asked to help conceal the recording devices and translate the woman’s conversations from her native language, in which he was fluent.
  The witness remained silent about the murder plot until he received an e-mail from the woman, at which point he decided to report the case.
 “I felt I had to speak up and tell everything that had happened,” he said in court, aided by a translator.
 He also forwarded his communications with his former employer to the police.
 In her recent decree, the inquiring magistrate ordered the police to further investigate the matter but despite a lengthy inquiry into the case, the court ruled there was insufficient prima facie evidence to confirm that a crime had been committed.
 
 The couple were married in 2005 and had three children but were legally separated in 2018. 
 During the latter stages of their relationship, over a period of months, the woman filed a series of reports against her husband but decided not to proceed to protect her family.
 The youngest of the couple’s three children lived with the mother for a while. The other two lived with the maternal grandmother.
 March 7, 2019: The woman filed a domestic violence report at a police station where she accused her estranged husband of harassment.  She scored high on a risk assessment carried out by Appoġġ professionals. As per procedure, her husband was arrested, charged in court the day after and placed on police bail.
 March 11, 2021: At 6am, the woman received a WhatsApp call from an Eastern European city. The man on the other end of the line, whom she recognised, informed her how her husband had, in the previous months, conspired to kill her.
 In one Whatsapp voice message, her husband’s former employee warned her that “he said that you must be killed, by the killer, he said to me a lot”.
 In another, he said that “[he] always has been offering, let a man come from the [country], so he will pay forty or fifty thousand for you, to eliminate you. All apartments will be his, you will have nothing.”
 A third message disclosed how “your husband said he placed video cameras on the street to hear everything, who came and who left from you. He placed the cameras on the street and on cars.”
 Later that day, the woman lodged a report at the Gender Based Domestic Violence Unit, claiming her husband had plotted her murder.  
 Following this report, the woman took another risk assessment carried out by Appoġġ which again scored high.
 It is understood that at this point the police opened an investigation. The woman spoke to CID inspectors but five-and-a-half months later, evidence was yet to be gathered.
 August 31, 2021: The victim filed a report with Magistrate Ian Farrugia stating that her life was in danger because her estranged husband wanted to kill her. According to her testimony, a former employee had revealed to her that her husband had pressured him to hire a hitman to kill her.
 The woman provided the court with recordings in which the witness explained the husband’s plan. She further testified that her husband had spied on her for some time, installing surveillance equipment in their home. She discovered one of the hidden cameras herself.
 She also said she had been informed about a hole in the ceiling that had been dug by her husband to install additional recording devices. 
 The witness would later say in court that he had been asked by the husband to cover up the hole with a tile.  According to him, the husband used recording devices, including an outdoor camera opposite the wife’s apartment, to monitor her movements and conversations.
 In her report, the woman said this formed part of what she described as a pattern of harassment and abuse.
 September 14, 2021: Magistrate Farrugia ruled that there were sufficient grounds to continue the investigation into the woman’s claims. This included investigating potential crimes such as violation of private property, harassment, stalking, conspiracy and voluntary homicide.
 September 30, 2021: The husband responded to these developments with a legal challenge, filing an application by which he sought to dismiss the charges brought by his wife, arguing that no criminal offence had occurred.
 During the next 19 months, the criminal court heard several witnesses. A psychological evaluation of the woman was carried out by court experts.
 April 27, 2023: The court dismissed the husband’s appeal, affirming there was enough preliminary evidence to warrant further inquiry into the allegations. The court noted that the offences described, particularly the murder plot, would carry a prison sentence exceeding three years if proven. The court concluded that the elements of the crime, as described by the woman, should be preserved for further investigation.
 October 11, 2023: The Court Registrar assigned the case to an inquiring magistrate who proceeded with the appointment of experts and the collection of forensic evidence. This included the extraction of relevant digital evidence from the woman’s mobile phone and laptop, including videos, audios, WhatsApp messages and e-mails. The court also appointed a media company to photograph the surveillance equipment found in the house, including the hole in the ceiling where the woman had discovered wires and cameras.
 Additionally, an IT expert was assigned to inspect the husband’s laptop, which was in police custody. This review was conducted under the supervision of a police inspector, and any relevant materials were to be preserved and presented in court.
 Over the next few months, reports were submitted to the court. But key to the whole case was the testimony given by the witness in court on November 23, 2023.
 That same day, representatives of the media company returned with photographic evidence, confirming they had documented the surveillance set-up.
 January 9, 2024: The digital forensic report was presented, while the IT report, detailing the contents of the husband’s laptop, was delivered on April 5.
 May 6, 2024: The inquiring magistrate concluded that there was still insufficient evidence to establish, prima facie, that a criminal offence had occurred.
 While the woman had described serious incidents of stalking and harassment, and the installation of surveillance equipment had been confirmed, the magistrate found that the evidence did not clearly point to a specific criminal act or an identifiable perpetrator.
 Moreover, the court noted that several of the woman’s complaints might fall under civil jurisdiction, particularly in light of the couple’s ongoing separation proceedings and the dispute over the care and custody of their children. These proceedings had been running parallel to the criminal investigation, further complicating the case.
 While the magistrate could not establish prima facie evidence of a crime, the court did not close the case. Instead, she emphasised the need for further police investigation.
 The court acknowledged that serious concerns remained about the husband’s alleged conduct and ordered the executive police to continue probing the matter.

More than €1.1 million in fines declared null after court finds FIAU breached companies' rights,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/129982/more_than_11_million_in_fines_declared_null_after_court_finds_fiau_breached_companies_rights,29-06-2024,006939.png,"The Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit (FIAU) was called out twice in two separate cases, where Judge Toni Abela found that the department’s investigations broke two companies' fundamental rights.
 The cases involved Truevo Payments Ltd, who were fined €443,670 by the FIAU, as well as Vivaro Ltd who were fined €733,160 on the basis of money laundering. 
 Following the company’s appeal, the court found that the department’s investigation process was carried out improperly. 
  The companies complained that when the FIAU sent them a minding letter, which is supposed to notify a company that an investigation led the FIAU to consider imposing fines, the department did not inform them about the value of said fines. 
 The companies argued that they did not know the nature of the case against them, and could not defend themselves properly.
 The court further declared the FIAU’s investigations null and ordered the department to pay for the court procedures.
 This is not the first time the court, or Judge Toni Abela erased heft fines issued in a flawed manner.
 Last February, Abela thrashed the FIAU for fines he described as “quasi-criminal,” noting that such fines should be issued by a court or juridical body that gives such companies the basic right of being tried by an independent and autonomous tribunal.
 A Court of Appeal had already declared in 2023 that the FIAU could not assume on itself the power to issue onerous fines against the firms it regulates.  ",Matthew Farrugia ,court_and_police

 The criminal charges related to bribery and corruption in sporting events were filed at the same time that the Malta Football Association launched disciplinary proceedings against Qala Saints FC, its outfield player Manuel Xerri and Żebbuġ Rovers goalkeeper Leonard Camilleri.  
  The players have also been suspended until their appearance before the MFA’s Disciplinary and Ethics Committee on Wednesday, together with Qala Saints FC.
 The charges come after a joint  investigation, conducted by the MFA Integrity Office and the police, into a GFA Division One match between Nadur Youngsters and Qala Saints at the Gozo Stadium in March, which had ended in a 1-1 draw. 
 The Malta FA is accusing the club and the two footballers of attempting to bribe a Nadur Youngsters player. Nadur Youngsters took the GFA Division One title, topping the table, two points ahead of Qala Saints. 
 MFA Integrity Officer Herman Mula said the arrangement appeared to have been made before the two clubs’ encounter on March 17. 
 A Qala Saints player had allegedly organised the approach to Xerri and Camilleri in a bid to give his club the advantage.  
 Xerri, Camilleri, and Qala Saints are scheduled to appear before the Malta FA’s Board Control Disciplinary and Ethics Committee to address the accusations. 
 Mula confirmed that the Malta FA Integrity Unit had begun disciplinary proceedings against both Camilleri and Xerri as well as against the Division One side. Camilleri and Xerri have been suspended from football activities until their hearing before the MFA board next week.
 Inspector Wayne Borg is prosecuting, while lawyers Frank Athony Tabone and Shazoo Ghaznavi will be assisting Leonard Camilleri and Manuel Xerri, respectively, in the impending criminal proceedings.  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police
Man who skipped bail for six days charged with injuring partner in her face,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/man-skipped-bail-six-days-charged-injuring-partner-face.1092746,20-05-2024,006970.png,"A man wanted by police for skipping bail landed under arrest after his partner reported him over a violent incident in which she suffered facial injuries.
 The 32-year-old Rabat man had allegedly failed to sign the bail book for six days in a row after being granted bail in a different case in June. 
 On May 17, his partner, bearing visible facial injuries, filed a domestic violence report.
 That report led investigators to track down the man who as he was not residing at the Rabat address where he was registered for bail purposes. 
 On Monday, the man, whose job entails inspecting water leaks, was charged with slightly injuring his partner, insulting and threatening her, breaching bail conditions and relapsing. 
 He pleaded not guilty. 
 A request for bail was objected to not only because the accused had previously been granted bail while appealing a three-year jail term for fraud and theft, but also in view of his criminal record.
 “Unfortunately he’s violent and has a drug problem. That’s what caused him to commit one crime after another,” argued Inspector Godwin Scerri.
 “He is not trustworthy,” he added.
 There was also a real fear of tampering with evidence since the alleged victim was still to testify, Inspector Sherona Buhagiar pointed out. 
 The accused had gone back to the victim’s residence even after she had reported him to the Domestic Violence Unit. 
 Moreover, he had breached various bail conditions. 
 Not only did he fail to sign the bail book, but he allegedly committed another offence, was staying at another address and was out past curfew when the nighttime violence allegedly took place.
 Defence lawyer Yanika Bugeja countered that the accused - a diabetic patient - had medical certificates to explain his failure to sign the bail book. 
 Moreover, he had issues with his mother and that was why he had moved out of her Rabat home. 
 But he had a fixed job and an alternative address in St Paul’s Bay. 
 After hearing submissions, the court presided over by Magistrate Rachel Montebello, turned down the request in view of the risk assessment, the reported facts, the accused’s criminal record and drug addiction which made him untrustworthy.

Former Labour MP in benefits racket has freezing order reduced to €4.5 million in assets,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/131404/former_labour_mp_in_benefits_racket_slapped_with_45_million_freezing_order,26-09-2024,006977.png,"The Court of Magistrates has imposed new limits on the amount of assets frozen against former Labour MP Silvio Grixti and four other defendants charged with theft and misappropriation in the benefits fraud case.
 The court of Magistrate Rachel Montebello issued decrees on the assets to be seized and frozen in the charges against Grixti, and co-conspirators Roger Agius, Emanuel Spagnol, Dustin Caruana and Luke Saliba in the €6 million racket of disability benefit fraud.
 The court ordered a total of €4.5 million in assets to be frozen Grixti's case. Agius’s frozen assets were limited to €60,000; Spagnol’s at €90,000; Caruana's at €153,000, and Saliba's at €47,000.
  These amounts will be subject to confiscation in the case of a conviction. The variations came in the wake of the freezing order issued back in April 2024, when the court froze all monies and other movable or immovable property belonging to the accused.
 In March, Silvio Grixti, a medical doctor and former Labour MP, and four others, Roger Agius, Emmanuel Spagnol, Dustin Caruana and Luke Saliba, had been charged with setting up and forming part of a criminal organisation, defrauding the Department of Social Security of an amount in excess of €5,000 and forging official documents.
 The men are also accused of forging public documents and knowingly making use of them, making a false declaration to the public authorities and possession of items intended to be used for fraudulent purposes, as well as a separate charge of money laundering.
 Grixti is accused of having provided applicants with medical certificates for disabilities which they did not suffer from in reality, allowing them to qualify for the allowance, after appearing before a medical board.
 The police accuse Agius, Spagnol, Caruana and Saliba of having acted as intermediaries, who collected payments from the fraudulent beneficiaries.
 A detailed list of the beneficiaries found on Grixti’s laptop, were grouped by their link to the different defendants, together with records of the amounts Grixti had received and the totals paid out by the Social Security Department to the fraudulent beneficiaries.
 Further names to those discovered on Grixti’s laptop, were found detailed in handwritten ledgers which the police recovered from Emmanuel Spagnol’s home, according to the testimony of police inspectors. Spagnol and Grixti had split the takings, a court was told.  ",Matthew Vella ,court_and_police

 Her 25-year-old son has been living on the streets since and he refuses help. The mother can do nothing about it because her son is an adult.
 “My son is sick. Since he started taking drugs, he is not the same person. He developed paranoia. Does not trust anyone. He gets furious for no reason, he smashes things. He needs help.
 ""But, because he is an adult, there is nothing I can do. He has decided to self-sabotage, and I can only stand and watch,” says his mother.
 The woman – who first expressed the desire to share her story in the Facebook community Women for Women – spoke to Times of Malta on condition of anonymity.
  She explains that her son never got a diagnosis, has never been to court and has never tried to hurt himself or anyone – so far.
 Problems started when her son was 18 years old. A shy man, he started hanging around with relatives who did drugs.
 He started ordering synthetic cannabis online which would be delivered at home. Such drugs are known to be associated with mental health problems.
 As time passed, she noticed he started to change. He dropped out of MCAST, took on a job as a delivery person and stopped caring about his looks.
 “He became paranoid at work and home. He was even paranoid about food and thought I would poison him. He locked himself in his room and did not want to meet anyone… A year into this, his hair started falling out.
  “I convinced him to go to a dermatologist and she immediately noticed he was depressed – but he did not take the medication… He started getting angry and swearing for no reason – banging and breaking things around the house. I had to call in the police on two occasions, but they did not do much,” she said.
 Meanwhile, as the situation escalated, her youngest daughter started to feel unsafe.
 She warned her son he would have to leave if he did not change his ways.
 “I offered to take him wherever he needed for help. I tried going everywhere. I was always told the same thing: they cannot do anything unless he wants help,” she says.
 He ignored her. The anger and negativity continued.
  “I thought about it for very long. Then one day I just had to. I told him to leave,” she says.
 Initially, he went to relatives who had first introduced him to drugs, but they eventually kicked him out – and he ended up on the streets.
 It’s been two years, during which his mother tried to keep track of his whereabouts.
 There was a time when he lived in a room in a field. Then in a disused garage for a few months. He slept outdoors with other homeless people or in shelters. He eats from soup kitchens.
 She recently recognised his shirt in a photo shared on social media – the photo showed a dirty mattress and someone’s personal belongings in a parking area.
  “Now and again, he comes home. I always let him in. I allow him to shower. But, when I offer to drive him to get help, he gets angry again. He tells me that this is his life now.
 “My son begs for money. The same boy who was so shy he would not speak to strangers, now asks strangers for money. He still buys drugs from the money he gets,” she says.
 The mother feels helpless and does not know what else she can do.
 “I still feel very guilty. Because I had to get to this point. Because I did not find a solution to bring him back. Because I was a single mother, and he had no father figure.
 “I thought that, if I throw him out and he’d find himself alone, he would come back and accept help. But this did not happen. It breaks me to know he is out there. That this is what he wants. But drugs are an illness – and I should be able to help my sick son even if he does not want my help.”
 Prof Anton Grech, clinical chairman of Mental Health Services, explained that while an addict cannot make rational decisions, one has to maintain a balance and ensure there is no breach of basic human rights.
 Research showed the success rates of addicts forced into rehab were similar to those of people who chose to start a programme.
 An addict who refuses help could be forced into it by order of a court. The Mental Health Act also provides for treatment against a person’s will if that person is deemed a danger to others or himself.
 If there is reasonable suspicion that a person suffers from severe mental health issues, then the person could be admitted against their will for 24 hours to get a diagnosis – following a doctor’s referral.

Man denied bail after allegedly breaching court order,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/man-denied-bail-allegedly-breaching-court-order.1097919,09-11-2024,007006.png,"A man who allegedly forced his wife to flee their home at night during a row was back in court on Wednesday for allegedly sending messages to his wife's employer in defiance of a court order.
 The woman had told a court in July that she had rushed out of the house at night wrapped solely in a bedsheet after she was assaulted by her husband.
 The 54-year-old man from St Paul's Bay was eventually granted bail under certain conditions, including a warning not to approach or communicate with the prosecution witnesses in any manner.  
 But he allegedly sent a series of SMSs to his wife’s boss. 
 On Wednesday he was charged with harassing the wife’s employer, insulting and threatening both of them, breaching bail as well as a protection order in favour of his wife.
 He pleaded not guilty.
 The man’s lawyer, Maria Meilaq Schembri,  argued that there was no breach of the protection order.
 She said the defendant had closely abided by bail conditions over the past three weeks and noted that the phone where the calls were supposed to have been made from had not been found. She said his client only missed observing bail conditions once, and that was on Tuesday when he needed to visit a health centre.
 “Now he has understood that next time he must inform the inspector,” said the lawyer. 
 But prosecutor Omar Zammit countered that the prosecution had ample evidence and did not charge the defendant simply over “frivolous allegations.” 
 A request for bail was objected to by the prosecution not only because a number of civilians still have to testify, including the defendant’s son, but also because the defendant was not truly living with his brother as he claimed.
 He has been living at the matrimonial home, said the inspector.
 Magistrate Lara Lanfranco turned down the request because of the various civilian witnesses to testify and also in view of the circumstances of the case leading to this arrest.
 Lawyers Jason Azzopardi, Kris Busietta and Alessandro Farrugia are appearing for the woman.

 Clyde Mallia accused of shooting and killing the cat, while also causing it to suffer, after the accused was filmed during the incident.
 The case dates back to 1 June, when the bystander reported the case to the police, also handing over the footage.
  Testifying, police inspector Sarah Kathleen Zerafa told the court the footage showed a car coming to a stop, before shots were fired at the animal. After it was hit, the cat was seen shaking and juddering, until it collapsed and died.
 The car’s number plate was clearly seen in the footage handed over to the police, and was traced back to its owner – a woman.
 The woman informed the police that the car was owned by her daughter’s ex-boyfriend, the accused, and that it was only registered in her name.
 A few days later, Mallia was seen driving the same car, leading to a warrant being issued for his arrest, according to Zerafa.
 Meanwhile, during the interrogation of Mallia’s ex-girlfriend, she revealed to the police that she was with Mallia in the car at the time of the shooting and provided precise details of the incident's location and manner.
 After the interrogation, the police searched Mallia’s home, finding a box of bullets and airgun pellets, but no weapon. An autopsy on the dead cat revealed the bullets matched with those found in the accused’s possession.
 The accused pleaded not guilty to the charges brought against him, with the prosecution objecting to a request for bail, fearing tampering of evidence as civilian witnesses were yet to testify.
 It also said he could not be trusted to obey the court’s conditions, having been accused of breaching four previous bail conditions.

 The morning’s sitting was largely taken up by the last of the prosecution witnesses testifying about their involvement in the magisterial inquiry into the case as well as continued pushback from the defence on the freezing orders issued against the accused. 
 Inspector Wayne Borg testified about his involvement in the inquiry, including his presence during a number of searches and his role in notifying witnesses who were requested to testify during the inquiry. 
 At one point, he was confronted by lawyer Stephen Tonna Lowell, who asked why there was a discrepancy in the acts of the inquiry, which indicated his clients as accomplices in the proceedings, while the charges filed against them indicated them as primary instigators. 
 He replied that such decisions were made by the Attorney General.
 Asked why the police had not acted on a report by the National Audit Office which also indicated shortcomings and cast suspicion on the hospitals concession, Borg replied that he did not know. 
 Lawyer Stefano Filletti requested a constitutional reference on the freezing order.  
 The lawyers argued that the limited time window allowed them to file an appeal to the assets freeze as well as the inequality of arms at the disposal of the defence in terms of evidence was potentially breaching their clients’ constitutional rights. 
 Prosecutor Francesco Refalo objected to the request, saying that the defence had not indicated which of the defendants’ human rights were likely to be breached by the freezing orders. He also cited case law that held that the court should hold back from making a constitutional reference when one had already been raised before the court of constitutional jurisdiction. 
 Filletti countered that the provisions regulating freezing orders were most likely to breach his client’s right to a fair hearing. Furthermore, the attachment order could be extended twice for six-month periods. 
 The court is expected to rule on this matter during the next sitting. 
 Filletti requested details about the list of experts appointed by the court and any changes made to it, however, the prosecution objected, saying it could not understand how this was relevant.
 Filletti officially requested the court to require the registrar to confirm whether the experts appointed in the magisterial inquiry are, in fact, on that list, with the prosecution rebutting that the magistrate was free to appoint experts according to its needs and was not bound by a list. 
 Former prime minister Joseph Muscat and his two former associates, Keith Schembri and Konrad Mizzi, are also facing parallel charges in connection with the concession, having earlier denied charges of money laundering, bribery and criminal association, among other serious crimes. 
 In a sitting on Wednesday, Muscat and the other co-accused went to court to challenge the €30 million asset freeze, arguing that the prosecution had not provided sufficient evidence to prove that the freezing of such an amount was merited. 
 The former prime minister's lawyers argued that the freezing order with respect to Muscat must be limited to the €60,000 mentioned in the process verbal of the magisterial inquiry. 
 Lawyers for Schembri and Mizzi also asked for a constitutional reference in the case challenging the freezing orders. Their request was upheld.

 Harold Mamo was denied bail and remanded in custody due to concerns of evidence tampering. The Court imposed a ban on the publication of the man's profession. He does not work at Identità.

 Testifying against the accused, a police inspector explained that in August 2024, people began to notice that letterboxes affixed to vacant properties were filled with Identità documents for third-country nationals to collect their residence permits.

 This came to light after ex-MP Jason Azzopardi exposed a racket at Identità through a series of social media posts. He later requested a magisterial inquiry, which is underway. 

                     These properties were vacant, and the owners were unaware. In one case in Sliema, a Maltese individual told police she visited her mother’s property and found a letterbox affixed to its façade, containing letters from Identità.

 Information from Identità and the Housing Authority revealed five people living in the Sliema property without the owner’s consent. The owner’s mother was unaware of this. When questioned, the third-country nationals provided the police with Mamo's mobile number, claiming he had provided the lease agreements. A warrant for Mamo’s arrest was issued, shortly after.

 During the investigation, police found that Mamo used an office inside of a barbershop. They searched his residence and found €9,000 in cash, along with several lease agreements, and several third country nationals going in and out of the property to obtain lease agreements.

 The defence did not contest the validity of the accused’s arrest. The accused pleaded not guilty, and requested his release from arrest. The prosecution objected due to a risk of tampering evidence.

 The defence argued that there are a number of witnesses which need to testify. Due to the nature of cases and the fact that the witnesses are foreigners, the defence questioned, “what contact does the accused have with these individuals?”.

 The Court, presided by Magistrate Charmaine Galea, upheld the prosecution’s request for a freezing order on the accused’s assets. However, the court is not convinced that the accused can observe all the orders obliged on him, and so denied the bail request.

Asad Ali’s lawyer calls for reversal of gag order in Vitals case,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/asad-ali-lawyer-calls-reversal-gagging-order-vitals-case.1094313,22-06-2024,007029.png,"A former consultant for Vitals and Steward charged over his role in the fraudulent hospitals concession is seeking to reverse a court order prohibiting him from commenting on the case.
 The request was made by lawyers representing Asad Shaukat Ali, the son of Shaukat Ali Chaudhry who is believed to have been secretly running Vitals Global Healthcare (VGH), in light of “heavy coverage and speculative statements in the press.""
 VGH was the concessionaire in the €4 billion contract to operate three state hospitals, a deal that was annulled by a civil court last year on the basis of fraud.
 Asad Ali is pleading not guilty to involvement in a criminal organisation as well as bribing top public officials including former prime minister Joseph Muscat.
 He was charged under summons earlier this month.
 In a court hearing on Friday, the defence requested the court reconsider a decree issued at the first hearing that prohibits the accused from publicly commenting about the proceedings. 
 Lawyer Shazoo Ghaznavi asked the court to “reconsider such decree in light of heavy coverage and speculative statements in the press, including but not limited to the absurd assertion that the accused was in some manner cooperating with the AG’s [Attorney General's] office with a view to some form of plea bargaining"".
 Ghaznavi described the allegation as ""totally unfounded... and a complete untruth.”
 Prosecuting lawyers objected to the request because, they argued, such a court order was meant to “ensure that proceedings are conducted in the best interests of justice.”
 Moreover, the prosecution declared that there were “no such discussions” for a possible plea bargain with the AG’s Office.
 The court is expected to decide upon the defence’s request at the next sitting next month.
 During Friday's case, former police inspector Anthony Scerri testified about his role in assisting inquiring Magistrate Gabriella Vella, who was handling the voluminous inquiry into the fraudulent deal.
 Scerri’s role, like that of other police officers roped into the magisterial inquiry, was limited to summoning witnesses and executing search warrants under the magistrate’s direction.
 He recalled discussing with the magistrate a particular media story published in November 2021 about two former directors of Swiss-based company Accutor, Tyrone Greenshields and Kamal Sharma, who had spoken to the media claiming to have information that was “valuable” to the inquiry.
 Scerri said he contacted the two individuals via Interpol, urging them to come to Malta to testify.
 He did not know if they ever did, explained the former officer who was tasked with leading the search at Joseph Muscat’s home in January 2022.
 Around the same time, the magistrate had issued warrants for other searches at a Ta’ Xbiex residence and also at ID Malta.
 After those last three searches, Scerri was not involved any further.
 He resigned from the corps in August 2022.
 Under cross examination, Scerri explained that the Vitals inquiry was “different” from other inquiries initiated by the police.
 In those inquiries, the police would ask the inquiring magistrate to appoint experts to assist the police. But in the Vitals inquiry, the police were simply asked to assist.
 They were ordered to seize files and devices under the guidance of foreign experts but were “not privy” to the material seized.
 Over 100 persons were summoned to testify in the inquiry, said superintendent Rennie Stivala who took over after Scerri’s resignation.
 Asked whether “Eurasia”, or “Incorps” or “Assad” rang a bell, Stivala replied they didn't.
 “To be fair we carried out searches on the magistrate’s instructions… and were assisted by experts who gave us keywords to go by,” said Stivala.
 Stivala was succeeded by inspector Wayne R. Borg who testified on Friday that the police had “no visibility of the documents seized.”
 He confirmed that police did not question anyone, including Assad Ali.
 “No person was ever requested to report to FCID to give an explanation on this inquiry,"" he said.
 Faced with a statement in the inquiry report saying that “further police investigation” could be required, Borg said the police and Attorney General were discussing possible further investigations by the police.
 Charges had been issued against Asad Ali and his father but further criminal investigations were still being considered.

Court finds lecturer's transfer out of MCAST was abuse of power,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/court-finds-lecturer-transfer-mcast-abuse-power.1093797,06-11-2024,007046.png,"A decision to transfer geologist Peter Gatt from the Malta College for Arts, Science and Technology to a secondary school, was an abuse of power by college authorities and therefore null, a court declared.
 Gatt’s legal saga started when he received an email from the permanent secretary at the Education Ministry in June 2021, informing him that the following day was to be his last day as lecturer at MCAST.
 He had been lecturing at MCAST’s Building and Construction Engineering department since 2014 when he was first hired there on a one-year contract that could be renewed year-on-year.
 He was later engaged on an indefinite contract. 
 Gatt claimed that trouble with management and staff at MCAST brewed when he pointed out the “poor quality” of certain study units that he was expected to lecture upon. 
 In September 2020, the college principal told Gatt that his detailing was being revoked. The lecturer was asked to hand back his equipment and keys to the college.
 However, since the Manual on Resourcing, Policies and Procedures within the public service stipulated that such decision was subject to final approval by the Prime Minister, which in this case was lacking, Gatt continued to report at MCAST but was not assigned any duties. 
 MCAST then filed disciplinary proceedings against Gatt.
 In June 2021 a disciplinary board issued a 15-day suspension without pay and a warning that could result in the lecturer being fired for four years.
 Meanwhile, Gatt took his grievances before the Ombudsman claiming that as from the start of that academic year, he was not “assigned classes, was not given a timetable of lectures, was forbidden to contact students within the institute…..and was removed from the department’s mailing list.”
 In May 2021 the Commissioner for Education at the Ombudsman’s Office upheld the complaint “…to the extent and in so far as it refers to MCAST’s decision not to assign to [Gatt] any teaching duties and to his being prevented from contacting students for such a long period while still on the books of MCAST.”
 Such an act was “oppressive and tantamount to degrading treatment of the complainant by the said institution,” concluded the Commissioner. 
 Then came the communication from the Education Ministry informing Gatt that his detailing at MCAST had been revoked on June 11, 2021. 
 He was to report at Pembroke’s secondary school as his new place of work.
 Faced with the prospects of such a demotion, the lecturer sought and obtained a warrant of prohibitory injunction which was upheld by the First Hall, Civil Court in July 2021, effectively blocking the transfer. 
 Gatt then filed an action against MCAST, its principal and deputy principal, the Prime Minister, the Education Minister and his permanent secretary, the permanent secretary (People and Standards) at OPM and the State Advocate, requesting the court to review the decision taken in his regard. 
 
 MCAST pleaded that it was non-suited because it had nothing to do with the final decision approving the revocation of Gatt’s detailing at the college. 
 However, the court, presided over by Madam Justice Audrey Demicoli, observed that the college played an active role in the process leading to the revocation of Gatt’s detailing at MCAST.
 Moreover, since staffing matters fell within the competence of the college principal, namely Joachim James Calleja, both he and the institution were legitimately suited, the judge said. 
 As for the merits, the court turned down Gatt’s claim that the administrative act was null because it breached his fundamental rights to protection against inhuman treatment and freedom of expression. 
 Such a claim did not fall within the parameters of the ordinary courts. 
 Nor could the authorities’ decision be annulled on the basis that they had not observed principles of natural justice or mandatory procedures. 
 There was no abuse of power and no bad faith by the Prime Minister and/or the permanent secretary who simply acted upon the information supplied by MCAST.
 However, Gatt’s claim merited being upheld on the grounds that the administrative decision constituted an abuse of power by a public authority since it was done for improper purposes or based on considerations that were not relevant. 
 Evidence consisting of “a number of affidavits and volumes of emails” reflected years of disagreement between Gatt and MCAST’s administration.
 In April 2020 Gatt had emailed the Education Minister stating that he had “no future or prospects at MCAST as a result of political discrimination instituted by a politically-minded and incompetent MCAST management that acts outside the parameters of the law.” 
 MCAST authorities interpreted that as an admission that the college was not allowing Gatt the space to exercise his profession. 
 In another email, Gatt complained that a particular study unit did “not make sense” to him and consequently, he could not lecture about something that did not make sense. 
 When all was considered the court said that Gatt was right in claiming that he had been punished twice. 
 The penalty handed down by the disciplinary board was a sufficient deterrent to ensure that Gatt would perform his duties as lecturer according to established procedures at the college and with respect towards its administration. 
 Gatt’s attitude towards the staff and administration at MCAST and his reluctance to abide by standard procedures should not have been addressed by revoking his detailing but through disciplinary action. 
 And that action was effectively taken.
 The college’s request to transfer Gatt was an abuse of power because it was based on irrelevant considerations.
 The letter issued by the education authorities on June 17, 2021, was null and void and Gatt was to be reinstated in the scale he occupied before the decision to revoke his detailing was taken.

 Hasan Hasan, from Marsaskala was arraigned in court by Police Inspectors Christian Cauchi and Colin Sheldon, who told magistrate Anne Marie Thake how the man had repeatedly attempted to contact the woman, with whom he has a teenage daughter, on WhatsApp and had also tailed her in his car in Zejtun and Zabbar. On one occasion the man had followed his ex to a hairdresser’s appointment and waited for her outside, only leaving after she called the police.
 Hasan, who had already been issued two restraining orders this year, pleaded not guilty to related charges, in addition to harassment and recidivism.

How long-term cannabis use is driving people to hospital,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/how-longterm-cannabis-use-driving-people-hospital.1095637,28-07-2024,007063.png,"A new trend in admissions of patients with persistent severe vomiting due to long-term use of cannabis is being witnessed at the hospital’s emergency department, clinical toxicologists have noted.
 These patients would have been smoking multiple joints a day for at least a few months.
 The flood of vomiting cases has been observed by toxicologists as cannabis admissions to Mater Dei’s emergency department have risen since the drug was liberalised, with Malta ranking the highest in Europe for the number of presentations for synthetic cannabinoids emergencies.
 The specialists from the newly set-up Malta National Poisons Centre, who also advise doctors in drug and overdose cases, said the increase was to be expected, as was the case in other countries that liberalised cannabis.
 Symptoms of cannabis admissions included psychosis, loss of consciousness, seizures, and vomiting.
 The ‘new’ condition has had a name for years – Cannabis-induced hyperemesis syndrome.
 “But the severe and persistent vomiting is very new to us,” said Dr Jeffrey Bonnici.
 Bonnici and Dr Robert Chircop – two emergency consultants at Mater Dei – are also clinical toxicologists with the poisons centre.
 “We have only seen this trend over the past year and even doctors may not be aware of it,” Bonnici said about his first-hand experience with the heightened condition.
 Drawing on his global experience as president-elect of the European Association of Poison Centres and Clinical Toxicologists (EAPCCT), Mark Lawrence Zammit said Malta was only now experiencing the increase in emergency admissions due to the sustained use of both natural and synthetic cannabis.
 “Nothing else explains the severe and persistent vomiting,” the toxicologists said, adding that patients often did not make the association with cannabis use.
 But when asked, they admitted they had been taking the drug consistently over sustained periods.
 
 This did not, however, necessarily happen to all long-term users, they said.
 “Sometimes, hot showers can alleviate the symptoms of nausea, but the only treatment is to stop the cannabis and/or synthetic cannabis use. Otherwise, the vomiting continues,” the toxicologists said.
 These patients ended up at the emergency department because the usual medication for nausea and vomiting did not help them.
 They said countries where cannabis was liberalised also showed an increase in emergency attendance due to cannabis-induced vomiting.
 “It may not have been diagnosed in the past. But today, with more information, it is easier to make the association, especially when no other diagnosis is suspected,” Bonnici said.
 The National Poisons Centre at the Malta Life Sciences Building, which deals with exposure to toxins, also offers advice on recreational drugs, and is facing major challenges with the spate of new synthetic substances on the market, and a lack of enforcement.
 “The amount of novel psychoactive substances and recreational drugs in Malta and worldwide is proving very challenging,” Zammit said, explaining that these were constantly changing.
 “We need to know what is on the market, their ingredients and how to counteract this with enforcement.”
 Referring to ‘MDMA gummies’ recently in circulation, and subsequently recalled, he said it was already “embarrassing” that  3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine – another name for ecstasy, which is illegal – was listed on the packet.
 “And then you check the product and find a new unlabelled synthetic hallucinogenic as well.”
  The ‘sweets’ would still have been illegal with MDMA on the packaging, but they were being sold as though “a piece of cake”, Zammit reiterated.
 While acknowledging that the situation with novel synthetic drugs was mostly “reactive”, Zammit said “new and positive tools”, such as the Poisons Centre, showed that “at least we know there is a major issue here and that we are doing something about it"".
 The challenges are worldwide, he continued, referring to fentanyl and other new and potent substances like nitazenes in the US.
 While there have not been cases of these drugs in Malta, “we have to be careful about these trends entering Europe”, he warned.
 Zammit said that while heroin was on the decline in Malta, cocaine was “king”, and the novel cannabinoids were now socially acceptable.
 “We are no longer dealing with the image of the homeless heroin junky; cocaine is taken by high-functioning people at the top of society.”
 Zammit called for enforcement, stressing its importance and categorically stating there was not enough of it.
 
 He also highlighted the need for education, encouraging people to call the new 1774 helpline, and tell doctors what they have taken and their symptoms.
 Zammit, who was instrumental in setting up the long-overdue Poisons Centre and who designed guidelines on this for the World Health Organisation, said it was ultimately the police’s job to actively follow the developing market of synthetic drugs.
 “If illegal substances are available on the market, they need to be stopped. If the cannabis law states that you cannot smoke in public, you cannot smoke in public. It may be difficult to enforce, but it needs to be done.”
 Still in its infancy, more awareness about the 1774 helpline is required and the outreach needs to be stepped up, Zammit said.
 The input of Mater Dei’s two emergency consultants, who are also clinical toxicologists with the Poisons Centre, allow for 24/7 coverage of the call service to healthcare professionals. It is otherwise available to the public from 8am to 8pm.
 “But we want a comprehensive 24-hour coverage,” Zammit said, adding that, so far, the service receives regular calls from emergency, but not many from the public.
 The Poisons Centre is seeing the trends, admissions, calls and what is prevalent to be able to intervene accordingly, he said, noting that, as yet, most referrals come from Emergency, and mainly involve inadvertent paediatric poisonings due to exposure to household chemicals.
 “We know for sure that there is lots of exposure to various toxins, including medicines and chemicals, both intentional and unintentional,” Zammit said.
 When cleaning the home, few people know that if they mix bleach with acid, they get pure chlorine gas, which is toxic, dangerous and can damage the lungs if inhaled, he pointed out.
 “Things happen to people and they just keep on going, without seeking medical advice,” he said, insisting household products should be stored correctly.
 “While we do not want to scaremonger, we live in a chemical world and are surrounded by this.
 “The truth is everything is a poison; it depends on the dose,” Zammit continued, quoting Paracelsus, the father of toxicology.
 “Something that can save your life, can harm someone else. Everything has to be taken in moderation.”

St Julian's beach stabbing victim recalls 'terrifying' look on accused's face,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/stabbing-victim-recalls-terrifying-look-accused-face-court-testimony.1096953,20-08-2024,007072.png,"A woman who was stabbed by a stranger on a St Julian’s beach earlier this month, recalled the “terrifying look” on her aggressor’s face as she testified about the incident in court on Tuesday. 
 “I was very scared when I saw the look on his face,” said the woman, as she testified about the violent incident which took place at sunrise on August 7 when an early-morning dip in the sea turned into a nightmare.
 The alleged victim recounted the ordeal when testifying against Fabian Medina Paira, a 21-year-old fellow Colombian national, who is pleading not guilty to attempted murder, grievous bodily harm, breaching the public peace and leading an idle and vagrant life.
 That morning she had gone to the beach with three other friends. Two of them left before the incident but she and a male friend decided to swim.
 “It was sunrise,” the woman said, assisted in court by an interpreter.
 She and her friend had spotted the accused earlier on. “He was talking to himself. We ignored him thinking that he was some lone soul, going about the place.”
 But when she and her friend got into the water, they noticed the stranger approaching her bag, which contained two mobile phones, a camera and her personal belongings.
 The man sat down some two metres away from the momentarily unattended bag.
 Paira then got up and as he approached the bag, grabbed a glass bottle and flung it. The glass shattered on the rocks.
 “He’s going to steal our belongings,” the witness recalled telling her friend.
 Sensing trouble, she left the water, went up some steps and approached the stranger.
 “When I came face to face with him, his look was terrifying. I was very scared when I saw the look on his face,” said the woman.
 Instinctively, she picked up another bottle and addressed the stranger, “What happened bro?”
 After that, she did not recall much.
 She vaguely recollected lying on the ground, her aggressor on top of her as she fended off the attack, said the witness, placing her hands, palms outwards, in front of her face as she acted out her actions during the attack.
 Then she recalled her friend’s voice, pleading with her, “Don’t sleep. Please don’t sleep,” as he shouted for help.
 The wailing of the ambulance and police sirens drifted into her memory, as she tried to resist the overwhelming drowsiness.
 “I felt physically very weak. An image of my baby son flashed before my eyes. I kept awake for him.”
 During the ride to the hospital, she heard doctors’ voices then she was wheeled into a ward where there were “many doctors.”
 X-rays confirmed that she had suffered great blood loss and needed surgery because there was blood in her lungs.
 Under cross-examination by defence lawyer Mark Busuttil, the witness explained that she had picked up a glass bottle because she was scared by the look on the stranger’s face.
 She drifted in and out of consciousness during the attack and could not explain how she ended up on the ground, under the aggressor whom she identified in court.
 When asked by paramedics in the ambulance how she had been wounded, she replied, “A bottle.”
 However, doctors confirmed that the injuries on the left side of her abdomen were not compatible with a broken bottle but some other weapon.
 Presiding magistrate Donatella Frendo Dimech intervened occasionally to block or moderate questions by the defence, pointing out that the court would not tolerate secondary victimization of the victim.
 The attack was over “in a matter of seconds,” said the victim, lifting her top to allow a glimpse of her injuries.
 The court observed that a brownish mark on the witness’s left side of the chest, below the clavicle, was visible “at a distance of some three metres.”
 As the testimony came to an end, the court declared that there was sufficient prima facie evidence for the accused to stand trial on indictment.
 The case continues.
 AG lawyer Kaylie Bonett and Inspector Shawn Pawney prosecuted.
 Lawyer Mark Busuttil was legal aid counsel.

Former police inspector did not feel 'comfortable' prosecuting Pilatus Bank officials,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/132715/former_police_inspector_did_not_feel_comfortable_prosecuting_pilatus_bank_officials_,10-12-2024,007114.png,"A former police inspector on Tuesday testified that he did not feel comfortable prosecuting Pilatus Bank officials as he was unconvinced a case against them existed.

 Proceedings initiated by Repubblika against the Attorney General’s decision not to institute proceedings against the defunct bank resumed on Tuesday morning before Madam Justice Doreen Clarke.

                     The only witness, Keith Vella, took to the stand and after listing his various academic achievements explained how he was involved within the FCID for four years as an inspector.

 He explained that in 2018, the police had received a confidential report regarding the bank.

 He further recalled that, after analysing the contents of the report alongside two other inspectors and under the direction of a superintendent, a request to the duty magistrate to initiate an inquiry was lodged. An inquiry was subsequently launched. 

 Two separate requests were mentioned. In 2020, the police made a request to issue rogatory letters since information from the US was required. The following year, the magistrate was requested to issue International Arrest Warrants and European Arrest Warrants (EAW) against Ali Sadr Hasheminejad, Luis Rivera, Mehmet Taşlı, and Hamidreza Ghambari. Vella noted that enough information had been gathered during the inquiry to request them.

 Vella also noted that on 3 April 2021, three warrants of search and arrest were executed against Claudeanne Sant Fournier, Antoniella Gauci and Brenda Calleja Smith. Whilst Calleja Smith was mentioned in the inquiry, no order was made to take action against her. With Gauci and Sant Fournier’s bail being extended, the police continued investigations into the case.

 Vella noted that he was ultimately not convinced that they should be arraigned, and recalled that the Office of the Attorney General had explained to police that the only way in which they would not be arraigned was through the preparation of a report which would be agreed to by the AG.

 Although Vella acknowledged that the inquiring magistrate ordered action against the owner of the bank Ali Sadr Hasheminejad; its director, Hamidreza Ghanbari; CEO Mehmet Taşlı, Chief Information Officer Luis Felipe Riviera, MLRO Claude-Anne Sant Fournier, as well as accounting officer, acting MLRO and risk manager Antoniella Gauci, he noted that he did not feel comfortable doing so. He noted, under cross-examination, that he would rather face proceedings challenging the decision of the police, than being part of charges issued against a person which would put them through difficulties.

 Proceedings are to resume on 23 January 2025, at 12:45pm.

Ex-Love Islanders threaten to pull out of ‘Fight Island’ match in legal row,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/exlove-islanders-threaten-pull-fight-island-match-legal-row.1101698,28-11-2024,007115.png,"Two former Love Islanders, all set to face off on a boxing ring, have threatened to pull out of the fight  unless organisers “honour” their original commitment rather than impose “unilateral” changes to the deal.
 Hours before weigh-in for Thursday's Fight Island event, Dale Mallia Tanti and Kyonne Gravina have sought legal assistance after the umpteenth change to match conditions by the organizers, Bulletproof Culture. 
 After each of the former Love Islanders signed an agreement to engage in a match, the pair said organisers failed to put their own signatures to the terms, and also introduced various changes “unilaterally.” 
 Those agreements were signed on October 10, 2024. 
 Since then, repeated calls by Mallia Tanti and Gravina for the organisers to sign the documents which they had drafted, proved futile. 
 To date, the organisers’ signature is missing.
 Moreover, they substantially reduced commissions payable to the contestants, introduced fresh conditions and even cancelled an event. 
 But the straw that appears to have broken the camel’s back was organisers’ insistence on introducing a last minute surprise wager, imposing a “demeaning and humiliating” public ‘penalty’ in the event of loss. 
 Both Islanders have now sought legal assistance, issuing a legal letter to the directors of Bulletproof Culture to counter such “preposterous” proposition which they would never accept.
 Such humiliating public ‘penalty’ “certainly does not reflect the sportive spirit of fair play and respect” which both contestants “firmly believe in,” said their lawyer, Stefano Filletti. 
 In light of such circumstances, they called upon the organisers “for the last time” to honour the original commitment they undertook and sign the agreements as presented to them in October. 
 In case of default, those agreements would be deemed non-existent and, consequently, also tomorrow’s event. 
 If that were to happen, the two contestants would hold the organisers responsible in damages. 
 While preparing for the event, they invested heavily in training and equipment, cancelled travel arrangements and dedicated long hours preparing for Saturday’s event, they said. 
 All this came at their own personal expense for they received no compensation. They also called upon the organisers to refund all tickets to those who had intended to follow the match between the two Love Islanders. 
 The organisers had already generated substantial revenue through adverts in the run-up to the event, they claimed.
 The letter was signed by lawyer Stefano Filletti on behalf of Mallia Tanti and Gravina.

Proposed reforms of the Family Court aim to speed up decision-making,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/government-proposes-major-reforms-family-court.1098798,30-09-2024,007122.png,"The government has launched a public consultation on a nine-point plan to reform the Family Court in order to reduce the heavy caseload and expedite proceedings.  
 One of the central proposals is the setting up of Family Boards to streamline cases and reduce unnecessary litigation. The boards will assist in mediation and provide the courts with comprehensive reports to help expedite case resolution.
 The reports, compiled by professionals from various fields, will focus on key issues such as custody, maintenance, and financial responsibilities and give the court a clear overview of the case, helping judges make better-informed decisions and saving time.
 The government hopes that this streamlined approach will reduce the burden on the courts and ensure faster resolutions for families. 
 “Family disputes can be emotionally intense, often resulting in decisions that need careful handling to ensure that the best interests of all parties, especially children, are prioritised,” Justice Minister Jonathan Attard said, adding that  these were the first major reforms of the Family Court in 22 years.
 A government working group began research ahead of making proposals in January 2023.
 The key proposals are:  
 With regard to maintenance the government is proposing that once a decision is taken, the maintenance amount will be automatically deducted from one party's salary, pension or other income and transferred to the other party. The process to date was not automatic, resulting in disputes.
 The minister said wide-ranging consultations had been held and calls had also been made for greater recognition of the role of grandparents and the need for them too to be heard during separation proceedings.  
 Social Welfare and Family Minister Michael Falzon underlined the importance of the reforms.
 “The reforms are needed. They have been a long time coming. They cannot  cover all the circumstances of every possible case. Ultimately, no matter what we do, family dynamics cannot be codified.”
 The consultation document in full can be seen by clicking the pdf link below.
 Submissions on the proposed reforms can be submitted until November 11 by email at consultation.justice@gov.mt or through the online platform publicconsultation.gov.mt. Public meetings will also be held to encourage discussion and gather feedback.

Watch: What Edward Johnston's YouTube videos tell us about the alleged murderer,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/who-edward-johnston-nicolette-ghirxi-suspected-killer.1096703,14-08-2024,"007124.png,007125.png,007126.png,007127.png","Little is known of Edward Johnston, the man who allegedly stabbed his ex-partner, Nicolette Ghirxi to death in the early hours of  Monday morning but videos posted on his social media profiles give a glimpse into his life and thoughts in the weeks leading up to the tragic events.
 Videos posted to Johnston’s YouTube channel portray him as an enigmatic figure, leading a spartan life in a modest two-bedroom St Julian’s apartment (“a luxury apartment in a prime location,” he says), while boasting about buying a Jaguar, a Rolex watch and a yacht.
 Several day-in-the-life videos posted by Johnston – who adopted the name Edwardo Sambora for his online persona – show him waking up to cook himself a breakfast of fried eggs, before settling down for a day’s work in his “office”, a bare desk and plastic picnic chair in his apartment’s second bedroom.
  This is from where he would run the Sambora Trading Academy, an online academy for prospective traders. Students would reportedly pay hundreds of euros to learn Johnston’s trading tricks and hear him “deliver analysis on futures and stock trading on the London and New York stock exchanges”.
 Johnston claimed to have as many as 600 students in his academy but its online presence is as inscrutable as Johnston himself.
 The academy’s website is no longer online and there is no sign of it ever having any formal recognition of any sort. Prospective students were directed to write to Johnston’s Yahoo e-mail address to sign up for the course.
 In any case, not all of his students were satisfied.
 One anonymous former student, who claims to have paid €300 to take Johnston’s course, set up an entire YouTube channel last year, posting several videos calling him a fraud and conman.
 “Edward Sambora is a fraud, don’t fall into his honey pot as you’ll get stung,” the former student warns in one video.
  Johnston didn’t take kindly to suggestions that retail trading is a scam. In one video he describes people who say this as “quitters or losers, the same people who diet for the first two weeks of January and then give up”.
 These people live in “losersville”, he says in one video, seated at the kitchen table where he shot most of his videos throughout his time in Malta.
 The videos show Johnston to be a man consumed by the twin idea of success and failure. He frequently described himself as a “winner”, able to emancipate himself from the drudgery of employment.
 He said that discovering financial trading in 2019 helped him “escape the slavery of the day job” and turn his life around.
 He said he quit his day job in logistics and distribution after almost two decades (although other reports suggest that he fell victim to COVID-19 redundancies), telling his 4,500 YouTube subscribers that he could “retire at 48” thanks to his new-found riches earned through trading stocks.
 But Johnston said he maintained a strict routine, rising at 6am, working for “maybe two hours” throughout the day and running or practising combat sports in his free time.
 “It’s all about discipline, having a routine and taking control,” he told his followers.
 But Johnston was no stranger to bombast.
 One YouTube video, titled ‘I Am Buying A Yacht’, shows Johnston standing at the Portomaso yacht marina discussing swing trading as several yachts behind him are rocked gently by the tide. Johnston doesn’t mention the yacht at all in the video.
 Other videos adopt the hyperbolic tone typical of many suspect financial traders (‘How to make 1.4k in 3 seconds’, one title proclaims) while, in one TikTok clip, he pulls a large wad of cash out of his jacket pocket and proudly displays it to the camera.
  He frequently tagged his videos with the hashtag #billionarelifestyle, attempting to portray a life of luxury.
 Other videos are more instructional.
 In one video posted last year, he walks people through the process of opening a company in a South American or Caribbean tax haven (“there’s nothing dodgy about it, it’s not illegal, in fact it’s very, very clever,” he says), adding that he registered his company – Sambora Trading Limited – in the UK “purely to funnel revenue that I make from my trading community”.
 Meanwhile, earlier videos shot in Scotland show Johnston together with his teenage son, who appears to have happily followed his father’s footsteps in the world of financial trading.
 Johnston’s own travels are well documented in his YouTube channel, from short trips to Naples and the Amalfi coast, to longer sojourns in Mallorca, where he lived for several months in late 2021, just before he moved to Malta.
 Johnston uploaded footage of himself landing in Malta for the first time in January 2022, initially moving into an apartment in an unnamed “small town” before eventually relocating to St Julian’s.
 It is likely that he and Ghirxi began a relationship, which the police say lasted for almost two years, shortly after his move to Malta.
 Early last April, Johnston abruptly posted a video titled ‘I Am Moving to Palermo Sicily’. He didn’t explain to his followers why he was leaving Malta, and Ghirxi is believed to have been just as taken aback to find that he suddenly left the island without any notice.
 Later videos suggest that his Sicilian sojourn was short-lived. A video posted in late June shows him in Glasgow “to start a new journey”.
 A fortnight later he was back to preaching discipline and rigour in a video titled ‘This is Why You Are A F****** Loser’.
 His very last video, uploaded on July 20, takes a darker turn.
 Shot in a stylised monochrome, Johnston warned viewers that things had become “real, real serious” with global elites working to oppress “the common man” and saying that the few public figures “who are trying to be honest with the world and telling the people how this world is run”, including Andrew Tate, Russell Brand and Donald Trump, are being “taken out” by false allegations.
 “Don’t you find it funny that the most heinous of allegations is any kind of sexual allegation,” Johnston, who reportedly created fake social media accounts to make accusations about Ghirxi’s sex life, asked.

"Woman, 75, handed suspended sentence for negligence that led to death of housemate",maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/130426/woman_75_handed_suspended_sentence_for_negligence_that_led_to_death_of_housemate,26-07-2024,007148.png,"A court has sentenced a 75-year-old British woman to imprisonment for two years, suspended for four, for allowing a 90-year-old man whom she had acted as a live-in carer for to die of untreated pneumonia.
 Penelope Davies of St. Paul’s Bay had permitted the health of Ernest Frederick Thompson, a 90-year-old man who lived with and was dependent on her, to deteriorate to a shocking degree as a result of negligence.
 The problems were flagged in 2020, by a doctor from the Mosta Health Centre, who was dispatched to a residence in St. Paul’s Bay to certify Thompson as deceased. Although there were no traces of a crime, the doctor had been unable to establish the cause of death and so a magisterial inquiry was appointed.
 Davies told Magistrate Nadine Sant Lia that she met Thompson in the UK in 2007. They met in a church, after she had been told of an elderly man wandering the streets after his daughter kicked him out of her house. Davies had taken him in and when she decided to return to Malta, Thompson asked to join her.
 The defendant denied being negligent, telling the court that she had done everything she could to help him, washing, dressing, feeding and changing his nappies and his catheter.  She told the court that their relationship was a platonic one and they lived together in a house at St Paul’s Bay which they had bought together.
 Davies recalled how she had called an ambulance after finding her housemate dead one morning, when she had gone to his room to check his nappy and catheter. The defendant explained that she had placed Thompson’s mattress directly on the floor because she was afraid that he would roll off the bed.
 A forensic specialist appointed by the court, Dr. Mario Scerri, noted that Thompson had suffered gross neglect before he died. “From a simple visual examination of the photos in this report and in that of the Malta Police Forensics one can see open wounds, sores and ulcers which must have been considerably painful and uncomfortable. These wounds are all over the deceased’s body and in the photos it is also possible to see how frail and weak the body was at the time of death. It is also clear to see that the wounds were left untreated and open giving rise to infection and an inability to heal,” noted the court.
 The expert said that the wounds he had noted on the body made it one of the worst cases of neglect that he had seen in his 35-year career.
 Lacerations indicated that the elderly man, who had suffered from dementia and other chronic health problems, had been left in the same position for a very long time. The cause of death was established as untreated pneumonia.
 The victim’s medical file showed that he had a long history of illness and had been showing signs of dementia since 2019, meaning that he was not in a position to care for himself. He had been hospitalised on several occasions and used to attend appointments at the Mosta Health Centre on a regular basis from 2015 until February 2020. After that date there was no record of any visits or examinations by a doctor or nurse, something which Davies herself had also told him at the scene.
 An examination of Thompson’s remains, which Scerri had carried out on June 24 2020, revealed “evidence of gross neglect, bed sores and a bad state of hygiene”, he said.
 In her judgement, sentencing the woman to imprisonment for two years, suspended for four, the magistrate noted that the inquiry had also established that before his death, Thompson made a will naming Davies as his universal heir.
 The court ruled that the evidence showed that there had been some level of care on the part of the defendant as she would regularly take Thompson for appointments at the Mosta Health Centre where a phlebotomist had taken a sample of his blood just a few days before his death.
 The magistrate was strident in her criticism of the failure by medical professionals who had seen the man, just days before he died, to intervene in the interests of their patient.
 “The court is somewhat perplexed how Thompson’s bad state was not brought to the attention of the medical professionals and equally how these professionals themselves did not observe and treat his wounds and lacerations which are large and evident.” Had the medical professionals treated the man’s wounds his poor health would have been immediately apparent, she said.
 In a judgement that was delivered in English, the court said that when a person takes on the role of sole carer, however commendable that decision may be, it also meant that the person was assuming responsibility for the patient’s welfare.
 “Whilst one can appreciate that it was hard and complex for the defendant to take care of the defendant alone, this was also her singular choice since she chose to leave his care only to her and not get more hands-on help…The court considers that the defendant was the carer of Thompson and the fact that she was not formally remunerated or employed is not a valid argument.”
 Davies was also ordered to pay the sum of €2,102.98 in costs.  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police
Former EU minister’s €20 million transactions scrutinised by the FIAU,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/former-eu-minister-20-million-transactions-scrutinised-fiau.1101169,18-11-2024,007161.png,"Almost €20 million in transactions by a former minister “in an EU jurisdiction” raised red flags during checks by the FIAU at a local corporate service provider.
 Integritas Consulting was fined €66,000 by the regulator for its “reckless disregard” of the numerous red flags present in certain business relationships.
 Its inadequate transaction monitoring could have led to the “unintentional facilitation” of money-laundering, the Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit said.
 In a public report, the FIAU zoomed in on the company’s relationship with the unnamed minister, who was facing “serious allegations” in the media of corruption, bribery and misappropriation of funds.
 The FIAU found the minister was linked to a “complex” web of loan agreements totalling almost €20 million. It said Integritas should have done more to understand the purpose of these loans to ensure their legitimacy.
 The loans should have been scrutinised both when the client was onboarded and throughout the business relationship.
 In another example highlighted in the report, a company linked to a prospective €200 million deal had failed to submit audited accounts since 2016 as a result of “accounting discrepancies” over dividend payments.
 To date, these critical documents had remained unsubmitted for the past eight years, the FIAU said, although efforts were underway to remedy the issue.
 Integritas Consulting surrendered its license to the Malta Financial Services Authority as a corporate service provider in August.
 The FIAU said this helped alleviate concerns about the future risk exposures for the company, which is in the process of being dissolved.
 Integritas Consulting is owned by Frederic Villa, a Swiss national who resides in Malta. 
 In February 2023, Villa was among dozens of individuals and companies sanctioned by the United States as part of an effort to target companies and people providing “material support” to Russia’s war efforts in Ukraine.
 He was placed on the sanctions list over his role as a director of a Maltese company called Stratton Investment Group.
 Villa was also involved in setting up Papaya, a Gżira payment firm that was a focal point in an international investigation into an alleged “Russian-Eurasian criminal network”.
 He sold his shares in Papaya in 2016 but stayed on as CEO until February 2023.

 The police conducted the operation after observing the premises, which was believed to be a hub for drug distribution.
 The residence, which had been under surveillance, was found to have reinforced iron structures blocking the entrance from the inside. However, law enforcement officers managed to breach the barrier and gain entry to the apartment. Inside, they discovered two men along with three women.
 During a thorough search of the premises, police uncovered several packets containing substances suspected to be cocaine and heroin, which were ready for sale. Additional items related to drug trafficking were also seized.
 Further searches in the residence led to the discovery of a bag containing approximately 50 grams of what is believed to be cocaine, along with a significant amount of cash.
 The suspects are currently being held at the police lock-up in Floriana. The two men are expected to be arraigned in court today before Magistrate Giannella Camilleri Busuttil.  ",Nicole Meilak ,court_and_police
Driver cleared of crash with police vehicle over 'serious conflict of evidence',timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/driver-cleared-crash-police-vehicle-serious-conflict-evidence.1101669,28-11-2024,007172.png,"A young driver charged with causing a collision with a police vehicle was cleared of all criminal wrongdoing because of a “serious conflict of evidence” as to the dynamics of the crash. 
 The incident occurred late on March 1, 2022, when Michela Vassallo had dropped off her friend at her Żabbar residence after university classes and was on the way home.
 She was driving down a side road onto Triq Wied il-Għajn when she sensed a flashing light approaching on the right. 
 That light was the cruise light of a police vehicle. 
 A female officer seated in the front passenger seat later recalled how that evening, while on night watch at Żabbar police station, they received a call about a suspected break-in at Wied il-Għajn. 
 Together with three colleagues - two male and a female constable - headed out in a service car, a 2019 Peugeot model.
 One of the male officers took the wheel, the other two sat at the back and the fourth officer sat next to the driver. 
 As they cruised down Triq Wied il-Għajn, they spotted a white car exiting a side street past a stop sign.
 All four officers testified in court when Vassallo was charged with causing the incident in which the police driver suffered a fractured wrist. 
 She was also charged with ignoring the stop sign. The prosecution requested the court to ban the defendant’s driving licence. 
 The defendant pleaded not guilty. 
 The constable who was driving the service car testified that he had spotted a car exiting the side street on the left, turning in their direction. 
 He claimed that he saw the driver looking the other way. 
 “I tried to avoid her but she blocked my path… I tried to avoid her but I couldn’t,” he explained. 
 The impact occurred as the defendant was manoeuvring her car onto the main road, claimed the witness. 
 “So how come the damages are on the vehicle’s side rather than the front?” asked defence lawyer Mario Buttigieg. 
 Upon impact, her car turned because the road surface was wet, the police driver explained.
 The policewoman seated beside the driver said that her colleague swerved to the left to avoid impact to no avail. 
 Following the crash, she approached the female driver to check on her condition. 
 “She [the defendant] said: ‘Sorry, sorry. I don’t know what happened,’” the policewoman recalled. 
 Vassallo was in a state of shock. She was taken to Mater Dei Hospital by ambulance. The officers in the police car were also given medical attention. 
 A surveyor tasked by an insurance company, reported in court that damages to the police car amounted to just over €8,000. 
 Asked by the defence, he confirmed that the car must have been going at speed since the airbags were inflated and that happened when there was rapid deceleration. 
 Vassallo also testified in the proceedings, giving a different version as to how the collision took place.
 She recalled driving over a speed bump located a few metres away from the stop sign. 
 She then drove towards the stop sign and sensed a light flashing on the right. 
 Then suddenly, moments after stopping at that sign, a car ploughed at speed into her car.
 “I ended up in the left lane in Triq Wied il-Għajn,” she explained. 
 Following the crash, she was in a state of “great shock”.
 She spent the night in the hospital because she was complaining of palpitations, pain in her side and a terrible shock. 
 Her car was beyond repair. All airbags were inflated upon impact.
 Vassallo also told the court about a brief conversation that had taken place in hospital that night. 
 While in the waiting area at Mater Dei’s emergency department, she spoke to one of the female officers involved in the crash, asking, “Where was I when the collision took place?”
 “I saw you stationary at the stop sign and told him [the police driver] ‘watch out’, and then we crashed,” the policewoman allegedly replied. 
 That conversation was witnessed by the defendant’s father who had rushed to his daughter’s side and who subsequently confirmed it in court. 
 When delivering judgment, Magistrate Yana Micallef Stafrace observed that there was “a serious conflict of evidence regarding how the incident occurred”.
 On the one hand, the defendant claimed she was stationary at the stop sign when the police car crashed into her vehicle.
 On the other hand, the police witnesses were saying that the defendant had gone past the stop sign straight into the path. 
 That conflict meant that the court lacked certainty beyond a reasonable doubt to conclude that Vassallo was responsible for the incident, concluded the court, thus pronouncing an acquittal. 
 Lawyer Mario Buttigieg was the defence counsel.

Bouncer cleared of causing injury to club patrons in 2015 Paceville stampede,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/bouncer-cleared-causing-injury-club-patrons-2015-paceville-stampede.1096963,20-08-2024,"007173.png,007174.png,007175.png","An unlicensed bouncer who was trying to shift patrons out of a Paceville club during a stampede was cleared of causing them injury on Tuesday. 
 The incident dates back to 2015 when the use of pepper spray inside the tightly packed Plus One club sent the crowd into a frenzied rush to exit the building. 
 In the chaos, the glass bannister of the staircase leading up to the club's front entrance shattered under pressure, causing some people to fall the height of over a storey down the rest of the stairs. A total of 74 people were injured in the incident. 
  Bojan Spasic, one of the 23 arraigned over the incident, was charged with causing the club's patrons grievous bodily harm, working as a private guard without a licence and smoking indoors. 
 In her judgment on Tuesday, Magistrate Donatella Frendo Dimech acquitted Spasic of the bodily harm charge and concluded there were a number of factors surrounding the incident that no reasonable person could have foreseen. 
 The court found there were shortcomings on the side of the club, including that the door of the main entrance was wider than it was supposed to be, enticing patrons to head towards it. 
 While Spasic initially led people towards the main exit, he later started to lead people towards an emergency exit that led to another nightclub. 
 Although he had never received training in evacuation procedures, Spasic remained the ""last man standing"" and ensured that no one was left inside the club, the court said. 
 The Serbian national, who was 22 at the time of the incident, stuck around to make sure no one remained inside, even checking bathrooms to ensure all had been evacuated. 
 The number of patrons that had been allowed into the establishment far exceeded the club's capacity, with about 450 people, or roughly four to five people for every square metre, packed inside. 
  ""Spasic, the only security to be inside the club and witness firsthand the chaos and mayhem which ensued, was put on the spot and instantaneously placed in the unenviable position of having to deal with the evacuation of a crowd alone, which crowd in the first place should have never been allowed to reach such numbers,"" the magistrate said. 
 ""In truth, the court deems that his actions, in those circumstances, with all the failings to which reference has been made above, demand commendation not censure.""
 The court concluded that the odds were stacked against Spasic who, despite these challenges, did his best to escort people to safety without thinking of his own wellbeing in the process. 
 Spasic was found guilty of acting as a security guard without a licence on his own admission and security footage showed plainly that he was smoking inside the club. 
 For these offences, he was fined €1,200 to be paid in instalments over the next 12 months.
 Spasic was represented in court by lawyers Franco Debono, Marion Camilleri and Adreana Zammit.

Repubblika files notice of crime after kickback allegations against Clayton Bartolo’s wife,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/132472/repubblika_files_notice_of_crime_after_kickback_allegations_against_clayton_bartolos_wife,26-11-2024,007183.png,"Rule of law NGO Repubblika has filed a notice informing the police that a crime has occurred following allegations that Clayton Bartolo’s wife received tens of thousands of euros in a kickback.

 Repubblika filed a “notitia criminis” - a notice informing the police that a crime has occurred – with Police Commissioner Angelo Gafa against Clayton Bartolo, his wife Amanda Muscat, and Italian cyclist Valerio Agnoli.

                     The NGO said the three acted as accomplices and participated in a criminal association to commit bribery and corruption, trading in influence, and money laundering.

 “All these offenses are qualified as continuous offenses since the various acts committed by the accused, even if at different times, breach the same legal provisions and were carried out with a single resolution,” Repubblika’s lawyer Jason Azzopardi wrote in a letter to the commissioner.

 On Tuesday, the Times of Malta reported that Amanda Muscat received tens of thousands of euros from a private firm suspected to be a kickback related to a Malta Tourism Authority (MTA) contract.

 The Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit (FIAU), Malta's anti-money laundering agency, flagged the transactions to the police. The payments, estimated at around €50,000, were reportedly made over six months by a company linked to an MTA contractor. 

  The FIAU investigation focused on Muscat’s work for a company associated with Italian cyclist Valerio Agnoli in 2023. In 2021, Agnoli was hired by the MTA to promote cycling tourism and formalised a €20,000 annual agreement in 2023. 

 Amanda Muscat began working for an Agnoli-linked company in 2023, 18 months after leaving her unjustified ministry consultant role, and ended the assignment in December.

 Investigators believe Muscat’s payments might be tied to an MTA-related kickback.      ",Nicole Meilak ,court_and_police

 Among those being arraigned is former Prime Minister Joseph Muscat, who will appear in court on Tuesday. His former chief of staff Keith Schembri and former health minister Konrad Mizzi will also appear in court the same day.
 Others including former Deputy Prime Minister Chris Fearne and Central Bank of Malta Governor Edward Scicluna will appear on Wednesday. 
 In addition to special arrangements being made inside the building, outside court will feature a cordoned-off area dedicated to the press.
 A considerable police presence is expected on both days, Times of Malta understands.
 The arraignments will be heard in Hall 22 - the largest courtroom - with the balcony normally available to the public instead reserved for the press and family members of the accused.
 The area downstairs will be reserved for defendants, prosecution, defence and court staff, with court proceedings being live-streamed to a separate courtroom serving as a public gallery.
 Muscat is among a group charged with major crimes including money laundering, corruption and bribery, while others, including Fearne, will face lesser charges of fraud and misappropriation. 
 Next week's arraignments mark a watershed moment in court action that has been ongoing for years - and has proven to be a charged political issue.
 The case has become a rallying cry for the Nationalists, thrusting former Opposition leader Adrian Delia into the spotlight alongside Bernard Grech and leading to large protests outside Parliament last week. 
 Meanwhile, the arraignment of their former leader has done little to dampen Labourite spirits, instead acting as a lightning rod to the party's grassroots and mobilising a charge of support for the leader who delivered landslide victories in 2013 and 2017.
 On Tuesday, close associates of Muscat called a 'solidarity meeting' outside the law courts when the former Prime Minister is arraigned next week.
 Announcing the show of support, broadcaster Emanuel Cuschieri called for those in attendance to act calmly and in a civilised manner.
 And while the Labour party has not yet declared its official position on the meeting, considering the strong reactions Muscat has provoked from his supporters in the past, attendance to the event could be high.
 This, along with the high-profile nature of the case and the numbers of accused and their families - in addition to members of the press and lawyers for both parties - suggests court will be a hub of activity next week.

 31-years-old Travis Xuereb from Sta Venera was arraigned under arrest before magistrate Yana Micallef Stafrace on Tuesday, accused of trafficking cannabis, aggravated possession of cannabis and trespassing on Dalli’s property.
  Xuereb was further accused of the online harassment of a third party between February 2023 to August 2024, misuse of electronic telecommunications equipment, breaching bail and recidivism.
 Police Inspector Stephen Gulia, prosecuting together with inspectors Keith Rizzo and Paul Camilleri, explained that Xuereb had been arrested at his home after police recognised him from security footage, as the person who dropped off the parcel, which was found to contain drugs, and a letter outside Dalli‘s home in Marsaskala on July 31.
 Inspector Gulia explained that it emerged during the investigation that Xuereb had been going through a mental health episode, for which he had been treated at MCH. Xuereb was readmitted after his arrest, before being released and re-arrested yesterday on the strength of another arrest warrant.
 Lawyer Roberto Spiteri, assisting Xuereb together with lawyer Michael Sciriha, asked the inspector to explain what Xuereb had told him about this incident.
 “On his part, the defendant thought that he had seen his idol, boxer Conor McGregor leaving the residence and had left the substances as a gift to McGregor. He had no intention of causing damage,” the inspector replied.
 The prosecution confirmed that it had been a simple coincidence that the residence belonged to Dalli’s, and that the issue had been caused by the defendant’s hallucinations.
 The defendant had also been harassing several other people, contacting them on Facebook and persisting when there was no reply.
 Xuereb had subsequently been released from Mount Carmel and certified as fit to stand trial.
 When asked by Spiteri as to whether Xuereb had also been under the delusion that popular radio show hosts JD and Martina had been talking about him on air, the inspector confirmed that this was true.
 In reply to a question from lawyer Franco Debono, assisting the Dalli family as parte civile, the inspector also confirmed that the family were worried that the items had been left on their doorstep with malign intent, but added that it had emerged from the investigation that the defendant had not even been aware that they lived there.
 Debono submitted that his clients had been “terrified” by the discovery and asked that a protection order be issued in favour of the Dalli family as well as the other victims.
 When asked what the defendant would be pleading, Spiteri told the court that his client would be pleading guilty and requested a pre-sentencing report.
 “We have an issue with Mount Carmel Hospital,” said the lawyer. “I cannot understand how a person like Xuereb is repeatedly being treated there for two or three weeks and then being discharged. We have a person here who needs stability and treatment,” he said.
 Spiteri explained that Xuereb had been diagnosed as schizophrenic and asked that the court order that the defendant be examined as part of the preparation of the pre-sentencing report.

 When asked what he wished to plead during his arraignment before Magistrate Victor Axiak, Mc Carthy replied guilty, also confirming to the court that he was aware of the implications of his plea.
 In view of his admission of guilt, the court condemned the man to the payment of a €1,000 fine, as punishment.

Muscat never questioned her Egrant work. Now he wants a court expert prosecuted,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/muscat-never-questioned-egrant-work-now-wants-court-expert-prosecuted.1101167,19-11-2024,"007211.png,007212.png,007213.png","Updated 12.20pm with Muscat right of reply
 A court-appointed expert that Joseph Muscat wants criminally investigated played a major role in the Egrant inquiry that Muscat often says vindicated him.
 Muscat says Miroslava Milenovic should face a raft of criminal charges because she was described as an “accountant” in the Vitals inquiry that has landed him in the dock, despite her not having an accountancy warrant.
 That raises questions about what Muscat, a former prime minister, makes of Milenovic’s work in a 2018 inquiry concerning his family and Panama company Egrant Inc. Muscat often cites that inquiry as proof that he was framed by his political enemies.
 Milenovic’s name is mentioned 99 times in the Egrant inquiry by Magistrate (now Judge) Aaron Bugeja into claims that Muscat’s wife, Michelle, was the ultimate beneficial owner of Egrant Inc., a Panama-based company opened by disbarred brokers Nexia BT.
 In that report, as in the Vitals one, the Serbian court expert is described as a “forensic accountant”.
 Milenovic’s conclusions in the Egrant probe were that there was “no evidence” that Egrant was owned by Michelle Muscat, Nexia BT’s Brian Tonna or anyone else, due to the suspected use of anonymous bearer shares.
 She also found no evidence that Muscat or any of his immediate family members held accounts at Pilatus Bank, and said there was not enough information to reach a conclusion about claims that a secret safe at the bank held information about Russian clients and Maltese Politically Exposed Persons, as well as the owner of Egrant Inc.
 The Egrant report’s conclusions were released in July 2018. Starting that same day, Muscat has described it as evidence that he and his family were victims of a political frame-up.
 Muscat has also described his prosecution in the Vitals case as “another Egrant”.
 Weeks before he was charged with corruption, bribery, money laundering and other crimes last May, the former prime minister said the Vitals inquiry was a political “vendetta”.
 “Ironically it happened exactly seven years after the Egrant issue, when they lied about me and my family,” the former prime minister said at the time. 
 The Vitals inquiry found signs that millions of euros had been siphoned out of the Muscat-era deal to privatise three state hospitals. Muscat was  hired as a consultant by people linked to that deal months after he resigned as prime minister. 
 Dozens of people, Muscat among them, have been charged with crimes. Muscat denies all charges and says the consultancy work was legit. 
 But while Muscat had no issue with Milenovic’s work on the Egrant probe, he now argues that she should be investigated by the police for describing herself as an “accountant” in the Vitals inquiry.
 While Milenovic’s name features 99 times in the Egrant report, there are only five mentions of her in the Vitals inquiry.
 However, Milenovic is the first court-appointed expert cited in the Vitals inquiry report and 100 pages of her work are included in the report, meaning her work on the probe carried considerable weight.
  She was also present when many of the witnesses were being questioned by the magistrate during the four-year-long probe.
 Lawyers representing Muscat and others this week filed a criminal complaint against Milenovic, asking police to investigate her for perjury, making use of false documents and obtaining money through false pretences, among other crimes.
 They argue that Milenovic misrepresented herself when describing herself as an “accountant”, as she does not have an accountancy warrant and had only sat for a diploma in the subject.
 Milenovic has countered by saying she has 20 years of experience working as an accountant for a Big Four firm.
 Although she has never held a warrant as an accountant in Malta, Milenovic has practised as a certified accountant abroad and signed off on numerous financial statements and tax reports.
 According to an online biography found on a Serbian anti-corruption council’s website, Milenovic is a certified fraud examiner in the US and has held various high-ranking government positions in Serbia.
 She became a member of the Serbian anti-corruption council in 2012, and in 2015, she was recognised by the OSCE as the “person of the year” for the fight against corruption and for media freedom.
 Milenovic has also trained staff at the MFSA and FIAU on combatting money-laundering.
 Whether or not Milenovic’s job title is acceptable under Maltese law will be for the court to determine. While the Accountancy Profession Act categorically states that only warrant holders may practice as accountants, the  Accountancy Profession Regulations list five specific tasks which only warrant holders may perform. Forensic accounting for criminal investigation purposes is not one of them.
  The criminal complaint filed this week suggests Muscat and other defendants in the Vitals case are preparing to challenge the admissibility of Milenovic’s work in the magisterial inquiry.
 Under Malta’s criminal law system, that can only happen at a later stage. The case is currently at the compilation stage, meaning the court’s role is to compile all evidence prosecutors have amassed. Defendants will be able to challenge the admissibility of specific pieces of evidence at the pre-trial stage.
 But Milenovic’s past work on the Egrant probe may present a challenge for Muscat and his lawyers: if the Serbian expert’s work on the Vitals probe is discredited, will that call into question her findings in the Egrant probe that he so often highlights as a vindication?
 It is the second time Milenovic’s credibility as a witness has been questioned by a defendant in Malta’s courts.
 In 2023, lawyers representing Keith Schembri argued that Milenovic’s work in an inquiry into his business dealings and suspected money laundering was discredited because she had formed part of an anti-corruption party in her native Serbia.
 Milenovic’s work with Serbia’s anti-corruption council led to her being assaulted outside her Belgrade apartment in 2015. She subsequently quit the council and helped found the “Enough is Enough” party. She quit that party in 2018.
 Schembri’s lawyers argued that Milenovic’s political views meant she could not impartially investigate him.
 Schembri, who served as Muscat’s chief of staff at the Office of the Prime Minister, is also facing charges of corruption and bribery in the Vitals case and he endorsed the criminal complaint filed against Milenovic this week.
 Lawyers representing various defendants in the Vitals case have also raised questions about another expert witness used in the magisterial probe.
 They say Sam Sittlington, an Irish financial crimes expert, tried to land a lucrative consultancy gig with the Malta Police during his time working on the Vitals investigation. That, they argue, mean he had a potential conflict on interest during the probe.
 In a right of reply sent through his lawyer Charlon Gouder, Muscat said he would relish the opportunity to revisit the Egrant inquiry. 
 Muscat's right of reply is reproduced in full below: 
 ""As you will surely know, there is a Court Order precluding me from commenting on the ongoing Vitals case where Ms Miroslava Milenovic, who was appointed by the Court as a Forensic Accountant, admitted she does not hold a degree in accounting and does not have a warrant to practice.
 ""I will limit myself to commenting on the Egrant case, where someone, to date unknown, faked signatures and a so called whistleblower claimed my wife owned a secret offshore company.  The claims were shown to be false and the latter has eloped Maltese justice.
 ""In the Egrant case, the then Magistrate took the expert reports as one of the inputs for his work.  He confronted versions, asked questions, made his own assessments and came up with his own report.
 ""Secondly, given that I was the victim in the Egrant frame up, I never had the opportunity to confront Ms Milenovic in court.
 ""There are those who might argue that now the Egrant case should be reopened.  As I said numerous times when such a possibility was floated, including by the said court experts who salivated at the idea of getting paid even more public funds: Make my day!
 ""I have nothing to hide and will only take further satisfaction in proving the conspiracy theorists wrong once again.""

From ‘inept’ finance records to warring owners: inside Em@ney,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/from-inept-finance-records-warring-owners-inside-emney.1099090,10-08-2024,007221.png,"Updated 2.30pm with former CEO's reply
 Accusations of “inept” financial record keeping, regulatory failures and client money being endangered have been playing out in the courts as part of a war between two owners of a payment services provider.
 Em@ney’s problems were thrust into the headlines in September after Times of Malta reported that clients of the Ta’ Xbiex firm were  unable to access their money for several days.
 Court testimony by one of the shareholders indicates Em@ney handles around “€60 million” in client funds.
 The issues faced by its clients appear to be the fallout from a year-long battle between Em@ney’s backseat majority shareholder Oriana Moltisanti and its ex-CEO and minority shareholder Germano Arnó.
 A slew of court cases filed by the warring owners has released confidential reports and letters by the FIAU, MFSA and the sanctions monitoring board into the public domain.
 The reports document Em@ney’s alleged failures in 2019 to abide by money-laundering prevention rules, as well as more recent failures in the company’s governance structures.
 While Moltisanti cites these reports as evidence of Arnó’s mismanagement, Em@ney had strongly contested the regulatory findings under his tenure.
 Arnó has in turn accused Moltisanti of endangering the company’s operations and client funds by initiating a boardroom coup last year which ultimately saw his removal as CEO in
 August and the appointment of a new board of directors.
 The former CEO did not respond to a request for comment.
 Em@ney was fined €360,000 by the FIAU, an anti-money laundering body, three years ago.
 A confidential report by the FIAU, filed as evidence in one of shareholder court cases, tells the back story to that fine.
 During an “unannounced” 2019 inspection, the FIAU found the company’s customer base included high-risk clients who were the subject of negative media reports and “were involved in financial crime”.
 One customer was found to have alleged links with the ‘Ndrangheta mafia, a powerful criminal organisation out of Calabria in Italy.
 Among several other problems flagged by the FIAU, Em@ney was accused of having failed to properly monitor risky transactions between certain clients, including two transactions totalling €3.2 million based on a “gentleman’s agreement”.
 As a result of the FIAU’s findings, Em@ney was also fined by the sanctions monitoring board for failing to adequately screen its customers for sanctions.
 At the time, Em@ney strongly rebutted the FIAU’s findings, arguing that the reports’  methodology and findings were procedurally flawed. It also appealed the €360,000 fine.
 A subsequent audit by the FIAU concluded last year that “tangible progress” was made to improve Em@ney compliance with anti-money laundering laws.
 The majority shareholder who recently ousted Em@ney’s management team, however, told Times of Malta that the FIAU findings in 2019 “were one of the key indicators that the previous directors and CEO were not properly managing Em@ney’s operations”.
 “Similarly, the fine issued by the sanctions monitoring board in 2020 was another red flag… These sanctions reinforced the growing realisation that immediate corrective action was necessary to safeguard the company’s future,” Rosario Fiorentino, a consultant to Moltisanti said. 
 The MFSA in September ordered Em@ney to stop taking on new clients until it ensures that the “proper governance and internal controls” are in place to operate its payment services licence in accordance with the law.
 Court documents show the financial regulator had long been raising concerns about the company’s operations.
 In a May 2021 letter, the regulator found “substantial shortcomings” at Em@ney.
 The regulator said Em@ney had been operating without an approved money-laundering reporting officer since November 2020, and had proposed unqualified staff for the two key roles of internal auditor and independent director.
 Arnó was found to wield significant power within Em@ney without the necessary checks and balances in place.
 Minutes kept by the Em@ney board were deemed to be “inadequate” by the MFSA. 
 Despite Em@ney pushing back at many of the MFSA’s findings, the regulator warned in a December 2022 letter that certain “persistent weaknesses” at the company had not been resolved.
 Fiorentino claims Em@ney’s majority shareholder was not made aware of the concerns raised by the MFSA in 2021.
 “The gravity of the situation only became evident when Em@ney’s directors disclosed the MFSA’s follow-up letter in December 2022,” Fiorentino said.
 Fiorentino said the December 2022 letter was only disclosed to the majority when Arnó’s team was seeking approval to nominate two new directors.
 “At this stage, despite the lack of detailed information, it became evident that the company’s governance was seriously flawed and lacking in both transparency and expertise,” Fiorentino said.
 In response, the majority shareholder attempted to clear out Em@ney’s entire board of directors, triggering an avalanche of legal claims and counterclaims by the two warring owners.
 Arnó and his management team were ousted in August 2024, however, the former CEO has claimed in court that the boardroom manoeuvres were carried out “illegally”.
 He has further alleged that these manoeuvres put the company, which administers some “€60 million” in client funds, at risk.
 Fiorentino disputes this. He says all legal decisions to date have contradicted Arnó’s claims that the majority shareholder’s action put client funds at risk.
 “Furthermore, the newly appointed directors, with MFSA approval, are working closely with local authorities to safeguard client interests.”
 Fiorentino said that during his two decades of experience in the sector, he has never encountered financial statements as lacking in detail and substance as those of Em@ney under the previous management.
 Fiorentino was nominated by Em@ney’s majority shareholder as one of the company’s new directors, as part of the boardroom coup.
 The nomination has yet to be approved by the MFSA, which vets nominations for key positions in licensed companies.
 Fiorentino has been named in Italian media reports as being under investigation in connection with a €1.7 billion hospital tender in Italy.
 He told Times of Malta the case related to a “tender dispute” in which he was involved professionally.
 “It has been reviewed by multiple courts, all of which have ruled that no crime or misconduct occurred on my part.
 “Unfortunately, the Italian legal system allows for investigations even after court decisions have been made.
 “We respect the process and remain confident that this matter will be resolved positively,” Fiorentino said.
 Fiorentino said that to his knowledge, the MFSA is still processing his nomination as a director.
 “I understand that regulatory reviews take time, and I await the MFSA’s decision”.
 In a statement sent to Times of Malta after publication, Em@ney's former CEO and minority shareholder Germano Arnó said the company had, under previous management, been committed to acting in line with its licence and uphold international standards.
 A commercial court had concluded the company was not in any risk and that shareholders had no cause for concern, he said. The judgement, which is publicly available, had also concluded that regulatory issues “are being rectified, and there is no indication that the previous board acted flagrantly incorrectly or negligently.""
 Arno said the FIAU fine was being appealed, and the customer with the alleged mafia links was not an Em@ney client.
 A follow-up independent audit confirmed that the company was growing and maintaining standards, he said. 
 “The current problems facing Em@ney have only arisen in the last two months, coinciding with the takeover by the new management, presided by Mr Gianfranco Antonio Vento and Massimo Famularo under what seems to be the guidance of Rosario Fiorentino. 
 “Until this transition, Em@ney operated smoothly and in full compliance with the regulatory framework. This attempt to shift blame has become increasingly evident, and it is clear that the majority shareholder and the new board of directors must assume full responsibility for the consequences of their actions—and inactions—which have led to the present situation,” he said, adding that he intended to use all legal means to defend his rights.

Court upholds request to open magisterial inquiry into alleged LESA racket,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/131237/court_upholds_request_to_open_magisterial_inquiry_into_alleged_lesa_racket,16-09-2024,007222.png,"Updated at 6:30pm with LESA statement 
 The court has accepted the request for a magisterial inquiry into an alleged multimillion euro racket involving top LESA officials.
 In August, Jason Azzopardi had requested a magisterial inquiry after he claimed that top LESA officials were involved in a scheme to fraudulently transfer penalty points incurred by Maltese drivers onto tourist rental cars.
  Through the racket, a Maltese offender's licence penalty points and fines are forgiven, while the fines are transferred to tourists' driving licences. The racket has ingeniously created a win-win situation for all involved, bar LESA, read the application.
 Speaking to MaltaToday in an interview, home affairs minister Byron Camilleri had stated that he will not oppose the magisterial inquiry, and denied knowledge of the racket.
 On Monday, Jason Azzopardi stated that his request was upheld, adding that unless an appeal is filed, a magistrate will be chosen to lead proceedings by the beginning of next week. 
 Azzopardi appealed to anyone with “concrete information” about the racket to speak with the inquiring magistrate next week.
 “I myself will be providing plenty of new information that I received last week, including evidence and testimony,” Azzopardi wrote.
 LESA welcomes magisterial inquiry
 Reacting to the announcement that an inquiry has been launched, LESA said it welcomes any scrutiny, saying that it never objected, and its CEO had made himself available for any investigation.
 “LESA maintains that no form of abuse or actions that undermine its integrity will be tolerated. So much so that in recent years, the Agency has invested and taken various actions, including legal measures such as garnishee orders against several individuals and companies to recover due payments,” it said.
 LESA said it will collaborate with any investigation.  ",Matthew Farrugia ,court_and_police

 The Court has ruled that the FIAU's administrative penalties do not violate the Maltese Constitution or the European Convention of Human Rights, reversing the previous decision.

                     A Constitutional Court overturned a sentence given by the Civil Court, First Hall, on 30 March 2023, where Phoenix Payments Ltd objected to a €454,293 fine that had been imposed on it by the FIAU over various money laundering breaches.

 In a similar case, the Constitutional Court had turned down a request by the Maltese financial intelligence authority to petition the European Court of Justice for guidance on the interpretation of EU law inside the Maltese courts.

 The Court had ruled that the FIAU did not classify as a court as prescribed by law, and that its power to impose administrative penalties on the basis of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, was unconstitutional and therefore in breach of the European Convention of Human Rights.

 The State Advocate appealed the decision on the basis that the FIAU has persons who are specialised in specific legal fields, and therefore, fines issued by an organisation which is organised, specialised, and expert in this field. The state advocate further added that the person who decides on a case is not the same person who investigates,

 On 18 November 2024, a Constitutional Court presided by Chief Justice Mark Chetcuti, judge Giannino Caruana Demajo, and judge Anthony Ellul, found that the laws referenced to in preceding cases did not go against the Maltese Constitution.

'Lilu King' walks out of court after his arrest is declared illegal,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/lilu-king-walks-court-arrest-declared-illegal.1096584,08-10-2024,007267.png,"Mohamed Ali Ahmed Elmushraty, better known by his online name Lilu King, walked out of court a free man on Saturday after his arrest by police on Thursday night was declared illegal.
 The decision means that while Elmushraty will still face charges of having deliberately crashed a Mercedes Benz into a buggy while driving without a licence last Thursday, he will do so without the risk of being held behind bars.
 Elmushraty is currently out of prison on three sets of bail in separate criminal cases.
 This latest incident dates back to late on Thursday night, when prosecuting inspector Eman Hayman was alerted to a car blocking the road opposite Bay Street in Paceville.
 A car had apparently crashed into a buggy and an injured man was lying on the road.
 The inspector was told that “il-Lilu” was somehow involved. Knowing that Elmushraty was subject to various bail conditions, the inspector ordered his arrest.
 Meanwhile, footage from the scene of the accident indicated that other offences had possibly occurred.
 The crash “appeared to have been deliberate,” the inspector said, and footage also showed Elmushraty step out of the Mercedes and speak to the buggy driver and a woman, who the inspector said an ex-girlfriend of Elmushraty’s.
 As the verbal altercation continued off camera, the voices got louder, said Hayman.
 Then Elmushraty left the scene.
 The injured man was taken to hospital for treatment, but he “chose to leave” the moment he got to the Mater Dei Hospital foyer.
 The inspector said he had tracked the man down and instructed him to present a medical certificate concerning his injuries. The man did not do so and also declined to provide an estimate of damages done to his vehicle, the inspector told the court.
 The woman told the police that she “saw no one”.
 Elmushraty was arrested at 1:30am on Friday and the inspector said he issued charges – reckless driving, driving without a licence and without insurance, and breaching bail conditions - based on the evidence at hand.
 But before even reaching charges stage, defence lawyer Franco Debono asked whether the inspector had informed the duty magistrate about the arrest. The duty magistrate had to be informed within six hours to validate the arrest, he noted, quoting from article 355AJ of Malta’s criminal code.
  “There are no ifs or buts,” argued Debono, citing caselaw on this point. There were similar cases, where the scenario was less clear cut, and yet the arrest was declared invalid, he noted.
 The prosecutor argued that since Elmushraty was under previous bail conditions, the police could charge him for breach of bail under arrest.
 After hearing submissions, Magistrate Nadia Helena Vella decreed that since the duty magistrate had not been informed of the arrest, it was invalid and the defendant was to be discharged.
 Elmushraty then pleaded not guilty to the charges. His case will continue while he remains a free man.

  Police Inspector Audrey Micallef told the court that the woman had filed a report at the Domestic Violence Unit yesterday, telling the police that her former partner had been sending her a stream of offensive messages on Facebook messenger and over the phone.
 She had explained that he would insist that she answer immediately whenever he called her and prohibited her from having intimate relationships or male friends.
 In recent days, particularly on September 9 and 11, he had bombarded her with insulting messages, said the inspector. During one of those calls, he had challenged the victim to report him to the police, telling her he was “prepared to spend a couple of days in prison and then kill her once he got out.”
 Police officers had subsequently arrested the man in Marsa and released a statement.
 Magistrate Rachel Montebello, leafing through the case file observed that a risk assessment had classified the situation as “Level 19. Extreme danger.”
 A plea of not guilty was filed. Defence lawyer Mark Busuttil requested bail.
 The prosecution objected to his release in view of the repeated threats to kill the woman, made over several days. His criminal record featured past convictions related to domestic violence incidents involving a former partner in one case, and in another, his parents.
 Busuttil argued that jurisprudence had established that words said in anger should not be taken literally. “Let us put things in the proper perspective. Heaven forbid that every time you argue with your wife, she can report you to the police and you are arrested.”
 The couple had been together for several years, said the lawyer, describing the argument as “a row over issues of the heart.”
 The court however denied bail as the victim had not yet testified, which could lead to risk of interference in her testimony. The magistrate added that the incident report and the defendant’s criminal record led it to “sincerely feel that there is a risk that the defendant will not observe the conditions imposed on him by the court.”

Police tight-lipped on fellow officer renting out overcrowded Sliema apartment,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/police-tightlipped-fellow-officer-sliema-apartment.1097296,28-08-2024,007272.png,"The police have refused to say whether an officer found to be renting out a cockroach-infested Sliema apartment to 16 tenants has been suspended or is being investigated.
 However, the Housing Authority has confirmed that the property had been flagged for further scrutiny last month and said that an investigation has been ongoing since then. 
 On Tuesday, Times of Malta revealed that constable Gosef Tanti was renting out the Norfolk Street house to almost three times the number of tenants permitted by planning regulations.
 The story also showed the conditions inside the property with video footage captured by a former tenant showing swarms of cockroaches in kitchen cupboards and at least 11 beds spread across two upstairs rooms of the house.
 When confronted last week, Tanti admitted to being a policeman and said other members of the police had visited the property earlier this month to check the documentation of the tenants but left without taking any further action.
 When asked about this incident and whether Tanti had been suspended in light of the revelations, the police refused to provide any specific information.
 In response to multiple questions, a spokesperson for the police only said the force “investigates all reports into breaches of professional standards and/or criminal offences allegedly committed by its members.”
 No further information was provided.
 Questions about a possible suspension or investigation, as well as the police’s alleged visit to the property earlier this month were all met with the same generic response.
 Times of Malta also asked about claims made by lawyer Jason Azzopardi, who said on Facebook on Monday night that a member of the public had reported a Facebook advert posted by Tanti allegedly offering Housing Authority contracts for sale.
 Separate questions about a police raid on the property later on Tuesday were also not addressed.

 Magistrate Donatella Frendo Dimech found Bojan Spasic, 30, from Serbia, not guilty of negligent grievous bodily harm, but convicted him of working as a doorman without a licence and smoking inside the club.
 He was fined €1,200 for these offences, payable in instalments over the next 12 months.
  Spasic had been one of 23 people who were charged over the November 2015 incident at PlusOne club. 
 A stampede inside the club had been triggered by someone using pepper spray inside the club, causing patrons to rush towards the exits.
 The crowd’s pressure had caused a glass bannister to give way. 14 youths suffered grievous injuries whilst over 80 suffered slight injuries. Two girls were in critical condition.  
  Although the club had been licenced to hold 200 persons, 450 revellers were packed inside on the night. At least 34 of them were aged under 17. 
 A subsequent inquiry led by Magistrate Doreen Clarke also found under age drinking, indoor smoking, non-existent emergency exits and unlicensed security guards, amongst other worrying shortcomings.
 Spasic, who spoke no English or Maltese had been singled out by the inquiry as having urged the patrons to leave the club.
 Reading out the concluding paragraph of her judgement in court, Magistrate Frendo Dimech praised Spasic, who she said had done his duty and put the safety of others before his own.
 Spasic was represented in court by lawyers Franco Debono, Marion Camilleri and Adreana Zammit.  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police
"Man 'tried to bite policeman during nightclub drug arrest,' court told",maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/129077/man_tried_to_bite_policeman_during_nightclub_drug_arrest_court_told,08-05-2024,007280.png,"Police say drugs, illegal fighting knives and cash were recovered during searches connected to a man who allegedly tried to bite a police officer during his arrest at a nightclub in Ta’ Qali, last Wednesday.
 Inspector Francesca Calleja arraigned 29-year-old Sebastian Fiedler from Żabbar before magistrate Joseph Gatt on Tuesday, accusing the man of possession of cocaine, ecstasy and an unclassified psychoactive substance, all of which were found in circumstances which indicated that they were not solely intended for his personal use.
 The charges are further aggravated by the fact that he had been at a place where young people gather.
 24 ecstasy pills were discovered in his possession, together with around 3.5g of cocaine and 1g of a psychoactive substance thought to be ketamine mixed with ecstasy were recovered.
  He was also accused of breaching previous bail conditions, committing an offence against the person of a police officer, violently resisting arrest and possession of illegal knives.
 The substances were found in the man’s pockets after he was arrested at the Numero Uno nightclub last Wednesday.
 Inspector Calleja told the court that police had conducted an inspection at the entertainment establishment at around 10:15pm on May 1st. Officers had noticed the man acting suspiciously and decided to take a closer look. “They approached him and at that exact moment, he dropped an empty sachet with traces of white powder from his hand.”
 Fiedler had been holding a €50 note in his other hand, added the police inspector.
 Fiedler was arrested after a struggle during which he allegedly attempted to bite one of the arresting police officers. He was then escorted to the Birkirkara police station, where a search on his person discovered four sachets of white powder, suspected to be cocaine in one of his trouser pockets.
 A sachet of pink powder, which the police suspect to be ketamine mixed with MDMA, as well as 24 pills thought to be ecstasy and €450 in cash.
 A subsequent search carried out at his home in Żabbar discovered a number of illegal bladed weapons, amongst them a butterfly knife and a switchblade.
 The defendant was already on bail at the time of his arrest, added the inspector.
 Fiedler did not answer questions during his interrogation and was later released on police bail, before being called in for questioning a second time, where he repeated his refusal to answer the police’s questions.
 Lawyer Franco Debono, assisting Fiedler together with lawyer Gianluca Caruana Curran, asked the inspector to confirm that the man had obeyed the order to return to the police station after being granted police bail. He had, Inspector Calleja replied.
 Debono suggested that the drugs had actually been found on the ground in the busy nightclub, but the police inspector explained that he had been seen to drop the sachet and had then tried to push it away with his foot.
 A proper search was then carried out at the Birkirkara police station, during which all the substances were found on his person.“All the sachets we found had been in his trouser pocket. The empty sachet was on the ground at the nightclub. The rest of the drugs were found in his pocket.”
 Asked by the court what he wished to plead to the charges, the defence replied that Fiedler was pleading not guilty and requested bail.
 In their objections to bail, the prosecution cited the seriousness of the charges, the place where he was arrested with drugs, their variety and the amounts in which they were found. He had a record of disobedience when it came to court orders, added the inspector. “He is not trustworthy and has demonstrated an inability to adhere to bail conditions, by committing another grievous offence and resisting police officers.”
 Questions asked by the magistrate clarified that the man currently had no convictions and that the breach of bail being alleged was the nightclub incident in connection with which Fiedler had been arrested.
 Debono submitted that the AG’s clearly didn’t agree with the seriousness argument, “because she sent the case to be tried before a court where less grave cases are heard,” and pointed out that his client was not accused of drug trafficking.
 The police had also felt him to be sufficiently trustworthy to release him on bail on Friday, added the lawyer. “He did not cause any problems and turned up when required.”
 Moreover, the witnesses in question are police officers and the incident was captured on body cam footage, argued the defence, pointing out that he had been on bail for the past 6 years and had made progress in that time.
 “His step father is Swiss, and he had a collection of Swiss knives under his bed,” submitted the lawyer.
 The court asked the lawyer about the charges relating to assaulting the police officers. “He denies them. Even if there was a misunderstanding, the defendant is declaring his complete respect for the police and the work that they do.”
 The defendant told the court that he worked on oil rigs and was “on call all the time.” His lawyer clarified that work-related travel while on bail had been permitted by courts, to which the inspector replied that she had not been informed of any changes to his original bail conditions.
 The court, after hearing the submissions, said that while it appreciated the defendant’s position, in view of some of the charges it would be too early a stage to grant bail. A protection order was also issued in favour of the police constable allegedly assaulted.  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police

Police sergeant denies leaking police operation information to third parties,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/132417/police_sergeant_to_be_arraigned_for_disclosing_information_on_third_parties1,23-11-2024,007341.png,"A police officer is being held in preventive custody after she was accused of leaking information related to police operations to third parties.

 Cherise Camilleri, a 28-year-old from Qormi, denied the charges in a quick, but tense arraignment on Saturday afternoon.

                     The court heard that during an investigation, a number of confidential sources had told the police that a police officer from the drugs squad had been leaking information about police operations for months, “and possibly years.”

 The investigators were told that the police officer was a woman named Cherise who had a tattoo on her arm.

 The investigators also examined social media profiles of a person of interest in an investigation, as it resulted that the person of interest and the accused knew each other.

 Camilleri was arrested on 18 November, as her mobile phone was seized. She denied her involvement in the leaks and was granted police bail, as investigators began the extraction process from her mobile phone. 

 The information obtained from the extraction would later result that Camilleri had lied in her statement to the police, leading to her being arrested yet again on 21 November.

 On that day, the police arrested another person in connection to the same crime, seizing his mobile phone and finding information on police operations shared with him.

 Camilleri denied the charges brought against her on Saturday, as the defence did not request bail at this stage.

Man who torched prison warder’s car jailed for five years,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/man-torched-prison-warder-car-jailed-five-years.1092854,23-05-2024,007349.png,"A man who torched a prison warder’s car in Qormi in January 2021 has been jailed for five years after being convicted of the crime.
 Tony Zammit, a 45-year-old Qormi resident, was found guilty of having torched a Toyota Platz, parked on Triq San Edwardu in the early hours of January 25.
 The car belonged to a warder who at the time worked in Division 5 at Corradino Correctional Facility.
 A blue Opel Astra parked in front of the burning car was also extensively damaged.  
 Zammit was also convicted of injuring a police sergeant when he sped off with his car after asking officers to get something from his car during his arrest. The sergeant was dragged for a considerable distance before he let go and fell to the ground. He was also found guilty of disobeying police orders and damaging the sergeant’s uniform.
 Magistrate Leonard Caruana heard how Zammit was identified by investigators from the Major Crimes Unit and the district police while they were checking CCTV footage.
 They saw a person wearing a hoodie, a face mask, tracksuit trousers with two white lines along the hem and sports shoes with a white sole. The person’s face was covered with the hoodie and the mask, making him unrecognisable. 
 Since the police knew Zammit from previous cases, they suspected that it was him, so an arrest warrant was issued and he was detained when he went to sign his bail book at the police station more than two weeks later.
 
 During a search at his house, the police found a pair of tracksuit trousers and shoes very similar to those worn by the person in the CCTV footage. 
 He was also identified through the car that he was driving on the night of the arson. Although the car was registered in his brother’s name, his sibling told the police that Zammit was using the car since he had to take it to the mechanic. 
 In a pre-sentencing report, the court was told about Zammit’s turbulent past as well as his drug addiction, which saw him incarcerated for drug abuse. He was only 15 when he was first jailed. Although he spent a few years away from the habit, he began abusing drugs again. 
 While in jail, he managed to stay away from drugs and worked as a baker in the facility’s bakery. However, the moment he was released, he fell for the “habit that has ruined his life”.  The probation officer recommended that treatment be given for drug abuse in an exhaustive manner and a controlled environment. 
 Magistrate Caruana ruled that, apart from the five-year prison sentence for the crime he had committed, the court hoped the treatment order would help him overcome the drug addiction.

 Police Inspector John Spiteri gave details during proceedings against Luke Farrugia, 36, Clint Lawrence D’Amato, Denzil Farrugia, 19, Kane Vassallo, 22, Gordon Cassar, 44, Luca Emanuele Corito, 21, Dylan McKay 30, Alexandra Suhov Pocora, 32, and her partner Nicolae Efimov, 37.
 They stand accused of involvement in a human trafficking racket which lured Colombian women to Malta with an offer of work but then forced them into prostitution in several brothels in the Msida and Gzira area.
 They saw over 2,000 clients in three months in just one of the brothels. 
 The accused are pleading not guilty.
 In his testimony Spiteri confirmed that although Vassallo was not involved in the process of bringing the foreign nationals to Malta, WhatsApp messages indicated that he was aware of their arrival from Colombia, referring to them as “new stock.”
 As for Corito, the inspector confirmed that the defendant had contacted one of the victims only once. There was evidence showing that Corito knew that he was instructing one of the victims to render services outside the apartment. He was allegedly paid €400 for that job.
  Cassar allegedly received some €75,000 in his Revolut account in less than two years.
 Deposits of €55 were made at intervals throughout each night, thus possibly indicating that those were payments for 30-minute services rendered by the prostitutes.
 After that testimony and submissions by the defence the court, presided over by Magistrate Donatella Frendo Dimech, decreed that there was sufficient prima facie evidence for all nine defendants to stand trial on indictment.
 Later in the afternoon, the court delivered a decree whereby it upheld the bail request in respect of two of the defendants, denying bail to the other co-accused.
 Pocora was granted bail against a deposit of €5,000, a personal guarantee of €15,000 and signing of the bail book three times weekly.
 Corito was granted bail against a deposit of €8,000, a personal guarantee of €12,000 and daily signing of the bail book.

 Magistrate Rachel Montebello, who will be presiding the criminal case, yesterday ruled that all parties were to be given access to the acts of the inquiry. Her ruling came a day after Judge Giovanni Grixti's decision to grant provide Muscat with a copy of the parts of the magisterial inquiry, 
 In a Facebook post, Charlon Gouder welcomed Friday's ruling, which ordered the Commissioner of Police and the Attorney General to disclose the relevant parts of the inquiry to the defendants, ahead of their arraignment in three weeks’ time.
  “Also this time, as this is what should have happened, the court ordered that this copy be also released to the other persons involved and recommended for charges.”
 Gouder drew comparisons with the Egrant inquiry into allegations of an offshore setup intended to launder kickbacks from passport sales, which did not find connections to Muscat's wife, Michelle.
 “I am convinced more than ever before that the truth about this second Egrant will be known soon. I am convinced that once the details of this greatest of injustices become known, the people will immediately judge the person who washed his hands, justice will pass judgement over the years and history will condemn those who were behind these machinations forever.”
 Gouder remarked that it was a shame that valid and talented people were being “lost during this long and difficult process,” and expressed solidarity with former deputy Prime Minister Chris Fearne, who stepped down yesterday, after he too was earmarked for prosecution by the inquiry.

 Addressing journalists at a press conference on Monday, Aquilina presented key points from the results of the 1,200-page report ahead of Muscat's arraignment on Tuesday.
 “Tomorrow will see the start of a judicial process of a magnitude and importance which we have never seen before,” Aquilina said, referring to the arraignment as a ""judicial earthquake"".
 He said that while in public Muscat repeatedly claimed that he wanted the truth to come out, he did everything in his power for the truth to remain a mystery. 
 Quoting page 54 of the inquiry report, he noted how Muscat and his family refused to give the investigators the passwords to their devices, and it was officials from the US Homeland Security who had to step in to unlock the devices. 
  The conclusions of the inquiry also showed how further investigations must be held on Muscat, specifically his bank accounts from 2020 onwards, and his connections with projects, money loans, and permits granted to companies during his time as prime minister. 
 “Whatever Muscat touched, there is suspicion of corruption,” Aquilina said.
 Aquilina noted how the investigators were ""shocked"" by the extent of fraudulent activities tied to the hospital's concession and how the inquiry details how the public's money was spent. 
 
 Aquilina said it should actually be the police commissioner, rather than himself, who should be giving a detailed account of the evidence, which showed how a criminal organisation was led by Muscat.
 He noted the “political support fund”, which was created by Steward Health Care, which took over the hospitals deal from Vitals and is suspected to have been set up to transfer bribes to Muscat as well as his chief of staff Keith Schembri, and then health minister Konrad Mizzi. 
 Furthermore, Aquilina said, Prime Minister, Robert Abela was told years ago that the hospitals concession was fraudulent, and yet he still went on to hand Vitals and then Steward millions of euros in taxpayers' money.

 The magistrate dropped charges against the 26-year-old Qormi man, reversing a decision by an initial court that initially refused to drop the charges at the woman’s request. 
 The accused was first arraigned last week an accused of breaching a protection order granted in favour of his ex-partner and her son, breaching bail conditions and misuse of electronic equipment. 
 At the man’s arraignment, the alleged victim, through her lawyer Mark Mifsud Cutjar, informed the court that she had forgiven the man for what passed between them and wanted to drop the charges. 
 However, the court turned down the request and ordered that proceedings against the man continue, reasoning that the charge of breaching a protection order does not necessarily qualify as a domestic violence charge, which allows for charges to be dropped based on the victim’s wishes. 
 A request for bail at arraignment was also turned down. 
 As is procedure, the case was then sent to a different magistrate, who was tasked with deciding its outcome. 
 When the case resumed on Wednesday, the woman and her son once again appeared in court and stressed that they both wanted to drop the charges against the accused and insisted they had forgiven him. 
 Both of them took the stand under oath and were questioned thoroughly by the court about their intentions.

 75-year-old Paul Philippe Al României is being detained at the Corradino Correctional Facility until the court decides on the AG’s appeal against a magistrate’s decision refusing his extradition.
 The case has been deferred to June 17.
 In the meantime, through his lawyers, he filed an urgent case in the First Hall of the Civil Court in its constitutional jurisdiction claiming that his continued arrest was in breach of his rights.
 He claimed that the law specifically precluded the court from releasing him from arrest just because it was an extradition request.
 But Mr Justice Mark Simiana disagreed with this interpretation of the law, stating that contrary to what was being claimed, the court did have the possibility of granting bail and had in fact exercised this discretion.
 The judge said that the Court of Criminal Appeal had rejected the applicant’s request for bail because it did not consider that he had brought sufficient guarantees to be released from arrest.
 The complaint that the law removes that discretion from the courts was not factually and legally rooted, the judge said.
 Al României successfully fought an extradition request claiming that his fundamental rights risked being breached if he were to be sent back to his homeland.
 The attorney general has appealed a decision by a Magistrates’ Court turning down the extradition request.
 On December 17, 2020, the prince was convicted by the High Court of Cassation in Romania for corruption and was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of three years and four months.
 The next day, an alert was issued on the Schengen Information System together with a European Arrest Warrant by the Court of Appeal at Brasov targeting Al Romaniei who was found to have been involved in the illegal restitution and sale of land in Bucharest.
 A similar extradition request by the Romanian authorities had been turned down by the two courts in France where Al Romaniei now lives.
 The AG claims there was no evidence showing “a real and serious risk” was put forward, the AG added, thus requesting the court to reverse the decision and order Al României’s extradition.

 A few days ago, Judge Edwina Grima ordered NEWZ.mt to pull down a video blog by Manuel Delia from its Facebook page. 
 Throughout the video, Delia discussed a previous controversy in which the same judge had ordered Lovin Malta to remove parts of an interview with lawyer Jason Azzopardi, who claimed Fenech was the sole mastermind in the Daphne Caruana Galizia murder.
  This had prompted Judge Grima to issue a ban on “writings, whether printed or not, and declarations or public discussions on the broadcast media and social media, on the crime and the person accused of the crime,” until proceedings are concluded. 
 Under this decree, only reports on the court proceedings are allowed, and anyone found guilty of breaching the order will be found in contempt of court.

 An appeals court has ordered the return of Anthony Chircop's Nissan Skyline GT-R after a procedural error invalidated its confiscation, despite his conviction for the involuntary murder of Stephanie Rapa in a high-speed crash.

                     Anthony Chircop had the Nissan Skyline GT-R he was driving at the time of the crash returned to him on due to a procedural error by the prosecution in his initial criminal conviction. The sports car, an appeals court noted, had never been formally listed in the acts of the case. Therefore, there were no legal grounds on which it could be confiscated, it concluded. 

 Chircop filed an appeal after a court handed him a two-year prison sentence, suspended for four years, after it found him guilty of the involuntary murder of 30-year-old Stephanie Rapa. In separate proceeding, Chircop and his insurer were ordered to  pay €323,944 to the family of a pedestrian who died after being run over in Gzira by a car travelling at 140km/h.

 Chircop, who had been driving towards Sliema when he collided with the woman, failed to stop. He had denied that he was driving at 140 km/h at the time. Furthermore, in June 2022, the First Hall of the Civil court ruled that the victim and the driver had been equally to blame for the incident, because Rapa had not been on a zebra crossing at the time, she was struck by the speeding car. The grieving parents then had filed an appeal.

 In their appeal, they argued the street was well-lit, the road dry, and visibility good, with the incident captured on nearby restaurant’s CCTV camera. The Court presided by Chief Justice Mark Chetcuti and judges Giannino Caruana Demajo and Anthony Ellul, upheld the appeal, finding no contributory negligence by the victim.

 Chircop asked the court of appeal to order the return of his confiscated vehicle, to revoke an €11,646.87 fine imposed on him and to strike off a two-year driving ban imposed on him. The court of appeal agreed to return the car due to the procedural error but threw out his other requests.

 Chircop was driving at “extreme” speed and had a history of dangerous driving: he was convicted in 2001 of reckless driving, drunk driving in 2006 and driving without a licence in 2014. The fine and driving ban imposed on him by the first court was “more than deserved”, the court said.

Sex worker from Colombia testifies in human trafficking case against nine defendants,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/130898/sex_worker_from_colombia_testifies_in_human_trafficking_case_against_nine_defendants,26-08-2024,007560.png,"A Colombian sex worker gave testimony on Monday as part of a human trafficking case against eight men and one woman who are accused of trafficking South American women to Malta, allegedly forcing them to work in brothels.
 The witness, who hails from Medellin, Colombia, shared her experiences of how she ended up in Malta under these circumstances.
  The nine defendants were among eleven individuals originally apprehended during coordinated early-morning raids on August 12, targeting multiple locations across Malta, including properties in Birkirkara, Gzira, St. Paul’s Bay, Siggiewi, Fgura, Gudja, Raħal Ġdid, Ħaż-Żebbuġ, and Isla. The police operations were a result of ongoing investigations into human trafficking and prostitution rings operating within the country.
 The witness, who identified herself as a salesgirl who occasionally worked as an escort in Colombia, explained that she came to Malta specifically to engage in sex work. “In Colombia, prostitution is legal, and it’s not a problem,” she said, citing economic difficulties as her primary motivation. “I need to support my daughter, my mother, and my grandmother. Economically, life in Colombia is very hard.”
 The witness testified that she had been introduced to the idea of working in Malta through a friend and fellow sex worker named Michelle, who was part of a WhatsApp group that connected escorts to opportunities abroad.
 “I knew what I was coming to Malta for,” she explained. “There was a WhatsApp chat, and my friend told me I could do that work in Malta.” The chat, she indicated, facilitated the movement of sex workers to various countries, with Malta being a chosen destination due to its use of the Euro, which is strong against the Colombian Peso.
 In preparation for her journey, the witness received assistance with her travel arrangements. Her contact in Malta, a person she only knew through disappearing messages, organised her flight tickets and instructed her to bring €500 in cash. The flight from Colombia took her to Madrid before arriving in Malta, with the total cost of travel amounting to €3,700. This amount was to be reimbursed through her earnings from sex work.
 Upon arrival, the witness was picked up by a man driving a white car, who she later identified as Clint Lawrence D’Amato, one of the defendants, known by the alias “Miguel.” She was taken to a property described as “normal” with basic amenities. Her work commenced on the very first evening of her arrival.
 The witness disclosed her daily routine, which typically spanned from 4pm to 2am, during which she would service five to six clients daily. Her charges were €50 for a 30-minute encounter, with additional charges for ‘extras’ at her discretion. Over ten days, she earned approximately €4,000 before deductions.
 She said that she had earned around €2000 from her base rate, but had not seen any of that money, which went to settle her debt for travel expenses. She told the court that she had lived off what she had made for ‘extras’ - which amounted to around €1,500.
 The sex worker described how her earnings were collected daily by D’Amato, whom she also identified through a video feed in the courtroom. All instructions and client bookings were communicated via the WhatsApp group, and D’Amato was the only point of contact she had met in person.
 She further testified about her limited knowledge of the broader operation and indicated that her involvement in prostitution was a voluntary decision based on economic necessity, to support her dependants in Colombia. “I wanted to settle my debt as quickly as possible,” she told the court.
 Despite having her passport, which was always in her possession, the woman said she had not considered leaving, because she did not have enough money to purchase a return ticket to Colombia. After the police raid on the brothel, she had expressed a desire to go back to Colombia but noted that she is currently in Malta due to her involvement in the ongoing case.
 Who is accused of what?
 All nine of the defendants, Luke Farrugia (36), Clint D’Amato (36), Denzil Farrugia (19), Alexandra Suhov Procora (32), Nicolae Efimov (37), Kane Vassallo (22), Luca Emanuele Corito (21), Dylan McKay (30), and Gordon Cassar (44), are denying charges which include money laundering, promoting or setting up a criminal organisation, forcing individuals into prostitution, holding persons as bonded debtors, and knowingly living off the earnings of prostitution.
 Additionally, several defendants face specific charges related to human trafficking for exploitation, assisting in trafficking, and running a brothel. Luke Farrugia and Dylan McKay are also charged with using services from trafficked individuals, with McKay facing further charges related to committing crimes during a suspended sentence and recidivism. D’Amato is also accused of possessing cocaine with intent for distribution.
 Cross-examining the woman, lawyer Roberto Montalto questioned the witness’s decision to apply for victim status under the Victims of Crime Act, suggesting that she had always been free to return to Colombia, a point she acknowledged. Further testimony revealed that her passport was currently being held by the police to facilitate her safe repatriation.
 Lawyer Mario Mifsud inquired about her communication with family and her understanding of the implications of her status as a trafficking victim. Mifsud asked whether the witness had initially feared being in trouble with the law herself. “Yes, at the time, many fears crossed my mind.” He suggested that this was a factor in the woman’s decision to ask for victim status. “Yes,” replied the witness.
 Mifsud asked whether the police had explained to her that if she were to be repatriated to Colombia, she would not be allowed to return to Malta or other Schengen zone countries, and whether this had affected her choice to request victim status. The woman said that it had not.
 Inspector Spiteri replied that if valid grounds for victim status hadn’t been found, she would have simply been deported to Colombia.
 Inspector Spiteri asked whether, in her chat with “Private”, she had ever been provided with information about tourist attractions in Malta, besides escort work. Her reply was that she had not.
 Had someone forced her to collaborate, asked the magistrate. “Was it a voluntary decision on her part or was she threatened with deportation?” She had not been threatened with deportation, replied the woman, confirming that the police had not spoken to her until she gave her statement.
 In reply to a question by lawyer Charles Mercieca, the woman confirmed that she had not been mistreated or abused in Malta. She had sent money back to Colombia voluntarily, the witness confirmed in reply to another question. “I didn’t want to leave. I only wanted to leave when I saw the police.”
 Second woman also recognises D’Amato
 Another woman who was allegedly trafficked took the stand in the afternoon.  
 Asked by Bonett Sladden why she had chosen to travel to Malta, she said that it had been mentioned in some WhatsApp group chats that she had joined. 
 She told the court that before travelling to Malta she had also performed escort work in her home  country and would provide services of a sexual nature. 
 In one of the WhatsApp groups she had seen a advertisement for sex work abroad. “There was a vacancy in Malta for a girl who wanted to go there to work,” said the woman, telling the court that she was unable to recall the name of the group.
 She had sent a picture of herself to the number specified in the group chat message and had received information about how much she could expect to earn, stipulating the rates for 30 minutes, 60 minutes and assorted ‘extras.’
 She had always been allowed 8 hours of sleep a day, the woman said when asked about her working arrangements. “I had only been in Malta for two days. I arrived on Friday and slept the entire night. On Saturday I saw two clients and slept at night. Another two on Sunday and I slept too. Then on Monday the police [raided the apartment].”
 The second witness also pointed out D’Amato in the courtroom as her handler in Malta, saying that she knew him as “Mig.” He would drive her to service clients at outside locations other than her flat, where she and the other women would sleep four to a room. There had been four outcalls in total, said the witness. “Two on Saturday and two on Sunday. Both during the day.”
 She said that she had travelled to Malta together with another woman, who had already testified in a previous sitting. During her two days in Malta, she “had not encountered any problems”, the woman from Medellin said.  
 She had earned a total of €600 from these outcalls, she said, which she would leave on a table in the flat every night for collection. In reply to a question put to her by Bonett Sladden, the witness said that D’Amato would drive her to service clients outside the flat. Cross-examined by Montalto, the woman confirmed that she had been in possession of her passport and mobile phone at all times. She was unable to say whether she was free to return to Colombia, however, explaining that she had only been in Malta for two days before the police raided the apartment, but confirmed that she had not been confined to or locked in the apartment.
 Similarly to the previous witness, the second woman also denied that the police had ever threatened her with deportation should she refuse to cooperate with their investigation.  
 Asked whether the women had asked to leave, the woman said “we all wanted to leave. We were told by the police that now there was an ongoing process and that we would be placed under protection.” 
 The court pointed out at this point that both witnesses had said the same thing and that repatriation was a process with several steps.  The police Inspector explained that the woman had not been under protection before the raid, because she had been part of the criminal organisation. “The risk to the woman and her family began the moment she turned against it,” said the inspector, describing the defence’s suggestion as absurd.
 At a point, the woman, unprompted, alleged that the police hadn’t allowed her to contact her boyfriend’s Italian lawyer, but it soon emerged that the failure to communicate was because the lawyer in question had not answered the phone, and not because of any obstruction by the police. 
 Lawyer Mario Mifsud asked the witness to explain whether was allowed to leave the shelter to go jogging or partying, to objections from the prosecution.
 The woman did say that she was allowed to leave the shelter, however.
 Lawyer Marion Camilleri suggested that it was not the woman’s first trip to Malta for prostitution. The woman confirmed that she had visited the Maltese islands before, many years ago but not for the purposes of prostitution. She had first visited with her then boyfriend and had subsequently been in Malta on another occasion, as a stop on a tour of Europe with a later boyfriend. 
 The sitting was adjourned to Wednesday.  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police

 Arab stands accused of threatening his mother and causing her to fear him, after she filed a police report against him, saying he has a drug addiction problem and is aggressive.
 He pleaded not guilty when he was arraigned on April 25.
 On Thursday, his mother told the court that she and her son had spent days trying to get him medical help at the Gzira Health Centre, but were turned away.
 The following morning, she tried to wake him up to go to Mater Dei Hospital, but he refused to wake up and things got heated.
 Arab’s mother said her son threw a lampshade and mobile phone at the wall, and that she subsequently left the room and called emergency services. She could then hear objects being broken, though she could not see who was breaking them.
 The accused’s girlfriend, who asked not to testify but was required to, confirmed that the accused was unwilling to get out of bed that morning. She said she went out onto the veranda as the argument got heated. There, she heard something break in the room, but did not see what it was.
 The accused’s father chose not to testify.
 Following Thursday’s testimony, Arab’s new lawyers Franco Debono, Marion Camilleri and Adreana Zammit filed a request for bail. Given that key witnesses had already testified, the Attorney General did not object.
 The court granted the accused bail against a €1,000 deposit and €4,000 personal guarantee. He must also respect a curfew between 9pm and 6am, sign a bail book four times a week at the Valletta police station and stay away from witnesses in the case.

Drug trafficking trial flounders after judge forced to dissolve jury,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/131232/trial_begins_for_three_men_accused_of_trafficking_almost_2000_ecstasy_pills_in_20081,16-09-2024,007601.png,"Updated at 6pm
 The trial of three men indicted for allegedly having trafficked almost 2,000 ecstasy pills in 2008 had to be cancelled on its first day, after it became apparent that a supplementary juror had been present in the courtroom while the parties were discussing whether to remove offences from the bill of indictment.
  On Monday, Madame Justice Edwina Grima presided over the trial of Rio Micallef, 41, David Tabone, 40- and 34-year-old Darren James Vella, who stand indicted for trafficking the drugs, a crime punishable by imprisonment for life. Micallef is also indicted for the possession of 1,940 MDMA, valued at €18,624, while Tabone is further accused of possession of MDMA pills and cocaine. All three men are denying the charges.
 But the plans were thrown into disarray after the judge was informed that the man chosen as supplementary juror number 12, had been in the courtroom’s public gallery before the sitting, during discussions on potential amendments to the bill of indictment.
 The defence lawyers asked the judge to order the dissolution of the jury, telling the judge that before the jury had been empanelled, one of the reserve jurors had been present in the courtroom whilst parts of the bill of indictment’s narrative, relating to verbal statements Vella had made to the police, and which the Court of Criminal Appeal had declared to be inadmissible, were being removed.
 Prosecutors Godwin Cini, Kevin Valletta and Danika Vella suggested that the court should first establish whether there was any truth to this allegation. The court duly ordered the deputy registrar to privately contact the juror and ask him whether he had heard the submissions, whilst also ordering that footage from the courtroom CCTV cameras be produced.
 “I was explicit and clear. I said that if any prospective jurors are in the courtroom, they are to leave immediately,” the court recalled.
 When she returned from speaking to the juror in question, the registrar informed the court that he had told her that he had been playing a videogame on his phone at the time and had not been paying attention to what was being said in court. His attention had only returned to the courtroom when the judge had ordered the jury to be called into the courtroom.
 Judge Grima asked whether the defence would object were only the supplementary jurors were to be replaced. Object it did, however.
 Cini argued that the objection had no basis. There was no risk, he said, because the supplementary jurors were kept apart from the jury, and there was no risk of contamination. “Jurors are kept separate from supplementary jurors so unless they are telepathic, they cannot communicate amongst themselves.”
 But lawyer Franco Debono insisted that there was, arguing that supplementary jurors “aren’t just for decoration.” “The panel is a single entity. If it is tainted, it is tainted,” he said, adding that even if the same pool of potential jurors were to be called back tomorrow, they now already know the names of the defendants and charges they are facing.
 Lawyer Arthur Azzopardi pointed out that “the first thing a person who is not selected as a juror will do is check the news to see what the jury was about,” arguing that it was unlikely that the jurors would forget what they read about the trial in the news in the space of a week.
 The judge considered dismissing the supplementary juror after calling him to testify to see whether he had said anything to the other jurors about what he had heard, allowing the jury to proceed if he hadn’t.
 But Debono expressed doubt as to whether a juror could legally disclose what he had discussed with the other jurors and pointed out that the court could not take him at his word.
 The jury was irremediably tainted, argued the lawyer. “You cannot fix this by simply removing a supplementary juror. Also, if he was playing a video game, when he was meant to be following a trial by jury, I don’t know what that says about him.”
 Lawyer Michael Sciriha said he was sympathetic to the court’s efforts to save the trial, “but it is unsalvageable.” Sciriha insisted that continuing with the trial would lead to constitutional proceedings, which he said, would unfairly cast a shadow over the judge.
 “I think the juror did not tell the registrar the truth or was, let’s say, ‘imprecise.’” was lawyer Arthur Azzopardi’s diplomatic suggestion. “Whatever this man says from here on, I cannot have peace of mind that he would be telling the truth. If you are playing a video game you shouldn’t have noticed that the jurors are being called. And if he did notice, why did he come back to the courtroom?”
 “The defence understands the court’s desire to have this case decided as soon as possible, but the risk is palpable,” concluded the lawyer.
 “This morning we already had one juror ask to be excused and a supplementary juror take her place,” said Azzopardi. “These three men behind me have been waiting for 16 years for this trial, but to continue with this trial today would be an injustice.”
 After retiring to chambers to deliberate on how to proceed for approximately an hour, the judge returned to the courtroom and discharged the jurors, postponing the trial to a future date.
 What was the trial about?
 The defendants had been arrested in September 2008 after a consignment of ecstasy pills which the prosecution said Micallef was to hand over to Tabone and Vella in a Birkirkara garage belonging to Vella.
 Text messages intercepted by the authorities indicated that the latter two were to then sell the drugs on to a number of third parties and reap massive profits.
 The police had been following their movements in Birkirkara and on 15 September 2008 the three accused were seen meeting in their cars outside the Butterfly Bar in Birkirkara, before following each other to the garage in Triq il-Knisja l-Qadima.
 It was outside the garage that Micallef realised that they had been followed by the police, ducking behind a parked van and running off, chased by police officers who subsequently arrested him.
 Other officers arrested Vella and Tabone, the latter of whom was found to be carrying €9,330 and an electronic weighing scales in his bag. Traces of cocaine and ecstasy were detected on the scales.
 Two bags containing 1,940 white pills, later determined to be ecstasy pills with a street value of €18,624, were recovered from underneath the van which Micallef had been seen crouching behind. Drugs were also found on Tabone’s person.
 Prosecutors Kevin Valletta, Godwin Cini and Danica Vella are representing the Office of the Attorney General in the proceedings.
 Rio Micallef is being assisted by lawyers Franco Debono, Jose Herrera and Alex Scerri Herrera.
 Lawyers Arthur Azzopardi and Jacob Magri are representing David Tabone. Lawyers Michael Sciriha and Matthew Xuereb are Darren James Vella’s defence counsel.  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police

 The 56-year-old Ħamrun resident is understood to have had a 12-year relationship with the victim, which had since ended. Despite the relationship being over, while drunk, the defendant had let himself into the woman’s home while she was out.
 When the woman returned and discovered that her ex-partner was inside her residence, she had told him to leave, at which point the man had threatened her.
  The man was also charged with having a knife in public without a permit, after the police retrieved a large butcher’s knife from his car.
 In his submissions on punishment, defence lawyer Jacob Magri suggested a probation order and a fine, in view of the man’s early guilty plea. The prosecution did not object.

Drug trafficking trial dissolved on day one,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/drug-trafficking-trial-dissolved-day-one.1098174,16-09-2024,007629.png,"The trial by jury of three men allegedly involved in a drug trafficking conspiracy 16 years ago was dissolved shortly after it got underway on Monday after a man who was selected to serve as a reserve juror was seen seated in the courtroom’s public gallery while the parties were thrashing out legal arguments prior to the actual start of testimony.
 The juror, when later questioned by the judge’s deputy registrar, claimed that he was oblivious to the legal arguments being discussed since he was engrossed in a video game on his mobile phone.
 The judge had earlier directed any member of the public who could subsequently be selected to serve as juror to leave the courtroom.
 But that order appeared to have gone over the potential juror’s head. He stayed in his seat while legal arguments concerning amendments to the bill of indictment were discussed. Those arguments related to police statements released by one of the accused. Those statements are to be removed from the bill of indictment because they were previously declared inadmissible in evidence by the Court of Criminal Appeal.
 When the man was noticed, the defence teams strongly objected to the continuation of the trial, even though that stray juror was a supplementary member of the panel.
 Defence lawyer Franco Debono argued that since the panel was a single entity, the whole panel was “tainted.”
 Defence lawyer Arthur Azzopardi argued further that the situation would not be remedied by selecting another juror from the same pool of potential jurors summoned on Monday. Those not chosen to serve today would have likely read about the trial in the interim period after being dismissed.
 Defence lawyer Michael Sciriha added that no efforts by the court could now salvage the trial. 
 Madam Justice Edwina Grima subsequently upheld the defence’s arguments, discharged the jurors and dissolved the trial, postponing it to a later date.
 The three co-accused, Rio Micallef, 41, David Tabone, 40 and Darren James Vella, 34, were friends who at the time of the allegations frequented the usual haunts in Birkirkara. One of them ran a snack bar in the area.
 The prosecution alleges that the trio’s plan was for one of the suspects to procure ecstasy pills which would subsequently be sold by his alleged partners.
 Another of the accused was to provide the funds for the drugs.
 Officers from the drug squad closely monitored the three suspects’ movements before arresting them on September 15, 2008.
 Police had watched as Tabone left his home and drove towards McDonald’s Birkirkara outlet, where Vella joined him. They then met Micallef, who ran a snack bar near Fleur-de-Lys. 
 Micallef exited his shop, got into his car and drove in the direction of Old Church Street, followed closely by the other two men.
 Parking their cars at a distance from each other, two of the suspects approached the entrance to a garage. One of them, Tabone, allegedly carried a black bag. 
 Sensing the police presence, Micallef suddenly crouched low and allegedly threw a white bag under a parked van and fled, but the police apprehended him and the others.  
 Police officers found the white bag under the van. It yielded two plastic bags containing 1940 ecstasy pills. Their estimated market value was €18,624.
 The officers also seized the black bag containing €9330 in cash and a set of electronic weighing scales bearing drug traces.
 Police statements released by the accused were later declared inadmissible in evidence against them since the suspects were not legally assisted at the time.
 AG lawyers Kevin Valletta, Godwin Cini and Danica Vella were prosecuting.
 Lawyers Franco Debono, Jose Herrera and Alex Scerri Herrera were assisting one of the accused.

Abuser who threw chair at his wife gets one last chance to clean himself up,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/abuser-threw-chair-wife-gets-one-last-chance-clean.1098700,27-09-2024,007631.png,"A retired construction worker with a 40-year drinking problem has been given “one last opportunity” to straighten himself out after he threw a chair at his wife and tried to attack her and his son.
 The man, 65-year-old Sri Lankan national James Dominicus, later apologized for the incident and expressed regret, saying he did not remember anything about what had happened.
 His wife turned up at the St Lucia domestic violence hub on Thursday morning at around 9:30am to report that her husband and father of three grown children had assaulted her.
 The Wednesday afternoon incident was apparently triggered by some construction works next to the couple’s Birżebbuġa home.
 The man complained about the works at around 2:30pm.  
 When his wife told him off about the way in which he tackled the issue, the incident turned violent, said prosecuting Inspector Christian Cauchi when giving an overview of the events leading up to the arrest.
 The man first threw a dining room chair at his wife. Then he grabbed a knife and threatened to kill her.
 When their grown up son intervened, the man grabbed a pair of scissors and tried to attack his son.
 His wife later told the police that his long-standing alcohol problem was the cause of his troubles.
 Following the latest scene, her landlord had advised her to seek police assistance.
 The following morning she headed to the domestic violence hub and filed a report.
 On Friday the elderly man, wearing a black sleeveless ‘Out to Party’ t-shirt, admitted to causing his wife and son fear of violence, insulting and threatening them.
 The prosecutor said he had retrieved the scissors but not the knife used in the incident.
 When questioned, the defendant denied the allegations, saying that he did not recall anything.  But he did admit to a 40-year-long alcohol problem which “he never managed to address.”
 After consulting his lawyer, the accused registered an admission.
 Defence lawyer Victor Bugeja said that the accused regretted his actions and apologized for what could have happened.
 He also wished to address his addiction. A treatment order and probation would be in order, said Bugeja.
 The court, presided over by Magistrate Jean Paul Grech, declared the accused guilty upon his own admission.
 As for punishment, the court observed that the accused had admitted at the earliest opportunity, had apologized and showed remorse and needed immediate help.
 The court thus issued a three-year probation order, coupled with a treatment order and restraining order for equal terms.
 “I am giving you the last opportunity to address your alcohol problem. Make sure you make the best of it. This could be your last chance,” warned the magistrate as the accused nodded in understanding.

Contingency plan drawn up as medical supplier faces court,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/contingency-plan-drawn-medical-supplier-faces-court.1092754,21-05-2024,007668.png,"Updated 2pm with Technoline response
 Technoline will continue to provide medical supplies to the government, but the health ministry has drawn up contingency plans in case the court orders a long-term freeze on the company’s assets in the wake of the hospitals scandal.
 Health Minister Jo Etienne Abela told Times of Malta that the government intends to allow its biggest supplier of medical equipment to continue operating its ongoing contracts, despite the fact the company and its representatives face criminal charges over the hospitals deal.
 But the ministry has drawn up plans to continue offering medical services normally in case the court orders an extensive freeze on the company’s assets, rendering it unable to honour its contractual obligations.
  “Let me assure everyone that we will continue to offer all our services, without any doubt,” said the minister, who added that the details would be ironed out by the Contracts Department.
 “The patient remains my top priority, so I will make sure our services remain uninterrupted, with or without freezing orders.”
 The government has, over the years, bought thousands of euros worth of medical equipment from Technoline. Once bought, the equipment is owned by the state, but the government procures consumables from Technoline and has maintenance agreements with it, and those risk being impacted by a freezing order, sources close to the government said.
 Technoline Ltd is among many individuals and companies who are to be charged with some of the most serious crimes over the Vitals and Steward hospitals deal next week.
 
 The company’s representative – businessman Ivan Vassallo – is also facing charges of major crimes, both personally and as a representative of the company.
 The company was in the privileged position of managing the procurement of all medical supplies for Vitals. Vassallo bought the company months before it got that contract and the deal is suspected to have been financed by the people behind Vitals.
 In the first 10 months of 2022, Technoline was handed €824,000 in direct orders from the government – more than any other company in Malta during the same period.
 Arraignments of the 38 individuals and companies are expected on Tuesday and Wednesday next week, when both Vassallo and the company are slated to have a chunk of their assets frozen.
 The prosecution generally asks court to issue a freezing order during the first hearing.
 Times of Malta asked Abela whether the government felt it should blacklist Technoline from bidding for future tenders, seeing it is facing criminal charges.
 “It’s not a question of blacklisting,” Abela replied. “Legal procedures must be allowed to take their course and there is the presumption of innocence.”
 “It is superfluous to discuss this issue though, because there are issues of assets freezing [that we have to deal with before].”

"Judge deems Jason Azzopardi comments prejudicial to Yorgen Fenech, orders Lovin to edit interview",maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/130968/judge_deems_jason_azzopardi_comments_prejudicial_to_yorgen_fenech_orders_lovin_to_edit_interview,31-08-2024,007669.png,"A judge has ordered Lovin Malta to edit an interview with lawyer Jason Azzopardi after he claimed Yorgen Fenech alone commissioned Daphne Caruana Galizia’s murder.
 After hearing the interview, Judge Edwina Grima, presiding over the Criminal Court, ordered the news portal to remove the section of the interview in which Azzopardi discussed Fenech. The judge also ordered Azzopardi to remove the interview from his Facebook page.
  In her ruling, Grima said the comments made by Azzopardi on Fenech’s guilt or otherwise could interfere with the administration of justice. She added that the comments could also influence the judgement exercised by jurors that still have to be selected for the trial.
 The ruling was delivered following a court application filed by Fenech in the wake of comments Azzopardi made during the Lovin Malta interview that was published recently.
 Fenech is awaiting trial over accusations that he procured the murder of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia in October 2017.
 In his application, Fenech asked the Criminal Court to take action against Azzopardi, accusing him of having breached a court order by discussing Fenech’s unsuccessful bid for a pardon.
 Fenech’s lawyers, Gianluca Caruana Curran, Marion Camilleri and Charles Merceica, argued that during the interview with Lovin Malta, Azzopardi had committed a “flagrant breach” of a court order, by speaking about a Fenech’s pardon request and by telling the interviewer that “the evidence that was legally collected, point towards Yorgen Fenech alone as being the person who commissioned the murder”.
 Apart from ordering the interview to be edited, the judge asked that the Attorney General and Azzopardi be notified so that they could make written submissions. The judge is expected to hear oral submissions from the parties on 5 September when she could take further steps should it be necessary.
 Azzopardi is the lawyer of the Caruana Galizia family.
 Three men – Vince Muscat, George Degiorgio and Alfred Degiorgio – have already been sentenced to prison after admitting that they carried out the murder. Another two – Robert Agius and Jamie Vella – are facing charges for having supplied the bomb that was placed inside Caruana Galizia’s car.  ",Kurt Sansone ,court_and_police

‘I have never even met Muscat’: Auditor facing criminal charges slams inquiry,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/i-never-even-met-muscat-auditor-facing-criminal-charges-slams-inquiry.1092245,05-10-2024,007701.png,"An auditor accused of forming part of a criminal association with Joseph Muscat has slammed the charges leveled against him.
 In a Facebook post, Steward auditor Chris Spiteri said he has never even met the ex-prime minister “in person”, let alone facilitated trading in influence.
 Spiteri said during the course of his audits of Steward, “I have never known that any criminal association exists”.
 “No bribery or money laundering have also ever come to my knowledge during all this time. I have been accused of facilitating trading in influence for Joseph Muscat, Konrad Mizzi and Keith Schembri - the truth is that I have never even met these individuals in person, let alone facilitating anything,” Spiteri said.
 Spiteri is among over 30 individuals and companies set to face charges in connection with the hospital scandal, including Muscat, his chief of staff Keith Schembri and ex-health minister Konrad Mizzi.
 The auditor echoed Muscat’s and the government's criticism of the probe, saying “a lot of money has been spent on a magisterial inquiry which has done none other than fabricate lies and a sensational story for partisan motives.”
 The auditor said he risks losing his clients, employees and work due to “what has been said about me”.
 “Thirty years of hard work as an auditor and all my credibility wiped out in a few days of reporting by the media. It is shameful for the judiciary to pick on normal persons like myself and try to destroy their life,” Spiteri said.
 
 Spiteri said he had given his version of events during the inquiry and explained in detail the work he carried out as an auditor.
 “The magistrate asked me why I was in possession of a lot of knowledge about Vitals/Steward.
 “The answer is because as auditor I am actually paid to ask questions and gather information which I could use to produce good accounts.
 “Instead she and her Irish court experts interpreted this as being for ulterior motives. I have now been served with a freezing order on my assets and bank accounts, which has hampered my work as an auditor in a big way,” Spiteri said.
 He accused the magistrate and “her Irish court experts” of incorrectly interpreting his knowledge about Vitals/Steward as meaning he had “ulterior motives”.
 “I am also one of the persons with the largest list of criminal charges related to the case. My reputation has been tarnished and my human rights violated.
 “I will seek redress in the courts when the time comes and also prove my innocence. I have been treated in a very unjust way,” Spiteri said.
 Apart from the money-laundering charges, Spiteri is also alleged to have filed false declarations and taken false oaths, as well as divulging confidential material and under-declaring the income made by Vitals investors such as Shaukat Ali.
 He is the the subject of a freezing order against his assets up to a maximum of €30 million.

Updated | Vitals charges pushed back by a week after prosecutors contest notification argument,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/129668/vitals_charges_pushed_back_by_a_week_after_prosecutors_accuse_defence_of_misleading_the_court,10-06-2024,007711.png,"The Vitals Global Healthcare scandal-related re-arraignment of former deputy prime minister Chris Fearne, Central Bank Governor and former finance minister Edward Scicluna and 13 others has been pushed back to next week, in view of an application filed by the prosecution.
 The 15 defendants were originally summoned to be charged in court on 29 May, but at 8pm, some 11 hours into the arraignment, the proceedings were declared null after the lawyers representing one of the defendants - law firm DF Advocates - claimed that the firm had not been validly notified with amended charges.
  This claim is now being challenged in an application that was filed by prosecutors from the Office of the Attorney General, who point out that the lawyers representing DF Advocates had themselves declared that they were appearing on its behalf at the very beginning of the sitting, at 11am. The prosecutors are arguing that the firm appeared to have decided, at 8pm, that it was no longer  represented and had raised this issue with the court.
 The application asks the court to declare that, contrary to the submissions made by the defence, DF Advocates had, in fact, been legally represented and implies that the the court had been misled.
 The prosecutors are expected to argue that the ramifications of DF Advocates being protected from prosecution simply because it is a law firm and not a company would be far-reaching, and that this would potentially create a loophole whereby money laundering can be carried out through a firm, with no one being answerable for that conduct.
 The removal of a separate company with a similar name, DF Corporate Advisory, from the charge sheet had nothing to do with DF Advocates, argued the prosecutors, requesting that the law firm remain on the charge sheet and that the court rescind its declaration of nullity - and to order the case to continue from where it had left off.
  
 Magistrate rebukes prosecutors over the timing of their application 
 In a sternly-worded decree adjourning the sitting, that had originally been intended to take place tomorrow, till Monday morning in order to consider the prosecution’s requests, Magistrate Leonard Caruana rebuked the prosecution for filing the request on Thursday, before a public holiday  and a weekend, and so close to the date of the next sitting. The magistrate warned the parties that if something like this were to happen again, he would not be taking judicial notice of the application.

 Qala Saints FC player Manuel Xerri and Żebbuġ Rovers goalkeeper Leonard Camilleri appeared before a Magistrate's Court in Gozo this week charged with sports corruption.
 It followed an investigation into a GFA Division One match between Nadur Youngsters and Qala Saints at the Gozo Stadium in March, which ended in a 1-1 draw. 
 Nadur Youngsters took the GFA Division One title, topping the table, two points ahead of Qala Saints. 
 But the two footballers are accused of attempting to bribe Nadur's goalkeeper Steve Sultana to let Qala Saints win the title.
 On March 5 Sultana was allegedly contacted by Camilleri, a former reserve goalkeeper with the Nadur club. 
 In that WhatsApp call, Camilleri allegedly passed on a message from Qala Saints FC who were offering Sultana a government job if he handed them the league. 
 That offer happened before the two teams were to face each other in a match on March 17, the court was told. 
 Camilleri was allegedly directed to pass on the message by Qala Saints FC player Xerri. 
 But Sultana informed his club president, lawyer Chris Said, about the attempted match-fixing offer. 
 Said in turn alerted the MFA integrity officer, lawyer Herman Mula, who subsequently spoke to Sultana, confirming the alleged attempted bribe. 
 The police were alerted and criminal investigations kicked off. 
 On Tuesday, Camilleri, 39 and Xerri, 31, both from Xewkija were charged under various provisions of the Prevention of Corruption in Sport Act, pleading not guilty to the charges. 
 Article 4 of that Act states that “whosoever engages in the manipulation of a sporting event ….shall, on conviction be liable to imprisonment for a period of not more than three years and to a fine (multa) from €5,000 to €30,000 or to both such fine and imprisonment.”
 Punishment cannot be probation or a suspended sentence.
 Inspector Wayne Rodney Borg testified about the investigations leading up to the charges against the two players. 
 The charges come after a joint investigation, conducted by the MFA Integrity Office and the police. Both players were suspended amid parallel disciplinary proceedings against Qala Saints FC. 
 The case continues. 
 Lawyer Herman Mula appeared parte civile for the MFA.

 Uzbek national Khabib Adizov, 29, who holds a Finnish residence permit, was arraigned before magistrate Jean Paul Grech on Monday, accused of criminal damage. Inspector Antonello Magri explained that Adizov had been stopped by RIU officers who observed that he was drunk. Unable to communicate with the man due to the language barrier, the officers took him to the Paola police station drunk tank.
  By 11:15 pm, he had recovered sufficiently to remember how to speak English and had been allowed to leave the station.
 But Adizov returned to the police station around 30 minutes later to collect his phone, thinking that he had left it there by mistake. After being told that it was not there, he had angrily punched a door, causing minor damage to it and was arrested close to midnight.
 In court, Monday, through a Russian-language interpreter, Adizov told the court that his phone had been taken away by the police while he was being searched.
 Inspector Antonello Magri told the court that the police did not have the device - and neither had Adizov, at the time when he had been arrested and searched at the Paola police station.
 Adizov pleaded guilty to the charge of criminal damage which, the court was told, would cost some €27 to repair.
 During submissions on punishment, Inspector Magri recommended a suspended sentence, as Adizov had cooperated with the police and was already booked to leave Malta on a flight to Riga, departing later this week.
 Finding Adizov guilty as charged, the court sentenced him to six months in prison, which would be suspended for two years.

Protected Black Stork shot at Girgenti: BirdLife Malta,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/protected-black-stork-shot-girgenti-birdlife-malta.1100286,30-10-2024,"007793.png,007794.png,007795.png","BirdLife Malta recovered a young Black Stork with severe leg injuries from a reservoir near the prime minister’s official summer residence in Girgenti on Tuesday morning.
 The NGO said the bird was illegally shot by nearby hunters.
 It is the second stork that formed part of a small flock and that has been shot.
 The other black stork was reportedly shot in Ta’ Ċenċ, Gozo.
  In a statement, BLM said the Black Stork (Ciconia nigra) - a rare visitor to Malta - was a protected species under Maltese law. It was also afforded the highest protection under Annex 1 of the EU Birds Directive and Annex A of the EU Wildlife Trade Regulations.
 “Illegal hunting of these species continues due to high demand resulting from two amnesties on taxidermy bird collections granted in the past, which remain largely unverified to this day,” said BLM’s Head of Conservation, Nick Barbara.
 In 1997, the then Labour Government granted the first amnesty, with hunters declaring close to 240,000 taxidermy birds.
 In 2003, the then Nationalist Government granted another amnesty, with hunters declaring an additional 282,000 taxidermy birds.
 This brings the total of taxidermy birds to over half a million.
 ""The Maltese authorities began a verification process, but it was never completed. As a result, it has never been confirmed if hunters possess the taxidermy birds they declared in these two amnesty lists.
 ""Consequently, some hunters claimed to have certain bird species in their collections that they did not actually have, becoming practically a wish list of birds before their lists were verified. This allowed the illegal hunting of protected birds to continue, reignited once more with recent permissions allowing hunters to transfer such wish lists between them,"" the eNGO said.

 They were charged with wilfully setting the vehicles on fire, wilful damage to third-party property and involuntary damage to a third vehicle.
  They were also charged with disturbing the repose of residents and wilfully breaching the public peace. 
 Both pleaded guilty but judgment will be delivered at a later date. 
 A request for bail was made with the prosecution objecting. The two men were remanded in custody pending further information as to the restitution of damages so that punishment can be properly calibrated. 
 A court-appointed expert will determine that amount, which according to the victim amounts to roughly €50,000. 
 Lawyers for the victim stated that he is only interested in recuperating the damages sustained. However, they emphasised that hinged on the arsonists showing an actual intention to pay back the damages before the final judgment, as to date the full amount is still due.

Handball association says safety rules bar wheelchair-using teen from playing the sport,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/132488/handball_association_says_safety_rules_bar_wheelchairusing_teen_from_playing_the_sport,27-11-2024,007521.png,"Thomas Mifsud, a wheelchair user with spina bifida and brittle bone disease, has been at the centre of a legal dispute with the Malta Handball Association, which argues his participation violates safety regulations.

 16-year-old athlete Thomas Mifsud, who has spina bifida, was barred from serving as a reserve handball player due to his wheelchair, despite showing promise during a trial with friends and being invited to train with the Kavallier Handball Club.

                     However, the Malta Handball Association (MHA) insists that while his inclusion is welcomed, participation must adhere to international handball rules, which prohibit hard objects that could pose a risk to other players.

 Thomas’s parents, Nicolette and Sam Mifsud, argue that their research found no evidence suggesting these rules exclude wheelchair users.

 An official letter was sent to the Court on behalf of the Malta Handball Association. In the letter, lawyers Stefano Filletti and Maurice Meli referred to a judicial protest filed on 8 November 2024, explaining that handball rules prohibit hard objects, including wheelchairs, to minimise the risk of serious injuries during matches.

 The letter goes on to mention that the introduction of a wheelchair into a full contact sport can lead to serious injuries to both the wheelchair user and the person making contact with the wheelchair, especially in the event of a fall.

 Furthermore, the International Handball Federation, which is the federation that regulates the sport of handball on a global level, had the opportunity to comment on this matter.

 ""Considering the construction and material of a wheelchair, it can be established that a wheelchair is a dangerous object that could pose a risk for the player in the wheelchair and other players during a match of indoor handball. Therefore, using a wheelchair in indoor handball violates the IHF Regulations on Protective Equipment and Accessories and by association the IHF rules for indoor handball,” the federation said. 

 Filletti and Meli go on to say that, contrary to what Mifsud’s parents were alleging, “it is dangerous for the athlete in the wheelchair and the other athletes”. Further to this, Mifsud also suffers from brittle bone disease. “A fall, contact with an athlete, or even a bad throw of the ball can lead to serious injuries.""

 “This danger to the athlete, even on a personal level, is unacceptable for an association that is responsible for the health of athletes during the game.”     ",Jordan Pace ,court_and_police

Man accused of setting fire to his former partner's car denied bail,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/man-denied-bail-setting-fire-former-partner-car.1093811,06-11-2024,007529.png,"A suspected arsonist was remanded in custody on Tuesday as he faces charges of having set fire to his ex-girlfriend's car over a custody dispute.
 The man was identified as the person who approached a parked car in a Ħamrun alley, carrying a jerry can shortly before the vehicle burst into flames.
 The incident took place in the early hours of June 6 when district police were alerted to the fire. Joint investigations by the arson unit and the Ħamrun police soon confirmed that this was indeed a case of arson.
 CCTV footage from the suspected crime scene showed a person approaching the car with a jerry can in hand at around 3 am.
 The suspect was soon identified as John Joseph Debono, a 35-year-old upholsterer from Naxxar, who was known to police.
 The car in question was being used by Debono's former partner but was registered in another person's name. 
 On Monday, police obtained an arrest warrant and Debono was taken into custody yesterday afternoon.
 On Tuesday he was charged with setting the car on fire, wilful damage to third party property, wilful breach of public peace and disturbing the repose of residents.
 He was also charged with negligent and dangerous driving on Monday, driving without a licence and insurance cover as well as breaching a number of traffic regulations.
 He was further charged with harassing his ex, causing her to fear violence, insulting and threatening her and misusing electronic communications equipment.
 Other charges related to allegedly breaching bail and relapsing.
 The prosecution explained that prior to the arson attack, the accused had been engaged in some argument with his former partner.
 Just a week before the incident, the accused had sent his ex a message concerning access to the former couple’s three-year-old daughter.
 That message ran along the lines, “Are you going to keep up the farce, not letting me see the girl? Now we’ll see.”
 More messages followed after the arson, the prosecutor explained, adding that the accused had also been outdoors when he had been previously bound by a curfew.
 The accused pleaded not guilty.
 A request for bail was objected to for various reasons including the fact that civilian witnesses including the victim and the car owner, were still to testify.
 However, there were no eyewitnesses of the arson.
 Defence lawyer Roberto Spiteri countered that evidence consisted mainly of messages and footage which were all preserved.
 Moreover, a tainted record sheet was not a sufficient basis to deprive a person of his liberty.
 On a humanitarian note, the accused had the sole care and custody of a 13-year-old child he had fathered with another previous partner.
 After hearing submissions the court, presided over by magistrate Yana Micallef Stafrace, turned down the request for bail.
 AG lawyer Joseph Camilleri Azarov together with Inspectors Jeffrey Scicluna and Mario Xiberras prosecuted.

 The proprietor of a popular chain of supermarkets has been left frustrated by police inaction in prosecuting shoplifting and said they are “shirking their duties” by doing so.
 Chef’s Choice managing director, Joe Mizzi told Times of Malta that, as a rule, the company insists on proceeding with legal action against shoplifters. However, this is becoming increasingly difficult, he said, when it feels like the police do not take these incidents seriously enough, with one case remaining pending for over a year.
 In a series of correspondence seen by Times of Malta, Mizzi has continued to follow up on this particular incident, which took place on May 4, 2023, but his requests for more information appear to have fallen on deaf ears.
 During the incident in question, six bottles of alcohol were stolen from the chain’s Żabbar shop, with a total value of €67.92.
 The very same day, a police report was filed, with Mizzi saying that he provided the police with CCTV evidence, as well as the contact details of the employees who had witnessed the events. Although Mizzi was told the suspects were identified, prosecution has not progressed, despite several letters sent by Mizzi’s lawyer to the police, as well as Mizzi writing to the police commissioner directly.
 “It’s very irritating because it feels like the police are shirking their duty to take people to court,” Mizzi said.
 “In the Żabbar case, we sent them CCTV, anything we could think of, and I wrote to the police inspector and the police commissioner but still nothing,” he continued.
 “It bothers me because it encourages more theft. Because they’ve gotten away with it really, they know that nobody has taken action.”
 According to Mizzi, this is not the first time he has faced resistance by the police to prosecute petty crimes like shoplifting.
  On another occasion at his shop in Gżira, Mizzi said his employees stopped a person from stealing and made him wait for the police to arrive, only to be allegedly told by officers that there was no need for the matter to escalate because the person had agreed to pay for the stolen items.
  “Even my employees feel demoralised about this,” Mizzi continued, “they feel like their efforts went to waste.”
 Mizzi said that, while he is aware it is costing him more than it is worth pursuing this cause, he feels that a point must be made.
 “I know that, with the amounts they stole it’s almost not worth going through the hassle, but I think that it is the principle of the matter,” he said.
 “The police are meant to serve their citizens and I feel like they are not protecting us.”
 Replying to questions sent by Times of Malta, a police spokesperson said that the Żabbar shoplifting case was successfully investigated and charges were duly issued. The first sitting is scheduled for September 19.
 Questions asking why Mizzi was not kept in the loop about developments and a request for comment on Mizzi’s feelings about his treatment by the police remained unanswered.

Man accused of sexually assaulting woman after offering to help her retrieve stolen bag,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/131116/man_accused_of_sexually_assaulting_woman_after_offering_to_help_her_retrieve_stolen_bag,09-09-2024,007553.png,"A man has denied charges relating to a nightmarish sexual assault allegedly committed on a woman in Msida last Tuesday.
 Afewerki Teklesembet Yohannes, 41, an Eritrean man living in Pieta, appeared before Magistrate Donatella Frendo Dimech on Monday, accused of having used a weapon to force the woman to submit to a non-consensual act of a sexual nature at a bar in Msida on September 3.
  He was also accused of holding the woman against her will, subjecting her to unwanted sexual behaviour, causing her to fear that violence would be used against her, slightly injuring her and stealing her smart watch.
 Police Inspector Michael Vella, who is prosecuting together with lawyer Nadia Ciappara from the Office of the Attorney General, told the court that the woman had approached a police patrol to tell them that she had “just been raped”. The woman had then pointed out the defendant to the police.
 The police were told how, earlier that evening, the woman and her boyfriend had been at Rocky Beach in Paceville, when their bag disappeared. A man had approached the couple to tell them that he could help, telling them to go to a bar in Msida so that the person who took the bag could return it to her.
 He also told the woman that if she was Colombian they would give her the bag, but not if her boyfriend was European, so the boyfriend agreed to stay behind. He gave the woman his phone and told her to call the emergency number if anything happened.
 Inside the Msida bar where she was supposed to meet the man, the woman felt something was off, but when she tried to leave she found that the door had been locked. The man, Yohannes, had then allegedly grabbed her breasts and tore off her smartwatch.
 Hearing the scuffle from behind the door, the woman’s boyfriend had kicked the door open and rescued her.
 He had found the defendant carrying a hammer and the woman’s mobile phone, which the defendant had handed over to the man immediately.
 After his arrest, Yohannes was taken to hospital to be treated for hand injuries. When he was subsequently questioned, the man had issued an audiovisual statement in which he had denied everything, insisting that it had been the couple who had approached him in St. Julians.
 But as his arrest was going to expire soon , the man was released on police bail that evening and rearrested when he returned to the police station the next day.
 The man pleaded not guilty to the charges.
 Lawyer Franco Debono, assisting the defendant together with lawyer Adreana Zammit requested bail, arguing that the man had been living in Malta for the past 13 years and was gainfully employed.
 Inspector Vella informed the court that although the man was registered with jobsplus as a self-employed restaurant owner, no restaurant was specified, because the work address provided was his home address.
 Debono insisted that the “most important thing” was the fact that after he was released on police bail he had obeyed his bail conditions and kept his appointment at the police station. “We have an address, police bail, a fixed address,” said the lawyer.
 Magistrate Frendo Dimech pointed out that he had claimed to have full time employment but didn’t know where he worked, which opened up another can of worms for the defendant. “He said that he worked in construction earlier today! Who does he work in construction with?”
 The defence explained that Yohannes used to work in construction and was “now preparing to open his own restaurant.”

 The court turned down the Attorney General’s appeal against the five accused, and a travel agency manager, who were acquitted in 2021 over alleged fraudulent refunds on flight expenses.
 Paul Cortis, general manager at KD Travel Services Limited, Oreste Alessandro, former executive secretary of the Local Councils Association, Dolores Borg, former Birkirkara mayor, Noel Formosa, mayor of San Lawrenz, former Labour MEP and former Qrendi vice-mayor Claudette Abela Baldacchino, and Michael Cohen, former president of the Local Councils Association, had been charged with complicity in the fraudulent racket dating back to 2010.
  They were also charged with misappropriation to the detriment of the European Commission and the government of Malta, complicity in making a false declaration in a public document and committing an offence as public officials.
 All protested their innocence from the start.
 In 2007, the EU’s Committee of Regions flagged potential irregularities by Maltese delegates travelling on EU-related trips when claiming refunds for flight tickets.
 The EU anti-fraud agency OLAF sent its officials from to Malta to carry out spot-checks at the travel agency in Sliema, leading to criminal charges. They were cleared of the charges in 2021, together with former Mellieha mayor Guzeppi Borg who has since passed away.
  In its appeal, the AG argued that the defendants knew that the invoices presented for reimbursement, did not give the amounts actually paid, because the tickets were being issued at a discount while the LCA claimed a refund of the full amount they were entitled to.
 The difference from the full-price refund on flexible business class tickets, was retained by the LCA. The former president of the Maltese delegation, Ian Micallef, said the refunds helped it cope with the additional expenses for overseas meetings, since government subventions were insufficient.
 Micallef said the LCA took the advice of its auditor, safe in the knowledge it was not doing anything illegal. A second advice sought by the Auditor General from a well-known auditing firm, found no irregularity in the way discounts and refunds were being managed.
 The handwritten invoices with the full amounts were submitted along with the boarding passes showing the discounted prices to the Committee of the Regions. No irregularity was flagged at that stage either.
 This was a typical Malta example of “getting the best out of a situation,” Mr Justice Aaron Bugeja said when delivering judgment at appeal stage.
 He said all had been done above board and those involved relied on the professional advice which they had no reason to doubt, with all defendants believing that they were not doing anything illegal.  ",Matthew Vella ,court_and_police

 Ben Alaya Mehdi - a 23-year-old Tunisian who has been studying in Malta for the past nine months - landed in hot water over the incident which broke out at around 5am on Sunday. 
 Minutes later, officers at the St Julian’s police station received a report about the altercation and were told a man was grievously injured when punched during the row. 
 The suspected aggressor was identified and arrested. 
 On Monday, he was charged with the solitary offence of grievous bodily harm. 
 His lawyer Josette Sultana informed the court that the accused was registering an admission. 
 The court, presided over by Magistrate Rachel Montebello, explained to the youth that this was a serious crime liable to a term of imprisonment. 
 After being granted time to reconsider, the youth confirmed his plea. 
 In light of that early guilty plea, his untainted criminal record and full cooperation with police, the prosecution did not seek an effective term of imprisonment, pointing out that a suspended sentence would be appropriate. 
 “He [the accused] actually hit him [the victim] by mistake,” added the defence. “The other guy was in the wrong place at the wrong time.” 
 Although the accused did hit the victim, he never intended to do so, said the lawyer. 
 “Are they friends,”asked the magistrate.
 “No, they never even met,” explained Sultana. 
 After the incident, the accused even accompanied the victim to hospital and to the police. 
 In light of those submissions, the court declared the accused guilty and condemned him to a one-year jail term suspended for two years, warning the youth about the implications of that sentence. 
 The court also issued a two-year restraining order against the accused.

Teenage girl recounts brutal assault and blackmail in gang-related case,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/132644/teenage_girl_recounts_brutal_assault_and_blackmail_in_gangrelated_case_,06-12-2024,007564.png,"A 15-year-old girl has testified in a harrowing case involving a gang attack, blackmail, and a school bully's alleged demands for money, with the court decreeing that there is sufficient evidence for the accused to stand trial. 

 The girl testified about being attacked by a gang led by a 13-year-old school bully and her 21-year-old boyfriend, describing a series of threats, extortion, and a violent ambush. 

                     The alleged victim described a brutal assault allegedly orchestrated by a female 13-year-old school bully, and the bully’s 21-year-old boyfriend, Jake Dalli Balzan. The victim told police she was ambushed by five individuals, including a schoolmate who had previously bullied her. 

 During her testimony through video-conference, the victim recalled that her problems began just three days into the start of this school year, when a student that the victim only knew by sight offered a line of cocaine. “I did not accept because I don’t do such things”, adding, “I’m a good girl.” 

 The next day, the 13-year-old bully allegedly called her whilst they were in the school toilets, drew out a black knife, and pressed it against her stomach. The bully demanded €110, saying, “as from tomorrow you must bring me money.” 

 The confrontation left the victim in a state of panic, not knowing where to get the money from. She decided to take the cash from her 18-year-old brother’s savings, who was saving up for a car. She continued by saying that, in order to fulfill the demands of the group of individuals that requested, she stole money from her father as well.  

 In her testimony, the victim said that she had skipped school for a while. However, despite her absence, the bully continued to pursue her through a fake Instagram profile. She said the 13-year-old and her boyfriend, Dalli Balzan, showed up near her family home in Mqabba at some point in October to demand money. She gave them between €40 to €50. On 2 November, the bully and her boyfriend came a second time, where the victim handed them €80. 

 On 15 November 2024, the bully and her boyfriend came for a third time. However, this time, they were accompanied by a third person who was later indified as the same person who had held a gun to the victim’s head in the alleged attack on 23 November 2024 accompanied the bully and her boyfriend. For a third time, she handed the group money, this time the victim said that she “gave them €90”.  She had received a message threatening that she would “end up very badly” unless she gave the money. 

 The victim told the court that she also paid money to her bully at school on 16 November and 17 November, stating that she was “absolutely certain” about the dates she was providing. “What if I tell you that 16 and 17 November were a Saturday and a Sunday?”, asked defence lawyer David Bonello. The victim responded by saying: “I’m not 100% ... but somewhere around those dates.” 

 She confirmed she received pocket money from her father. When asked by Bonello why she didn’t use that money to pay off her bullies, the girl said there were “many other demands for money” which she had not testified about because she was not sure of the dates. 

 Lawyer Joseph Borda told the Court that he believed that it was the victim who had created the fake Instagram profile. “Who me? No,” replied the girl.  

 A last message on the fake Instagram profile demanded €400. On 23 November 2024, she went outside her home to tell her bullies that she could not cough up that amount. The girl headed to an alley just off her street where she usually meets the group, where she saw a male figure, dressed in black, wearing a black balaclava. “I recognized him as the one who came with Jake and [the bully].” 

 He demanded the €400 and when she told him she did not have that much, he pulled a small gun from his trousers pocket and placed it against her head. She said the male with the gun dropped “three gold bullets” from his pocket when he pulled his mobile phone out of his pocket. “I’m going to give you a chance until next week. If you don’t get them I’ll kill you and cut you up in pieces,” said the man wearing the black balaclava. 

 As she walked out of the alley, she saw five masked persons waiting for her. The girl said that she heard a person say “Hey shit!”, to which she added that “Then they pounced on me.” There were three females, including the 13-year-old, and two males, one of which she identified as Dalli Balzan. The other male “had an Arab accent,” she told the court. 

 Whilst testifying, she said that she could see Balzan’s facial piercings through a balaclava he was wearing. She also spotted his tattoo and recognised his voice as he called out, “come on beat her.” The victim was unable to describe that tattoo or say on which hand it was. “I hardly knew where I was going,” she said. 

 According to her testimony, the 13-year-old tried to stab her three times with a penknife, while Dalli Balzan punched her head and kicked her in the stomach, while another girl allegedly kicked her. 

 She said her aggressors fled when they spotted an elderly man in the road. The victim walked towards that man and asked for help. According to the victim, the man got into his car and left. “He didn’t help me,” testified the girl. A passerby, who happened to be the mother of a friend, assisted her and called the police. 

 The victim said that, on 24 November 2024, Dalli Balzan had texted her to apologise while she was in hospital following the stabbing, “I’m sorry. It won’t happen again.” She deleted that message because she was scared of showing that he had “admitted.” 

 “So why did you immediately mention his name to the police that same morning in hospital?”asked the defence, pointing out that the girl’s statements were rather contradictory. “I was scared,” the victim replied. 

 After the long session the court, presided over by Magistrate Kevan Azzopardi, decreed that there were sufficient prima facie evidence for the accused to stand trial on indictment. 

 The case continues.

Teen who allegedly planned bomb outside parliament pleads insanity,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/suspected-teen-bomber-files-insanity-plea.1094094,18-06-2024,007579.png,"An 18-year-old caught with a garage full of explosive material and plans to bomb key areas including parliament has pleaded insanity.
 David Brincat of Santa Venera entered the plea in court on Tuesday, with his lawyers saying he was not in a sound state of mind at the time of the offence.
 The court upheld that plea and appointed three psychiatrists to assess Brincat’s mental state over the past year.
 Brincat was caught after an explosive device was detonated inside a garbage bin outside Labour HQ earlier this month.
 The device exploded at around 2am and nobody was injured, but the incident triggered a police investigation that led them to a garage where Brincat was living.
 Inside, they found significant amounts of chemicals and materials used to make explosives.
 Further investigation led police to believe Brincat had also placed explosives outside two pharmacies in St Venera and Birkirkara and had plans to target other sites, including parliament.
 He was subsequently charged with a raft of serious crimes, including terrorism-related charges.
 Brincat, who was held for some days at Mount Carmel Hospital after his arrest, was subsequently certified by a psychiatrist as fit for interrogation and trial.
 He returned to court on Tuesday, when he filed his insanity plea.
 Prosecutors told the court that Brincat appears to have started concretely planning his bombs and acquiring materials to manufacture them in May 2023. Certain ideas and discussions with third parties extended beyond that year….but that was more about ideology,” prosecuting inspector Lydon Zammit told the court. 
 Psychiatrists Christian Sant, Anton Grech and Nigel Camilleri must now assess Brincat’s mental state stretching back to that date and report back to the court. In the meantime, legal time limits for the compilation of evidence stage of proceedings will remain frozen.
 A clean-shaven Brincat sat silently throughout the hearing, wearing a greyish-brown suit.
 He was remanded to the forensic unit at Mount Carmel, walking quietly out of the courtroom and gesturing briefly. His eyes lit up momentarily as he waved to anxious relatives seated at the back of the hall.
 The case was deferred to next month when the experts are expected to report on Brincat’s mental state at the time of the offences.
 If they conclude that Brincat was insane at the time when he committed crimes, the records are sent to the Attorney General, who may appeal. Time limits are short.
 If the experts conclude that he was not insane, the court will proceed with the hearing of witnesses. The first one will be one of the lead investigators, prosecuting inspector Zammit, who informed the court that his testimony would take up an hour or more.

 The man, who told the court that he worked as a truck driver, was also accused of misusing electronic telecommunications equipment to coerce or threaten his ex-partner, insulting or threatening her and recidivism.  
 He pleaded not guilty to the charges. 
  Inspector Sherona Buhagiar, prosecuting, explained that in spite of the various protection orders which prohibited any contact between them, the defendant had persisted in contacting the woman, and would threaten her over the phone.
 Bail was requested by his defence lawyer, Marija Sara Vella Gafà, who told the court that the victim, with whom the defendant had fathered a child, was “apparently unable to decide” whether she wanted a relationship with the defendant or not.
 The woman would herself repeatedly turn up at his front door with the child in tow when she did want the relationship, but would file police reports against him for breaching the protection order when she didn’t, said the lawyer.

Dismembered body found in suitcase: Police rule out murder charges - for now,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/dismembered-body-found-suitcase-police-rule-murder-charges-now.1102457,14-12-2024,,"Updated 9.30am with suspect's name
 A man found chopped up inside a suitcase was already dead when his body was cut into pieces, the police believe.
 That conclusion means police will not be pressing homicide charges against the prime suspect in the case at this stage.
 Instead, the 43-year-old will face charges of promoting a criminal organiation, trafficking drugs, criminal association, money laundering, hiding a body and trying to cover up a crime.
 The suspect is Andres Leonardo Gamboa Duran, 43 and from Cucuta, Colombia. Duran is being arraigned on Saturday morning.
 In a press conference held on Saturday morning, police superintendent and lead investigator Keith  Arnaud said the victim was already dead when his hands and feet were cut off. There were no external signs of violence, he added.
 An autopsy carried out earlier this week concluded that the victim most likely died of asphyxiation. But it was not conclusive, Arnaud noted. While police would not be filing murder charges at this stage, that could change if new evidence came to light.
 The victim, who is also believed to be a Colombian national, has not yet been conclusively identified though police are working on a number of leads.
 Investigators are also working to establish how the victim and prime suspect were connected, and why 101 capsules of cocaine found in the victim’s stomach were not extracted before the body was dumped.
 “It’s still a bit early, but we have a few  theories,” Arnaud told journalists when asked that question.
 Arnaud provided some further detail about the gruesome discovery, made on Monday afternoon in Gżira.
 The suitcase was first flagged to authorities by people on a boat, who saw it bobbing at sea.
 Inside, authorities found the remains of a man who was not wearing any clothes save for an adult nappy. His hands and feet were cut off and stuffed into plastic bags.
 Police tracked down the suspect and the shop where he is believed to have bought the axe and suitcase used to dispose of the body.
 When they moved in to arrest him, they found him with a Portuguese man. There were many items related to drug trafficking in the property and the Portuguese man is to face drug-related criminal charges.
 Police also searched another property in Msida, where they believe the body was moved from. Officers found the axe in that property, Arnaud added.

"Benefit fraudsters cite Grixti, but say they didn't pay him",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/beneficiaries-benefits-scandal-cite-grixti-say-didnt-pay.1097837,09-09-2024,007639.png,"A number of fraudulent beneficiaries in the social benefits racket investigation had cited the name of doctor Silvio Grixti but did not say they had paid the former Labour MP, a court heard on Monday. 
 Grixti is one of five people charged with playing a key role in a massive disability racket that is believed to have cost taxpayers as much as €6 million. 
 Last year, Times of Malta revealed how Grixti, a popular family doctor, was implicated in a years-long racket to help hundreds of people fraudulently receive monthly disability benefits they were not entitled to. 
 Evidence indicates Grixti provided false medical documents to help people, often hailing from Labour strongholds, to receive social benefits averaging €450 monthly for severe disabilities they did not suffer from.
 On Monday, three police inspectors who pieced together evidence as they dug deeper and deeper into the massive social benefits fraud explained how each focused on different suspects behind the racket, linking names to amounts received for their alleged role in the scam. 
 
 One line of investigation focused on certificates found in Grixti’s laptop, which was seized by police during a search at his Għaxaq clinic, said inspector Shaun Friggieri when proceedings against the former politician and four co-defendants resumed. 
 Police are charging Grixti with having allegedly played a central role by providing applicants with false medical certificates to secure them the severe disability allowance after they appeared before a medical board. 
 Co-defendants Roger Agius, Emmanuel Spagnol, Dustin Caruana and Luke Saliba allegedly acted as agents or go-betweens, raking in payments from successful beneficiaries. 
 The inspectors explained how different beneficiaries were grouped under different headings representing their alleged link to each of the defendants. The police also include the amounts received by the defendant and the amounts forked out by the Social Security Department to the fraudulent beneficiary.
 Besides names found on Grixti’s laptop, police unearthed other beneficiaries through handwritten ledgers subsequently found at Spagnol’s home.
 Those ledgers, presented in evidence, also indicated sums allegedly split between Spagnol and Grixti.
 Some beneficiaries opted for their right to silence. 
 
 Three of those investigated by Friggieri named Agius as the person to whom they handed money or as the one who intervened to help them secure the severe disability allowance. 
 Caruana did not feature in those ledgers and there appeared to have been no relationship between him and Spagnol, said Friggieri. 
 Inspectors Wayne Rodney Borg and Andy Rotin, who worked jointly on the investigation, said some beneficiaries told police that they had gone to Grixti. Others got an application for the allowance from him. 
 Such an application had to be signed by a medical specialist and “Grixti was not”, explained Borg. 
 Various beneficiaries named Caruana as the person they had handed money to for the false documents. 
 The Social Security Department initially flagged a number of suspicious certificates which appeared to be “identical scanned copies, all presenting the same illness, namely epilepsy” and all signed and stamped by the same medical specialist.
 When the suspected fraudsters were charged in court, all said they had obtained the certificates from Saliba. 
 Several beneficiaries also said once their application was approved, they were expected to hand over the first year’s worth of benefits, usually amounting to some €5,000, to the person who procured the false documents.
 Asked by the court, presided over by Magistrate Rachel Montebello, whether beneficiaries who mentioned Grixti also mentioned they had paid him, Rotin replied that as far as his investigation was concerned, the answer was “no.”  
 He also informed the court that on July 16 at 11am, Agius released an audio-visual statement to the police in the presence of his lawyers, Jason Azzopardi and Alessandro Farrugia. 
 At the start of the hearing, Social Services Department director George Cremona confirmed that when the suspected cases emerged, the department had handed over all files to the police. 
 The police went back to the department, telling them to block all payments to those beneficiaries whose names were recorded in a spreadsheet-previously presented in evidence- and to demand a refund. 
 Agius, one of the defendants, had also received €43,398 in fraudulent payments from the department between June 2016 and November 2023. 
 The case continues. 
 AG lawyer Abigail Caruana Vella prosecuted together with inspectors Wayne R. Borg, Shaun Friggieri and Andy Rotin.

 The victim was taken to hospital after she suffered two stab wounds to her chest in the attack by a stranger on Wednesday.
 Fabian Medina Paira, 21, a Columbian national with no fixed address was charged in court on Friday with attempted murder, grievous bodily harm, breach of the peace and living a vagrant life. 
 He was allegedly caught on camera attacking the woman and was then traced to a car park in Pembroke, where he was arrested later that evening. 
 He answered no questions when he appeared in court.
 Prosecuting Inspector Shawn Pawney explained how police were alerted to the incident at a rocky beach in Triq il-Wilġa, St Julian’s at around 9am.
 A person who was with the victim told police about the attack, which involved a sharp, pointed weapon, possibly a knife. 
 The victim, who did not know her attacker, was taken to Mater Dei Hospital in imminent danger of dying and has had surgery.  
 She was able to communicate with police on Friday to confirm she did not know the accused, who also did not know his alleged victim. 
 It took investigators a whole day to trace footages all the way from the Dragonara beach to the car park at Pembroke where police spotted the man, matching the suspect.
 He wore identical clothes and his face was also recognizable, explained the prosecutor. 
 The suspect needed medical assistance before being taken into police custody. 
 Assisted by a Spanish speaking interpreter, the man, his face bruised and nose scarred, told his lawyer that “there are things here which I didn’t do.""
 Presiding magistrate Kevan Azzopardi explained to the accused his legal rights, including his right to silence.

 That was until he discovered the messages his former partner had sent to her friend about him, which he said hurt his feelings and caused him to react.
 Defense lawyer Franco Debono said that the man had admitted his guilt immediately and fully cooperated with the police and had shown remorse for his actions.
 The man told the police that he never had any intention of harming her and had no intention of contacting her further.

Commercial centre planned for site once slated for new Gozo law courts,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/commercial-centre-planned-site-slated-new-gozo-law-courts.1098049,13-09-2024,"007651.png,007652.png","A piazza that was set to be the site of the new Gozo Law Courts will instead house a commercial centre, according to recently submitted plans.
 On Sunday, the Gozo Regional Development Authority applied to build a roof-garden topped commercial centre in Pjazza l-Assedju ta' Ghawdex in Victoria. 
 The development will also house a four-storey underground car park and an Enemalta substation, the Planning Authority (PA) application (PA/06157/24) shows.
 The plans mark a change in direction for the square, which as recently as June was being prepped to house a new court building and, like the new proposal, a multi-storey car park.
 The move is a stumbling block in an ongoing saga to find new premises for Gozo’s law courts, which have poor health and safety standards and have maintenance and accessibility issues.
 According to the Gozo Regional Development Authority, the “main objective of the proposed project is to address the lack of parking spaces and open spaces in Victoria.”
  A tender document for the development of the piazza says a “significant increase in economic activity” had led to increased urbanisation, population growth, traffic and parking shortage – which the authority hopes to solve with its new car park and “some commercial space.""
 The tree-lined square, which at present is also used as a car park, will be cleared, excavated and see its trees felled to create the new parking area and “green space.”
 According to the authority, the proposal is in line with the Gozo Regional Development Strategy which includes 'providing further green spaces’, ‘rethinking mobility’, and ‘transforming streets towards people centred’ (sic).
 The development of the square will be fully privately funded, the tender document shows.
 But the decision puts the future of the Gozitan law courts – which for years have proven a point of contention – back in limbo.
 Last year, the government said it was considering eight bids from private individuals offering a site or building to house the new Gozo law court.
 The hunt for a new location for the courts kicked off in 2022 following years of complaints of humidity, flaking walls, ageing workstations and a lack of fire detectors, alarms and exit routes, among other issues.
 The current courts are also seen as too small, with Gozitan lawyers having gone on strike in the past over the conditions of the building where they spend most of their days.
 According to Avukati Għawdex, the current court building is inaccessible and small for the number of cases instituted in Gozo, where, sometimes, even the room designated for use by lawyers was taken over to hold sittings.
 In June 2022, the police issued criminal charges against two senior government officials over their failure to ensure minimum health and safety standards at the Gozo courthouse.

Man accused of threatening ex-wife breaks down in court after bail denied on daughter's birthday,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/130943/man_accused_of_threatening_exwife_breaks_down_in_court_after_bail_denied_on_daughters_birthday,29-08-2024,007653.png,"A man accused of threatening his ex-wife broke down in tears in the dock after being denied bail on domestic violence charges.
 The 38 year-old appeared in court before Magistrate Abigail Critien, charged with causing his ex-wife, with whom he has two children, that violence would be used against her or her property.
  The man is understood to have been arrested after his ex-wife reported him to the police,  claiming that he had breached an order issued by the court handling their divorce. It emerged in court that while collecting his children from the woman’s custody he had allegedly said that he would rather kill her than talk to her.
 After entering a not guilty plea, the man requested bail.
 Legal Procurator Peter Paul Zammit, defence counsel, argued that the defendant had obeyed the court’s orders in the civil proceedings between the couple.
 Zammit told the court that his client had ended up being held at the Forensic Unit in Mount Carmel Hospital after the arrest warrant was issued. He pointed out that a protection order could be issued to allay any fears of the defendant approaching the woman again.
 But after hearing the bail submissions by both sides, Magistrate Critien ordered the man to be remanded in custody, due to the fact that the victim had not yet testified, which meant there was a risk of the defendant tampering with evidence.
 “Am I going to prison?” the man asked after hearing this, before breaking down in tears. “It’s her birthday today,” he said of his daughter, before remarking that the woman “had warned me that she would ruin me,” as police officers attempted to calm him down.
 The man’s weeping intensified when the court imposed a protection order in favour of the woman, pending the outcome of these proceedings. The court ordered that the man’s access to his children should remain unaffected by the protection order.

As it happened: 'Funds derived from fraud' - Vitals case continues,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/live-blog-joseph-muscat-associates-back-court-vitals-case.1094191,20-06-2024,"007656.png,007657.png","The biggest and most complex court case of the year, so far, continued on Thursday as Joseph Muscat and another 13 individuals face corruption charges  in connection with the Vitals hospitals deal.
 The prosecution argued that numerous transactions related to the hospital project revealed a fraudulent scheme. Based on experts' advice, the magisterial inquiry recommended action against the accused without requiring further police investigation.
 The first part of the sitting revolved around the cyclotron project, which was meant to assist cancer patients. 
 Defence lawyers insisted that the cyclotron project was done, contradicting inquiry conclusions. But other witnesses said that the equipment is still in boxes. 
 Once again, at least one defence lawyer hit out at the prosecution for failing to question their clients before dragging them to court.
 1.45pm Today's sitting is over.
 The compilation of evidence will continue on Tuesday, June 25 at 9.30am.
 We'll bring you a wrap-up of today's proceedings shortly. 
 1.40pm Lawyer Dalli wants to know why nobody spoke to her client Taomac Ltd.
 ""It’s not credible to say that this company was simply being operated as a front. There is nothing tangible about Taomac. It is totally extraneous to VGH. It was Malta Enterprise that asked it to step out of the project. The experts’ report is totally void of any transaction, traces. This is immensely dangerous.
 ""Did anyone search Taomac’s offices, were any documents seized? Nothing at all. Yet, Taomac was simply charged and we've ended up here in court. We insist that there is no case to answer as far as Taomac is concerned,” argues Dalli animatedly. 
 1.30pm You might be rightly confused over the names of individuals and companies being named in court.  Here's a story we prepared earlier referencing the people implicated in this case.
 1.25pm Lawyer Dalli says nobody sent for the company to speak to them and get their version after they were charged with money laundering to the tune of €62,500.
 AG simply speaks of “suspicion” when it comes to Taomac and nothing else. The company is named only once in the experts’ report simply to say when the company was set up and that it transferred its shares.
 Dalli says the share capital transfer was at same price. The experts should have sent for Taomac to delve into that “strange 62500 transaction.”
 Taomac was incorporated in 2012, and a business plan was done with Saint James three years later.
 Dalli adds: ""Had anyone investigated they would have found out that it was Malta Enterprise which asked Taomac to move out of the project. Police did not bother to investigate. The cyclotron project and request for soft loan was at an advanced stage. When Taomac was asked for due diligence the company said they were facing some proceedings in Italy over illegal dumping reports. Later, Taomac was totally acquitted in those proceedings, as will be proved here.""
 Malta Enterprise asked Taomac to move out of the project.
 Taomac asked Malta Enterprise what it was expected to with that 62500 share capital.
 The company held on to that capital until another company came along and expressed interest in acquiring that share capital. And that was the 62,500 transaction.
 1.20pm Jonathan Vella worked at Christopher Spiteri's auditing firm and they facilitated the crimes of money laundering, fraud and made false declarations, the court hears.
 Vella was in touch with several of the people now facing the same charges. He worked in Spiteri’s firm assisting in the audits, as company secretary of Bluestone and VGH Assets. He had the know-how.
 The inquiring magistrate gave clear directions for these persons to be charged with these crimes.
 Taomac sold its shares in MTrace to Vitals Procurement in Jersey for the same purchase price. That flagged suspicions that Taomac was simply holding those shares for third parties. 
 Refalo from the AG's office adds: ""It was a smokescreen. The holder was Vitals Procurement Ltd in Jersey. That’s why prosecution insists that there’s more than prima facie as far as Taomac is concerned.""
 So to sum up, the voluminous inquiry, the experts’ reports and so on, the inquiring magistrate “did not say ‘investigate further, but charge these persons with these offences'”, says Refalo.
 Lawyer Veronique Dalli rebuts on behalf of Taomac. She says that after hearing the prosecutor she is more convinced than ever that action against the company was done in a hasty manner.
 1.15pm Refalo explains that MTrace got a fraudulent soft loan from Malta Enterprise. MTrace did not have the funds to pay its 31% share of expenses on the project. So there is prima facie on MTrace too.
 Brian Bondin was CEO of MTrace and was involved in the scheme, fraudulently set up to get the loan from Malta Enterprise.
 Bondin enabled the scheme to get monies from Malta Enterprise. Technoline was also to cover the 31% share of expenses.
 1.10pm Francesco Refalo from AG’s office goes first.
 He says the detailed inquiry roped in a lot of experts who reported on the hospitals case. 
 It was evident that Gateway was given a convertible loan from Vitals of over €5 million to buy all shares of Technoline. All these were funds derived through fraud which were meant for the hospitals concession.
 Technoline became the sole provider of medical equipment to Vitals.
 Experts concluded that there was prima facie evidence where it comes to Technoline. The trail of funds, namely €5 million, is the same for Gateway. These were funds from the concession which ought to have been spent on the hospitals, Refalo explains.
 Over €2.3 million were channelled to MTrace, which were meant to go for the cyclotron project.
 1pm Magistrate asks what the defence lawyers have to say about prima facie.
 Lawyers for Joseph Muscat are not contesting, so as to facilitate the process because it is in his interest for proceedings to be conducted expediently. 
 Konrad Mizzi and Keith Schembri also submit to the court’s decision. Clarence John Thompson does likewise, together with a number of other parties.
 Gateway Solutions, MTrace, Technoline, Taomac, Sciacca Grill, Brian Bondin and Jonathan Vella are contesting the prima facie.
 The court will start hearing submissions today and continue on Tuesday when the decree will be delivered.
 12.55pm The last witness is Malcolm Mifsud, who audited Gateway Solutions Ltd's accounts from 2018 to 2022.
 Asked about loan and interests to date, according to the 2022 audit, Mifsud says the company signed a private agreement with Steward Health International Ltd around 2017 for a loan of €5,850,733. By 2022 the outstanding balance was €690,325.
 Documents presented by Gateway’s auditor showed that the loan plus interests was settled last year.
 That testimony wraps up today’s witnesses.
 12.40pm Court is back in session. 
 The next witness is Joseph Cremona, a representative of the Radiation Protection Board set up under EU Directive on Radiation.
 The board vets justification for request and then lists the necessary documentation.
 The law says that all radiation activity must be notified to the authority. 
 MTrace wanted permission to use cyclotron at Life Science Park.
 Was the permit issued?
 ""It’s not that easy. First we need to check the structure, the nature of concrete and so on. But the permit for the installation of equipment was never issued. The last inspection by a foreign expert took place in 2017. All we inspected was the facility structure not the cyclotron as such. “Cyclotron is still in boxes... we were shown the boxes. The project stopped.”
 ""Last year we were going past LSP and we noticed some works on the road near the bunker where the cyclotron was to be installed. We went to inquire about it and were told that remedial works were being done because of some water seepage problems,"" says Cremona.
 Lawyer Arthur Azzopardi shows him a set of 12 photos.
 ""Do you recognize the place?""
 ""I recognise the equipment. These are related to the cyclotron but the cyclotron as such I didn’t see.""
 Asked if it’s what he personally attested or was told, he says that that’s what he was told. He’s under the impression that works were still ongoing for cyclotron to operate.
 12.10pm The court sitting is being suspended for 15 minutes because the interpreter was called elsewhere and her services will be needed for the following witness/es.
 We'll continue after this break.
 12.10pm Alexander Camilleri, a representative of the Environment Resources Authority takes the witness stand.
 He says ERA involvement began in 2016 but discussions started by the planning authority earlier. A meeting was also held between ERA and MTrace.
 Details of the applicant and project description statement were submitted in 2015.
 In 2017, they were told that the project was being reactivated as long as MTrace satisfied the requirements by ERA.
 It was confirmed that the project description was still valid. The authorised representative of the project was Brian Bondin for MTrace.
 So what did ERA do?
 ERA issued guidelines to facilitate a follow-up but in reality it was not followed up. The applicant did not follow those guidelines. The coordinator on the project asked for a meeting because they had some reservations about ERA's requirements. That was in June 2017 and that was the last contact with the authority. That’s where discussions stopped.
 12pm Serracino Inglott from the Medicines Authority said that some 10 years ago, Malta Enterprise informed the authority that ""there might be interest"" in a cyclotron facility.
 “But that's it. Everything stopped there.""
 11.55am Some context to the court discussions today:  Cyclotrons are used to produce a radioactive tracer for nuclear imaging during PET/CT scans. This enables patients, primarily those suffering from cancer, to be diagnosed and the effectiveness of their therapy to be monitored. Malta has never used the cyclotron so far.
 In March 2021, Times of Malta reported that the cyclotron was not being used and was “still in boxes” at the Life Sciences Park. In the meantime, the country had been importing tracer from a company called Curium, in Rome.
 The cyclotron itself became the property of Mtrace, a company that was owned by Steward and Andrea Marsili, the general manager and managing director of Curium, the same Rome company that supplies Mater Dei Hospital with the tracer.
 You may want to read this Times of Malta story from January 2023 for more background. 
 11.50am Anthony Serracino Inglott, CEO of the Medicines Authority is the next witness.
 He says no permits were issued for the cyclotron facility.
 ""We had no applications,"" he says.
 ""Not even by Malta Enterprise?""
 The CEO replies: ""No, usually as far as I know it would be the project owner to apply.""
 Serracino Inglott said that where it comes to cyclotron, the authorities were still in the stage of considering if there was suitable manpower to produce appropriate medicines.
 ""We would need capability to carry out inspections of the facility... The only thing that was done “long ago” was some interest in that service about radio pharmaceuticals. As an authority we would then need to ensure that we would be able to deliver that service to the country.""
 11.45am Lawyer Arthur Azzopardi makes a formal request for court to carry out on-site inspection at LSP property of INDIS to prove that contrary to what the inquiry states, the cyclotron facility exists.
 The Attorney General lawyers object.
 ""I’m flabbergasted,"" says lawyer Chris Cilia. ""The prosecution’s questions a while ago hinted a trace of disbelief (regarding cyclotron). So I would expect them to agree to go on-site. We’re here for justice not an inquisition!""
 But the magistrate turns down the request saying that proof is not necessary for court to reach prima facie stage in terms of law.
 11.35pm Next witness is senior planning officer Ian Galea.
 Asked if the Planning Authority issued a permit for cyclotron, he says that there was no specific request for cyclotron but permits were issued.
  All plans are in digital form on PA system.
 Lawyer Azzopardi suggests that the magistrate should conduct an on-site inspection at Life Sciences Park to confirm that the cyclotron facility exists.
 But the magistrate points out that at this stage the court must decide whether there is enough prima facie evidence for the accused to have a case to answer, not to prove the existence or otherwise of cyclotron.
 Background: Investigators working on a magisterial inquiry into the Vitals deal concluded that the company used taxpayer money to purchase the firm that owned the cyclotron, then eventually resold the firm to Malta Enterprise.
 11.20am ABI Associates Environmental Consultants Ltd Adrian Mallia says that they carried out some work for MTrace after carrying out works for Malta Enterprise in 2009. 
 He presents documents about the company’s statements on environmental impact and subsequent changes in factors all related to the cyclotron facility, which was already being conceived back in 2009. 
 Construction works were done, equipment was imported, but ultimately the project was aborted.
 On Wednesday, another witness said that the project was taken over by Malta Enterprise and ready to go.
 Asked for the purpose behind certain details, defence lawyer Arthur Azzopardi said it was to prove that the cyclotron facility was actually built and ready when the magisterial inquiry says this project does not exist.
 11am So far we've had witnesses from GO Plc, Firetech Ltd, Terracore Ltd and TS Container Services. The questions are focusing on the promised cyclotron project. 
 The project cost millions to set up and was then sold to Malta Enterprise for roughly €6.9 million when Vitals’ successor, Steward Healthcare, decided to drop it.
 Years later, the equipment remains unused at the Life Sciences Park adjacent to Mater Dei Hospital, a Malta Enterprise representative confirmed under oath on Wednesday. 
 10.40am The magistrate enters the Hall 22 and the court session starts. 
 The accused are all seated around the back end of the hall. Their lawyers are at an extended defence bench and in the places normally reserved for jurors during trials. The prosecution team are on the left-hand side of the hall. 
 10.35am There are teams of lawyers assisting the accused.
 Muscat is assisted by Vince Galea, Charlon Gouder, Ishmael Psaila, Luke Dalli and Etienne Borg Ferranti.
 Schembri and Mizzi are assisted by Edward Gatt and Mark Vassallo.
 David J Meli is assisted by Giannella DeMarco and Charles Mercieca, while Spiteri is assisted by Jason Grima. 
 Pierre Sladden and a number of companies are assisted by Arthur Azzopardi.
 Franco Debono and David Bonello are counsel to Sciacca Grill Ltd, while Stefano Filletti is counsel to Adrian Hillman. 
 Other lawyers include Stephen Tonna Lowell, Shazoo Ghaznavi, Jessica Formosa, Veronique Dalli, Rachel Powell and David Bonello.
 Attorney General lawyers Francesco Refalo, Rebekah Spiteri and Shelby Aquilina are prosecuting together with superintendent Hubert Cini and inspector Wayne Borg.
 10.20am Joseph Muscat and Keith Schembri arrive in court. In this particular case, the accused have to attend the proceedings or risk a €25,000 fine if they missed the session with no excuse.
 10.15am This will be the third time the former prime minister and his associates appear in court as criminally accused defendants. 
 In their first appearance, they were read charges and pleaded not guilty, doing so over the din of a crowd gathered outside court to voice support for Muscat. 
 The second court hearing saw police confirming they did not investigate the hospitals' case and were relying on the findings of the magisterial inquiry. 
 During Wednesday's sitting, Saint James Hospital magnate Josie Muscat strongly denied having anything to do with a failed cancer treatment project spearheaded by Vitals Global Healthcare.
 10.10am In 2015, the government signed a multi-billion agreement to redevelop and operate three public hospitals with a private company called Vitals Global Healthcare (VGH) Ltd, a company with no previous experience. 
 Deadlines for several projects are missed as questions are asked over whether the investors can deliver on their pledges.
 The National Audit Office said in 2020 that the government’s work to verify the deal with VGH and its capacity to run three public hospitals was “grossly inadequate”.
 
 The contract was transferred in 2018 to a US company named Steward Health Care.
 That same year, then PN leader Adrian Delia filed a court case to rescind the concession. The case would eventually conclude in February 2023, with the courts cancelling the deal altogether, describing it as ""fraudulent"".
 A Times of Malta investigation last year showed Muscat got close to €482,000 in various consultancy payments in the year of resignation.
 Fast forward to last month and a magisterial inquiry - four years in the making - recommended serious charges against a number of high-profile individuals and companies, sparking a political war. 
 The last of three reports by the auditor general published revealed that a total of €456 million was paid to Vitals and Steward throughout the concession period. Investigators believe Vitals – and later Steward – stakeholders had no intention of running Maltese hospitals for the 30-year lease period they agreed to.
 This included a catering company suspected to be involved in a 10% kickback scheme, a medical equipment supplier which had hidden owners, and a secret shareholder who received monthly €100,000 consultancy payments.
 It was NGO Repubblika's work that led to this case reaching the criminal courts: prosecutions were based on a magisterial inquiry the NGO triggered back in 2019.
 All those charged deny wrongdoing. 
 10am Good morning and welcome to this live blog. We'll be bringing you live updates from the law courts, where the case against Muscat, Schembri, Mizzi and others will continue. 
 Those three - and another 11 people - have been jointly charged with a litany of serious crimes concerning the Vitals deal.

 The defendants, both of whom reside in Malta, were arraigned before magistrate Rachel Montebello on Thursday, after allegedly profiting from the fraudulent hospitals deal with Vitals Global Healthcare, through Shaukat Ali Chaudhry’s companies Mount Everest FZ LLC and Global Assets Holdings.
  In August, a court had declared that there were sufficient prima facie grounds to indict Shaukat Ali Chaudhruy and his wife Shaukat Aasia Parveen for related offences.
 Prosecuting police inspector Wayne Rodney Borg told the court that he had taken over the investigation in 2022 and confirmed that Wajid had never been spoken to by the police.
 Investigators had traced money transfers into the bank accounts of Shaukat Ali’s two wives Aasia Parveen and Fakhra Ali, his sons Asad and Wajid, and his “honorary daughter” Saba Binte Abbas and concluded that the family had “acted as a unit.”
 The prosecution asked the court to confirm a €20 million freezing order, which they said, was based on amounts emerging from evidence gathered during the inquiry. 
 Prosecutor Shelby Aquilina told the court that the defendants had participated in a “scheme to extract public funds, intended for the hospitals concession, for their personal gain.”
 The defendant’s lawyer, Shazoo Ghaznavi contested the issuing of any seize and freeze orders through the present proceedings, arguing that if confirmed in court today, the defence would not have the possibility of challenging them.
 Magistrate Montebello, after having also seen that the law obliged the court to issue a freezing and seizing order over the assets and properties subject to confiscation, said it had to accede to the prosecution’s request at this stage. 
 The court issued the requested €20 million freezing and seizure order over all the defendants’ property.
 It also prohibited the accused from making public statements that could undermine the proceedings or disseminating material from the inquiry in any way to ensure unlawful interference in the administration of justice. 
 The court, in view of the defence’s declaration that the defendant was a permanent and habitual resident of Malta, and a Maltese citizen, granted bail, ordering the defendants to inform the court in advance of any travel outside the Maltese islands, and provide it with details of the destination and length of stay.
 It also ordered the accused to provide a €35,000 personal guarantee.

Court grants bail in cannabis postal parcels case,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/man-linked-cannabis-postal-parcels-granted-bail.1097873,09-10-2024,007704.png,"A man who stands accused of having conspired to import nine kilograms of cannabis using packages sent in the post has been granted bail.
 Pedro Da Costa Masi, a 29-year-old self-employed Brazilian national from Mellieħa, is pleading not guilty to a raft of charges related to cannabis possession, importation and cultivation.
 The case came to law enforcement’s attention last month, when a parcel flagged as suspicious by Fedex officials turned out to contain four packages of suspected cannabis.
 That parcel was addressed to a ‘Paola Gonzales’ living at an address in Pietá. Although the street and apartment block cited on the address were real, the apartment number provided was fictitious.
 Two days later, a man showed up at Fedex offices and inquired about the parcel. The police’s drug squad pounced, and arrested him. Inside his Mellieħa home they found several kilograms of cannabis resin, six cannabis plants, suspected MDMA and around €12,000 in cash.
 Inspector Mark Mercieca testified that officers who searched the accused’s home also found envelopes addressed to the same ‘Paola Gonzales’ cited on the Fedex package. Further investigations revealed that another package addressed to that name had been flagged by Maltapost to the police some days earlier.
 Masi was arraigned in court last month and pleaded not guilty to charges. He did not request bail and was remanded in custody.
 When the case resumed on Tuesday, his lawyers asked that he be granted bail and prosecutors did not object.
 Magistrate Elaine Rizzo took note of that and agreed to grant Masi bail against an €18,000 deposit and €20,000 personal guarantee.
 The accused was also ordered to deposit his passport and residence card with the court and told he must sign a bail book at the Sliema police station every day. He must remain indoors at an apartment in Gzira between 10pm and 6am every day.
 Masi was represented by lawyers Franco Debono and Marion Camilleri. 
 The case is being prosecuted by police inspectors Mark Mercieca and John Leigh Howard.

"€119,605 compensation after swab is left in woman's body during surgery",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/119605-compensation-swab-left-woman-body-surgery.1098406,22-09-2024,007717.png,"The Health Ministry and Mater Dei Hospital have been jointly ordered to pay €119,605 in compensation to a woman after a swab was left in her stomach after a gall bladder operation in 2014.
 The case was instituted against the health authorities and the surgeon.
 The civil court presided by Mr Justice Toni Abela was told that after the gallbladder operation in November 2014 the wound did not heal and was oozing pus. The woman became increasingly weak.
 After many visits to health centres, she was referred for a scan in February 2015 and a week later a nurse pulled out a 25cm swab from her wound. The patient suffered a panic attack when she realised what had been going on.
 Although she was discharged from hospital after a scan that determined that there were no more swabs inside her stomach, the woman complained that she remained weak and had also suffered mental trauma, feeling depressed, limiting her activities and even requiring sleeping pills.
 In January 2016 she was operated for incisional hernia which appeared to have started from the site of the first operation.
 She, however, remained weak and could not even perform ordinary house chores.
 The woman said she was offered €20,000 compensation by the medical authorities, which was considered inadequate after consultation with experts. 
 In his considerations, Mr Justice Abela said there was no doubt that a swab had been left the woman's body during the first operation. The ‘Surgical Safety Checking’ notes showed that a nurse visually confirmed completion of instrument, sponge, and needle counts but there was no mention of the swabs.
 It was 'interesting' the court said, that according to a scrub nurse present for the operation, they were not given a proper course on standard operating procedures but learnt as they went along from their superiors. There were previous cases when swab counts did not match and recounts were held and intensive searches were made until all were accounted for.
 ""The court finds it very strange how no training is given for such sensitive work,"" the judge said. ""This increases the risk of mistakes such as this one, particularly for nurses just starting their work in operating theatres."" 
 The judge also praised a nurse for having realised that a foreign object was in the patient, telling a consultant: ""there must be something in there.” 
 ""This was truly a case of the sacristan advising the parish priest because eventually his observation turned out to be true,"" the judge said. 
 The court concluded that the surgeon who performed the first operation was not at fault and this case was a result of poor training for the nurses and because the checklist did not specifically include swabs.
 The court found the health authorities and Mater Dei Hospital responsible for the incident and condemned them to pay compensation of €119,605 on the basis of the patient having suffered a 40 per cent permanent disability and 10% psychological disability, calculated on the average wage and the fact that the woman was 47 at the time of the operation and would have been eligible for a pension at 64.

Suspected arsonist fled Malta days after setting car on fire,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/suspected-arsonist-fled-malta-days-setting-car-fire.1101117,16-11-2024,007723.png,"A suspected arsonist, who left Malta two days after allegedly setting fire to a car in Gozo, was remanded in custody on Friday upon arraignment after he was brought back to face justice under a European Arrest Warrant.
 Yahia Hamid Mohamad, the 21-year-old Syrian-born holder of a temporary Bulgarian passport, was targeted by the arrest warrant after being identified as the suspect behind the fire that broke out on a Munxar street.
 The incident took place during the night between April 30 and May 1 some time between 10pm and 4am.
 There was no one inside the parked vehicle and luckily the fire did not spread to a nearby property. 
 CCTV footage from the suspected crime scene enabled investigators to identify the suspect.
 It turned out that two days after the incident, the youth travelled out of Malta and headed to Bulgaria. 
 The Maltese authorities issued a European Arrest Warrant which was executed by Bulgarian police on October 14. 
 On Thursday, Mohamad was returned to Malta to face justice.
 The next day he was escorted before a Magistrates’ Court in Gozo, facing charges for wilfully setting fire to the vehicle, wilful damage to third-party property, wilfully disturbing the repose of residents and breaching the public peace. 
 He was also charged with unlawfully disposing of waste material in a public place, as well as driving without a licence and insurance cover. 
 He pleaded not guilty. 
 His lawyer made no request for bail at arraignment stage and the court, presided over by Magistrate Simone Grech, remanded him in custody.
 AG lawyer Joseph Camilleri Azarov together with inspectors Mario Xiberras, Keith Xerri and Keith Rizzo prosecuted. 
 Lawyer Mario Mifsud was defence counsel.

 Sliema resident Ben Alayah from Tunisia, who the court was told was currently in Malta pursuing a Masters degree, was arraigned before magistrate Rachel Montebello on Monday, in connection with the 4:30am Sunday morning incident.
 The prosecution told Magistrate Rachel Montebello that a suspended sentence would be a fitting punishment in view of the defendant’s early guilty plea, clean criminal record and his cooperation with the police.
 The man’s defence lawyer, Josette Sultana, submitted that the defendant and the victim did not know each other and had never argued. Sultana explained that the victim had been punched accidentally during the commotion, in which a number of students had been involved.
 Declaring Alayah to be guilty on his own admission, the court sentenced him to imprisonment for one year, suspended for two years and issued a protection order in favour of the other student.

 In a statement, Darren Carabott, shadow home affairs minister, raised several unanswered questions about the allegations surrounding Svetlana Muscat, the Correctional Services Agency's (CSA) Head of Strategy.
 On Tuesday it was revealed that police have interrogated a top prison official after she allegedly allowed Fenech to meet people in her office at the Corradino prison.
 He is currently on remand, awaiting trial for complicity in the 2017 car bomb murder of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia. 
 Carabott called for Home Affairs Minister Byron Camilleri to ""immediately and publicly clarify the position of the situation in the prison"".
 He asked Camilleri to explain if it is true that the meetings were held, what they were about and whether there was any connection with any pending court proceedings. 
 Carabott asked for a detailed explanation as to why the prison official has been put on forced leave, what other steps were taken against her and whether any steps were taken against Fenech and/or third parties.
 He also wanted to know why Svetlana Muscat, a former communications coordinator, was given the task of Head of Strategy in Kordin, and to provide a breakdown of her experience for the position. 
 ""In these very delicate moments, the people need to have immediate and clear information about these allegations,"" Camilleri said.
 ""It is in the interest of Minister Camilleri to address immediately and without delay these allegations that are capable of tarnishing the name of the prison administration at Corradino.""
 In a statement issued around 40 minutes later, the home affairs ministry said it immediately reported the incident to the police and triggered an investigation.  
 ""Pending such an investigation, the person concerned is on forced leave,"" it said.

 Lorraine Vella, 52, of Cospicua, was spotted by a police patrol driving at very high speed at around 4am.
 Rather than stopping when she was flagged down, she floored the accelerator and shot off, heading towards Marsa, prosecutors said.
 The police gave chase and noticed the driver throwing something out of the window.
 They managed to block the car at Marsa but the woman refused to get out. All the doors of the vehicle were locked.
 As the officers tried to break one of the windows, she started the car once more and drove off, sometimes driving against one-way traffic and ignoring red lights.
 The officers chased her to Tarxien, again noticing her throwing something out of the window.
 They finally managed to block her in Tarxien, where she was arrested.
 Police found a sachet of brown substance, a pair of weighing scales and €1,400 in cash in Vella’s possession.
 Retracing the route of the chase, officers retrieved two sachets filled with a white substance and a mobile phone which had also allegedly been thrown out by the suspect.
 Hours after her arrest, the frail-looking woman, shabbily dressed and wearing a face mask, was escorted to court, charged with possessing cocaine and heroin under circumstances denoting that the drugs were not solely for personal use.
 She was also charged with refusing to obey legitimate police orders, driving her Skoda in a reckless and dangerous manner, running a red light, driving wrong way and breaching other traffic regulations.
 She was also charged with relapsing.
 She pleaded not guilty and was remanded in custody.
 Upon a request by defence lawyers Ishmael Psaila and Maria Sarah Vella Gafa’, Magistrate Noel Bartolo issued a treatment order so that the woman could be helped for psychological and drug addiction problems.

 Inspectors Francesco Mizzi and Nico Zarb arraigned 18-year-old Kyrese Lares, a British man from Swieqi before Magistrate Claire Stafrace Zammit on Thursday, on charges of sexual harassment and possession of ecstasy and cannabis, the latter substance in circumstances which indicated that it was not for his personal use.
 The defendant’s ex-girlfriend is understood to have gone to the police to report him for sexual harassment, after he allegedly sent her unwanted messages which were described in court as “indecent”, as well as footage purporting to show him having sex with another girl.
  Police officers executing a search warrant at his house seized the man’s phone, but also discovered an undisclosed amount of cash and cannabis, as well as weighing scales. Ecstasy was also retrieved during the search, the court was told.
 Lares pleaded not guilty to the charges. His lawyer, Noel Bianco, requested bail.
 Objections were raised to that request by the prosecution, primarily on the grounds that his drug abuse increased the risk of him committing further offences if released from arrest.
 Bianco told the court that the man had been in possession of just one ecstasy pill which he had split in two, alleging that he had bought the pill and then forgotten all about it, because he had smoked too much cannabis.
 The lawyer added that the defendant’s father was present in the courtroom and was willing to help him out as required. The court replied that while it was good to see his father’s presence in court, it was still “very premature” for Lares to be released. He had a drug problem, remarked the magistrate, “and has not yet made up his mind whether to address it or not.”
 Also militating against bail was the fact that the alleged victim had not yet testified, the court noted. The bail request was denied at this stage.
 At the defence’s request, the court directed the prison director to house the defendant at the Young Offenders unit, in view of his age.  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police
Court rejects Gordon-John Manche’s libel case against TVM News journalists,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/132342/court_rejects_gordonjohn_manches_libel_case_against_tvm_news_journalists,18-11-2024,007779.png,"River of Love pastor Gordon-John Manche has lost a defamation case, he initiated against Public Broadcasting Services journalists over articles linking his church to illegal conversion therapy and a murder suspect.

 The court has found the claims lacked evidence of financial harm to the River of Love community, while recognising the articles as addressing matters of public interest.

                     Gordon-John Manche’, both in a personal capacity and as the leader of the River of Love Evangelical Community, had filed a libel case against TVM’s Head of News Owen Galea and journalist Alvin Vassallo in a Court presided by Magistrate Rachel Montebello. The two individuals working for TVM were involved in publishing two articles on the TVM news portal in January 2022.

 The first article, dated 4 January 2022, alleged that the River of Love community engaged in illegal gay conversion therapy. The second article, dated 6 January 2022, linked the community to the  murder suspect Abner Aquilina, who was implicated in the murder of Paulina Dembska on 2 January 2022.

 Manche’ claimed that these articles caused significant harm to his reputation and that of his community, leading to public hostility, threats, and emotional distress. Manche’ and his supporters denied practicing conversion therapy and insisted that any changes in lifestyle among community members occurred voluntarily and were attributed to personal religious transformations.

 Manche’ further refuted allegations that his community had any connection to the murder suspect. The court reviewed testimony and evidence presented by both sides, including prior media coverage linking River of Love to conversion therapy and concerns raised by organisations like the Malta Gay Rights Movement (MGRM) due to the fact that conversion therapy was made a criminal offence in 2016. Notably, the Court observed that allegations of conversion therapy had been a recurring theme in media reports on River of Love over the years.

 The court also examined whether the articles constituted responsible journalism, evaluating the defendants’ adherence to standards of verifying information and ensuring accuracy. While the articles were deemed to address matters of public interest, such as illegal practices and connections to serious crimes, the court assessed whether they were published maliciously or recklessly. Evidence indicated that the articles relied on previously available reports, public statements, and the broader societal discourse surrounding the issues at hand.

 The Court therefore rejected the claims of Gordon-John Manche. While Manche’ was seen as having suffered reputational harm, the court questioned whether the community, as a non-profit religious entity, met the legal criteria to claim damages for defamation. The court noted that non-profit entities must demonstrate serious financial loss resulting from defamatory statements, a criterion not met in this case.     ",Jordan Pace ,court_and_police

 Inspector Sherona Buhagiar arraigned the 50-year-old man from Fgura on charges of causing his ex-partner to fear violence, breaching a restraining order, committing an offence while on bail, criminal damage and threatening the woman with an improvised weapon.
 He was further charged with having threatened three police officers in a bid to intimidate them into not performing their duties on 5 May and breaching a restraining order.
  Inspector Buhagiar told Magistrate Giannella Camilleri Busuttil that a woman had filed a police report claiming that her ex-partner had entered her apartment without her permission, turned on the radio “full blast”, before going on a destructive rampage inside her home.
 Police officers arrested him in the act of smashing items on the ground, she said, adding that the man had also threatened the officers.
 Both he and his partner were convicted of offences against each other last February and had been placed under mutual restraining orders.
 Lawyer Peter Paul Zammit, assisting the man as defence counsel, informed the court that his client was pleading not guilty to the charges, but was not requesting bail because “the only habitable address he has is the matrimonial home and although he had been offered the option of living with his mother, she is 89 years old and he does not want to trouble her.”
 “The defendant does not want to return to his house as long as his partner is residing there, due to a number of incidents, including today’s, in which he is insisting that he is being victimised by her.”
 Lawyer Matthew Xuereb, who is assisting the woman as parte civile together with lawyer Jeanine Depasquale, said that the couple have a long history of marital problems and that the courts had warned the man time and again to find a middle ground with his former partner about access to the house.
 Inspector Buhagiar added that previous courts had drawn up a roster stipulating when either party could use the property, but said that the defendant was not sticking to it.  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police

 Cherise Mifsud, 27, from Valletta, who told the court that she was unemployed, was arraigned under arrest before magistrate Charmaine Galea on Monday, accused of committing two thefts while on bail for a separate offence.
  Lawyer Francesca Zarb, defence counsel to Mifsud, asked the prosecution to explain what had led to her client being arrested.
 Police Inspector Roderick Attard told the court that officers had been dispatched to handle a report about an argument at a residence on Saturday. While talking to the people inside the house, one officer noticed that Mifsud was acting strangely. The woman’s behaviour led him to suspect that she could be hiding drugs on her person.
 Mifsud had immediately been arrested on suspicion of drug possession, with the duty magistrate appointing a medico-legal expert to examine her and report the findings. But neither the doctors at Mater Dei Hospital who had examined the defendant, nor a CT scan carried out on her there had detected any drugs.
 While she was still in hospital, however, Mifsud was arrested again: this time on suspicion of having committed two thefts - of cash from a house in Gzira on September 5 and of designer shoes from a boutique hotel on September 9. The charges were deemed aggravated by time and value of the items stolen. 
 “She had been arrested without a warrant due to the risk of her destroying evidence,”  explained the inspector.
 Zarb contested the validity of the arrest, arguing that the inspector’s testimony had not provided the court with all the details required by law, but was overruled.
 Mifsud pleaded not guilty to the charges and her lawyer requested bail.
 The prosecution objected to that request, arguing that eyewitnesses had not yet testified and that Mifsud was an unemployed drug addict who would likely have to resort to criminality to sustain her habit. The defendant was also now aware of the victims’ identities, added prosecutor Julian Scicluna.
 Zarb counter-argued that the police had said that they were gathering CCTV footage of the incidents, which meant that the most important evidence was preserved.
 “She is being arraigned on September 16 on charges which refer to September 5 and 9,” pointed out the lawyer, adding that the prosecution had provided no evidence to support their assertions about drug addiction. “But if she does need assistance, the legislator has provided the court with the option to impose a temporary supervision order.”
 Bail was denied at this stage, the court explaining that it was not sufficiently assured that Mifsud would not commit further offences, as well as in view of her recently having been granted bail in other proceedings.  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police

Decision to dismiss MCAST principal 'unreasonable and unjust',timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/ombudsman-cautions-authorities-dismiss-mcast-principal.1097371,29-08-2024,007851.png,"The “devious way” whereby education authorities were trying to “constructively dismiss” MCAST principal Joachim James Calleja breached the Ombudsman Act, the Commissioner for Education said.
 In a damning final opinion delivered on Tuesday, the commissioner within the Ombudsman’s Office, Chief Justice Emeritus Vincent De Gaetano, concluded that the circumstances of the case showed that Calleja’s dismissal was “both unreasonable and unjust.”
 He also cautioned the authorities not to go ahead with the planned dismissal in two days. 
 The case revolved around Calleja’s post as principal and CEO of the Malta College of Arts, Science and Technology (MCAST) which he occupied since 2018.
 That post did not fall within the remit of the Public Administration Collective Bargaining Unit at the Office of the Prime Minister.
 The Education Act itself spelt out that the college’s supreme governing body was the board of governors “ostensibly to underscore the academic and administrative independence of MCAST from the political establishment”.
 In March 2021, the principal’s employment contract was extended on a definite basis up to May 31, 2026.
 But last June, Calleja received a letter from the permanent secretary within the education ministry informing him that his “request” to work beyond the age of 67 had not been accepted.
 The termination was to take effect at the end of August 2024.
 Calleja complained to the Ombudsman’s Office claiming his dismissal was unlawful and politically motivated.
 When notified about the complaint, the permanent secretary at the education ministry replied that everything was done according to law.
 The commissioner was to investigate whether such a decision by the authorities amounted to an act of maladministration, applying the rule of law as the “leitmotif” and “transparency and accountability as the linchpins.”
 The commissioner observed that when extending the contract in March 2021, the board of governors knew the principal’s age ""fairly well”
 There was no evidence to suggest that that information fell within the parameters of the Official Secrets Act, remarked De Gaetano.
 The contract expired only at the end of May 2026 and it was governed exclusively by the Employment and Industrial Relations Act.
 The contract did not refer to any requirement of periodic approval by the education minister or his permanent secretary.
 Nor was there any such “reference, hint or suggestion” in the letter of renewal signed by the president of the board of governors in May 2021.
 To date, the only reason provided to the complainant and the commissioner for the constructive dismissal was that his request to work beyond the age of 67 had not been accepted.
 Such a reason was “spurious” and made “a mockery” of the authority of the college’s board of governors as well as employment laws.
 The “devious way” whereby education authorities were attempting to dismiss the complainant was highlighted further by the contents of a 'To Whom It May Concern' note penned by the former president of the board.
 Before stepping down from that role, law professor Ian Refalo wrote that Calleja had “steered the college to unprecedented academic heights, whilst ensuring that each and every one of the students was given all the support and guidance necessary to reach his or her full potential.”
 Refalo also stated that Calleja’s “integrity and commitment towards vocational and dual education is exceptional.”
 The commissioner concluded that the “imminent constructive dismissal” violated various provisions of the Ombudsman Act and recommended that the education authorities “desist” from going ahead with their decision in two days.
 Lawyer Matthew Xuereb is assisting the complainant.

 Inspector Clayton Camilleri charged 49-year-old Patrick Borg from Birkirkara with both trafficking and aggravated possession of heroin within 100 metres from a place where young people normally congregated, as well as recidivism.
 The court was told that the police had been following Borg and another two suspects after receiving a tip-off about possible drug trafficking. 
  Inspector Camilleri explained that on April 24, at around 2:00pm, an anonymous phone call to the Birkirkara police station had reported suspicious-looking people on the corner of Triq it-Torri and Triq Swatar. Officers had gone to the location and spotted a car with two people sitting inside it talking to another person standing next to it. As the police car approached, two of the men had scattered, leaving the defendant alone, sitting behind the wheel of the car.
 A car chase had ensued, during which Borg was seen to throw three bags out of the car’s window. The three bags were later found to each contain ten sachets of small doses of heroin. Despite their efforts, all three men had been arrested. 
 When he was stopped, the other two fled. The three bags he was seen throwing out of the car each contained ten sachets of small doses of heroin, police inspector Clayton Camilleri told Magistrate Victor Axiak. 
 Borg pleaded not guilty to the charges and requested bail. 
 His lawyers, Franco Debono and Adreana Zammit, submitted that the global amount of heroin retrieved had not even been established, yet the charges had been issued nonetheless. Inspector Camilleri rebutted that this was a job for court experts. He could not be expected to weigh the exhibits himself, as this could lead to DNA contamination and other risks.
 The court upheld the request for bail, releasing Borg from arrest against a €500 deposit and a €10,000 personal guarantee. He was ordered to sign the bail book twice a week and not to speak to any of the prosecution’s witnesses.  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police
Students and lecturer to be charged after exposing security flaw in popular app,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/student-lecturer-charged-exposing-security-flaw-popular-app.1097416,30-08-2024,"007862.png,007863.png","Three computer science students and their lecturer will be charged in court after they found and exposed security flaws in Malta's largest student application two years ago. 
 In October 2022, Michael Debono, Giorgio Grigolo and Luke Bjorn Scerri were arrested after they highlighted vulnerabilities in FreeHour, an app that helps students manage their schedules. 
 The students had e-mailed FreeHour to inform the company of the security flaw and requested a reward - or ‘bug bounty’- a common practice in ethical or ‘white hat’ hacking. Instead of a payoff the University of Malta students were arrested, strip-searched and had their computer equipment seized.
 The charges accuse Grigolo, Bjon Scerri and Debono of gaining unauthorised access to a computer’s data, software or supporting documentation held in the computer and using, copying or modifying the data, software or document.
 The three students and their lecturer Mark Joseph Vella will appear before Magistrate Marse-Ann Farrugia in March 2025.
 The trio are also accused of having prevented or obstructed the inputting of data without any authorisation, as well as having obstructed or prevented the use of the computer system or software. 
 Vella, a senior lecturer of Computer Science at the University of Malta, is accused of being an accomplice to the students. 
 Grigolo is charged separately for the unauthorised output of data, software, or supporting documentation from a computer. He is also charged with having copies of any data, software or supporting documentation in any storage medium other than the original location of the data. 
 A fourth student, Luke Collins, who was originally arrested has not been charged.
  Former book council chair and author Mark Camilleri posted the charge sheet on his blog on Friday. 
 The charges were filed by AG lawyers Nathaniel Falzon, and Andreas Vella and inspectors Marcus Cachia and Warren Muscat. 
 In a Facebook post, Debono said despite feeling exhausted from the two-year saga, he hopes the case will result in a better climate for cybersecurity.
 “It’s crazy that I’ve had to spend almost two years now dealing with the fallout of an incident that should have been resolved over a table in a day with Freehour and the police,"" he said.
  Speaking to Times of Malta, Debono said it is ""unbelievable"" that their lecturer was charged alongside them. 
 He clarified that Collins was not charged because he was not 'actually involved' in the case, but he just signed an email.
 Last month Times of Malta reported on how the three students were barred from competing in a European cybersecurity challenge they qualified for last month.

Watch: Police raid overcrowded Sliema house rented out by fellow officer,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/watch-police-raid-overcrowded-sliema-house-rented-fellow-officer.1097286,27-08-2024,007880.png,"The police raided a Sliema property on Tuesday after a Times of Malta  investigation revealed a policeman is renting the property to more tenants than allowed by planning regulations.
 Footage shows police officers asking tenants for documentation on the ground floor of the property before heading upstairs to a bedroom used by one of the tenants.
  The video, first shown on SideStreet Malta, shows officers asking tenants to show them their living conditions. 
 The police visit came hours after Times of Malta published details about the living conditions at the Norfolk Street property sublet by policeman Gosef Tanti and owned by lawyer John Seychell Navarro.
 Video footage captured by a former tenant shows at least 11 beds spread across two upstairs rooms of the house and swarms of cockroaches in kitchen cupboards.
 The tenants pay the 22-year-old police constable €250 per month each in rent and live in conditions described by the former tenant as “inhumane”.
 When Times of Malta confronted Tanti during a visit to the property last week, the policeman said he did not think renting to so many tenants was wrong, despite knowing it was in breach of planning regulations, but conceded it was “not fair.”
 Refusing access to the property, Tanti insisted that “no one can come here apart from the tenants; it’s in the contract... Even the police can’t come in without a warrant”.
 It was during that visit he admitted he was a policeman, with sources confirming he was actively serving at the time of going to print.
 Tanti claimed the police visited the house briefly at the start of August to check the work permits and Housing Authority documents of the tenants but found no issues.
 In response to numerous questions, a spokesperson for the police only said the force “investigates all reports into breaches of professional standards and/or criminal offences allegedly committed by its members.”

Woman remanded in custody after trying to steal a bag from dementia patient,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/132400/woman_remanded_in_custody_after_trying_to_steal_a_bag_from_dementia_patient,21-11-2024,007887.png,"A man came to his mother’s rescue by successfully preventing a theft at her house after he noticed suspicious activity from the CCTV cameras which were installed in her home.

 The accused, Renald Falzon, is a 49-year-old woman from Msida. She confirmed that she is currently unemployed as she is undergoing psychiatric treatment.

                     Police inspector Sarah Kathleen Zerafa recalled that on 31 October 2024, the police received information from the alleged victim’s son about an attempted theft.

 The court furthermore heard how the alleged victim, an elderly woman who is almost 90-years-old and who suffers from dementia, lives in an apartment right below that of her son, who instantly became suspicious upon hearing unusual sounds coming from below.

 Upon hearing the sound of someone entering his mother’s home, the man checked the CCTV footage which showed his mother making coffee, as well as a person seemingly trying to evade the mother who had her back turned.

 The footage, it was noted, was handed over to the Police.

 From said footage, the police identified Falzon who appeared to have pretended to drop an item on the floor next to a cupboard, from which she swiped a bag which she placed into her own bag. An arrest warrant was subsequently sought, with the uncontested arrest then taking place.

 The accused, after consulting with her lawyer, pleaded not guilty to the charges.

 A request for bail was also made. Whilst the prosecution objected on the grounds that civilian witnesses still needed to testify, legal aid lawyer Martin Farrugia argued that measures could be issued to prevent the accused from approaching said witnesses. He also argued that there existed no risk that the CCTV evidence could be tampered with.

 The Court, unconvinced of the accused’s ability to stick to any order it may issue, denied the request for bail.

 The case is to be assigned to the relevant court according to law.     ",Thomas Cilia ,court_and_police

 A motorcyclist, 61, was seriously injured in a crash in  Ċirkewwa that left southbound traffic at a standstill on Wednesday evening.
 The motorcycle crashed into a safety barrier at around 4.30pm, with fellow commuters reporting being stuck in their cars for over half an hour.
 Police said the accident, on Triq il-Marfa, involved a Honda 125 motorcycle. The crash occurred on the lane heading to Mellieħa.
 The traffic jam quickly built up on the road, as southbound traffic was closed for cars and drivers reported being stuck in their cars for over 30 minutes.
  According to the popular Facebook page Maltese Roads Traffic Updates, at 5.10pm some cars were still aboard the Gozo Channel, unable to disembark.
 “Standstill traffic for almost 30 minutes,” one comment read. 
 
 “No space for cars to exit ferry anymore thus everyone is stuck with no space to move.
 ""God forbid there is another emergency for people stuck in traffic- impossible to be reached by an ambulance.”
 At the time of writing, southbound traffic was still being diverted out of Ċirkewwa through a northbound carriageway. 
  A magisterial inquiry and police investigations are ongoing.

Man remanded in custody after breaching protection order,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/130912/man_remanded_in_custody_after_breaching_protection_order_,27-08-2024,007925.png,"A 39-year-old self-employed builder from Birkirkara was remanded in custody on Tuesday on charges of breaching a protection order in favour of his estranged partner.
 He was arraigned before magistrate Elaine Rizzo, accused of breaching a protection order and threatening his former partner, as well as misuse of telecommunications equipment and breaching bail.
  Police Inspectors Colin Sheldon and Christian Cauchi explained that the man had threatened his estranged partner, who is also the mother of his son, that he was going to do “something big,” after the man was told that his son had repeatedly been beaten up by his step brother.
 The threat is understood to have been conveyed by instant messaging and voice messages.
 The police told the court that they were in possession of the voice messages.
 Inspector Sheldon explained that two days after this episode, the man had insulted the woman about her appearance when he had gone to pick up the son from the police station in obedience of a custody agreement.
 The defendant pleaded not guilty to the charges. His lawyer, Lennox Vella, requested bail.
 The prosecution objected to the man being released due to the alleged breach of protection order and the fact that the victim had not yet testified.
 Vella explained that the alleged incident had taken place because the man’s son had told him that he had been beaten up by his step-brother at his mother’s house. “The inspector already has WhatsApp messages and voice recordings to prove this,” added the lawyer.
 The magistrate asked the lawyer to base his arguments on the risk assessment, but Vella said this was worthless.
 “With all due respect, a risk assessment is a fill in the blanks, box ticking exercise with a set of standard questions. Did anyone speak to my client? No. Is it sworn? No. Did they hear his version of events? No. It has no probatory value, because you sit down and say whatever you like,” argued the lawyer. “When a risk assessment is a serious exercise then we can talk, but as it stands, today a risk assessment is simply a box ticking exercise.”
 Vella stressed that his client was a self-employed builder, with no addictions and had a fixed address. “In truth, his wife filed a report. A protection order was issued and he was arrested. When the case then started, she didn’t even bother testifying. She was comfortable with the protection order.”
 The lawyer questioned whether the elements necessary to deprive the man of his liberty were even present.
 “He has no interest in this woman, they have a son between them. If need be, access to the son can be suspended until the child testifies.”
 Bail also had a practical aspect, explained the lawyer. “If he is remanded in custody, he will not be able to earn anything and won’t be able to pay child support.”
 The court, after noting the risk assessment and the fact that the man was charged with breaching a protection order and previous bail conditions, said it felt that at this stage he was not sufficiently trustworthy to be released from arrest and denied bail.  ",Matthew Agius ,court_and_police
Man refused bail after domestic violence incident,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/woman-wrapped-bedsheet-flees-home-row-husband.1096070,30-07-2024,007931.png,"A man who allegedly injured his wife during a row late on Sunday night, causing her to rush out of the family home wrapped solely in a bedsheet, was remanded in custody on Tuesday.
 The 54-year old was taken to court and accused of unlawfully holding his wife against her will, causing her to fear violence, insulting and threatening her as well as assault.
 He pleaded not guilty.
 His lawyer requested bail but prosecuting inspector Omar Zammit objected because of the gravity of the charges which carry a maximum possible jail term of six years. He pointed out that the wife was allegedly beaten by the accused.
 She was so scared that she  rushed out of the couple’s St Paul’s Bay home “wrapped only in a bedsheet.” 
 He also pointed out that the couple’s children were still to testify and there was fear of tampering with evidence.
 The prosecutor said that he had spoken to the woman shortly before her husband’s arraignment. She was so afraid in case he was granted bail, that she had moved out of their home and gone to stay with their daughter.
 Defence lawyer Albert Zerafa explained that the accused and the alleged victim had been going through personal separation proceedings for the past year. Throughout their years of marriage, this was the sole incident of its kind.
 The accused’s only brush with the law concerned some issue with the tax department, pre-dating 2017. His criminal record was clean. The house he lived in with his wife was his own paraphernal property, added the lawyer. Moreover, slight injury charges were normally dealt with under summons not arrest.
 “His [the accused’s] criminal record shows that he never manifested any aggressive behaviour,” argued Zerafa, pointing out that the court could set  adequate conditions to stop the accused from approaching the alleged victim in any manner.
 “The injuries are slight but let’s not downplay the charges,” countered the prosecutor.
 After hearing submissions the court, presided over by magistrate Charmaine Galea, turned down the request for bail since the accused offered no alternative residence and also because of the real fear of tampering with evidence until the victim testified.
 The court also issued a protection order warning the accused about the consequences he would face if he breached that order. The defence requested a ban on the parties’ names and the prosecution did not object. The court upheld the request.

Expert confirms process underway to unlock Joseph Muscat’s mobile phone,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/132393/expert_confirms_process_underway_to_unlock_joseph_muscats_mobile_phone,21-11-2024,007933.png,"Court expert Keith Cutajar has confirmed that a process to unlock an iPhone belonging to former Prime Minister Joseph Muscat is once again underway after a similar process began but came to a halt before the magisterial inquiry was concluded.

 Criminal proceedings against former Prime Minister Joseph Muscat, Keith Schembri and former minister Konrad Mizzi resumed on Thursday morning before the Court presided over by Magistrate Rachel Montebello.

                     The sitting began with the presentation of the civil case records which led to the recission of the contract by the Civil Court.

 Whilst defence lawyer Stephen Tonna Lowell questioned the relevance of such documents in the current criminal proceedings, the Court said it is within its discretion to determine the admissibility of such records.

 Cutajar then took to the stand, explaining that a process is currently underway to unlock an iPhone belonging to Muscat. He stated that he was tasked to continue this process which had initially began during the inquiry only to be stopped before its conclusion.

 Whilst this unlocking process has restarted and has been underway for around 23 days and 16 hours, Cutajar said that the estimated time of completion is another 298 days, nearly 10 months.

 He said this estimated length is normal, with the process exhausting all unlock processes and passwords. So far, this technology has inputted roughly 1,100 attempts per day.

 The MLRO of Moneywise also testified, presenting copies of an account belonging to Keith Schembri, as well as documents relating to a former auditor of VGH and Steward Healthcare, co-accused Christopher Spiteri.

 It was then noted by prosecutor Francesco Refalo that whilst Manuel Castagna, Robert Borg and James Camenzuli, members of the evaluation committee, are listed down as witnesses, they are also facing criminal proceedings in relation to the deal, namely proceedings involving former deputy prime minister Chris Feanre and Central Bank Governor Edward Scicluna.

 A Fexserv representative also testified and informed the Court that both Mizzi and Technoline had accounts with Fexserv. Moreover, whilst Kevin Causon stated that Muscat held an account with Emoney, he did not bring any documents with him and noted that he could confirm the existence of this account off-hand.

 Julian Curmi from Trust Payments also testified, providing documents detailing that co-accused David Meli is a director of Winzon Ltd, a gambling company holding an account there.

 The case was adjourned to 8 January 2025, at 10.30am, making this the last sitting for the year.

 Lawyers Francesco Refalo, Rebecca Spiteri and Shelby Aquilina, representing the Attorney General, as well as Inspector Wayne Rodney Borg representing the police, prosecuted.

"Judge orders blanket ban on discussion of Caruana Galizia murder, Yorgen Fenech",maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/131291/judge_orders_blanket_ban_on_discussion_of_caruana_galizia_murder_yorgen_fenech,19-09-2024,007999.png,"A judge has ordered a blanket ban on “writings, declarations or public discussions” on Daphne Caruana Galizia’s murder and Yorgen Fenech outside what happens in court.
 Judge Edwina Grima handed down the ruling on Thursday as she ordered NEWZ.mt to pull down a video blog by Manuel Delia from its Facebook page. The request to sanction the news site was filed by Fenech’s lawyers.
  NEWZ.mt has pulled down the video with a note saying it is doing so “under protest” and is exploring with its lawyers what action to take next.
 In the blog, Delia discussed a previous controversy in which the same judge had ordered Lovin Malta to remove parts of an interview with lawyer Jason Azzopardi, who claimed Fenech was the sole mastermind in the Daphne Caruana Galizia murder.
 The Lovin interview had breached a previous court order that no evidence submitted in the case and which was deemed inadmissible by the court should be published or made reference to in public.
 In her latest decree, Grima used the power given to her by the Criminal Code to prohibit, until the end of court proceedings, “writings, whether printed or not, and declarations or public discussions on the broadcast media and social media, on the crime and the person accused of the crime”.
 The only exception are reports of court proceedings. Anybody found guilty of breaching the court’s order will be found in contempt of court.
 The judge said she was handing down the ruling because “there are people who feel they can breach court orders with impunity”, adding that they believe they have a right to say what they want without considering the serious consequences of their actions. “This is done on the pretext of freedom of expression, which right should not serve as a hindrance to the right to a fair trial in every judicial process,” the judge said.
 The blanket ban raises serious question marks as to whether any reference at all can be made to the Caruana Galizia murder and Yorgen Fenech’s alleged involvement in it when writing or commenting about the case outside the confines of a court report.
 One recent example was a report on Edward Zammit Lewis’s selection as Malta’s nominee for EU court judge where reference to Yorgen Fenech and the murder case were made given that the former was embroiled in controversy a few years back when leaked WhatsApp chats showed he had a friendly relationship with Fenech.
 The judge’s ruling does come, however, after a series of purported leaks over the years from the acts of the case despite a court decree prohibiting the publication of inadmissible evidence.
 Caruana Galizia was murdered in October 2017 when a powerful bomb was detonated inside her car. Three men – George Degiorgio, Alfred Degiorgio and Vince Muscat – are currently serving prison time after admitting their involvement in the crime. They procured, placed and detonated the bomb.
 Another two, Jamie Vella and Robert Agius, are facing ongoing criminal proceedings after they were charged with supplying the bomb.
 Fenech is awaiting trial over charges that he commissioned the assassination.  ",Kurt Sansone ,court_and_police
Taxi driver saves woman from violent assault by her former boyfriend,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/court_and_police/131066/taxi_driver_saves_woman_from_violent_assault_by_her_former_boyfriend_,06-09-2024,008009.png,"The intervention of an unnamed taxi driver would appear to have saved a woman from a violent assault, or worse, at the hands of her ex-boyfriend.
 Msida resident, Santosh Bhandari, 31, a chef from Punjab, India, was arraigned under arrest before magistrate Marseanne Farrugia on Friday, accused of intimidating, insulting and causing slight injuries to his former girlfriend.
  Inspector Audrey Micallef, prosecuting, told the court that the police’s Domestic Violence Unit had received a report from the victim on 4 September.
 The woman had told the police that their three-year relationship had ended 18 months ago, but the man still wanted to control her. The former couple work at the same place and still lived under the same roof, together with two of the defendant’s male friends, she said.
 “Whenever he would see her messaging other men on her mobile phone, he would tell her to keep in mind that she was ‘still his' and threaten to kick her out of both the flat and workplace” explained the inspector.
 Bhandari had been drinking heavily on the night of the incident in question, and upon seeing the woman using her phone, had grabbed both her shoulders and shook her violently, telling her that she was “his and his alone” and that he would not allow her to speak to anyone else ever again.
 Not long after that, the defendant hailed a taxi and insisted on the victim sharing the ride with him. Despite her refusals, the woman ended up complying.
 When the taxi arrived at the flat, after they got out of the vehicle, the defendant had once again grabbed the woman by the shoulders and shook her violently. Upon seeing this, the driver got out of his taxi to help the woman, ending up pinning the defendant down until the police arrived.
 While the police officers were there, they had phoned Inspector Micallef, who heard the man in the background telling the woman several times “I will kill you. Today I will kill you.”
 Her officers also reported that he had a strong smell of alcohol on his breath.
 After ascertaining that they did not need backup, the inspector ordered the officers to bring Bhandari to the Valletta police station, where he was held in the lockup after refusing medical assistance.
 Bhandari initially pleaded guilty to the charges during his arraignment on Friday afternoon.
 The court informed him that he could face up to five years in prison together with a fine of up to €15,000 and gave him several minutes to consult with his lawyer, Alexia Vassallo.
 Addressing the court with the assistance of two interpreters, the man then withdrew his admission of guilt and pleaded not guilty instead. Bail was not requested.

 Manuel Abela, 31, from Zabbar and Spiridione Costa, 59, from Paola, were arraigned days after the fire broke out at the property in the very early hours of the morning on April 15.
 CCTV footage gathered from the scene of the fire confirmed police suspicions that this was a case of arson.
 Video footage showed a man approaching the residence with a large bag in hand. A burnt tyre was later retrieved from the site.
 After the fire broke out at the front door, the suspect fled in a getaway car that was subsequently tracked down in Paola. Footage from that location showed two men alight and enter a house.
 Those men were subsequently identified through daylight footage as Abela and Costa.
 The pair were arraigned and initially pleaded not guilty to a raft of charges.
 When arrested, Abela had a wound on his nose. Medical examination confirmed that was a burn mark, thus further strengthening investigators’ suspicions.
 The men, both unemployed, were jointly charged with arson, causing wilful damage to third-party property, breaching the public peace and disturbing the repose of residents.
 Both were also charged with recidivism.
 Costa was separately charged with reckless and dangerous driving, ignoring a no-entry sign as well as leading a vagrant and idle life.
 Abela was separately charged with disposing of waste material in a public place.
 The proceedings against them continued.
 More recently, the two co-accused changed their plea and registered an admission which they confirmed after being given time to reconsider.
 In light of that admission the court, presided over by Magistrate Astrid May Grima, condemned each of the co-accused to a six-year effective jail term and an order to reimburse the victims €10,454.95 within one year.
 Abela was fined €150 (ammenda) while Costa was fined €500 and banned from driving for six months after serving jail time.
 The court also issued a protection order valid for three years from the time when the accused have served the term of imprisonment and further bound them under a personal guarantee of €2000 for one year.

 According to new information published in the Government Gazette, the Tourism Zones Regeneration Agency recruited several employees last year without any competition and against established rules.
 The employees were given short-term direct contracts, renewed every few months, in what seems to be an approach to bypass rules.
 Between March and September 2023, at least 13 employees were recruited and put on the government payroll through this irregular system, costing taxpayers some €150,000 in salaries.
 Despite the National Audit Office’s warning last year, the minister and the agency’s chairperson, Andre Zammit (a former aide of former Minister Edward Zammit Lewis), have ignored the NAO.
 Last year, the Auditor General said that based on an audit of the agency’s 2021 accounts, Minister Clayton Bartolo’s agency had “serious governance issues”.
 The audit found that in 2021, around 22 individuals were given “relatively short” contracts of service with the agency, which cost €206,000.
 The work was awarded without a call for expressions of interest, and upon expiration, the agreements were “repeatedly renewed”.
 These agreements covered small jobs such as maintenance services, beach supervision as well as light office duties.
 The NAO also found complete disregard for other procurement rules, including several direct-order purchases without the necessary approvals.

         The Office of the State Advocate welcomed the judgment of the Court of Appeal delivered on Monday in a case instituted by Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech.
 ""The Court of Appeal has for the most part confirmed the judgment of the First Hall Civil Court of 11 July 2024, but only varied it to confirm the independence and autonomy of the State Advocate to pursue the right of action arising specifically from Article 33 of the Government Lands Act (Chapter 573 of the Laws of Malta), which is an action wholly different to that which the plaintiffs demanded the State Advocate to institute,"" the State Advocate's office said in a statement.  There have been conflicting interpretations on the court's judgement, with the PN declaring victory for them and for the people of Malta, and the government saying that the PN had not carefully analysed the court's decision before issuing its declaration.
 ""The Court of Appeal firmly rejected the assertion, mistakenly made by some media houses, that the State Advocate was duty bound to proceed with this right of action,"" the State Advocate said.
 The Office observed that the Court of Appeal clarified that the State Advocate is empowered, but not duty bound, to pursue that right of action. According to the Court of Appeal, the State Advocate has the final say on whether he is to proceed or otherwise with that right of action. This discretion naturally includes decisions on the right time and right forum where such actions ought to be brought in the interest of the State, as confirmed by the Court of Appeal in paragraph 46 of its judgment. In fact, the Court of Appeal extended this line of thought to any person empowered by Article 33 of the Government Lands Act, which would include the Hon. Leader of the Opposition and Hon. Dr Adrian Delia themselves.
 ""Following the Court of Appeal judgment of 23 October 2023 in the names of Hon. Leader of the Opposition Dr. Delia vs Hon. Prime Minister Dr. Joseph Muscat et, the Government of Malta instructed the State Advocate, and co-counsel, to claim against Steward in the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) arbitration, amongst other things, the rescission of the contractual framework underpinning the concession relating to the three hospitals. In that arbitration, Government is claiming that the parties to that contractual framework, being, Government and Steward, must be restored to the position they were in prior to the contract (restitutio in integrum) based on Article 1209 of the Civil Code, a position which is contested by Steward in the ICC arbitration,"" the State Advocate said.
 It said that the Government has already made submissions on this issue and has also submitted expert reports on Maltese law and on the quantum of compensation due because of the rescission. The Court of Appeal's judgment of 2 December 2024 is aligned with the instructions given to the State Advocate by Government and implemented by the State Advocate in the pending proceedings.
 ""The proceedings of the ICC arbitration are private, and Government has been advised to keep it so to preserve its position in the arbitration and not to jeopardise its defences and counterclaims,"" the State Advocate said.
 ""Therefore, as things stand today, the State Advocate, on the instructions of the Government of Malta, is already pursuing a defence and claim in the arbitration as contemplated by the Court of Appeal in its judgment of 2 December 2024.""
 The Government of Malta's and the State Advocate's rights and privileges are hereby fully reserved and not waived, it concluded.

 The Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit (FIAU), Malta's anti-money laundering agency, flagged the transactions to the police, according to a report by the Times of Malta published on Tuesday.

 The payments, estimated at around €50,000, were reportedly made over six months by a company linked to an MTA contractor. 

 On Tuesday morning, Prime Minister Robert Abela announced that Bartolo had resigned from cabinet and the PL's parliamentary group following yet another scandal.

 Bartolo, his wife and Gozo minister Clint Camilleri have been dominating the news cycle after a Standards Commissioner report which found that the ministers had abused their power when they awarded Muscat a number of government promotions within their ministries.

 The FIAU investigation focused on Muscat’s work for a company associated with Italian cyclist Valerio Agnoli in 2023. In 2021, Agnoli was hired by the MTA to promote cycling tourism and formalised a €20,000 annual agreement in 2023. 

 Amanda Muscat began working for an Agnoli-linked company in 2023, 18 months after leaving her unjustified ministry consultant role, and ended the assignment in December.

 Investigators believe Muscat’s payments might be tied to an MTA-related kickback. 

 A Tourism Ministry spokesperson had stated this work was unrelated to Agnoli’s MTA contract and that Muscat complied with tax obligations.     ",Matthew Farrugia ,Crime

 The Inquiry Board will be chaired by retired Judge Lawrence Quintano.
  The Board has been tasked with determining the facts and circumstances regarding the professional assistance provided to Ghirxi whenever she sought help or was referred for such assistance by social services for domestic violence.
 This includes an examination of the risk assessment procedures followed.
 Additionally, the Board will make recommendations on whether further measures are necessary in the operation of social services provided to victims of domestic violence.
 This inquiry will be conducted in conjunction with the ongoing investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Board, which is analysing the circumstances surrounding the murder of Nicolette Ghirxi, which happened on Monday 12 August.
 The Board has been given a four-month period to submit its report. The ministry said it will make the inquiry report public.
 Ghirxi was killed by her ex-partner Edward Johnston in her Birkirkara flat, her body found in the early hours of Monday 12 August.
 Her murder sparked widespread debate on whether the police force has the necessary means to prevent femicides and other forms of gender-based violence.  ",Nicole Meilak ,Domestic Violence
Botched raid exposes flaws in Malta’s immigration system,theshiftnews,https://theshiftnews.com/2024/08/19/botched-raid-exposes-flaws-in-maltas-immigration-system/,19-08-2024,000042.png,"Immigration officers broke into an elderly woman’s home based on incorrect information and failed to inform the home owner of the error or fix the damage caused by their botched raid.
 Mario Role’ told The Shift that his brother had visited the home of their elderly mother in Marsa to pick up some clothes when he found the main door broken and left open. The house had been unoccupied since December, when the 95-year-old moved into an elderly home after a fall.
 A piece of wood had been crudely attached to the door in an attempt to fix it. Initially, the family thought a neighbor might have tried to repair the door, knowing the elderly woman no longer lived there.
 A neighbor informed them a few days later that immigration officers had raided the home at 7 am on a Sunday, three days before the family discovered the damage.
 “Someone might have given them an address, and they might have mixed up the road,” Role’ said to The Shift. “But now the Commissioner, the Inspector, or the Superintendent, whoever is responsible, knows whose house it is. They might have had the excuse that they didn’t contact us because they didn’t know whose house it was, but now they do, because we made a report at the police station.”
 He added, “A week has passed, and they still don’t have the decency to call and apologize or to say, ‘Listen, I will send our workers to fix or replace the door.’ Is there a need for us to call the Police Commissioner?”
 Nationalist MP Darren Carabott brought the incident to public attention, claiming that the immigration officers had mistakenly raided the elderly woman’s home based on incorrect information. He criticized the authorities for not informing the family, pointing out that they only attempted a makeshift repair by attaching “two screws and a piece of wood” to the traditional Maltese door.
 Carabott expressed concern about the broader implications of the incident on the community: “Above all, it’s a worrying situation for the entire area. Imagine sitting comfortably at home and hearing this news, knowing that due to a wrong address or incorrect information, they could come into your house and grab you. Consider the anxiety this causes for families living nearby, knowing this happened just a few streets away and could happen to them.”
 “This shows how crucial it is to have a system that works,” Carabott said, “and above all, to take action to restore peace of mind and security to families in this area.”
 In a related issue, TCN Malta, an organization supporting third-country nationals, reported that several individuals were detained at Identity Malta offices during routine biometric appointments despite holding valid visas.
 The arrests occurred due to expired approval-in-principle documents, raising serious concerns about inconsistent and overreaching immigration enforcement.
 TCN Malta has urged its community members to keep their visas current and offered support to those affected by these actions.
 These incidents expose serious flaws in Malta’s law enforcement and immigration systems, raising concerns about misinformation and inconsistent practices and the urgent need for reform.

Ex-Labour MP at centre of ‘benefit fraud racket’ was OPM adviser until last year,theshiftnews,https://theshiftnews.com/2023/09/04/ex-labour-mp-at-centre-of-benefit-fraud-racket-was-opm-adviser-until-last-year/,04-09-2023,000058.png,"The man at the centre of the alleged fraud involving false medical certificates to Labour voters for social benefits they were not entitled to, was an advisor to Prime Minister Robert Abela.
 Former Labour MP Silvio Grixti, elected in 2017 and forced to resign his parliamentary seat in 2021 after being arrested and interrogated by the police, was an adviser to the Office of the Prime Minister (OPM) between 2017 and 2022.
 He was on a €20,500 a year contract signed by Projects Malta, which falls under the remit of the OPM.
 The contract, renewed every year, was for Grixti to provide advice on health and life sciences and later local council projects “with particular emphasis on the south of Malta”.
 His advisory role at the OPM is significant in light of reports by The Times of Malta that many of those seeking Grixti’s false certificates to receive social benefits were directed to the former MP by the OPM’s customer care unit.
 While Grixti’s advisory role started when disgraced former prime minister Joseph Muscat was at the helm, Abela kept him on as he did with James Camenzuli, the key person in Projects Malta, enabling several shady deals shown to be corrupt, such as the privatisation of three of Malta’s public hospitals, which the Court ruled was “ fraudulent“.
 Due to the scandals surrounding Projects Malta, Abela rebranded the agency to Malta Strategic Partnerships Ltd. Its role is the same – to facilitate public-private partnerships – but controversy continues to surround the agency.
 While Abela gave the agency a fresh look, he retained Camenzuli, whose signature is on all of Grixti’s contracts as OPM adviser.
 In 2019, Grixti also served on the medical board of the Lands Authority
 Other ministries and government entities also gave him a number of other consultancy contracts worth tens of thousands of euros.
 These include some €50,761 from Transport Malta, with the latest contract lasting until mid-2022, and €23,123 from the Health Ministry as consultant to Deputy Prime Minister Chris Fearne.

"South American sex workers gave pimps half their earnings, rent and flight costs",maltatoday,https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/court_and_police/130800/colombian_human_trafficking_ring_testify_2,29-08-2024,000061.png,"Two women from Colombia and Venezuela have testified in court proceedings against a Maltese human trafficking ring, describing the way they were encouraged to take up sex work in Malta and how they split their earnings with their pimps.
 Magistrate Donatella Frendo Dimech insisted that the victims be only brought to testify once, warning the prosecution the court would not allow any secondary victimisation of the witnesses. 
  The two women testified by video-link, and form part of some 50 witnesses who are yet to testify in the criminal proceedings against nine individuals who were among 11 people arrested in police raids on 12 August. The defendants are facing charges of money laundering and immoral earnings, apart from other prostitution-related charges. 
 Assisted by parte civile lawyer Lara Dimitrijevic, the two witnesses explained that they were first introduced to the prospect of travelling to Malta by a friend, before leaving on a ticket financed by the Maltese organisation. 
 Once they arrived in Malta, they had to pay back the flight ticket, as well as rent for their apartment – which was shared with other sex workers – and give practically half of their earnings to their pimps. 
 One of the accused, Clint d’Amato, was identified in court as their fixer by both witnesses, who told the court that they knew him as, ‘Elmo’ and ‘Miguel.’ 
 The Venezuelan witness travelled in Malta back in March 2024, with an intention to overstay and enter prostitution at the behest of the traffickers. She said she was promised a good pay “and no problems”. 
 She said she charged clients €100 for one hour of sex work, keeping 55% of her earnings. “The work didn’t have fixed hours. If I woke up at 10am I could start work then. Two, three hours, as much as my body could take.” 
 D’Amato would forward the clients to her, effectively taking calls through the prostitute’s WhatsApp number that was displayed on an online profile page for sex workers. Clients would enter the apartment, explain the services required, and if she refused, they would have to leave. “If I finished working at 2pm, I would message ‘Miguel’ and he would tell me to calculate my dues and leave the money on the table for him.” 
 The witness said she paid some €750 in rent every month, on top of the percentage she passed on to the pimp, as well as the €3,350 ‘loan’ that represented her flight ticket to Malta. “I came here with debt for the flight. So when the client paid me, I took all the money and then I would do the sums and hand everything over to Miguel.” 
 She added that she hoped to raise money to buy a house and pay for an operation for her daughter, “and have a better future.” 
 She said she could see around six clients a day, and potentially earn even up to €1,700 when including tips; by 1 August, she estimated that she was owed €5,000 but that she was not transferred the entirety of those earnings by her pimp. “When the police came to our apartment, I was frightened, even though I needn’t have been. They found my notebook and asked who it belonged to, but I said nothing. I told them it was mine, later at the police station.” 
 She added that new women were moving into the flat, also sex workers. The premises was monitored by small cameras, one inside and the other outside the building. 
 The second witness, a Colombian 20-year-old, recounted a similar experience where an online acquaintance had encouraged her to travel to Malta. 
 The witness revealed she had already carried out sex work in Medellin, explaining that she was described as a ‘company woman’ there rather than a prostitute. She was a beautician by trade but had carried out sex work for people she met on Tinder. Malta was proposed to her as a destination close to Bilbao, Spain, where she would be able to move and leave the sex trade after saving enough, she told the court. 
 She was picked up by D’Amato from the airport upon her arrival, who would also accompany her on €150 outcalls to clients. 
 She, too, was obliged to pay back her flight, which she estimated at around €1,200 (5 million Colombian pesos). 
 Background
 The nine suspects were arrested during an early morning raid last week across various Malta localities on Monday, 12 August. 
 The defendants are: Luke Farrugia, 36, from Birkirkara; Clint D’Amato 36, from Gudja; Denzil Farrugia, 19; Alexandra Suhov Procora, a 32-year old Romanian woman residing at St Paul’s Bay, who told the court she was an accountant; Nicolae Efimov, 37 also Romanian and residing in St Paul’s Bay; Kane Vassallo, 22, from Siggiewi; Luca Emanuele Corito, 21, from Isla; Dylan McKay, 30, from Fgura; and Gordon Cassar, 44 from Żebbuġ. 
 All nine are charged with money laundering, promoting or setting up a criminal organisation, forcing individuals over 21 years of age into prostitution, holding persons against their will in a brothel as bonded debtors, knowingly living off the earnings of prostitution and running a brothel. 
 All accused will remain in custody at the Corradino Correctional Facility for the time being.
 Lawyers Franco Debono, Robert Montalto, Marion Camilleri, Mario Mifsud, Nicholas Mifsud, Charles Merceica, Etienne Borg Ferranti, Kathleen Calleja Grima and Michaela Giglio are assisting the individual defendants.

Parliament’s Standards Committee to decide fate of two Ministers today - The Malta Independent ,independent,https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2024-11-21/local-news/Parliament-s-Standards-Committee-to-decide-fate-of-two-Ministers-today-6736265927,21-11-2024,000094.png,"
                
        

         The Standards in Public Life Committee is to decide the fate of Ministers Clayton Bartolo and Clint Camilleri over an ethics breach in a sitting at 4pm today.
 The parliamentary committee, which is made up of two government MPs and two Opposition MPs, with Speaker Anglu Farrugia as chairman, will be meeting  to decide whether it will adopt the Standards Commissioner report's conclusions, reject them, or request for more information.  The Standards report concluded that Bartolo's then-girlfriend, now wife, Amanda Muscat was given a lucrative job as a Gozo Ministry consultant with a hefty pay rise, even though she did not have the necessary qualifications or expertise.
 Muscat was found to not have even done her job as a consultant, and instead remained Bartolo's private secretary, while receiving a €68,000 salary as a consultant. 
 The Commissioner concluded that both Ministers abused their power and breached ethics in granting her the job and referred them to the Parliament's Standards Committee for sanction.
 The Committee, according to the Standards in Public Life Act, can choose to adopt or reject the report's conclusions, or request for further information.
 If adopted, the two Ministers will be given the opportunity to present submissions before the Committee, before a ruling is given on punishment.
 If the Committee rejects the conclusions, it could request for more information on the report, or people to testify before it.
 The Committee could order the Ministers to apologise, or demand a repayment of any funds that were used improperly, or else recommend any other measure it may deem fit.
 Despite several calls for their resignation, Bartolo and Camilleri have remained at their posts insisting they did nothing wrong, and Prime Minister Robert Abela made it clear that he will not be sacking the two ministers.
 Abela had said that he himself decided to remove Muscat from her role, and the issue was over a ""€16,000"" discrepancy in her salary.
 The Standards in Public Life Committee is made up of Labour MPs Jonathan Attard and Andy Ellul, and PN MPs Ryan Callus and Mark Anthony Sammut, alongside the Chairman, the Speaker.

"Bartolo’s wife suspected of receiving €50,000 kickback for MTA deal – reports - The Malta Independent ",independent,https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2024-11-26/local-news/Bartolo-s-wife-suspected-of-receiving-kickback-for-MTA-deal-reports-6736266054,26-11-2024,000108.png,"
                
        

         Clayton Bartolo's wife, Amanda Muscat, received tens of thousands of euros from a private company which investigators suspect were made as a possible kickback for a contract with the Malta Tourism Authority, the Times of Malta reports.
 These payments were flagged by the Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit (FIAU) to the the police, the newspaper reports.
 The Times quotes sources as saying that payments in the region of ""€50,000"" were made to Muscat by a company linked to a Malta Tourism Authority contractor over a period of around six months.  Clayton Bartolo resigned as Tourism Minister and  was also kicked out of the Labour Party parliamentary group as new circumstances have emerged, Prime Minister Robert Abela said Tuesday. At the time he did not say what they were, only saying that it was linked to questions that the Times sent last week. This scandal was then published.
 The investigation by the FIAU was about work Bartolo's wife had done for a company that was linked to Valerio Agnoli, an Italian cyclist, in 2023. The cyclist was hired by the MTA in 2021 to promote cycling tourism on an ad hoc basis, the newspaper reports. The arrangement was formalised in 2023, with Agnoli being placed on an ""all-inclusive remuneration of €20,000 per annum,"" it quotes a tourism ministry spokesperson as saying.
 It read that Amanda Muscat was hired by a company linked to Agnoli half-way through 2023, around 18 months after her ministry consultancy job was ended, and it states that Muscat's work with the Agnoli-linked company ended in December that year.
 It states that investigators sucspect that the payments that had been made to Muscat could be kickbacks for the Malta Tourism Authority contract.
 The Times quotes a spokesperson for Bartolo as having confirmed that his wife was ""given work on an assignment basis"" by a company connected to Agnoli, and that her work consisted of assisting in cycling related initiatives internationally in Italy and Qatar, among other places.
  ""This assignment had absolutely nothing to do with Malta and bore no relation with the work being done by Agnoli for the MTA.""

Court dismisses AG’s Ali Sadr World Bank tribunal excuses as ‘not binding’,theshiftnews,https://theshiftnews.com/2023/06/14/court-dismisses-ags-ali-sadr-world-bank-tribunal-excuses-as-not-binding/,14-06-2023,000156.png,"The courts have thrown out the Attorney General’s argumentation that a letter from the World Bank’s International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes means Repubblika’s case against the Commissioner of Police over the corps’ failure to arraign a number of key Pilatus Bank officials must be heard behind closed doors.
 In a ruling on Tuesday, Madam Justice Doreen Clarke revoked an earlier decree and ruled the case could continue in public because, contrary to the Office of the Attorney General’s contention, the ICSID’s letter was “not binding” and that the tribunal had not even requested the case be heard behind closed doors in the first place.
 Wholly dismissing the AG’s argument for behind-closed-doors hearings, the court ruled, “…in this letter, it seems that clarification is being made about how, and by whom, publicity should be given to the eventual decision of the tribunal in the arbitration which is being referred to.
 “This letter, however, is neither a decision of the ICSID tribunal nor can it be considered as a decision that is binding on the Maltese Courts on how it should regulate the hearing.”
 The judge upheld Repubblika’s contention that the AG was mistaken in the interpretation it had given the letter and upheld arguments to the contrary by the NGO’s lawyer Jason Azzopardi.
 The case had been initiated in December 2020 after a magisterial inquiry concluded criminal charges should be pressed against a number of high-ranking Pilatus Bank officials.
 Elaborating on the ruling today, Repubblika noted how the Attorney General had received the letter from the international tribunal in December but had “kept it hidden” until it was presented in court months later on March 16.
 The Shift first reported the ICSID case on 17 September, revealing how Pilatus Bank owner Ali Sadr Hashemi Nejad had launched a counterattack on an international level in an attempt to fend off court action in Malta against himself and other bank officials.
 An urgent request had been filed through Alpene Ltd, a Hong Kong-based company owned by Ali Sadr, before the ICSID, which, among other matters, asked for Malta’s proceedings against him and the other related parties, including criminal proceedings, to be suspended.
 The extraordinary request forms part of a wider ongoing case taking place behind closed doors, brought by Ali Sadr-owned Alpene against Malta, where the company is claiming millions of dollars in damages.
 The case was filed 13 days after Police Commissioner Angelo Gafa announced in early August 2020 that the force was close to “solving a big case … which people thought we were doing nothing about”.
 On 20 August 2020, Alpene sent a letter through US law firm Steptoe & Johnson notifying Malta of the existence of a ‘dispute’ and its intention to eventually bring proceedings under the bilateral investment treaty between Malta and China.
 A year later, in June 2021, noting that Malta had ignored its letter, Alpene filed a formal request for arbitration against Malta before the ICSID.
 The ICSID is an international arbitration institution established in 1966 for legal dispute resolution and conciliation between international investors and States, known as investor-state dispute settlement, or ISDS.
 The choice of using his Hong Kong company Alpene and dragging in Malta’s 2009 Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) with China not only offers Ali Sadr protections but also potentially places Malta at odds with China, a country Malta has been increasingly courting for large investments.
 A breach of Malta’s BIT with China would place such investments in jeopardy.
 Alpene claimed that Pilatus Bank was effectively expropriated and that Malta was “engaging in malicious investigations and harassment”.
 Alpene also claimed that threats of criminal prosecutions against Ali Sadr or even leaks of conclusions of criminal inquiries represent continued forms of harassment “in retribution” for bringing the ICSID arbitration against Malta.
 On 14 September, the ICSID accepted Alpene’s arguments and ‘recommended’ a suspension of all proceedings by Malta, including criminal proceedings, that could affect Alpene’s rights under the relevant treaty, including its right to call witnesses such as Ali Sadr, until the tribunal has conclusively decided the case.
 Malta’s courts have now rejected the arguments made by the AG’s Office, which appears to be throwing spokes in the wheels of justice at every fork in the road and the case continues in full public view.

Maltese government reputation laundering aide escapes US extradition,theshiftnews,https://theshiftnews.com/2023/06/17/maltese-government-reputation-laundering-aide-escapes-us-extradition/,17-06-2023,000160.png,"Former espionage expert, consultant, and indirect reputation launderer for disgraced former prime minister Joseph Muscat and the Maltese government, Frank Schneider, has escaped from house arrest in France.
 He has in the process evaded extradition to the US where he was to face charges for aiding ‘cryptoqueen’ Ruja Ignatova in the €4 billion OneCoin cryptocurrency scam.
 Schneider, whose company Sandstone was hired by UK PR firm Chelgate and the Maltese government to produce a misleading report on the Daphne Caruana Galizia assassination, was facing a maximum of 40 years in a US prison on fraud and money laundering charges.
 ‘Cryptoqueen’ Ignatova was no stranger to Maltese shores either, having been company shopping in Malta before later making use of Maltese-registered iGaming companies to move around large sums of money as part of her OneCoin scam.
 She disappeared in 2017 after boarding a flight to Athens having defrauded investors out of €4 billion. Schneider worked as an advisor for Ignatova and served seven months in a French prison after being arrested in April 2021 and was subsequently released under house arrest.
 Ignatova’s OneCoin cryptocurrency scam ran between 2014 and 2016. It tricked customers into investing by simulating crypto transactions to give the impression that OneCoin worked like any other cryptocurrency platform, when purchasers were not in fact buying anything.
 The BBC reports how the former cryptoqueen’s “troubleshooter” could not be located after a fresh warrant for his arrest from Nancy, France’s court of appeal was issued with Schneider having evaded his ankle-tag-enabled electronic surveillance.
 Speaking to the BBC in the months before his arrest, Schneider had claimed he would not be given a fair trial in the US, given the country’s plea-bargaining court system, which he said presumed his guilt. Schneider also maintained he had no criminal involvement with Ignatova, and denied supplying her with confidential police information.
 After consulting for Ignatova, who remains wanted by the US FBI under a $250,000 bounty, Schneider went on to write a report through his company Sandstone, commissioned by former prime minister Joseph Muscat’s emergency PR firm, on the Daphne Caruana Galizia assassination.
 In 2019 the EUobserver leaked parts of the report, which was intended to misdirect and disinform, saying there was reason to believe the President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev and the President of Russia Vladimir Putin had conspired to assassinate the journalist, by way of a Chechen assassin.
 Ironically, Muscat remains close with the report’s scapegoat, Azerbaijani president Aliyev, and is a member of his Nizami Ganjavi ‘think thank’ to this day.
 Schneider’s Sandstone report on Caruana Galizia was commissioned by Muscat’s government through UK public relations consultancy firm Chelgate. Muscat made increasing use of Chelgate’s services, specialising in reputation laundering, crisis management and whitewashing, since he first took the helm in 2013.
 Following their revelatory article, Schnieder filed a criminal libel case against the EUobserver in Luxembourg courts, which threw out the case. The move was widely condemned by multiple press freedom organisations, who labelled it nothing more than a SLAPP suit intended to silence the publisher.

 Magistrate Rachel Montebello decided the 49-year-old doctor from Zejtun should bear the largest brunt of a freezing order against the five accused.
 A general freezing order of €4.5 was issued on Grixti’s assets last April. The other defendants also had a freezing order imposed on parts of their assets and property, but to a different degree.
 Dustin Caruana, 36, from Tarxien, was slapped with a freezing order of €153,000; Emanuel Spagnol, 70, from Zejtun, €90,000; Roger Agius, 46, from Birzebbugia, who served as the former Labour MP’s driver, €60,000; and Luke Saliba, 33, from Msida, has his assets, up to the value of €47,000, frozen.
 All five are facing accusations of defrauding the government of some €6 million in disability benefits through a scheme they coordinated.
 The alleged fraudsters were arraigned last April after years of investigations by the police, started through a whistleblower.
 Evidence indicated that Grixti provided false medical documents to people, mostly Labour voters from the south, to receive social benefits averaging €450 a month for severe disabilities that were fake.
 Apparently, none of the government-appointed medical boards, including medical professionals close to the government, knew what was happening.
 Grixti’s driver, Roger Agius, a government employee, is believed to have played a significant role in the racket. While he asked for whistleblower protection to spill the beans, including on other key government officials involved, including politicians, the government turned down his request.
 Some of the beneficiaries of this racket told the police that they were referred to Grixti by Labour ministers, politicians’ aides and even customer care officials from the Office of the Prime Minister.
 Grixti resigned from parliament in December 2021 after he was arrested and interrogated by the police.

Sandro Craus not suspended from public role despite criminal case,theshiftnews,https://theshiftnews.com/2023/11/26/sandro-craus-not-suspended-from-public-role-despite-criminal-case/,26-11-2023,"000186.png,000187.png,000188.png","The Labour Party Mayor of Rabat, Sandro Claus, facing criminal charges over the misappropriation and theft of public funds in connection with the phantom job given to the fixer of Daphne Caruana Galizia’s assassination, Melvin Theuma, has still not been suspended from his taxpayer-paid position at Projects Plus.
 It is standard procedure in the public sector that any public official facing criminal charges in court is automatically suspended from the job and put on half pay until a final decision is pronounced.
 Instead, Craus is “still attending his work and being given his full financial package”, according to his boss, James Camenzuli, CEO of government agency Projects Plus.
 If found not guilty, the suspended employee is given back his job and paid the remainder of the salary due for the suspension period. If found guilty, the employee is usually fired.
 For some reason, this has not happened with Craus. At the same time, the move could be considered discriminatory to other employees currently suspended on half pay, according to the rules.
 It appears Craus is rarely at work. “The job given to Craus can also be considered a phantom job as he is never here,” a colleague said.
 Contacted by The Shift, after months of avoiding questions on the issue, Camenzuli admitted that Craus had not been suspended.
 Asked why Craus is being treated differently from any other public officer in the same position, Camenzuli said he was following his government entity’s disciplinary code.
 When Robert Abela became prime minister in 2020, Craus, who was at the time disgraced former prime minister Joseph Muscat’s head of customer care, resigned.
 Instead, he was given a job with Projects Plus, a government agency, and put on a €65,000 financial package as chief business development officer even though Projects Plus only handles projects given to it by the government.
 In June 2022, together with Keith Schembri and others, Craus was arraigned in court and charged with facilitating the giving of a phantom job to Melvin Theuma. All involved claim their innocence.
 Lawyers who spoke to The Shift said Craus’ treatment by the OPM could lead to other suspended employees opening discrimination procedures in court against the prime minister and Principal Permanent Secretary Tony Sultana.

"Man jailed for 6 years for robbing elderly shopkeeper, grievously injuring him - The Malta Independent ",independent,https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2023-04-12/local-news/Man-jailed-for-6-years-for-robbing-elderly-shopkeeper-grievously-injuring-him-6736251048,12-04-2023,000196.png,"

 A man was jailed for six years for robbing and grievously injuring an elderly shopkeeper to finance his drug habit, an offence which the court described as ""intolerable in a civilized society"".
 Kevin Cacciattolo, 47, had been charged with the armed robbery of a shop in Msida in August 2018. 
 He was also charged with grievously injuring the 72-year-old shopkeeper, holding him against his will, carrying a knife in public without a permit during the commission of a violent offence and recidivism.
 The elderly man had initially resisted the robber, who then hit him in the head with a metal bar, leaving him bleeding on the pavement. The incident had been captured on CCTV, which had eventually led to Cacciattolo’s identification and arrest.
 Magistrate Ian Farrugia observed that it had been proven that Cacciattolo had driven his car to Msida, parked and then walked towards the shop. “The defendant’s intention was clear and unequivocal - he wanted money at all costs and this because he has an acute drug abuse problem,” said the magistrate.
 Cacciattolo had shown the knife to the shopkeeper, who stepped back behind the counter. In an attempt to defend himself, the shopkeeper had grabbed a chrome rod with a hook at the end, normally used to retrieve items from high shelves, and managed to knock the knife out of Cacciattolo’s hands.
 But the robber had grabbed the other end of the rod, leading to a struggle which ended up on the pavement outside. At one point the rod snapped in two, at which point Cacciattolo attempted to hit the elderly shopkeeper with his end, while the victim tried to fend off the blows with the other half of the broken rod, while shouting for help.
 At one point Cacciattolo had landed a blow on the shopkeeper’s head, seriously injuring him. While the disoriented shopkeeper was recovering, the robber opened the cash register by throwing it on the ground, picked up the knife and around €500 in cash and fled.
 Finding Cacciattolo guilty of the charges, Magistrate Farrugia said “these crimes cannot be tolerated in a civilised society, and when they do happen, society expects to be protected from the criminals who commit them,” said the magistrate.
 The court sentenced Cacciattolo to imprisonment for six years, as well as ordering the seizure of the vehicle he had used during the commission of the offence.
 Inspectors Lara Butters and Clayton Camilleri prosecuted.

"Court rules Yorgen Fenech’s WhatsApp chats not banned, publication permitted",theshiftnews,https://theshiftnews.com/2023/06/03/court-rules-yorgen-fenechs-whatsapp-chats-not-banned-publication-permitted/,03-06-2023,000202.png,"The Attorney General’s request for the Criminal Court to take action against lawyer and former MP Jason Azzopardi has been refused by the court.
 The AG’s request followed a complaint received from the lawyers of Yorgen Fenech, who stands charged before Madam Justice Edwina Grima with masterminding the assassination of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia.
 The lawyers sought to claim on Fenech’s behalf that the chats’ publication violated their client’s right to a fair hearing and his right to private life.
 The source of Fenech’s complaint was a newspaper column written by Saviour Balzan and published in MaltaToday on 15 May.
 Judge Grima ruled on the AG’s request and held that the WhatsApp chats extracted from Yorgen Fenech’s mobile phone were not such that would properly be protected by law, contrary to the AG’s assertion. The court would not, therefore, take any action against them being published.
 In the article on which the AG’s request was ultimately based, Saviour Balzan had claimed that he was facing “constant rumour-mongering, and recently, a blackmail of sorts about WhatsApp chats [extracted from Fenech’s phone] being published” while blaming Jason Azzopardi.
 Balzan wrote how he had reported “the leak of Jason Azzopardi” to the police and provided “hard and irrefutable evidence of Azzopardi passing on privileged information (chats) to third parties”.
 Fenech’s lawyers were quick to pick up on the article and wrote to Attorney General Victoria Buttigieg on 31 May.
 They claimed Azzopardi threatened to publish extracts of the chats “in violation of a court order” and because “the case in question is still before the criminal court of appeal”.
 Fenech’s lawyers seized upon Balzan’s article and asserted that the WhatsApp chats had been extracted from Fenech’s phone and presented as evidence in the case against their client.
 They added that the “uncontrolled sharing of documents has persisted from the beginning of proceedings to today”. They described Azzopardi as having undertaken “consistent actions in disseminating documents that have been sealed by court order”.
 In her application before Judge Grima following receipt of the communication from Fenech’s lawyers, the AG claimed that the WhatsApp chats in question fall under Article 517 (3) of the Criminal Code and asked for appropriate action to be taken by the court to prevent their publication.
 By invoking Article 517 (3) of the Criminal Code, Fenech’s lawyers  sought to have Azzopardi arrested or summoned for contempt of court.
 That provision says that if the Attorney General or the Police “become aware of the publication of any writing in contravention of this article, they shall inform the court by which the order of prohibition was made and shall carry out such directions as the court shall give, orally or in writing, for proceedings to be taken before the court against the offender, either by summons or by arrest”.
 Broadly speaking, Article 517 addresses documents that have had their publication banned by the court and stipulates that anyone found guilty of violating such a ban would be guilty of contempt of the court’s authority.
 Judge Grima, however, dismissed the request outright in a decree she gave the very next day.
 She ruled, without delving into the specific rationale behind the decree, that the WhatsApp chats “do not qualify as a publication which the law speaks of in Article 517 of the Criminal Code, [and] it is considered that no steps can be taken based on the said provision of the law by the Court”.
 The ruling has broader implications than would appear to be the case at first glance.
 In March, author Mark Camilleri published around 2,200 WhatsApp messages between Fenech and former Labour MP Rosianne Cutajar, many of an intimate nature but others that lifted the lid on widespread political graft, corruption and sleaze.
 Cutajar’s lawyers at the time demanded the AG request an investigation into the leaks, which was accepted.
 The police confirmed the messages formed part of evidence filed before Judge Grima in criminal proceedings against Fenech and that they were subject to a November 2021 ban on their publication.
 Camilleri was facing the prospect of imprisonment of up to one month and a fine of up to €4,000 if found guilty.
 It now appears that Camilleri will be able to argue that he has been let off the hook by  Judge Grima’s ruling.  It can be argued that since the substance of the AG’s failed application is inherently identical to the rationale underlying his prosecution, there is no reason to find any criminal liability in his regard.
 In a wider sense, it is becoming even more apparent that the publication of such WhatsApp messages that do not impact the criminal case against Yorgen Fenech should no longer be considered a “no go” area.
 The ban, as interpreted by some, can only be seen, especially in the light of Judge Grima’s ruling, as being excessively restrictive on the fundamental right to information that is in the public interest.
 From what has already been exposed, and from what many media operators know but to date have been reluctant to publish, there is much in the WhatsApp chats that have nothing to do with the Fenech case but which demands to be published in the public interest.

Man threatens former girlfriend after finding messages about him,newsbook,https://newsbook.com.mt/en/man-threatens-former-girlfriend-after-finding-messages-about-him/,15-09-2024,000224.png,"Tista' taqra bil-
 A man, who has recently broken up with his girlfriend, landed in hot water on Sunday after threatening his now ex. The 34-year-old driver from Żurrieq appeared before Magistrate Victor Axiak and was charged with causing his ex to fear that violence would be used against her or her property and of threatening and insulting her. He was further charged with threatening and insulting his former girlfriend’s friend. The accused and the alleged victim had been together for three years and broke up some three weeks ago. They were still meeting and on speaking terms. Inspector Sherona Buhagiar explained that the alleged victim wanted the police to speak to the accused, however, the officers decided to speak to him and arraign him under arrest. The case was described as an isolated incident. It emerged that the man had found messages sent by his ex girlfriend to her friend, in which she had been badmouthing him. The man sought to speak to her friend as a form of closure. The man pleaded guilty to the charges. When discussing punishment, both the prosecution and defence agreed that a conditional discharge would suffice in such case. Lawyer Franco Debono underlined that the man had cooperated fully with the police and had shown remorse. “This was an isolated incident. My client was hurt,” Debono said. He added that the man’s parents were in court and that the accused was employed as a driver. The court conditionally discharged the man for two years. A restraining order in favour of the two victims was issued by the court. Inspector Sherona Buhagiar led the prosecution while lawyer Franco Debono assisted the accused.",Monique Agius,Crime

 D’Amato, 37, from Mosta, an ICT professional and company director, was appointed to the ambassadorial position in October 2020. However, his tenure was abruptly ended once the ministry was informed of his arraignment on serious criminal charges.
 A spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry confirmed the termination with the Times of Malta, stating: “The ministry was informed by the competent authorities that this person was involved in a criminal case, and on the same day, internal instructions were issued to terminate his contract with immediate effect.”
  The termination was communicated to the Cuban Embassy in Rome.
 D’Amato, who spent a week in preventive custody following his arraignment, was released on Wednesday due to a procedural error by the prosecution. He faces multiple charges including human trafficking, money laundering, computer misuse, forgery of official documents, using forged documents, fraud, and making false declarations. The alleged crimes were committed between 2018 and earlier this month.
 During the hearing on Wednesday, the prosecution, represented by Attorney General lawyers Ramon Bonett Sladden, Andreas Vella, and police inspector Karl Roberts, sought to amend the charge sheet to include charges of money laundering, fraud, and document falsification. However, instead of amending the existing charge sheet, they filed a completely new one dated Wednesday, as if starting the arraignment anew.
 Defense lawyers Franco Debono, Alfred Abela, and Karl Cordina strongly objected to D’Amato's continued detention under these circumstances. Magistrate Donatella Frendo Dimech noted that the prosecution had not merely added charges but had initiated a new procedure with the fresh charge sheet. She observed that D’Amato's initial arrest was based on a warrant issued the previous week, and his detention was upheld under the same warrant.
 Ruling that the fresh procedure rendered his continued arrest illegal, Magistrate Frendo Dimech ordered D’Amato's immediate release from custody.
 The case has drawn significant attention, given D’Amato's diplomatic status and the serious nature of the charges. The Foreign Ministry’s prompt action reflects its stance on maintaining integrity within its diplomatic corps. The investigation into the charges against D’Amato is ongoing.  ",Nicole Meilak ,Crime
Transport Malta promotion earmarked for officer in driving tests racket,theshiftnews,https://theshiftnews.com/2024/09/26/transport-malta-promotion-earmarked-for-officer-in-driving-tests-racket/,26-09-2024,"000264.png,000265.png,000266.png","A vacancy for the appointment of a new chief officer at Transport Malta has raised eyebrows among senior officials who believe it is set for an official frequently mentioned in the recent driving tests scandal.
 The newly appointed CEO, Kurt Farrugia, the former spokesman of disgraced former prime minister Joseph Muscat, issued the internal vacancy for a new land transport chief officer.
 Sources at Transport Malta told The Shift that Farrugia was acting on the direct instructions of Transport Minister Chris Bonnet.
 They said the vacancy was tailor-made for Gilbert Agius, a former PN counting hall agent who switched to Labour in 2013, when the Party was elected, and started canvassing various government ministers, particularly those related to transport.
 According to the internal vacancy notice seen by The Shift, the right candidate for the post must have 20 years’ experience in a managerial role in Land Transport and occupy the position of a director or higher.
 “It is only Gilbert Agius who qualifies for such a promotion. They could have been a bit more subtle in this pre-arranged promotion,” a senior Transport Malta officer told The Shift.
 Although Agius was not arraigned in court, his name appears in various chats received by Clint Mansueto  – the alleged brains behind the racket – asking for help for candidates during their driving tests.
 While Agius, as Mansueto’s manager, was supposedly responsible for preventing the scandal, the chats exhibited in court show him as a participant.
 According to chat logs, Agius sent Mansueto details of specific candidates and often made it clear they were important ones: from the MTA chairman “Gavin Gulia’s son” to “Minister (Chris) Cardona’s wife” and the son of then-MTA CEO Johann Buttigieg.
 Another was a “friend of IB”, presumably Minister Ian Borg. One came from “Silvio Grixti”. On another occasion, he flagged a worker for a company close to Labour who had sat for his test seven times.
 According to the chats, in December 2019, Mansueto complained to Agius that the Transport Ministry’s selected were hogging all the driving test spots.
 “I had seven slots, and the ministry swallowed them up in two days,” he told Agius.
 No disciplinary measures were ever taken against Agius over his participation in the alleged racket.

Judgement declared null after delivered in language accused could not understand,newsbook,https://newsbook.com.mt/en/judgement-declared-null-after-delivered-in-language-accused-could-not-understand/,26-09-2024,000271.png,"A man, who was imprisoned for eight months, will have to have his case adjudicated again after judgement was delivered in a language he did not understand. Habte Mariam Tsegethans was arraigned in court over a 2019 incident. He was accused of subjecting a woman to act of physical intimacy. The case relates to an alleged improper conduct by the accused when on 2 July 2019, the man boarded a bus, sat next to the woman and allegedly made sexual advances. The woman had informed the driver and the police were called at the scene. In May 2024, the court, presided over by magistrate Monica Vella, sentenced the man to eight months of effective imprisonment. It also issued a restraining order in favour of the victim for a period of two years. The judgement had been drawn up in Maltese. Tsegethans filed an appeal asking for the sentence to be revoked or varied. The Court of Criminal Appeal observed this was a preliminary judgement regarding the first grievance by the appellant. The man complained that the judgement delivered by the Court of Magistrates should be declared null given that he does not understand the Maltese language as declared in front of the same mentioned court and given that proceedings had to be carried out in the English language. Tsegethans had informed the court through an interpreter that he did not understand the Maltese language but knows how to speak the English language. This was also recorded in the minutes of the case on 1 December 2021. The Court of Criminal Appeal observed that from the records of the case, it seems that the proceedings took place in English until 2 June 2023 when the minutes were drawn up in Maltese. It also emerged that there was no decree ruling that the proceedings should continue in the Maltese language. It was also observed that when the Court of Magistrates delivered its sentence on 3 May 2024, the first court read out the judgement and noted down that the court had explained the consequences and obligations imposed under the judgement both in the English language and in the Maltese language. The appellant had declared that he understood. The Court of Criminal Appeal, presided by Mr Justice Neville Camilleri, noted that the first court might have been aware that it mistakenly delivered a judgement in the wrong language, and felt it was necessary to register in the records of the case that it had explained to the accused, both in the English and in the Maltese language, his obligations vis-à-vis the judgment which was just delivered. “This means that the appellant could not understand the Maltese version of the judgment so delivered,” the Court of Criminal Appeal held noting that the appellant had declared before it that he could not understand completely the Maltese language but he could understand the English language. The Court of Criminal Appeal upheld the first grievance raised by Tsegethans and declared the judgement delivered by the first court as being null. It clarified that the proceedings held in front of the first court were not being declared null but it was only the appealed judgement which was.

"Murdered woman’s family to meet ministers, urge for ‘proper inquiry’",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/murdered-woman-family-meet-ministers-urge-proper-inquiry.1097490,09-02-2024,000273.png,"Nicolette Ghirxi’s relatives are this morning expected to tell three cabinet ministers that they will continue to call for an independent inquiry into her murder.
 Accompanied by their legal representatives, Ghirxi’s siblings are expected to meet Justice Minister Jonathan Attard, Home Affairs Minister Byron Camilleri and Social Policy Minister Michael Falzon at the family affairs ministry.
 Lawyer Joseph Borda told  Times of Malta that neither the police complaints board nor the inquiry announced by the minister for social policy are enough to establish if and how the State failed Ghirxi.
 “Only an inquiry set up by the prime minister can conduct an all-encompassing investigation because article 4 of the Inquiries Act clearly states a minister can only appoint an inquiry concerning a department or statutory body or service, for which he is responsible, whereas the prime minister can appoint a wide-ranging inquiry,” said Borda.
 Ghirxi was murdered late on Sunday, August 11, by her former boyfriend Edward Johnston in her Swatar apartment. Johnston was shot and killed by police after a three-hour stand-off.
 On April 22, Ghirxi had filed a domestic violence report against Johnston but never took a risk assessment. Johnston had previously been involved in two separate police stand-offs in Glasgow and Liverpool in 2012.
 Borda says Monday's meeting was only scheduled after he personally reached out to the prime minister on August 22.  
 He says Ghirxi’s family would like an independent inquiry to establish a wider scope, including, but not limited to, the presence of Johnston in Malta. 
 They also want to be involved in drafting the terms of reference of the inquiry.
 Borda insists that the investigations announced so far are limited and will never lead to a proper understanding of what happened.
 “This is our main bone of contention. The inquiries announced so far will not give the family the answers they seek.  Let’s remove the straightjackets and allow a proper inquiry to shed light on whether the State did everything in its power to prevent Nicolette’s murder,” he said.
 Borda bases his arguments on the Inquiries Act (chapter 273), according to which an inquiry set up by a minister can only look into matters involving “the conduct or management of any department of government or any statutory body” but only “insofar as the matter of the inquiry concerns or affects a department or statutory body or service for which he is responsible or in respect of which he has powers.”
 On the other hand, an inquiry set up by the prime minister can look into any governmental department or body, and their officials, irrespective of the ministry they belong to.
 “We have been saying all along: let the police and the ministry conduct their own internal affairs but this is not what the family wants,” said Borda.
 On August 19, nine days after the murder, the Office of the Prime Minister told Times of Malta that the Independent Police Complaints Board, chaired by retired Judge Geoffrey Valenzia, had been tasked with assessing the implementation of the recommendations arising from the report of the inquiry published on February 23, 2023. 
 “The board will also review the conduct of the Police Force concerning established standard operating procedures and relevant legislation.”
 This development took place after Times of Malta established that Johnston  mocked the police when they summoned him for questioning as he continued to harass his victim.
 Last Wednesday, the social policy ministry launched an inquiry “to determine all the facts and circumstances regarding what professional help was given to Ghirxi, whenever she requested for help”. 
 The inquiry board, led by retired Judge Lawrence Quintano, will also examine the risk assessment procedure.
 FSWS came under fire last week after one of Ghirxi’s close friends and her lawyer told Times of Malta that she had been talked out of taking a risk assessment by the risk assessors.
 Times of Malta published the transcript of a voice note delivered by Ghirxi to her friend.
 Dated April 22, and sent soon after she reached home after filing a domestic violence report at the police headquarters in Floriana, Ghirxi states that “[he] didn’t do the risk assessment because he told me there are no threats but insults. He told me that [the assessment] would score zero, kind of.”
 FSWS denied that its employees  discouraged Ghirxi from taking a risk assessment and published affidavits from the two risk assessors present on the day that Ghirxi went to file a report. 
 Borda hit back: “Although the victim had sought refuge in the State entities and its legal framework, yet she was still murdered, the family was totally ignored and the police and FSWS were more interested in setting up their own internal inquiries while they continue blaming the victim.”

         Another man has been remanded in custody after he was arraigned and charged in connection with a 146kg seizure of drugs reported earlier last week.
 Kurt Scicluna, a 31-year old self-employed chef residing in Zejtun, has pleaded not guilty to a number of charges including conspiracy to traffic drugs, trafficking of cocaine, criminal association, money laundering and recidivism.  No request for bail was made by the accused at this stage.
 Lawyers Kevin Valletta and Maria Francesca Spiteri were present on behalf of the Attorney General. Inspectors Mark Mercieca and Lianne Bonello led the prosecution on behalf of the police.
 Lawyers Roberto Spiteri and Michael Sciriha represented the accused.
 The police earlier said they had arrested a third man in connection with the 146kg drug find at Malta Freeport earlier this month.
 Two others have already been arraigned following the discovery on 13 November.
 The police said that in connection with this case, it has seized considerable amount of cash, luxury cars and jewellery.
 Two men were remanded in custody last week after they were arraigned and charged in connection to a significant cocaine seizure.
 Darren Dimech, 46, and Roderick Camilleri, 44, both denied charges of drug trafficking and criminal association.
 The police said that 105kg of drugs suspected to be cocaine was found behind the driver and passenger in the cabin of a trailer. Further searches in the container at the same port led to the discovery of an additional 41kg of drugs, the police said. This means that a total of 146kg on drugs, suspected to be cocaine, with a street value of €20 million, was found, the police said.

Psychiatrists conclude man behind Labour HQ explosives was in a state of psychosis - The Malta Independent ,independent,https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2024-09-20/local-news/Psychiatrists-conclude-man-behind-Labour-HQ-explosives-was-in-a-state-of-psychosis-6736264278,20-09-2024,000293.png,"
                
        

         A panel of three psychiatrists have concluded that the man accused of planting an explosive device outside the Malta Labour Party’s headquarters was in a state of psychosis at the time and had told them that he had consumed home-made mephedrone and GHB.
 The compilation of evidence against 18-year-old David Brincat from Santa Venera continued before magistrate Kevan Azzopardi on Friday.  Brincat was charged with offences related to terrorism and the illegal manufacture of explosives in connection with the discovery, last May, of an explosive device in a dustbin outside the Labour Party headquarters in Hamrun.
 In a previous sitting, lawyer Nicholas Mifsud, who is appearing for Brincat together with lawyers Mario Mifsud and Lara Attard, had asked the court to order a psychiatric evaluation of the defendant before the compilation of evidence proceeded any further.
 Today the panel of three psychiatric experts appointed by the court presented their report and described the conclusions of their joint assessment of the defendant, whom they had met with twice, in addition to discussing the youth’s medical history with his parents.
  “At the time of the offence, he was intoxicated and in a state of psychosis,” they told the court. “Our conclusion is that he is a vulnerable young man due to use of substances, mental health and neurodiversity, as he suffers from a personality disorder and autism.”
 They assessed that risk of Brincat committing further offences in future “would be high if he doesn’t receive regular outreach from a multidisciplinary team.”
  “He shows little remorse about what happened and could have happened and would require a lot of scaffolding to reintegrate into society and live independently,” the court was told.
  “Mr Brincat told us that he was consuming mephedrone which he was making himself, as well as GHB, and had been drinking a lot of alcohol at the time,” one expert told the court.
 Prosecutor Joseph Camilleri Azarov asked the panel whether this meant that the defendant had been consuming all these substances since 2023, pointing out that the alleged offences required a great deal of preparation.
 The witnesses replied that although they had only been appointed to establish his mental state at the time of the offence, there was also documentation and medical notes about hospital admissions which state that he had been abusing substances.
 The defendant’s parents had also told the panel that they had suspected he was drinking “over seven bottles of beer a day and taking mephedrone every day too.”
 In the months before his arrest, Brincat’s parents had suspected he was suffering from drug-induced psychosis. Brincat would regularly visit a number of pharmacies and was consulting with several psychiatrists, they added.
 Brincat had already been held at the Corradino Correctional Facility for over a month by the time they had been appointed to examine him which rendered drug tests useless.
  “The issue is that many substances which can be abused do not show up on urine tests, particularly synthetic drugs,” said the experts. “Our conclusion is that Brincat was suffering from substance-induced psychosis, a state of insanity probably triggered by substance abuse.”
 One of the lawyers assisting Brincat, Nicholas Mifsud, asked the panel what tests could be carried out to detect GHB and mephedrone.
 Two types of tests could be carried out in Malta: a basic urine test and a more detailed lab assessment of a urine sample. Only the basic urine test had been carried out at the time, and not the detailed urine toxicology testing.  It was too late for this test to be carried out, added the witness.
 But another panel member informed the court that another type of test existed - hair analysis - which could detect drug use for up to a year, but said that it is not available in Malta.
 The court ordered that a hair sample be taken from the defendant and tested abroad, despite its considerable cost, ordering that its results be included in the experts’ report.
 Magistrate Azzopardi explained why he felt this was necessary. “The court needs to take a decision about a serious matter and any help that science can offer will be taken. We are establishing a state of insanity… I would prefer some more certainty.”
 The case was adjourned to October 28.
 Police Inspectors Lydon Zammit and Alicia Scicluna are prosecuting together with lawyers Kevin Valletta and Joseph Camilleri Azarov from the Office of the Attorney General.
 Lawyers Lara Attard and Nicholas Mifsud are defence counsel.

"Hospitals concession instrument for money to pass from ‘state pockets’ to VGH, Steward",theshiftnews,https://theshiftnews.com/2023/10/23/hospitals-concession-instrument-for-money-to-pass-from-state-pockets-to-vgh-steward/,23-10-2023,"000298.png,000299.png,000300.png","Tista taqra dan l-artiklu bil-Malti.
 The Court of Appeal on Monday confirmed the shady 2015 multi-billion-euro deal through which three public hospitals were transferred to Vitals Global Healthcare and Steward Health Care to the detriment of Maltese taxpayers.
 In a hard-hitting decision, confirming the first one issued earlier this year, the Court of Appeal, presided by Chief Justice Mark Chetcuti, reiterated that the deal was “a simulation”, intended to pass funds from state coffers to private persons, rather than to benefit Maltese healthcare.
 Confirming the revocation of all the contracts signed in 2015 on the direct instructions of disgraced former prime minister Joseph Muscat and his collaborators, the Court also increased the weight of its decision, ordering the Maltese government to fork out part of the court fees in the first case, as it was part and parcel of this “very suspicious” deal.
 “The Court (of Appeal) notes that there was collusion between VGH/Steward and top officials of the Maltese government to enter into simulated contracts intended not to provide medical care but for other reasons.”
 Noting that from day one, it was evident that what would be agreed could not be delivered, the Court said that it was mysterious why no due diligence was conducted, both by Steward and particularly by the government, despite it having engaged audit firm RSM in these discussions.
 For many years, RSM carried out the auditing of the Labour Party.
 The ruling once again confirmed that “despite paying many millions through taxpayers’ funds, none of the milestones set in the original concession were reached, the government again colluded with the private investors and made their life easier despite breaching all the concession rules.”
 “The reaction of those who were obliged to look after the country’s interests (the government) when milestone after milestone was not reached was not to seek remedies but to keep giving extensions to VGH and Steward without them giving anything back.”
 The government “continued to pay millions to the concessionaires so that, instead of showing that the agreement was not working, gave the impression that everything was ok”,” the Court said.
 The Court denounced Deputy Prime Minister Chris Fearne’s statement that the transfer to Steward Healthcare was “the real deal”, saying the evidence “confirms the suspicion that the intention behind this concession was not a better medical service but an instrument through which money could flow from the country’s pockets towards those of VGH and Steward.”
 Signed in 2015, the VGH deal raised suspicions from the start as it was signed hastily after a ‘secret’ agreement, later published, before the original tender was even issued.
 Run by VGH and Ram Tumuluri, utterly unknown in the medical field with shady shareholders in many jurisdictions, mostly tax havens, the concession was a non-starter.
 Furthermore, despite the millions of euro paid to it by the government, VGH went bankrupt soon after.
 However, instead of pulling the plug, the government still approved the concession to be ‘sold’ to Steward Health Care (which paid €1) instead of regaining possession of the Gozo Hospital and St Luke’s and Karen Grech in Malta.
 It was only through a long-drawn-out case instituted by Nationalist Party MP Adrian Delia, at the time leader of the opposition, that the court rescinded the concession and returned the three hospitals to the Maltese public.
 Ironically, the government conducted talks on the transfer of the concession with Armin Ernst, the CEO of VGH, who then switched to CEO of Steward.
 Meanwhile, a criminal inquiry on this deal started in 2019, investigating various Labour Party government members, including disgraced former prime minister Joseph Muscat, is ongoing.
 The Shift has also revealed how, in 2020, Prime Minister Robert Abela had already agreed to renegotiate a new agreement with Steward but was stopped at the eleventh hour on the advice of the State Advocate and the Department of Contracts that what he was negotiating was illegal.

"Malta a ‘haven’ for financial crime as state, police and judiciary ‘vulnerable’",theshiftnews,https://theshiftnews.com/2023/09/27/state-embedded-actors-and-private-actors-were-identified-as-particular-risks/,27-09-2023,000318.png,"Malta is a destination and transit country for human trafficking, illegal fauna trade, drugs and a “haven” for financial crime, according to a report published on Tuesday by independent international civil-society organisation The Global Initiative Against Transnational and Organised Crime.
 The “2023 Global Organised Crime Index” report analysed the country’s resilience to organised crime based on its government, judiciary, economic environment and society.
 “The vulnerability to organised crime of Malta’s state, political and executive branches, law enforcement, and judiciary is believed to be high,” it said.
 Overall, Malta ranked 109 out of 196 countries, scoring 5.0 for criminality. It came 19th out of 48 European countries and was given a resilience rate of just 5.13 out of 10.
 The report said, “instances of state capture and infiltration by criminal groups have raised international concerns about how police activities have been hindered by high-level officials concealing connections between the government and organised crime,” with criminals “believed to extract resources from the state through bribes and public procurement.”
 However, regarding the type of criminal actors, state-embedded actors were ranked as the riskiest, followed by criminal networks and private sector actors.
 The report also noted that Malta is a known “haven for tax evasion,” identifying its citizenship by investment programme as particularly problematic.
 The Global Initiative also reported Malta as “a destination and transit country for human trafficking” as “Foreign nationals are trafficked for sexual exploitation or forced labour in industries such as domestic service, massage parlours, nightclubs, construction, and hospitality.”
 The report identified most victims of sexual exploitation as being Eastern European women, with victims of forced labour mainly originating from South East Asia.
 The report also identified Libya as a primary source of human smuggling operations, funnelling irregular migrants toward Malta as a destination country.
 Illegal fauna trade in the form of illegal tuna fishing and bird trading was identified as a “persistent problem”, with “the country being a hotbed for songbird poaching, illegal hunting, and bird trapping,” and illegal tuna fishing “facilitated by corruption and poor oversight.”
 The report claimed Malta was both a transit and destination country for illicit substances, particularly cocaine and cannabis, with the illicit market for the latter drug losing influence due to its partial legalisation in 2021.
 When analysing the country’s resilience to organised crime, the report found that “Corruption remains a concern in Malta, particularly among high-level politicians.”
 Regarding the country’s enforcement, it said, “[Malta’s] police force is severely undermined by a lack of resources, including expert and dedicated investigative capabilities.”
 The report also concluded that “The safety of journalists, press freedom, and access to information continue to be problematic issues in Malta,” noting strategic lawsuits against public participation (SLAPPs) and its “highly polarised” media ownership as particular problems.
 “There is a significant gap between the government and law enforcement authorities, civil society, and opposition parties regarding the rule of law, corruption, and organised crime,” it concluded.
 The 2023 Global Organised Crime Index report follows an earlier edition of the report made in 2021.
 The European Union partly finances the Global Initiative’s work as part of the ENACT programme and the United States Government.

Man jailed for violent Gżira grocery store robbery,newsbook,https://newsbook.com.mt/en/man-jailed-for-violent-gzira-grocery-store-robbery/,19-08-2024,000327.png,"A 37-year-old man from Santa Lucija has been sentenced to two years in prison after admitting to a violent robbery at a Gżira grocery store over the weekend. Wyatt Zammit appeared before Magistrate Yana Micallef Stafrace on Monday, facing charges of aggravated theft and illegal detention. The robbery took place on Saturday evening, 17 August, at approximately 9pm. According to police reports, Zammit entered the store and, after allowing another customer to leave, approached the female cashier. He then pushed her against a wall before proceeding to empty the contents of the cash register. CCTV footage played a crucial role in identifying Zammit, who made no attempt to conceal his identity during the crime. Police Inspector Darryl Farr, leading the investigation, arrested Zammit on Sunday. A subsequent search of his girlfriend’s residence uncovered clothing matching that worn by the suspect during the robbery. Sources close to the investigation suggest that Zammit’s motive was to finance a staggering €7,000 monthly cocaine habit. While this information has not been officially confirmed, it paints a grim picture of the devastating effects of drug addiction. During the court proceedings, Zammit pleaded guilty to all charges. In addition to the two-year prison sentence, he was fined €500 and ordered to repay the stolen €436 within six months. The court also imposed a three-year treatment order and issued a protection order for the cashier and her employer.

Man convicted of importing explosives goes missing - The Malta Independent ,independent,https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2023-08-22/local-news/Man-convicted-of-importing-explosives-goes-missing-6736254267,22-08-2023,000333.png,"

 A man who was convicted of importing explosives and trying to buy lethal poisons over the darkweb is missing.
 The Times reports that Jomic Calleja Maatouk, 36, failed to sign a bail book for a number of days and is now considered a wanted man.
 His partner has also been reported missing, with family members telling authorities they have not heard from her in several days, The Times reports.
 It is suspected that the two have fled the country.
 Calleja Maatouk was jailed for five years in prison in July after a magistrate concluded that he was guilty of importing explosives, document forgery, using that forged document, breaching previous bail conditions and relapsing.
 A court heard evidence of how Calleja Maatouk had tried to buy lethal doses of radioactive material Polonium-210, highly toxic poison Ricin, killer drug Fentanyl and C-4 explosive off a darkweb marketplace. 
 In her judgment, Magistrate Donatella Frendo Dimech had described Calleja Maatouk as “a lethal weapon” who was ready to open “the gates of hell upon whoever he deemed an inconvenience to be eliminated.”
 But he was allowed out of custody after being convicted. According to Maltese law, people who are found guilty of a crime and sentenced to prison time by a magistrate’s court are allowed out of custody if they appeal that decision, pending the final outcome of those proceedings.

39 fined for smoking cannabis in public,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/national/132682/39_fined_for_smoking_cannabis_in_public,10-12-2024,000340.png,"Three years since Malta partially legalised cannabis use and distribution, 39 people were fined for smoking the drug in public, figures tabled in parliament show.

 In one of the cases, the person was smoking cannabis in the presence of children, something that incurs a steeper fine.

 The information was tabled in parliament by Home Affairs Minister Byron Camilleri in response to questions by Nationalist MP Ivan Bartolo.

                     Under the current regime, carrying up to 7g of cannabis in public is allowed but smoking in public is prohibited and can carry a fine of up to €235. Smoking in front of a minor, irrespective of the location, is prohibited and can incur a fine of up to €500.

 The figures also show that 30 persons were arrested because they had more than four cannabis plants at home for personal use. In three of these cases, the plants were grown in the presence of children.

 The law allows individuals to grow up to four cannabis plants at home but these must not be visible to the public and not in the presence of children.

 Camilleri said nine people were arrested because they had more than 50g of cannabis for personal use at their home. The law allows a person to be in possession of up to 50g of cannabis at any one time at home. In two instances, the accused also had minors living with them.

 The Maltese parliament approved a new legal regime in December 2021 to allow people aged 18 and over to use cannabis for recreational purposes. Cannabis is still considered an illegal drug but laxer regulations apply for users thus ensuring the cannabis they consume is safe and does not have to be sourced from the shadow market linked to the criminal underworld.

 Malta’s cannabis law allows users to purchase up to 7g of cannabis every 24 hours, with a maximum possession limit of 50g per month. The cannabis can be purchased from licensed clubs and users have to enrol as members.

 The law also created the Authority for the Responsible Use of Cannabis (ARUC) to oversee the sector and issue regulations, which clubs, known as cannabis associations, have to abide by.

 These associations must be run on a not-for-profit basis and can have a maximum of 500 members each. Users cannot be members of multiple clubs.

 Possession of up to 7g in public is allowed but anyone caught carrying between 7g and 28g of cannabis will appear before a tribunal instead of the criminal court.

 Users can also grow up to four cannabis plants at home for personal use but these must not be visible outside the house.

 The law does not allow minors under 18 to use, carry or possess cannabis.     ",Kurt Sansone ,Crime

 Meanwhile, the chairman, supported by Education Minister Clifton Grima, is resisting the direction given by Prime Minister Robert Abela to appoint another former Labour MP, Jean Claude Micallef, as the new CEO.
 Busuttil was sacked recently following pressure from the retired Judge.
 The Shift is informed the board has not been meeting for a long while, except for informal meetings held behind the CEO’s back.
 The chairman and the board are resisting the appointment of Micallef as CEO, preferring Ryan Borg, the former chief of staff of the education minister.
 The minister is reportedly siding with the board, lobbying for his former chief of staff and Labour councillor in Sliema to be the new CEO.
 While AIMS has recruited some 17 officials in the past months, its work to improve integrity in Maltese sports is nowhere to be seen.
 AIMS is responsible for testing athletes for doping and ensuring they are not taking prohibited substances.
 Concern has been raised about board members appointed by the government who have clear conflicts of interest, which were ignored despite having been pointed out by several sports organisations and athletes.
 The concerns raised mainly involve the vice chairman of AIMS, Kirill Micallef Stafrace, and Lucienne Attard, a member of the board representing the Malta Olympic Committee.
 Both are sports doctors with hundreds of athletes as private clients. They regularly administer medicinal products to their patients to treat injuries and improve their performance and also collaborate with sports organisations.
 These same clients are also potential subjects of anti-doping tests administered by the same AIMS regulator while the two doctors sit on its board.
 Sources said that WADA – the International World Anti-Doping Agency –  has already highlighted the gross conflicts of interest at AIMS. The rules underpinning the Maltese regulator conflict with EU directives.
 The board has, so far, not addressed these issues.
 Apart from his chairmanship of AIMS, the retired Judge, now in his 70s and married to former Labour MEP Marlene Mizzi, was also given two other jobs by Labour.
 Mizzi is also head of the Justice Reform Commission and chairman of the Embryo Protection Authority. These come with three separate monthly cheques apart from other perks, such as a fully expensed car and a full-time driver.
 Mizzi is also regularly appointed to conduct inquiries for the government.
 With all this on his plate, Antonio Mizzi is reportedly rarely present at the agency.
 A former magistrate reprimanded for breaching ethics, Mizzi was promoted to Judge as soon as Labour was returned to power in 2013. He retired from the Bench in 2018.

 Meanwhile, further investigations by The Shift reveal that Ciappara is ‘managing’ her property management business through an unregistered company from her government office while being paid by ARMS.
 ARMS sources said that many of the government agency’s top officials, including board members, have known about Ciappara’s double role for years, which may also have involved other members of the Chief Financial Officer’s team.
 However, none have taken any action due to Ciappara’s role in the governing Labour Party.
 Apart from being one of ARMS’s top officials, Ciappara, an accountant, also doubles as the Labour Party’s official treasurer.
 Miriam Dalli, the minister directly responsible for ARMS, has not yet commented on the latest scandal involving one of her top officials.
 Asked by The Shift to state whether she was aware of Ciappara’s side business and the fact it is being run on government time, Dalli – currently under pressure due to her Enemalta woes – did not respond.
 The minister also refused to say what action is being taken, if any.
 The Shift revealed how Ciappara, the chief financial officer of ARMS since 2018, has been managing JPM Administrators on the side of her top job at the government agency.
 Raising the eyebrows of many inside the company as Ciappara is the only official with direct access to data about the utility bills of properties and businesses around the country, her role at JPM is considered a direct conflict of interest. This is in addition to the fact she manages the business while on duty at ARMS.
 The revelations come only weeks after The Shift revealed a new ‘racket’ coordinated by the Office of the Prime Minister through which customer care officials are contacted by ministries to try to avoid the suspension of water and electricity services to constituents despite overdue bills.
 The Shift was told that Ciappara has the final say at ARMS on which services are disconnected and which get an extended grace period.
 Sources claim that this also puts her in apparent conflict as the private business she manages is also responsible for the settlement of utility bills for common areas in private blocks of apartments, among others.
 Soon after The Shift’s revelations on her private business, the website of JPM administrators taken offline along with its social media pages.
 When JPM was contacted by The Shift, Ciappara answered the call while at her office at ARMS.
 Asked how she was administering her business while acting as ARMS CFO, Ciappara said this was “her private affairs” and hung up.
 She also refused to answer questions by email.
 Discipline at ARMS is the role of the board of directors, currently led by Nadia Pace – a government appointee from Zurrieq – minister Miriam Dalli’s constituency.
 Pace also receives consultancy contracts from Malta Enterprise, also in Dalli’s portfolio.

European Elections 2024: Environment and rising prices dominate Maltese voters’ concerns,newsbook,https://newsbook.com.mt/en/european-elections-2024-environment-and-rising-prices-dominate-maltese-voters-concerns/,03-10-2024,000388.png,"A new Eurobarometer survey has shed light on the priorities that drove Maltese citizens to vote in the 2024 European Parliament elections, with environment and climate change, rising prices and the cost of living emerging as the most significant concerns. In the European Parliament elections held in Malta in June 2024, the Labour Party maintained its position as the leading party, but experienced a significant reduction in its majority. The final results showed Labour winning 45.26% of the vote, a decrease of 9.03 percentage points from the previous election, securing 3 seats (one fewer than before). The Nationalist Party made substantial gains, increasing its vote share by 7.12 percentage points to 42.02%, winning 3 seats (one more than previously). Notably, independent candidate Arnold Cassola gained significant support with 4.88% of the vote, an increase of 3.69 percentage points, though not enough to win a seat. Other parties and independents, including Imperium Europa, Conrad Borg Manché’s new party, and Volt Malta, also contested but did not secure any seats. The election saw a turnout of 72.98% of registered voters, with the final tally narrowing Labour’s majority to just 8,500 votes. The European Parliament’s “EU Post-Electoral Survey 2024”, conducted between June and July 2024, reveals that the environment and climate change (40%) topped the list of topics that encouraged people in Malta to vote, followed by rising prices, cost of living (36%). According to the survey, other topics which were high on the list of voters in malta included democracy and the rule of law (32%) migration and asylum (29%), Social protection, welfare and access to healthcare (28%) and the international situation (27%). The survey also showed a significant percentage of non-voters, with 27% of Maltese respondents not participating in the elections. In the 15-24 age group, there was a dramatic increase in those citing a “lack of trust in politics” as a reason for not voting, jumping by 38 percentage points. This suggests a growing disillusionment with the political process among Malta’s youth. Interestingly, this age group also showed a marked decrease in citing “rarely or never vote” as a reason, indicating that their non-participation is more likely due to active disengagement rather than apathy. When it comes to decision-making, Maltese voters appear to be more decisive than the EU average. 55% of Maltese respondents said they had “always voted like this”, compared to 45% across the EU27. However, this represents a 19 percentage point decrease from the previous election, suggesting a shift towards more fluid voting patterns. The data also shows that older voters (55+) in Malta are more likely to have consistent voting habits, with 65% saying they always vote the same way. The reasons for party choice in Malta reveal some interesting trends. The most common reason, cited by 41% of respondents, was that the party’s proposals on European issues aligned with their ideas or values. This was closely followed by alignment on national issues (41%) and habitual voting for the same party (38%). Notably, there was a significant decrease (23 percentage points) in those citing habitual voting as a reason compared to the previous election, further supporting the trend towards more flexible voting patterns. The data also shows that younger voters (15-24) were more likely to be influenced by specific proposals and less by habit compared to older age groups. Despite these concerns, the survey revealed a generally positive view of the European Union among the Maltese public. A strong majority, 88%, believe that Malta has benefited from EU membership, with 90% feeling that EU decisions have an impact on their daily lives. Additionally, 74% of respondents expressed optimism about the future of the European Union, a figure notably higher than the EU-wide average of 65%. On the other hand, the European Parliament’s “EU Post-Electoral Survey 2024” reveals that rising prices and the cost of living are the foremost concerns for citizens across the EU, with 42% of voters highlighting these issues as their primary motivation for participating in the June elections. Similarly, 41% of voters expressed concern over the broader economic situation. The data illustrates the pressing need for policymakers to address these economic challenges, which are increasingly shaping voter behaviour across Europe. Democracy and the rule of law also played a significant role in the decision-making process for 32% of voters, reflecting the growing importance of governance and accountability in the minds of European citizens. Environmental concerns and climate change were noted by a further 34%, indicating that while economic concerns dominate, issues surrounding sustainability remain relevant. For those who abstained, many cited the same economic concerns as potential reasons for not voting, with 46% mentioning the cost of living as a major factor, demonstrating that economic instability is a shared issue across both voting and non-voting populations. European Parliament President Roberta Metsola emphasised the significance of this high voter turnout and the clear mandate for the new European Commission to prioritise these issues, ensuring that the EU continues to deliver tangible results for citizens in the areas of economic growth, democratic integrity, and security.",Jurgen Balzan,Crime
"Malta’s anti-trafficking efforts still lack muscle, US report says",maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/national/130776/maltas_antitrafficking_efforts_still_lack_muscle_us_report_says,20-08-2024,000402.png,"The arrests of an organised crime ring of human traffickers last week came in the wake of yet another United States government downgrade of Malta’s efforts in meeting minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking.
 Malta remains on the U.S. Department of State’s ‘Tier 2 Watch List’ in its annual report for 2023 – the same position since 2012 – which once again found that the government was not meeting minimum anti-trafficking standards despite “significant efforts to do so”.
  The diplomatic language employed berates Malta for not demonstrating overall increasing efforts with previous years, despite having established a specialised trafficking investigation unit, a specialised anti-trafficking working group to guide coordination, and an additional hotline for victims to receive referrals to services.
 In fact, the Trafficking In Persons report said the government had investigated fewer trafficking cases and initiated fewer prosecutions against suspected traffickers.
 The U.S. report says sex traffickers exploit foreign national and Maltese women and also children, and labour traffickers exploit foreign men and women.
 Women from Southeast Asia were profiled mainly as domestic workers, foreign women work in massage parlours, and women from Central and Eastern Europe, Russia, and Ukraine working in nightclubs were vulnerable to trafficking.
 Refugees and asylum-seekers residing in Malta are also vulnerable to trafficking in the country’s informal labour market, including in the construction, hospitality, and domestic work sectors.
 According to the US report, Malta had actually decreased law enforcement efforts.
 In 2023, law enforcement initiated nine new investigations, compared with 12 investigations in 2022 and 16 in 2021. Seven investigations were for sex trafficking and two for labour trafficking. Six investigations remained ongoing from prior years.
 The Attorney General’s Office (AG) initiated criminal proceedings against two suspects for labour trafficking in 2023, a decrease compared with six prosecutions initiated in 2022.
 A previously acquitted labour trafficker was convicted on appeal from the AG in 2023, which included a significant sentence; this compared with one conviction for labour trafficking in 2022 and zero in 2021.
 And according to the U.S. report, official complicity in trafficking crimes remained a significant concern, even though no investigations, prosecutions, or convictions of government employees allegedly complicit in trafficking crimes had taken place.
 Perennial issues with rule of law and an understaffed police force also hampered prosecutions and convictions. Courts were overturning trafficking convictions on appeal for administrative technicalities. After the conviction of two traffickers in 2019, courts initially overturned the conviction in 2020 for failure to adhere to court procedure, and in 2023 overturned the conviction a second time because the case was tried in the incorrect court. Courts ultimately upheld the conviction of two traffickers in December 2023, via a plea deal, and sentenced them to significant sentences; an appeal from a third trafficker in a separate case was also upheld, which also included a significant sentence.
 The report’s trafficking experts also believe untrained judges were dismissing cases or pursuing crimes with inadequate penalties when physical violence and injuries were not sustained by trafficking victims.
 On the judicial front, it said anti-trafficking training for judges remained inadequate and courts continued to frequently overturn trafficking convictions on appeal for administrative technicalities.
 It also said Malta did not report efforts to effectively enforce labour regulations to prevent recruitment fees charged to workers, which increase workers’ vulnerability to trafficking. And no concrete efforts to increase oversight and regulation of massage parlours were registered.
 Victim protection
 In 2023, Agenzjja Appogg, a government office within the Foundation for Social Welfare Services (FSWS) that provided national assistance to trafficking victims, identified 16 victims, while police identified two.
 Of the 18 total victims, police formally identified six trafficking victims and the other 12 victims remained potential victims.
 Of these victims, traffickers exploited nine in sex trafficking, three in both sex and labour trafficking, and six in labour trafficking, including one for forced labour, one for forced criminality, and four for domestic servitude.
 All identified victims were adults – 17 women and one male – and foreign nationals.
 In its 2021 report, the Council of Europe’s anti-trafficking committee GRETA stressed the government’s failure to convict traffickers, and the absence of effective, proportionate, and dissuasive penalties undermined efforts to combat human trafficking and victims’ access to justice.
 In October 2023, the government established a specialised human trafficking investigation unit comprising four staff and a backup unit to assist as needed, but no trafficking-specific training was given to judges in 2023 despite sustained concerns related to gaps in judges’ knowledge of trafficking crimes
 In a joint action with Europol in December 2023, the specialised trafficking investigative unit partnered with immigration authorities to inspect three locations in Malta. Five Nigerian women for immigration violations in a location known for commercial sex, but no potential victims were identified.
 Experts encouraged separate inspections for the trafficking investigation unit and immigration authorities, as fear of deportation often deterred potential victims from engaging with law enforcement.
 Police said they continued to screen for sex trafficking indicators among individuals in commercial sex, including conducting outreach at several massage parlours and a prison in 2023 – however, the lack of interpreters hindered their efforts, and no victims were identified.
 There are concerns by civil society groups that police did not proactively identify trafficking victims in massage parlours, apart from a lack of oversight and regulation on the licensing of such parlours, which had a higher likelihood of sex trafficking occurring.
 Additionally, the government decreased funding for prevention and continued to lack coordination among ministries.
 In 2023, the government allocated €50,000 to the Human Rights Directorate (HRD) for prevention efforts, including continuing to draft a new anti-trafficking NAP and raising public awareness. This was a significant decrease compared with €300,000 allotted by the government in 2022, 2021, and 2020.
 The U.S. report says that the government was still not addressing key gaps in prosecution or victim identification and assistance.
 Fraudulent labour recruitment 
 Fraudulent labour recruitment remained a significant concern, with estimates of foireg nationals employed in low-earning vocations, increasing to some 100,000.
 The Employment Agencies Act (EIRA) regulates labour recruiters but does not allow workers to be charged recruitment fees by employment or recruitment agencies, even though many agencies illegally charged such fees.
 To address this, the government passed new regulations effective in April 2024, that gave the government the option to prohibit recruitment companies from operating if they charged a recruitment fee, withheld identity documents, or impeded freedom of movement and job transfers.
 However, in a report published by the Auditor General in January 2024, the office concluded labour inspectors responsible for implementation of employment laws took a lenient approach toward compliance and did not effectively enforce the law.
 The report also found applicable penalties were not sufficient to deter violators, which created exploitable gaps in enforcement.
 Experts urged the government to enforce the law prohibiting fraudulent recruitment and recruitment fees charged to workers.

"MaltaToday survey: Pensioners give budget thumbs up, PL trusted more than PN on finances, economy",maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/data_and_surveys/125967/maltatoday_survey_pensioners_give_budget_thumbs_up_pl_trusted_more_than_pn_on_finances_economy,12-11-2023,"000446.png,000447.png","MaltaToday Survey respondents are split between those who feel Budget 2024 has left them in the same position as before (30.4%) and those who have seen an improvement (29.8%) in their financial position. 
 Only 13% of respondents replied that they were negatively impacted. But the budget is perceived differently by different categories, with over-65s, whose pensions have been boosted by a minimum of €15 a week, being the most likely to feel a positive impact on their life. In fact, among this category an absolute majority of 51% has seen a positive impact.  
 But despite a substantial increase in children’s allowances and a record COLA increase, the budget has not quelled dissatisfaction among those aged 36-50, the age group which is most likely to include struggling families with dependent children in the middle of their careers. 
 In fact, among this group only 15% have seen an improvement in their personal finances, while 16% think that they are worse off after the budget.  
 A substantial 35% replied that their position has remained ‘the same’ while 32% replied don’t know. 
 Similar trends are exhibited among those aged 16-35, among which 42% replied that their situation is unchanged, while 30% replied ‘don’t know.’ 
 The high percentage of ‘don’t knows’ in both categories in an indication that many are still waiting to see how the budget measures actually play out in a reality marked by inflation. 
 The politically strategic category of non-voters, amongst which 37% replied don’t know is also in a wait and see mode. Therefore, Labour’s chances of recovering support in this category also depend on whether inflation will continue eating away the increments included in the budget.

 PL more trusted on finance and economy  but relative majority trust neither party 
 Which political party do people trust with running the country’s economy and finances? A MaltaToday survey has found that a relative majority trust neither the Labour Party nor the Nationalist Party. 
 The survey shows that 41% have little faith in either of the two parties in parliament but the PL is trusted more than the PN by a margin of more than 10 points. 
 The findings show that 35.1% of voters trust the PL to run the country’s economy and finances as opposed to 24% who trust the PN. 
 The PN’s lack of gravitas on this crucial aspect of governance is further underlined by the fact that 12% of its own 2022 voters – and 11% of its current voters – trust Labour on the economy and finance. Additionally, 40% of PN voters in 2022, and 33% of current voters, say they trust neither party on this issue. 
 But the PN also fails to make any headway in convincing non-voters, amongst which the vast majority (72%) say they neither trust the PN nor the PL on this issue. However, even in this category, more say they trust Labour (17%) than the PN (11%). 
 Significantly Labour is trusted more with running the economy and finances by those aged over 65 (49%) and least trusted by those aged 16-35 (25%). The latter category of voters is the least likely to remember life under previous PN administrations. 
 Yet despite widespread disenchantment with Labour’s economic model, the PN scores dismally among under-50s, where just 18% trust the PN more than Labour with the country’s economy. Among both the 16-35s, and 36–50-year-olds, the absolute majority trust neither party. 
 Indeed, 36-50-year-olds are more likely to remember PN administrations than younger voters and are slightly more inclined to trust Labour on the economy and finances than those aged under 35 (28% compared to 25%). 
 On the other hand, a staggering 57.2% of 16-35s trust neither party with the economy in an indication of widespread disenchantment with the economic model among younger people. Disenchantment with both parties on their economic policy is only slightly lower among those aged 36-50 (54%) but drops to 32% among those aged 51-65 and to just 21% among over 65s. 
 The PN gets its best score among those aged 51-65 (32%), yet trust in its ability to run the country’s finances drops to 21% among the elderly. This suggests that while inflation has robbed Labour of one of its most powerful arsenals among younger respondents, its efforts to sustain pensions and welfare are more appreciated by the oldest demographic. 
 In an indication that disenchantment with Labour’s economic and fiscal policies is greater among the middle-class than among the working-class, a relative majority of secondary educated respondents (41%) trust Labour compared to only 23% of respondents with a university degree. 
 But the PN has not managed to convince middle-class voters that its economic and fiscal policies are any better. In fact, 51% of those with a tertiary education and 55% of those with a post-secondary level of education trust neither party with running the economy and the country’s finances. Trust in the PN’s ability is lowest among those who continued their studies after secondary level but who do not have a degree. In this category only 18% trust the PN in managing the country’s economy compared to 25% among the tertiary and secondary educated.  
 This suggests that working-class voters are more likely to appreciate the emphasis in the budget on boosting incomes of low-income earners and vulnerable groups while middle-class voters, particularly those in the lower middle class are feeling excluded.

 Finance Minister passes the budget test 
  Clyde Caruana has passed his budget test with voters giving him an average score of 2.9 out of five. 
 MaltaToday respondents were asked to rate Caruana’s performance from 0 (lowest score) to 5 (highest score). 
 The results suggest he enjoys a favourable rating across a wide category of voters. Among non-voters Caruana manages to scrape the pass mark by clinching a score of 2.6. Predictably Caruana gets his lowest score (2.4) among 2022 PN voters and among current PN voters (2.2) and his best score among current (3.8) and 2022 Labour voters (3.5). 
 A breakdown by age shows the finance minister clinching his best score among over 65-year-olds, amongst which his rating reaches the 3.1 mark in what could be an indication of Labour’s focus on sustaining pensions in recent budgets. 
 But in an indication of growing dissatisfaction among the middle and working classes, Caruana’s score falls to a respectable but lower 2.7 among those aged 36-50 – the most likely to feel the pinch of inflation amid budding family burdens and mid-career peaks. 
 A breakdown by education also shows Caruana getting his lowest score among those who continued their studies after secondary level but did not attend university (2.7). 
 On a regional level Caruana gets his best in score in Gozo (3.2), a toss-up region which is pivotal for Labour’s majority.
 Methodology
 The survey was carried out was carried between 1 November 2023 and 9 November 2023 for which 637 people opted to complete the survey.  Stratified random sampling based on region, gender and age was used.  A fraction of those who opted to complete the survey chose not to answer a few of the questions for which they are treated as missing values.  Missing values analysis was then carried to determine the type of technique to replace the values. A combination of logistic and linear regression with predictive mean matching was used to replace certain missing values completing and enlarging the sample set from which the final results were extracted. The margin of error for this result 3.85% for a confidence interval of 95%.  ",James Debono ,Crime
Eastern Region designated as Cultural Region for 2024 - The Malta Independent ,independent,https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2023-08-28/local-news/Eastern-Region-declared-2024-Cultural-Region-6736254427,28-08-2023,000452.png,"

 The Eastern Region will be the Cultural Region for 2024, the Ministry for National Heritage, the Arts and Local Government said on Monday.
 A quarter of a million euro has been allocated to the Eastern Regional Council to facilitate the organising of various cultural activities to take place during the upcoming year, in collaboration with the relevant local councils.
 The localities which form part of the Eastern Region include Birkirkara, Pembroke, Swieqi, Pieta, Gharghur, Lija, Msida, Ta' Xbiex, St Julian's, Sliema, Iklin, and Gzira.
 Minister for National Heritage, the Arts, and Local Government Owen Bonnici said that this is an investment in the local talented artists and creative minds, not just an investment in local cultural activities. Bonnici said that the Eastern Region will be the second region to conduct a cultural calendar following the Southern Region's cultural calendar in 2023. ""In total, 14 cultural activities have been staged so far and it is believed that nine more will be staged in the Southern Region."" He added that this initiative will leave an important legacy for strengthening the cultural fabric.
 Parliamentary Secretary Alison Zerafa Civeli regarded the scheme with success. She spoke about the activities and cultural initiatives which were organised within the Southern Region and the resulting appreciation for Maltese culture. She said that this initiative allows for the preservation of culture and heritage for future generations.
 Permanent Secretary Joyce Dimech said that the Cultural Regions scheme has allowed for substantial parts of the cultural strategies of the six regions to be implemented and thanked those involved in the project.
 President of the Eastern Regional Council Anthony Chircop said that the Cultural Region title will provide the Eastern Region with a platform to show its unique identity. He said that they are committed to implementing lasting initiatives with the active involvement of the community. ""In the cultural program we will honour our historical roots and traditions while celebrating the diverse heritage that forms our foundation."" He added that they will also celebrate diversity and will emphasise the unity between cultures and generations.

Changing the Local Plans in isolation will facilitate more development – NGO insists on debate - The Malta Independent ,independent,https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2024-11-20/local-news/Changing-the-Local-Plans-in-isolation-will-facilitate-more-development-NGO-insists-on-debate-6736265891,20-11-2024,000454.png,"
                
        

         A number of resident groups and NGO Il-Kollettiv have said that any review of the Local Plans must not lead to further development, whilst reiterating their proposals in favour of a comprehensive planning reform, the NGO said.
 Noting statements made by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, ""the groups remarked that a review of the Local Plans without a suspension of development in rationalisation zones would effectively lead to more construction,"" Il-Kollettiv said in a statement.  ""Moreover, the government should introduce measures to enforce the protections in the Local Plans, and eliminate the various loopholes in secondary policies such as the DC15 and its annexes, which have led to a spate of applications for tall buildings on UCA borders.""
 The groups have already called on the Prime Minister and Planning Minister to discuss the thirteen proposals sent to them in July. ""Besides a moratorium on the rationalisation zones, residents have called for a suspension of large projects, the enforcement of buffer zones around UCA, the refusal of applications for new roads opening virgin land for development, a suspension of the DC15 reform presented in February 2024, and the publication of revised DC15 and SPED policies by the Planning Authority,"" the statement read.
 ""The Prime Minister and his Cabinet have been insisting that Local Plans cannot change, now the tune is starting to change. We wonder if this is a way to justify the shambolic way in which the change in the St Julians Local Plan is being carried out, or a ploy to further weaken the protection afforded to our towns by the Local Plans,"" said Wayne Flask, Secretary of il-Kollettiv.
 ""It's worrying to hear the Prime Minister implying that rationalisation zones are here to stay. These are the main source of anger for many residents, especially in towns where the borders are no longer recognisable, and whose identity is being rapidly lost to development. In Zurrieq and the surrounding region, the plan is to create one huge agglomeration of built-up land, which will result in the destruction of the green belt, lead to more congestion, and generate overpopulation.""
 Back in July, the resident groups held a press conference in Zurrieq where they highlighted the issues in their towns. They then wrote to the Prime Minister and Planning Minister, ""in a letter signed by the Għaqda Residenti taż-Żurrieq, Għaqda Storja u Kultura Birżebbuġa, Għaqda Storja u Kulturali Marsa, Inħarsu Santa Luċija, Residenti tal-Imqabba, Residenti tal-Qrendi, Residenti ta' Ħal Safi, Residenti tas-Swatar, Siġġiwin Nieħdu Azzjoni, Sliema Residents Association, Marsaskala Residents Network, Marsaxlokk Heritage, Wirt iż-Żejtun and il-Kollettiv.""
 No reply has been received yet, the NGO said.
 ""The groups call on the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition for a serious discussion on their points for a planning reform, also noting how both major parties have publicly admitted their availability to meet big developers,"" Il-Kollettiv said.

Patients’ screening results erroneously revealed in printing malfunction,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/national/129188/patients_screening_results_erroneously_revealed_in_printing_malfunction,14-05-2024,000455.png,"A number of clients received their National Screening Centre test results in addition to data pertaining to other clients on the other side of their result letter, due to a printing malfunction.
 The minister for health said a number of clients had erroneously received data pertaining to other clients on 13 May, with a same-day investigation revealing that the service provider commissioned to print and mail the test results had suffered a technical malfunction in the printing equipment.
 It transpiredthat a batch of test results from the National Screening Centre were erroneously printed on double-sided paper.
 The ministry instructed the primary health department to file a Data Protection Breach notification with the Information and Data Protection Commissioner for further investigation on its part.
