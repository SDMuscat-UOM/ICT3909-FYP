MCAST students plead for end to union dispute,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/mcast-students-plead-end-union-dispute.1094123,20-06-2024,004719.png,"Final-year students attending the Malta College for Arts Science and Technology said the ongoing union directives have left them feeling unmotivated, anxious and stressed, as they do not know when they will be provided their results.
 For the past month, all staff at MCAST have been following directives issued by the Malta Union of Teachers, after talks over the new collective agreement failed.
 No exam and assessment results are to be provided to students, and no marks will be uploaded onto any platform due to directives. Staff have also been asked to limit communication with students, management and administration.
 “Students are left in the dark and overwhelmed with the situation,” Jordan Galea Pace, a final-year Business Enterprise student told Times of Malta.
 “Students have spent years studying, trying to move forward, and now the uncertainty kills our motivation. Without marks, students cannot apply for masters or internships abroad, and some cannot start working either.”
 Galea Pace, the newly elected vice-mayor of Swieqi, is also a student representative at MCAST’s Institute of Business Management and Commence and has experienced first-hand how the directives have impacted his colleagues.
 “Two course mates, both young men, were in tears in the hallway because they were so anxious and nervous about not receiving their marks and feeling unable to do anything,” he said.
 He said he knew of students who handed in their thesis without receiving any feedback from their tutors.
 Similar directives were ordered last year over the delayed collective agreement. The directives were eventually suspended in January by the union following progress in its discussions, yet those talks came to a halt in May.
 The Commissioner for Education urged the government and Malta Union of Teachers to resolve their dispute at MCAST. While the commissioner acknowledged the fundamental right of educators to engage in industrial action to voice their grievances, it should not cause harm to students.
 Prospective students might have second thoughts about applying for a course with MCAST because of the directives, Galea Pace said.
 Daniela Iraci, another Business Enterprise final student said she was meant to have her viva-voce exam (an exam where students defend their thesis and research), but she has received no feedback if she passed her assessments or exams.
 “I feel bummed because I studied at MCAST for five years and finally I have concluded my studies but with no sight of marks if I have passed or not,” she said.
 “I am supposed to feel relieved after all this hard work but it feels like I did all this for nothing. I understand that lecturers deserve better conditions, but this is just cruel.”
 Nursing students Kylie Mercieca, 20, and Martina Farrugia, 21, raised the alarm about how the directives prevent them from starting their careers as nurses, especially at a time when the shortage of nursing staff needs to be addressed.
 “As aspiring nurses, we have dedicated years of intensive study and clinical practice to serve our community and join the healthcare system,” Farrugia said.
 “The government has always highlighted the important role nurses play in our healthcare system and has encouraged the need to address staff shortage. Yet, this current matter contradicts everything, leaving us in limbo.”
 Mercieca said she and her coursemates were supposed to know if they were going to graduate next week, but thanks to the directives they were still waiting for their dissertation marks.
 “The directives have caused undue stress and anxiety. The removal of assessment marks heightened my anxiety. Not knowing my academic standing made it difficult to stay motivated and confident.”
 The lack of communication with her lecturers, and not receiving any feedback or guidance,  left her feeling alone and unsupported.
 Martina Farrugia said living in the “constant fear of the unknown” has affected her greatly, as she waits for the results of two assignments and her dissertation.
 “In the short run, it is affecting us students, but in the long run it is going to affect everyone, as everyone needs healthcare, and with this crisis, the patients are also going to suffer,” she said.
 The Education Ministry told Times of Malta that MCAST has a financial proposal prepared to be presented to the MUT with the condition that the union immediately suspends the directives.
 “The MUT is refusing to withdraw the directives to the detriment of the students,” a ministry spokesperson said.
 The MUT said there were no updates about the situation.

MUT and government agree on second draft of sectoral agreement,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/mut-government-agree-second-draft-sectoral-agreement.1094538,27-06-2024,000346.png,"Updated 1pm with minister's comments
 The Malta Union of Teachers have concluded another draft agreement about educators' work and pay conditions with the government and will be asking their members to vote on it next week.  
 The agreement will determine conditions for educators in state and church schools.
 The teachers’ union had already reached agreement with the government last May, but union members expressed dissatisfaction with the conditions on offer.
 MUT then froze a vote on the agreement and returned to the negotiating table. 
 That first agreement included a raft of other proposals including revised starting salaries for kindergarten teachers (KGEs) and learning support educators (LSE), quicker salary progression, a one-off payment of €1,000 and an additional allowance of €2,000 for those with more than 20 years' experience, among others. 
 Basic salaries would have stayed the same under the proposed changes, with pay increases effected through increased allowances.
 On Thursday morning, the teachers’ union said in a statement ""discussions with the government have been concluded, and updates have been included in the new sectoral agreement text”. 
 The details are not yet clear and Times of Malta has reached out to the Education Ministry and the MUT.
 From Monday, the union will be holding meetings with teachers so that they can see a physical copy of the agreement. 
 MUT educators will then have between Thursday and Saturday to vote on whether they approve of the latest version of the sectoral agreement.  
 Education Minister Clifton Grima said he was looking forward to seeing the closure discussions within the union so that educators can start to benefit from an unprecedented new agreement.  
 “I welcome the news that the MUT now feels it can go back again to its members with the draft agreement,” he said.   
 The agreement not only shows respect for educators but also a substantial improvement in conditions, he said.  
 Contacted for comment MUT president Marco Bonnici said that the teachers' union negotiated for amendments to reflect members' requests.
 Negotiations over the agreement have been ongoing for months and reached a boiling point in November when a one-day strike was held. 
 Matters also came to a head in spring when MUT said it was considering resorting to industrial action again.

"Ban hunting within 200m of schools, Birdlife says, after protected bird is shot",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/birdlife-asks-ornis-committee-outlaw-hunting-200m-schools.1099178,10-08-2024,"000422.png,000423.png","Birdlife has called for hunting to be outlawed within 200 metres of schools after a teacher found a protected European Honey-Buzzard shot close to a Rabat school.
 A teacher who heard rustling in bushes found the protected bird on Monday near the Archbishop’s Seminary, a primary and secondary school.
 Birdlife said the teacher first tried to contact the Environmental Protection Unit but they were unable to help him. Birdlife volunteers then intervened and took the bird to a vet for medical treatment.
 The bird conservation NGO said such illegal hunting could be significantly reduced if schools were declared bird sanctuaries with a 200m buffer zone surrounding them.
 It has now pitched the idea to the Ornis Committee – a government-run committee which it sits on and which is responsible for advising the government on hunting and trapping-related issues.
 “We don’t anticipate any opposition from its voting members,” said BirdLife Malta CEO Mark Sultana.
 “Schools should be places where students can learn to appreciate and connect with wildlife, not where protected species are gunned down just outside their grounds.”
 Birdlife said the Honey-Buzzard was the 22nd shot bird its volunteers have recovered since September 1, when the autumn hunting season began. The police recovered various others, it said.
 Of the 22 birds Birdlife volunteers found, 12 were birds of prey, including species such as Eurasian Hobby, Lesser Kestrel, Common Kestrel and Eleonora’s Falcon.
 “In the last two weeks alone, seven European honey-buzzards have been rescued. Other targeted species include Common Greenshank, night heron, grey heron, little egret, Common Hoopoe, European bee-eater and European turtle dove,” the NGO said.

Stephen Vella appointed new principal and CEO of MCAST,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/stephen-vella-appointed-new-principal-ceo-mcast.1097890,09-10-2024,000515.png,"Stephen Vella has been appointed the new principal and CEO of the Malta College of Arts, Science & Technology (MCAST), the college announced on Tuesday. 
 Presently holding a deputy principal role, MCAST said that Vella was selected following a call for applications in June. They said that he brings with him over two decades of experience in vocational education and a strong track record of leadership within the college. 
 He was educated at Savio College and Stella Maris College and read for degrees at the University of Malta and Falkirk College of Arts in Scotland. He also holds an MBA from the Henley School of Management.
 Vella started teaching graphic design and photography at the Salvatore Dimech School for Craftsmen in 1993 and he was appointed deputy director of the institute in 2003. 
 He has held several roles at MCAST throughout the years, being appointed Director of the MCAST Institute for the Creative Arts in 2008, Head of the Technical College in 2015, General Manager at MCAST Gateway to Industry in 2017 and Deputy Principal for Business Development and Communications in 2021. 
 Vella replaces Joachim James Calleja, whose removal from the post made headlines when he was told that his contract would not be renewed. 
 Calleja had previously complained to the Ombudsman’s Office claiming his dismissal was unlawful and politically motivated.
 Commissioner for Education Chief Justice Emeritus Vincent De Gaetano, concluded that the circumstances of the case showed that Calleja’s dismissal was “both unreasonable and unjust.”

MCAST students to get exam and assignment marks,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/mut-drops-mcast-directives-union-government-continue-negotiations.1094588,28-06-2024,000733.png,"Students at MCAST are to get their exams and assignment marks, after the Malta Union of Teachers dropped marking-related directives following negotiations. 
 All other directives in place at the college remain in place. 
 In a statement on Friday, the union said the two have agreed on a way forward regarding these negotiations, that will lead to a “satisfactory conclusion” of the agreement. 
 Schedules and meetings have been set, and the union has suspended marking directives.
 Other directives that remain in force include an order to student support services staff to not answer phone calls or act on any communication from administration and management, excluding emergencies and crises.
 Student mentors have also been ordered to ignore any communication from management and refuse to attend outreach sessions with students.
 In a Facebook post, Prime Minister Robert Abela said he was satisfied that the discussions held with MCAST students and MUT members bore fruit. He said while the talks on the collective agreement will continue, students will be provided with their marks to provide them peace of mind. 
  The dispute made headlines over the past few weeks, as MCAST students had raised their concerns about how the situation has impacted them negatively, as exams had been cancelled and their marks remained in limbo until the eleventh hour. 
 The Commissioner for Education also urged the government and MUT to resolve their dispute at MCAST.
 Last week, MCAST principal Joachim James Calleja confirmed his contract was not renewed by the Education Ministry, amid reports he was sacked.
 Calleja previously told Times of Malta that some three weeks ago, the ministry informed him in writing that his contract, which was up for renewal, was not going to be renewed.

Wish you weren't here? MTA to ask residents how they feel about tourists,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/wish-werent-here-mta-ask-residents-feel-tourists.1091830,21-06-2024,"000942.png,000943.png","Residents across Malta and Gozo are to be asked about their views on the impact of tourism on their lives.
 The Malta Tourism Authority (MTA) has issued a call for tenders to carry out a survey of 600 people in June. The authority has estimated the cost of the survey to be at around €10,000.
 Residents will be asked if they agree with a series of positive and negative statements on topics including whether respondents benefit economically from tourism to whether it causes crowding in bathing spaces. 
 And while the MTA has not indicated how the findings of the survey will be used, it comes at a time of heightened concern about mass tourism across the continent.
 A record three million tourists visited Malta in 2023, according to the MTA, with 40% of visitors coming from Italy or the UK. 
 According to the call issued on Thursday, the successful applicant will “carry out a study for the MTA to better understand the residents’ perceptions and attitudes towards tourism activity on the Maltese Islands.”
 A provisional set of questions issued with the call sheds light on the topics the authority is interested in.
 Residents will be asked to indicate how strongly they agree or disagree with statements such as: “Tourism makes me want to work to keep the Maltese Islands special”, “Tourism helps me pay my bills” and “Tourism fosters a sense of 'community spirit' within me”.
 Residents are expected to be asked if they think tourism helps preserve the country’s heritage and environment, whether it worsens traffic issues and causes overcrowding.
 And they are also likely to be asked whether Malta should remain a tourist destination, if the country should aim to attract more tourists and whether “the positive benefits of tourism outweigh negative impacts”.
 A final set of questions will be supplied to the winning bidder when the tender is concluded.
 Tourism is an important economic driver in Malta and has regularly been touted as a measure of the country’s success by various governments.
  While the government has indicated it wants to attract more “quality tourism” and higher-spending visitors, other parts of Europe have recently tried to stem the tide of visitors, concerned that mass tourism is overly impacting residents.
 Last year, Sardinia introduced a cap on the number of visitors to its pristine beaches, while Venice recently introduced a €5 fee for day-trippers visiting the famous city.
 In July, Amsterdam banned cruise ships from entering the city centre in a bid to curb visitor numbers and pollution. The same month, Dubrovnik in Croatia introduced an educational ‘Respect the City’ campaign and Portugal introduced fines of up to €36,000 for playing loud music at popular beaches.
 When contacted, a spokesperson for the Tourism Ministry said the results of the survey would help the MTA ""to form an opinion, plan and formulate future strategy.""
 He said the survey was being undertaken as part of the government's 2021-2030 strategy and as part of the activities of the Malta Tourism Observatory ""aiming at developing a sustainable tourism industry for the future.""

 From September to August – the most recent ‘precipitation year’ – only 249.8 mm of rainfall was recorded. This is less than half the amount normally registered over the same period.
 Rain was recorded on 58 days out of the 366 days in the precipitation year, totalling “295.5 mm below the climatic norm,” the Met Office said.
 Only 1948 was drier - when just 230.7 mm of rain fell.
 Most months saw below-average rainfall, with only last month registering above-average precipitation, exceeding the monthly norm by 3.5 mm in one downpour on August 22.
 Meanwhile, July was the driest month of the year with no rain recorded at all for the second year in a row, while October last year was the driest such month on record with only 0.2 mm of rain.
 November “offered some relief” however, with 53.6 mm of rain “providing much-needed hydration for crops after a dry start to the rainy season”, the Met Office said.
 That month was also home to the wettest day of the year, when 26.4 mm of rain fell on November 22.
 Over the past 12 months, Malta was hit by 14 thunderstorms and experienced three bouts of hail in November, January and February, with the latter seeing social media flooded with images and videos of ice blanketing the streets.
 Each year, the Met Office - which celebrated its 100th anniversary two years ago - releases reports on the previous precipitation year, which runs from September 1 to August 31.
 Last year's analysis for the preceding precipitation year showed the summer months of June, July and August were all drier than average months.
 According to the Met Office weather forecast on Friday afternoon, the weekend is expected to be cloudy with showers predicted on Monday. Peak temperatures are expected to hover between 26 and 27 degrees Celsius.

 The order - which comes into effect on Monday - forms part of a raft of directives issued by their union after talks over the new collective agreement failed.
 Sources told Times of Malta the Malta Union of Teachers has registered a dispute with the college and issued directives after negotiations failed mainly due to the financial aspect of the agreement.
 Lecturers, student mentors, senior research officers, technicians, learning support educators, student services, directors and deputy directors have all been told to follow directives. 
 The action is the same one that the union ordered late last year over a delayed collective agreement. Consequently, MCAST students  walked out of their lectures in January, protesting the action.
 The directives were eventually suspended by the union following progress in its discussions.
 Those talks continued, however, they reached a dead end this week, with MCAST management and the government remaining adamant in their position. 
 Sources said the same situation was being experienced at the Institute for Tourism Studies.
 Student support services staff has meanwhile been ordered not to answer phone calls and not act on any communication from administration and management excluding emergencies and crises.
 They were also ordered not to issue new referrals or assign new cases unless they were deemed high-risk.
 Student mentors have also been ordered to ignore any communication from management and refuse to attend outreach sessions with students.
 All lecturing grades- whether full-time or part-time lecturers - have been asked to withhold assessment marks from students, colleagues, internal verifiers, and management. Marks will not be uploaded onto any platform.
 The staff has also been asked to refrain from any invigilation duties.
 This means that lecturing grades will not distribute or collect assessment papers and will not monitor students to ensure they do not copy during tests.
 The directives also limit communication with students, administration and management.
 Communication with students will be strictly limited to scheduled lectures and designated contact hours. This includes emails, MS Teams and any other online platforms outside of these scheduled times.
 Lecturing grades have been instructed not to attend staff meetings except for those that are timetabled and part of the contact teaching load.
 This directive also includes any CPD meetings organised by MCAST.

'Will you worship me?': Santa Cement statue greets students at UoM faculty,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/youll-worship-me-santa-cement-statue-greets-students-uom-faculty.1098787,30-09-2024,"001652.png,001653.png","Santa Cement, the 'patron saint' of concrete and rapid development, debuted at the University of Malta’s campus on Monday.
 Nearly two metres tall, the statue is now greeting students and staff at the entrance of the Faculty for the Built Environment, with a slogan reading: ""Will you worship/adore me (ħa tadurani)?"".
 The statue, created by recent architecture graduate Karl Sammut and student Julian Cassar, is a statement about Malta's ""addiction to cement"" and rapid development.
 “We want students to be aware of the local situation when it comes to the Maltese construction industry and we urge them to address it rather than hide or be afraid to act,” Sammut said. 
  Santa Cement was built during a summer workshop held by the Society of Architecture and Civil Engineering Students.
 The theme was ‘Escape,’ and Cassar and Sammut’s group focused on what many in Malta long to escape from: relentless concrete development.
 Their creation, called ‘Min Ħexa Mexa’, or simply Santa Cement, reflects this frustration.
 They hope the structure stays in the faculty for at least a year:
 “The statue serves as a physical reminder to do better, design better and avoid being pushed around in an industry often run by bullies"".
 Freshers’ Week is usually known for its flashy commercial displays, but Santa Cement stands out as a more direct, thought-provoking statement.
 The duo hopes the statue encourages more activism by students: “Student organisations don’t realise how much power they hold or, if they do, they just do not utilise it"".
 “A student’s voice, free from political ties, can be a powerful force for change.”

 MCAST students plan to hold two separate protests on Wednesday to raise awareness about the impact of an ongoing dispute between lecturers and the government. 
 The Institute of Creative Arts students are planning a 'protest picnic' on the road between MCAST's Mosta campus and Lidl for 11.45am on Wednesday.  
 In a statement, the students said there was ""deep frustration and uncertainty"" among students due to industrial action by the Malta Union of Teachers. 
 Separately, another protest endorsed by Kunsill Studenti MCAST (KSM), will kick off at 11am at the Students' House Piazza on the MCAST Paola campus.
 Students from MCAST Qormi will join their peers in Paola, staging a carcade on their way to the protest to demand urgent action.
 The directives mean students have had marks and grades withheld and assignment briefs for the upcoming year have not been verified. 
 Staff are also banned from communicating with management and students outside designated hours.
 ""With teachers on strike since October 4, 2024, students feel their educational futures are at risk as they await government intervention while their academic progress is severely compromised,"" the Mosta MCAST students said. 
 ""The situation has become difficult for many students, prompting them to consider dropping out as they navigate the implications of the union's directives.""
 The Paola and Qormi students meanwhile said the unresolved directives threaten to jeopardise their career prospects, limit their chances of progressing within their courses, and reduce their employability.
 ""These longstanding issues have left students feeling exhausted and frustrated, with no clear resolution in sight.""
 Among other directives, the union ordered lecturers to avoid communication with MCAST administration and students outside of designated contact hours, to boycott events and not show up for extracurricular activities and school ceremonies, to refrain from disclosing assessment marks to students or management, not to show up for staff meetings, to limit work to essential tasks like teaching and to halt research activities, including providing support for students who are doing their theses.

Teachers must now get written permission to speak to the media,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/teachers-now-get-written-permission-speak-media.1100394,11-02-2024,002032.png,"Updated 5.30pm with PN statement 
 Teachers must now get written permission before speaking to the media and have to tell their bosses what they intend to speak about.
 The rule forms part of Circular DES 28.2024, sent out by the Education Ministry in late September, and applies to educators at all levels. 
 According to the policy, educators who obtain permission to speak to the media must ensure that their comments reflect Education Ministry policies and objectives and refrain from promoting their personal opinions or making statements that might be perceived as politically biased. 
 Any educator who breaches the policy will be referred to the department for educational services, for ""review and ensuing action"". 
 The rules apply to all forms of media appearances - from TV shows to podcasts, written media and radio - related to educational matters. 
 Authorities say the policy is important to maintain professional standards in education and safeguard the integrity of the educational system. 
 But it has prompted concerns about self-censorship and restricting teachers' freedom of expression, as well as warnings that educators who are also politically active - in political parties, NGOs or other community initiatives - have been effectively muzzled. 
 The directive effectively extends restrictions placed on civil servants - who are also forbidden from speaking to the media without permission - to teachers, academics and heads of schools across the country. 
 Michelle Attard-Tonna, a faculty member at the University of Malta’s department of education, stressed that teachers, like other public sector workers such as doctors and architects, were already regulated by the Public Service Management Code (PSMC) - a code of behaviour for civil servants.  
 ""My question is if they [other professions] also received similar directives and if they think that such a directive makes sense in a democratic society,” she said.  
 “If we want a level of ‘quality education’ - because that is the buzzword at the moment - then we cannot gag the mouth of the teachers; it’s one or the other.”
 Teachers’ union UPE said on Friday that it wants the directive to be withdrawn.
 The Union of Professional Educators said it has written to the director general of educational services, Ritianne Borg Saliba, to outline their concerns about the circular
 It has also asked the Education Ombudsman to investigate it, taking up a request made by independent candidate - and academic - Arnold Cassola. 
 Cassola, who has branded the directive a ""fascist"" one, had a request for the Ombudsman to investigate it rebuffed, on grounds that he is not employed by the Department of Education - a prerequisite for such an investigation.
 Shadow Education Minister Justin Schembri has also asked for the ombudsman to investigate.  
 In a statement the PN said the circular ""stifles the freedom of expression of every educator as an individual and citizen by stating that no educator may voice their personal ideas on the field of education and dictates what may be said"".
 Lawyer and former MP Jason Azzopardi has also been critical of the new rule, saying it effectively muzzles educators and that it suggests the government ""is afraid of its own shadow.""
 The UPE said it has similar concerns about the directive, saying it breaches freedom of expression provisions in the constitution and would effectively work to create an atmosphere of self-censorship among educators, driving them to avoid speaking to the media for fear of reprimand.
 “The restrictions imposed by the circular not only harm individual rights but also deprive society of the insights and expert opinions of educators, which are vital for informed public discourse,” the UPE said.
 Union chief Graham Sansone told Times of Malta that the restrictions were ""unheard of"". 
 ""Is the government saying union officials who work in schools can't speak? That educators involved in politics can't speak? That educators in NGOs have been silenced? 
 
 ""The circular makes it clear all these can't speak freely and say what they think,"" he said. 
 The UPE has now instructed its members to actively assert their right to openly engage with the media, saying it would back them in opposing the circular. 
 It has issued a directive to that effect. 
 Activist group Il-Kolletiv also condemned the directive, saying it was “incomprehensible”.
 “Its only aim is to silence the diversity of voices within education,” said NGO president Jeanette Borg.
  The organisation noted a pattern of work to silence critical voices within the sector – from an ongoing dispute at MCAST to a controversy that erupted at University during freshers’ week.
 “A state that silences its academia is a totalitarian, cowardly and paranoid one,” Borg said. “The minister has no right to silence teachers because he feels threatened by criticism.”

 The government and the Malta Union of Teachers have reached an agreement for a collective agreement for educators, following months of negotiations.

 Following the agreement, ""the MUT will now present the new sectoral agreement to its members for approval,"" a joint government-union statement said. 
 Details about the agreement remain a closely guarded secret and the deal will remain under lock and key: teachers who wish to know its terms before casting their vote will only be able to read the agreement at MUT offices, under supervision. 
  In a statement by MUT, it said members whose grades are included in the agreement and who are in employment with state or church schools are to register to participate in the online vote on the agreement.
 Members also have the opportunity to attend a face-to-face meeting, where MUT will present the agreement to its members. 
 The meeting will be held on Thursday May 30 at 4pm, and attendance is on a first come first served basis due to the capacity of the meeting venue. Another meeting is planned for Gozo. 
 The deadline to register is Wednesday May 29 at 9am.
 No date for a union member vote has been set yet. 
 Negotiations have been ongoing for months and reached a boiling point in November when a one-day strike was held. 
 Matters also came to a head earlier this month when MUT was considering resorting to industrial action again. 
 Then last Friday, the union issued an ultimatum giving the government a week to conclude the sectoral collective agreement for teachers of government and Church schools.
 Since then, there has been progress in negotiations, Education Minister Clifton Grima said. 
 On Friday morning, Grima said the MUT and the government had been meeting almost daily for the last week. 
 ""I have personally attended some of those meetings,"" he said.

 Some 52,000 students returned to schools this week, along with some 11,200 educators. 
 Visiting a number of schools on Wednesday, Grima said it was time for students to once again embark on their education journey. 
 “More than ever before, this journey will be increasingly focused on the well-being of both students and educators,” he said. 
 “This is because we believe our education system must support people’s development while keeping their humanity at the heart of it all.” 
 Graham Sansone, head of the Union for Professional Educators, said the fact that the new collective agreement signed between the Education Ministry and the MUT had not yet been made public was giving rise to anomalies that were frustrating teachers. 
 “The discussion of these anomalies under lots of secrecy has given way to delays that see teachers failing to benefit from certain benefits they should benefit from as per the new agreement,” he said. 
 “School management is also being kept in the dark about special leave and allowance and who exactly is entitled to it.”
 Sansone also noted that while the complement of teachers has been satisfied accordingly, teachers have been given a maximum workload, particularly in middle and secondary schools.
 He also said it was positive to note that the Msida primary school had finally been completed as the model for all future schools, despite the project having been promised in 2013.
 In his address to teachers ahead of the start of the school year, Malta Union of Teachers President Marco Bonnici said the profession should prioritise love, reminding educators of the joy of loving their work, themselves, each other and their students. 
 He said it was a joy to meet educators who spoke passionately about their subject and about sharing their love with others.
 On the other hand, educators who suffered injustice often lost the love they had for teaching which weighed down their work
 Bonnici said the profession was blessed with altruistic people who gave all they had to serve others. However, they must also remember to love and take care of themselves as well as others, even if this required seeking professional help. 
 Professionals should also remember to love and respect each other and refrain from engaging in petty rivalries, jealousy, suspicion and other aspects that can harm workplaces and poison relationships, he said. 
 Ultimately, Bonnici said it was always important to remember the love teachers had for their students, which kept the profession going. 
 For most students, school was becoming the point of reference on which they modelled their behaviour, and therefore, educators should be sensitive towards the role they played in their pupils’ lives. 
 “Human contact is decreasing and some are not bothering to look for it,” Bonnici said. 
 “But we have an obligation to keep up human contact with our students and give them what no electronic equipment can give them: love.”

Swieqi boosts night patrols to target anti-social behaviour,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/swieqi-boosts-night-patrols-target-antisocial-behaviour.1096082,08-06-2024,002350.png,"The police have stepped up patrols in Swieqi following complaints from residents about vandalism by tourists and partygoers from nearby Paceville.
 A spokesperson said that both foot and Rapid Intervention Unit (RIU) patrols have been increased during the night, to curb antisocial behaviour.
 In the last few weeks, Swieqi residents have shared videos and photos on social media showing people smashing car mirrors, broken glass littering the streets and people defecating or urinating on pavements.
 Mayor Noel Muscat and deputy mayor Jordan Galea Pace have been calling for police patrols in Swieqi and for the police station to be opened at night.
 Opened in 2014, the station has been operating as a ‘Community Policing Office’ since August 2020, with a focus on deploying officers on the streets. 
  The police spokesperson said this strategy aligned “with public preference”. A national statistics office survey indicated that 80% of people prefer a visible police presence, while 20% prioritise having a nearby station “which, in this case, is located in Balluta Bay, St Julian’s”, the police said.
 Crimes like broken mirrors and smashed windows fall under the category of ‘damages’ and there have been 27 such reports up until June this year, including 18 cases of hit and run.
 Statistics covering the last 20 years show a peak of 107 damages in 2013 and a significant drop since 2019 when the police received 65 reports of damages, with the numbers falling in each subsequent year.
 It is not clear whether the drop in reports is partly due to the pandemic, which led to a decrease in tourist numbers, or if the station’s conversion to a policing office resulted in fewer reports.
 However, the police attribute significant improvements in crime prevention over the last two decades to the enhanced use of intelligence-led policing and crime data analysis, which have informed targeted policing strategies.
 The spokesperson added: “The substantial decrease in crime can also be attributed to improved cooperation between police departments, particularly the contributions of the Community Policing Team, which has been active in Swieqi since August 2020.”

Gaming sector generated more than €1.3 billion last year,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/gaming-sector-generated-13-billion-last-year.1101229,19-11-2024,002381.png,"The gaming sector’s contribution to the economy grew to more than €1.3 billion last year while the number of new gaming licenses halved, according to an annual report from the industry watchdog.
 Drawing on National Statistics Office (NSO) figures, the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) said the Gross Value Added (GVA) of the sector grew by €55 million, a rise of 4%.
 GVA measures the economic value that each individual sector contributes to a country’s economy.
 But while the sector’s revenue increased, the number of new gaming licenses dropped by half while the number of terminated licenses almost doubled.
 While 31 new licenses were issued in 2022, last year this dropped to 15 as the number of licenses revoked by the MGA jumped from six to 11.
 The authority said it issued 28 warnings against gaming operators last year and almost €173,000 in administrative penalties, including one settlement of €66,500 from a company offering unlicensed gaming services.
 Meanwhile, administrative penalties issued by the Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit (FIAU) - which carried out almost half of the anti-money laundering and financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) checks on gaming operators - reached almost €1 million.
 
 The MGA said seven operators were discovered to be in breach of AML/CFT compliance following 28 interviews conducted by the authority and the financial intelligence agency.
 Inspections of land-based gaming establishments totalled more than 9,500 but fell by a fifth when compared to the year before, with the biggest drop seen in the number of inspections of controlled gaming premises hosting electronic gambling devices, such as slot machines.
 The MGA carried out 1,661 inspections of controlled gaming premises last year, a drop of 15% from the year before and the lowest number of inspections since 2021, when the authority inspected more than 2,200 such premises.
 Meanwhile, 49 websites were found to have “misleading references” to the MGA, with 23 failing to remove the references despite being notified by the authority, which reiterated it regularly published details of such websites to stop consumers falling for “scams”.
 Gaming establishments in Malta continued to see a rise in popularity last year, with Maltese casinos registering over 225,000 new players, an increase of more than 50,000 from the year before.
 Casinos were also visited more last year, with the number of visits to such establishments increasing by more than 130,000 to reach over 925,000.
 Turning to ‘responsible gaming’ – tasked with making sure players gamble for entertainment rather than as a source of income – the authority said it assisted almost 4,500 players last year who reached out for assistance, a drop of around 700 from the year before.
 
 The MGA said it carried out checks on 72 responsible gaming-themed websites and sent out 41 letters to operators identifying issues and areas they could improve.
 Meanwhile, the authority said it received 255 suspicious betting reports from operators and collaborated with law enforcement and sporting bodies on 34 requests for information related to “manipulation of sporting events or violations of sporting regulations.”
 It said it dealt with 45 requests for information from international organisations within the EU and 32 from outside the bloc while making a total of 42 international requests to other organisations.
 Citing an EY study, the authority said almost three-quarters of gaming operators expected to see their revenue increase next year, with more than half saying they expected employment to increase over the next two years.
 Gaming companies also expect to spend more on legal and professional services, technology, communications and marketing services, however.

Architecture faculty finds last-minute solution to avoid teaching in tents,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/architecture-faculty-finds-lastminute-solution-avoid-teaching-tents.1097847,13-09-2024,002411.png,"A study space has been found for architecture students who were previously told they would have to carry out workshop sessions in a “marquee tent”.
 The faculty of architecture has secured a lease for two halls at Campus Hub in Msida, according to the dean, Marc Bonello.
 Students in architecture and civil engineering had raised concerns about the proposal to work in a tent, saying it would be hot in summer and cold in winter.
 The Campus Hub halls will be available at the start of the new academic year, which begins this month.
 “There will no longer be a need to provide a marquee tent for the master’s students, whose design project workshop sessions will be now held within the two spaces at the Campus Hub,” Bonello told Times of Malta.
 Around 50 students will be attending the design workshops at the new location. Undergraduate students are unaffected and will continue holding their workshop sessions within the faculty building.
 Design workshop sessions are typically held in a large studio space where students can freely interact with their tutors on design projects.
 Last month, master’s students in architecture and structural or civil engineering were told design workshop sessions would be held in a marquee tent in the campus courtyard.
 The alternative arrangement was proposed after the Sustainable Living Centre (SLC), the intended location for the workshops, was “not yet available” and a previous agreement to lease off-campus space from the Department of Visual Art had expired.
 Worried students feared a marquee tent would make it difficult for them to carry out their work due to a lack of amenities, such as power outlets and lighting.
 Previously, Bonello said the faculty was “exploring” the possibility of taking over some of the SLC Design Studios by the second semester, meaning students would move into the new studio by January.
 Located just a few minutes’ walk from the University, Campus Hub offers student accommodation, lecture rooms, underground parking and food outlets.

Government considering extending free childcare into the nighttime,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/government-considering-extending-free-childcare-nighttime.1096225,08-02-2024,002780.png,"The government is exploring the option of extending free childcare, for children under three, to nighttime hours to cater for shift workers who work during the night.
 The Foundation for Educational Services has issued a tender for a preliminary market consultation for the procurement of childcare services during weekdays between 6pm and 6am and on a 24-hour basis on weekends and public holidays.
 The service is required in two centres in Malta and one centre in Gozo. The service would have to respect the carer-to-child ratio of 1:6 children for toddlers aged 12 months to 36 months and 1:3 for babies between three months and 12 months. 
 A spokesperson for the education ministry said that the purpose of the tender is to gather insights for the potential extension of free childcare services during atypical hours to support shift workers. The aim is to understand the feasibility of this.
 “This initiative aligns with the electoral manifesto proposal, promising to extend free childcare during unconventional hours. Currently, the free childcare scheme, managed by Jobsplus, offers up to 200 hours monthly to all working parents, redeemable at both state and private childcare centres. 
 “The consultation aims to determine the availability and cost of these services during atypical hours, explore the willingness of private operators to provide this service if economically viable, and consider potential partnerships with the state for subsidised childcare,” the spokesperson said.
 Free childcare is currently available from three months to three years, with state-owned centres operating between 6am and 6pm or 7.30am to 4pm. Private centres have varied hours. 
 The limitation to children up to the age of three - for the purposes of the tender - is due to children enrolling in kindergarten at that age, the spokesperson said.
 “This initiative is a positive step towards supporting working parents by potentially expanding childcare options during essential hours,” he said.

MCAST principal confirms contract was not renewed amid reports of sacking,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/mcast-principal-confirms-contract-renewed-amid-reports-sacking.1094266,21-06-2024,003027.png,"MCAST principal Joachim James Calleja has confirmed his contract was not renewed by the Education Ministry, amid reports he was sacked on Friday.
 This comes as the post-secondary institution continues to be overshadowed by ongoing industrial action, with the college remaining locked in a dispute with the Malta Union of Teachers over a long-lapsed collective agreement. 
 Calleja told Times of Malta that some three weeks ago, the ministry informed him in writing that his contract, which was up for renewal, was not going to be renewed. 
 He said that since he turned 65, it was practice for his contract to be renewed on a yearly basis. Calleja is now 67 years old. 
 But Calleja insisted he was not made aware of any decision by the ministry to fire him and that he was set to complete his contract until the end of the academic year in August.
 ""Now all of a sudden they publish this, that I am fired because of the disputes. I have evidence of emails from students trying to help them. I have no problem with this, but I am not stifling the issue,"" Calleja said.
 ""I knew nothing about the decision, I was not informed about it,"" he continued.
 ""I received a call informing me about the media report, otherwise I knew nothing about it. I have nothing to do with the ongoing discussions. While I attend the discussions, this is between the union and the government.""
 Calleja said he has been in discussion on ways to mitigate the hardships students have been experiencing due to the ongoing dispute.
 Malta Today said on Friday that sources close to the institute said the ministry informed the MCAST board that Calleja's services ""were no longer required"".
 According to the report, a public call will be issued to find a replacement. 
 An MCAST representative echoed Calleja's comments, saying they found out about the decision to remove him from media reports. 
 Responding to questions, an Education Ministry spokesperson said the decision to remove Calleja was taken weeks ago and that there had ben communication between the Ministry and Calleja.
 “The ministry thanks professor Calleja, who is the longest principal who served in the MCAST management, and under whom progress has been made on various aspects related to the college,” the spokesperson said. 
 In a statement, the Nationalist Party accused Abela’s government of losing control over the situation at MCAST.
 “The responsibility in the negotiations falls on the shoulders of Prime Minister Robert Abela, who promises things but fails to deliver and Education Minister Clifton Grima, who failed to conclude talks with the MUT on the Collective Agreement two and a half years after it expired.”
 The statement, signed by PN education shadow minister Justin Schembri said the failure to conclude collective agreement talks is causing anxiety among thousands of MCAST students. 
 “As always, Robert Abela shrugs off his responsibilities and blames others by firing the MCAST principal when the academic year has only two weeks left.”
 Calleja was appointed principal and CEO of the Malta College of Arts, Science and Technology in June 2018. His position was reconfirmed back in 2021. He also served as Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Education and Employment from 2011 to 2013.
 The news of Calleja stepping down from this role comes as the institution is experiencing ongoing union directives.
 Last month, the Malta Union of Teachers ordered staff at MCAST not to disclose exam and assessment results to students after talks over the new collective agreement failed.
 MCAST students have raised their concerns about how the situation has impacted them negatively, as exams have been cancelled and their marks remain in limbo.
 On Thursday, students set up an online petition asking Prime Minister Robert Abela to intervene and help them get their marks and reschedule their exams.

University seeks to stop ‘dangerous’ fuel station operating on land it owns,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/university-seeks-stop-dangerous-fuel-station-operating-land-owns.1095999,08-01-2024,003022.png,"The University of Malta is seeking an injunction against the owners of a fuel station, which it says operates on land it owns in flagrant breach of a stop order and poses a serious danger to nearby student facilities.
 The university authorities have already filed proceedings before the civil courts to evict the fuel station owners from the site facing Triq Mikiel Anton Vassalli Road, Msida.
 The Environment and Resources Authority (ERA) had, in June 2019, issued a stop order against JOEM Services Station Limited, the company running the business, to stop its storage and distribution operations that were taking place without the necessary permits.
 The way the station was being operated meant that its activities breached environmental laws and regulations on the control of emissions by volatile organic materials.
 The service station was not equipped with adequate structures and storage facilities, thus posing “great danger”. That was why the ERA issued the stop order, claimed the university in its application.
 The issue concerns two plots of land that became university property by means of two public deeds signed in March 1964 and September 1977.
 The transfer to the university followed an expropriation notice issued by the governor of Malta in 1961 so the property would be used for educational purposes. Then, in 1995, a fuel station on Regional Road, operated through C. Vella and Sons Limited, had to be relocated to make way for the Santa Venera tunnels project.
 That site on Regional Road was expropriated and the university was informed by the Roads Department that the Vella fuel station would be relocated to the two plots belonging to the university. Permits for the new service station were issued on July 11, 1996.
 However, unlike Vella, who was compensated for his expropriated land on Regional Road, the university never received any compensation. In fact, it never signed any form of contract to transfer the land and an attempt to regularise the situation in 1996 never led anywhere.
 In 2012, the service station was sold to JOEM. The university is arguing JOEM is operating the station on land it does not own and which is not being used for educational purposes as originally intended.
 Moreover, although the service station had been targeted by a stop order by ERA five years ago, it had still continued to operate. Such a “flagrant breach” was exposing the university, as owner of the two plots in question, to fines and damages and potential court action by ERA. That meant the university could be hit by daily maximum penalties of €150, leaving it with no option but to seek an injunction.
 The two requirements for such an injunction subsisted, argued the university’s lawyers. The institution had a prima facie interest as owner of the plots. There was also the risk of irremediable prejudice since the university gym and sports complex were close to the service station.
 Since the station owners were facing possible eviction, they would have no intention of addressing shortcomings in such manner as to avert the risk of some disaster, argued the university.
 Lawyers Carlos Bugeja and Jurgen Micallef signed the application.

 The National Education Strategy, which will guide education policy for the next seven years, was published on Friday.   
 Education Minister Clifton Grima said the document was written following extensive contributions from stakeholders.
 “This is the first strategy that was not written in an office, but was built from the ground up,” he said.  “Educators, students, and parents were all involved. Every person should be able to reach their potential.""
 The strategy is based on three pillars: Wellbeing, Growth and Empowerment, and Equity and Inclusion.
 It will focus primarily on students' mental health and overall well-being. 
 One initiative proposes a specialised programme focused on social and emotional education. 
 It also proposes setting up a “National Students’ Wellbeing Service”, intended to strengthen psychosocial services.  
 The strategy also looks to involve families on a deeper level by providing “courses on parental skills”.
 A Family-Community-School Link programme will look to work with parents and in some cases social services to prevent chronic school absenteeism.  
 The government also wants to change after-school clubs and summer schools by offering accredited programmes.  
 The strategy also seeks to enhance reading skills by distributing books to each child’s household. 
 Students will also be encouraged to follow their sporting pursuits through a Talented Athletes Scheme. That scheme will allow athletes' time in training and athletic achievements to be formally recognised and included in academic certificates.

Students frustrated as MCAST pay talks drag on and industrial action continues,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/students-frustrated-mcast-pay-talks-drag-industrial-action-continues.1101289,21-11-2024,003385.png,"MCAST students are growing more anxious and frustrated as they seek the assistance of lecturers who cannot help them due to an impasse in a three-year negotiation process for better working conditions.
 One nursing student who spoke to Times of Malta  said she should soon graduate but that dream could go out the window if she is not given her marks.
 “Without the marks, I fear I won’t be able to graduate and all of us here are eager to start working, some of us more than others as they badly need financial stability,” she said.
 The frustration stems from the ongoing dispute between the Malta Union of Teachers (MUT) and the government, which have yet to agree on a new collective agreement for MCAST lecturers and staff, the last one having elapsed in 2021.
 Over the past months, the union dished out a series of directives, the last of which were controversially rolled out at the beginning of the scholastic year in October, intended to pressure the government to iron out the pending issues.
 Among other directives, the union ordered lecturers to avoid communication with MCAST administration and students outside of designated contact hours, to boycott events and not show up for extracurricular activities and school ceremonies, to refrain from disclosing assessment marks to students or management, not to show up for staff meetings, to limit work to essential tasks like teaching and to halt research activities, including providing support for students who are doing their theses.
 Several students who spoke to Times of Malta said they are particularly concerned about the withholding of marks and the lack of communication from lecturers.
 “We do get help during the lectures but our emails to lecturers remain largely unanswered and it’s getting incredibly stressful because we need their support,” one student said.
 Another student who is doing engineering said that, since their lecturers are not handing out assignments, their final grades will depend solely on their performance during the exams.
 Others fear their degrees may be invalidated due to the implementation of administrative passes.
 “We’re worried about our future job prospects,” one said. “An administrative pass doesn’t reflect our true abilities and it could hinder our chances of getting a good job.”
 The issue brought about a wave of protests and demonstrations by lecturers and students over the past months.
 In early October, lecturers protested alongside MUT and, later that month, students staged a protest at the Paola campus to express frustration over the ongoing dispute.
 A parliamentary petition filed earlier this month to “end the academic limbo for students and educators” had garnered 465 signatures at the time of writing.
 Lecturers also initiated a petition of their own, calling for the “prompt conclusion of our collective agreement”.
 MCAST said when contacted that the negotiations remain a priority for all involved and progress “is ongoing, with further meetings scheduled in the coming days”.
 “MCAST’s management is committed to respecting the directives currently in place while ensuring that students’ academic progress and well-being are prioritised,” a spokesperson for MCAST said.
 “The College continues to stress the urgency of these discussions and is working diligently to reach a resolution that balances the interests of all stakeholders.”
 Marco Bonnici, president of the Malta Union of Teachers, told Times of Malta that talks on the MCAST agreement are being held at the Office of the Prime Minister. They are being led by the Permanent Secretary at OPM.
 Negotiations are ongoing with several meetings being held on a weekly basis. The latest meeting was on Wednesday afternoon and meetings are planned for the following weeks until Christmas.
 ""The MUT hopes that these negotiations will lead to a new agreement for all the affected grades at MCAST. With regards to directives, the union will lift them once it is satisfied with the new agreement,"" Bonnici said.
 The Education Ministry said MCAST is doing everything possible to reach an agreement that benefits both lecturers and students as soon as possible.
 ""The ministry reiterates that no directive should negatively impact the educational journey of the students and once again appeals to all concerned parties to be reasonable and reach an agreement regarding these negotiations,"" it said.

The sixth form that's trying something different,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/the-sixth-form-trying-something-different.1096867,30-08-2024,"003426.png,003427.png","When one 15-year-old, fresh from his O levels, turned up at the Central Mediterranean Business School, he arrived with a vision for his life’s work.
 “He wanted to be a barber but, asked if he wanted to work in a barber’s shop, he was clear he wanted to open a chain,” recalls Kristina Galea Borg, principal of Malta’s new alternative to traditional sixth form.
 “He was looking for something different that would give him more business acumen. And he is exactly why we exist.”
 From October, the Central Mediterranean Business School at the Brewhouse in Mrieħel will teach teenagers public speaking, critical thinking and entrepreneurship – skills its CEO says are missing in the working world.
 “The idea is to churn out employees who will speak up in a meeting and contribute, and we believe these life skills will help,” said Morgan Parnis.
 It is his solution to a problem that is often raised by employers – skills shortages – and his attempt to change an education system that is pumping out early school leavers.
 There is, however, one major issue: its courses aren’t yet recognised as entry qualifications by the University of Malta.
  So far, the advanced diplomas in business management, computer science and accounting and finance on offer at CMBS are not accepted entry qualifications at the University of Malta should students want to further their studies. But Parnis is confident they will be approved by next year’s student intake.
 “The programme we created would be approved by many international universities, but it may not be directly aligned with the entry criteria of the UoM,” he said.
 Following a recent, positive meeting with the dean of the Faculty of Economics, Management and Accountancy, where he explained the “innovative” programme, Parnis said he was hopeful CMBS students would also have the option to attend the UoM, apart from other international tertiary-level institutions.
 “We are the first to do this and it can be used as a benchmark to see whether this type of qualification can also meet entry criteria into university,” Parnis said. “I have invited the university to study what we do and vet us.”
 The new sixth form is targeting 10 students this scholastic year, with no more than half being international to ensure the original idea of feeding the gaps in the industry would be retained.
 Opening to international students, who travel to study, meant their Maltese counterparts could be exposed to “high quality”, elevating both the offering and their experience, Parnis maintained.
 “We are not after a market of volume, but just after a niche, going up to a maximum of 45 students in the coming two to three years,” he projected.
 “We need to change how people study. It will take a long time to change the system in place, so we intend to be innovators in starting to address the change and breaking the mould,” Parnis continued.
 “We cannot change public schools, or the philosophy around A levels. But rather than just saying the existing system is wrong, we are focusing on one we have seen working in many countries and put into practice.”
 Work-based learning components are embedded in the school’s system, which does not just revolve around studying, the school principal explained.
 One of the reasons for opening a sixth form was based on the realisation that “we have to start capturing students at an even earlier stage”, Galea Borg said.
  The relationship with one of the Big 4 accountancy firms will start at sixth form, and the companies test the students before they sponsor them.
 CMBS moved to “this eco-system” – the Brewhouse – because of the many employers around it, and as part of their studies, students will do a work programme that is “not your classical tick-box exercise”, she said.
 Specific academic milestones must be reached by the students at the workplace as part of their education and mechanisms are in place for the organisation to assess performance accordingly.
 “This is a thought-out placement with companies that want to be part of it and get the right of first refusal on employment,” she said.
 “Our model is based on bringing what industry needs. We want to be sure employers find the students employable. So, we are constantly speaking to them to make sure what they are doing at the workplace is connected to the curriculum.”
 If the students make an impact in these organisations, come the holidays, they have the opportunity to put in extra hours of paid work, Galea Borg said.
 CMBS has been operating for over 10 years, offering undergraduate and postgraduate programmes that are focused on professionals in industry, and is now launching campuses in Germany and Toronto, following the UAE.
 Describing the student profile of the new sixth form, which spans 15 straight months, continuing throughout the holidays, Galea Borg said: “Coming here means knowing I want to be an accountant. I know I want to work in business, or I know I have a passion for IT.
 “I am not choosing accounts because my father is an accountant but because I have a propensity towards that subject.”
 Validated by the regulator, the Malta Further & Higher Education Authority, CMBS’s entry requirements are three O levels, two of which are Maths and English.
 But grades are important as it is an intensive programme and the cohort must be strong to avoid lowering the quality of the output, Galea Borg said.
 “They need to be good students because our objective is that they are accepted by many other international universities.
 “But we should also give the opportunity to some of the underdogs to outperform others. It has happened in the past.
 “Maybe we are fitting in to fulfil the potential of people that could have been failed by the normal system, although there are checks and balances in place to ensure they have the academic ability to reach the standards and succeed.
 “We exist to show there are other ways to create exceptional students.”
 Referring to the fact that a fifth of students failed their core O-level subjects, Parnis said this was indicative of the need to do things differently.
 Malta also consistently has among the highest levels in the EU of early school-leavers, meaning those who drop out of further education or training after secondary education or less.
 He pointed out how “for the amount of money that has been injected into the education system, the results are not very good.
 “It tells us we need more systems that do not repeat the status quo and do not allow for much innovation.
 “We are not saying that ours is better, but that there is more than one way… If everyone is following the path of least resistance, then we are stuck repeating past mistakes,” Parnis insisted.

Everybody is pigging out: Malta tops EU table for increase in pig population,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/everybody-pigging-out-malta-tops-eu-table-increase-pig-population.1092775,21-05-2024,"003432.png,003433.png","2023 turned out to be a standout year for Maltese pigs, with new EU figures showing that Malta now tops Europe’s rankings for the largest increase in its swine population.
 With Rosianne Cutajar’s prescient remark that “everybody is pigging out” ringing in their ears, Malta’s pig farmers upped their game in 2023, growing Malta’s pig population by over a fifth to now reach almost 36,000.
 Bulgaria is the only country to match Malta’s sharp increase in pig population, with most EU countries registering fewer pigs than in previous years.
 This reversed a previous trend which had seen the number of pigs in Malta drop from 40,000 to just 29,500 between 2021 and 2022.
 Malta’s pig population fell sharply over the past decade, dropping by over 15,000 since 2013, but appears to have recovered over the past year.
 Malta's cow population, on the other hand, has remained largely unchanged, with just over 14,000 cows grazing in the country.
 Cutajar’s warning had inspired droves of people to take on the mantle and dress up as pigs during last year’s Nadur carnival celebrations. Despite the detailed costumes, they did not feature in the EU’s count.
  Livestock numbers around Europe have been on the decline for years, with some estimates suggesting that Europe’s livestock has dropped by almost a tenth over the past two decades.
 In some cases, this has been by design, with some countries taking drastic action to reduce livestock to cut down greenhouse gas emissions driven by an overload of manure.
 The data reveals that the overall number of all types of livestock dipped in 2023 compared to the previous year. There are now 133 million pigs, 74 million bovine animals, 58 million sheep, and 11 million goats across the EU.

MCAST lecturers frustrated over protracted negotiations,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/mcast-lecturers-frustrated-protracted-negotiations.1098106,15-09-2024,003555.png,"MCAST lecturers have expressed concern that their working conditions are still governed by a collective agreement which expired nearly three years ago.
 On the eve of a new academic year, they voiced frustration over protracted negotiations between the Malta Union of Teachers (MUT) and the government, with no resolution in sight.
 “The delays have created a lot of uncertainty and frustration, especially when we are much aware that our working conditions and salaries are not comparable to those of our colleagues in other same-level institutions,” one lecturer said.
 Another lecturer said she feels “demotivated” because salaries do not reflect the responsibilities.
 However, MUT president Marco Bonnici told Times of Malta that after a summer of meetings, “a new stage has been reached”, and this has been communicated to union members.
 A spokesperson for the education ministry added that negotiations are ongoing, with both parties striving to secure the best possible conditions for MCAST educators.
 Times of Malta understands that the government has requested MUT to provide a consolidated position on conditions of work and financials, with a deadline set for Friday, September 20.
 In response, MUT informed MCAST lecturers that its officials, in collaboration with delegates, will be working to submit the requested details on time.
 The union also confirmed it will not suspend the remaining directives, as requested by MCAST, pending further developments.
 Prior to this communication, MCAST lecturers had voiced concerns about the lack of transparency and feedback from the union representing them.
 “We don’t even know what’s being asked for on our behalf in these negotiations. As lecturers, we’ve been left completely out of the loop.”
 A senior lecturer, who also wished to remain anonymous, said the only information received is that the MUT aims to secure the same working conditions outlined in the junior college agreement.
 “This raises concerns. Are we being asked to accept terms based on an outdated agreement?”
  “Where is the equal pay policy?”, another asked, pointing out the fact that their salaries are far less than those of university and junior college lecturers, even though they teach at diploma and undergraduate levels.
 “This is discriminatory and demoralising. I love my job and my students, but I want equal treatment.”
 Another insisted that the situation has become even more pressing given inflationary pressures and the economic challenges that have arisen post-pandemic.
 The last collective agreement was signed in 2018 and expired in December 2021.
 “The government is always dragging its feet, and I don’t think it’s because of shortage of money as there seems to be a lot for university and junior college lecturers,” one lecturer said.
 Last November, the MUT issued directives for MCAST lecturers but lifted them in January, claiming to have found a way forward. 
 It again issued directives in May but felt secure enough to partially lift the directives in June, again claiming a solution was near.
 One lecturer complained that the disruption caused by the directives has created a backlog of work which now needs to be addressed along with preparatory work for the new academic year.
 
 The union also confirmed it will not suspend remaining directives, as requested by MCAST, pending further developments.
 If finalised, this would be the second major collective agreement secured by the MUT in recent months.
 In July, MUT and the education ministry signed a collective agreement for all primary, secondary and post-secondary school teachers, which also covers LSEs and KGEs.
 The developments come as MCAST appointed a new principal, Stephen Vella.

 San Anton School is transforming a 5000m2 area adjacent to the school into a learning-nature space, offering students a hands-on experience with the environment.
 The project will bring nature to life with vibrant features that include a selection of indigenous plants, shrubs, and mature trees creating a natural sanctuary, complete with a pond. Students will have their small areas for cultivating crops and learning how to garden firsthand. There will also be a dedicated compost area to showcase sustainable practices, while wooden walking paths will make the area accessible to all. 
 There will also be an outdoor classroom with a floor of soft, mulched wood bark, inviting students to learn in a fresh, open-air setting.
 Bernardette Stivala, Head of School at San Anton said:
 “Being one of the pioneers in outdoor education in Malta, San Anton School wishes to extend its programme to other levels enabling more students to benefit from nature-based learning at different parts of their day.”
  At San Ġorġ Preca College, better known as Il-Liceo an unutilised roof area measuring 1280m2 will be converted into a new roof garden.
 The scope is for it to serve as a space for horticultural education, designed to transform traditional classroom learning into an immersive, sensory, hands-on experience. Similar to San Anton, the garden will feature a dedicated vegetable planting area, encouraging students to explore the possibilities of growing fresh produce at home. 
 Additionally, diverse pathways with varying textures will create a dynamic, interactive environment, showcasing a modern approach to architectural design. 
 “In a densely populated locality like ours, where open spaces are limited, this roof garden project is a valuable addition,” said Ħamrun Local Council Mayor Christian Sammutwho is spearheading the project.
 “This initiative not only provides a green space for learning and relaxation but also brings our community closer to nature. It’s an opportunity for residents of all ages to enjoy, connect, and benefit from a shared environment right in the heart of our town.”
 Chairperson of the PA’s Development Planning Fund, Perit Raymond Farrugia said the PA will be financing both green projects to the equivalent of close to €415,000. 
 ""These projects are not only beneficial for the students who attend these two schools but these new green areas will be made available to the wider community, after school hours. We hope that these projects will encourage other similar educational institutions to look at opportunities to turn under-utilised spaces into nature areas.” 
 The Development Planning Fund which is supporting these projects provides essential financial support to local councils and NGOs for initiatives that advance community wellbeing, environmental quality, and social engagement.

Maltese graduates top EU employment rate ranking,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/maltese-graduates-top-eu-employment-rate-ranking.1097012,21-08-2024,004352.png,"Maltese graduates are the most likely in Europe to walk into a job, with almost 96% of graduates finding a job within three years of finishing their studies, according to new EU data published on Wednesday.
 The employment rate of graduates in Malta has remained high throughout most of this century but had dipped below the 90% mark for the first time in two decades in 2021 and 2022, as graduate employment rates dropped throughout Europe following the outbreak of COVID-19.
 But 2023 saw this bounce back to an almost all-time high of 95.8%, well above the European average of 83.5% and just above second-placed the Netherlands, according to data from Eurostat, the EU's statistical office.
 
 Malta remains a geographical anomaly in this respect, being the only Mediterranean or Southern European country to register a rate above the EU average.
 Other Mediterranean states, from Cyprus (80.6%) to Spain (78.7%), France (80.1%) and Greece (72.3%) drag the EU average down, with neighbouring Italy propping up the European table at 67.5%.
 Graduate employment figures in Malta remain high across all educational levels.
 A little over 96% of graduates with a tertiary education find a job within one to three years of graduation, while this figure drops slightly to 90% for those with a non-tertiary education.
 These results are unsurprising when viewed in light of Malta’s broader employment rate, with the country frequently topping EU tables for employment growth.
 However, the data does not delve into the nature of the jobs, raising questions over whether graduates are landing in jobs that match their skillset.
 A 2022 study by the National Statistics Office found that more than a third of all workers in Malta are over-qualified for their jobs, with women and youths, in particular, tending to find themselves in jobs beneath their skillset.
 Although Malta is succeeding in getting graduates into jobs, it is battling to get people to stay in school in the first place, with a government strategy launched last year hoping to bring Malta’s rate of early school leavers in line with the EU average.
 Currently, one in ten 18-24 year-olds in Malta are early-school leavers, meaning they achieved fewer than two O-level exams and did not continue studying or training.
 Although this has dropped significantly from over 21% in 2010, it remains above the EU median, with the strategy aiming to bring this down to 9% by 2030.

BCA wants to create MCAST course for masons after many fail theory exam,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/bca-wants-create-mcast-course-masons-many-fail-theory-exam.1102124,13-12-2024,,"The Building and Construction Authority (BCA) is in talks with MCAST to develop a course to address the low pass rate in the theory portion of the masons’ licensing exam. 
 Godwin Agius, chairperson of the masons licensing committee, said the revamped process revealed shortcomings in applicants’ theoretical knowledge. 
 Speaking to Times of Malta, he noted that “education must be a key priority in the future” and highlighted ongoing discussions with MCAST to develop a comprehensive course.
 Efforts are being made to ensure the course encourages participation without disrupting attendees’ daily routines. Recent data showed that around seven out of 10 builders failed the revamped theory exam. This exam, part of the mason licensing process, was revamped in August and transferred under the wing of the BCA.
 For the exam, the BCA organised an eight-hour refresher course for industry professionals, with sessions led by the Occupational Health and Safety Authority (OHSA), legal representatives, the Chamber of Architects on concrete and steel structures and the Assoċjazzjoni Bennejja u Kuntratturi (ABK) on geometry.
 Despite these efforts, Agius emphasised the broader issue: a lack of foundational knowledge in key areas, not an unfair exam design. Agius raised this issue in a recent opinion piece he sent to Times of Malta in which he managed to answer a number of questions the BCA had previously left unanswered. 
 In it, he highlighted that, while only 30 per cent of candidates passed the theory exam, 88 per cent passed the practical component. Among the 123 candidates who failed the theory portion, 116 struggled, specifically with the geometry and stereotomy section.
  Furthermore, of the 185 candidates eligible for assistance, only 29 sought help. However, even among those assisted, the pass rate was just 17 per cent.
 Agius clarified that claims suggesting most candidates had “over 40 years of experience” and were unfairly tested were misleading, in his opinion. He stated that half of the candidates who failed were in their 20s or 30s, far from the 40-year benchmark. He also pointed out that anyone working as a mason for over 40 years without a licence would have been doing so illegally.
 The licensing authority is also exploring ways to provide targeted support for candidates, including preparatory courses, study materials and mentorship programmes.
 He highlighted that MCAST offers a similar course, Preparation for Mason’s Licence, which he said only saw about 50 applicants over the past two years.
 Agius said the BCA would consult on whether similar courses should be made compulsory. He added that suggestions for improving the examination and accompanying course are welcome, stressing the need for an “effective filter” to assess applicants’ capabilities.
 “This is not about lowering standards but ensuring that only capable and qualified individuals are licensed to carry out critical construction responsibilities,” Agius said.

Teachers' union pushes for private lesson regulations,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/private-lessons-regulated-ensure-quality-mut-boss-says.1098764,30-09-2024,"004832.png,004833.png","Private lessons should be regulated to ensure they abide by quality standards that apply to compulsory education, according to the head of the teachers’ union, Marco Bonnici. 
 Regulating the practice would address the current “anything goes” situation, he said. It would ensure that only qualified teachers can teach and address issues brought about by online private lessons, he said.
 Parents recently complained about the quality of online private lessons, with some teachers accepting over 40 students at one time.
 This leaves students, who are already struggling with a subject, having to make an even bigger effort to keep up and concentrate due to the lack of individual attention that private lessons are meant to provide. 
 Bonnici, president of the Malta Union of Teachers, noted: “While compulsory education is highly regulated, in the absence of a regulatory framework for private lessons, anyone, including non-teachers, can give private lessons. 
 “As a professional organisation we have, in the past, requested a regulatory framework for private lessons but this was never considered by the authorities. On the other hand, private lessons by qualified teachers are similar to private practice carried out by a number of other professions, so it is surely not an issue.”
 Questions were sent to the Education Ministry on the matter of regulation. 
 A recent survey showed that six out of 10 secondary school students in Malta attend private tuition. 
 The certified quantitative research exercise ‒ commissioned by a Lithuanian tutoring company, Mokosi and completed by Esprimi in February ‒ was conducted among 500 parents of children aged four to 18. 
 The findings showed that the main advantages of tutoring included the need to do extra work (47%) and individual attention (33%).
 In terms of priorities, the majority of respondents (61%) wanted their children to be in smaller classes.
 Yet, over half would have considered online lessons, with the highest level of interest being among 16- to 18-year-olds. The Facebook group Private Lessons around Malta and Gozo shows a mix of parents seeking in-person-only or one-on-one lessons close to their home while others specifically request online or recorded classes.
 The survey findings also shed light on a “grey zone” in the tax system when it came to private lessons and indicated it was “not really regulated”.
 One secondary school teacher, who recently left the profession, said the issue of private lessons in Malta has always been “a racket”. She believes in the urgent need for regulation.
 “The authorities need to step in and seriously look into the matter. It’s gone unchecked for too long and now has become so much worse,” she said.
 She spoke about the Maltese culture of sending children to private lessons, even if their schoolteachers were perfectly capable of preparing the children for any upcoming exams.
 The COVID pandemic brought with it the phenomenon of online teaching in 2020 and “the racket has become way worse”.
 “How can it be called a ‘private’ lesson if a teacher needs to attend to huge online classes, which, sometimes, are held concomitantly with in-person classes?
 ""There is no way these children are getting more specialised attention than they would get in their school classroom where the number of students hovers around 20 nowadays. Also, online teaching is a huge challenge at the best of times, even with small numbers of students. One has no idea if the students are paying attention and what they’ve understood, which are immediately evident during in-person teaching,” she said.
 Another teacher noted that the nature of the lesson played an important role. “It all depends on the way the lesson is structured and how much the students are engaged. Certainly, looking at a head talking on screen will not do the job with most teenage students,” he said. 
 As for the students, one 17-year-old girl who attended online lessons in maths said: “Personally, I prefer physical lessons because I get less distracted by my phone and even family members talking in the background. Also, I believe that being in a class rather than in my bedroom helps me focus more.
 “But I think it mainly depends on the teacher. Some online teachers make it work because they ask us to switch on our camera and constantly ask us questions but other private lessons I joined where we had the camera off felt like I was watching a video rather than attending an actual lesson.”
 Another teenager said: “In my experience, online will never be as good as in real life. The teacher can’t correct you and redirect your focus through the screen like they can in real life. However, I still find myself learning a lot from online and getting really good notes, especially if the online session is one-on-one.”
  One mother said that although she was happy to pay for private lessons in subjects in which her son struggled, “it’s not fair that the teachers take advantage of the situation by over-packing their classes which, at the end of the day, means my son will fail his exams and us parents would have thrown away all that money”.
 Graham Sansone, from the Union of Professional Educators, said that, since the pandemic, there was an increase in online private lessons that impacted the quality of lessons when compared to face-to-face lessons.
 “This is due to the lack of investment in the educational sector. Teachers are seeking alternative means of financial stability and the element of greed kicks in… If, in the past, you could have six students, now you can have 60 all at once, doing the same task, at the same time and earning more money,” he said.
 However, in most cases, he said “teachers are desperate to get hold of more money as their salary cannot keep up with the rate of inflation” despite the recent increase in salary that formed part of the sectoral agreement signed with the government earlier this year.

 The teachers' union on Friday registered a new trade dispute over an MCAST collective agreement that expired nearly three years ago and said its members will hold a protest at the Paola campus on Tuesday.
 Discussions about a new agreement have been going on for over two years. Last November, the Malta Union of Teachers issued directives for MCAST lecturers but lifted them in January, claiming to have found a way forward. 
 
 It again issued directives in May but felt secure enough to partially lift the directives in June, again claiming a solution was near.
 Ahead of the new scholastic year, MCAST lecturers expressed concern with Times of Malta over the expired agreement, saying there did not seem to be any resolution in sight.
 On Friday MUT said it had been involved in negotiations for a new collective agreement for eight grades including lecturers, student support services, student mentors, directors, deputy directors, technicians, Learning Support Educators and senior research officers for two years and nine months.
 ""In the last days, there was a deterioration of negotiations from MCAST which led MUT to reconsider its position.
 ""To this effect, and in view of the latest communication received from MCAST on Thursday - which is a regression in negotiations, the MUT is declaring a fresh trade dispute with MCAST,"" it said in a statement.
 It will hold a protest at the MCAST campus in Paola, in front of the administration block on October 1 at 11am.
 All MUT members at MCAST are invited to join the protest.  
 On Friday evening, MCAST said its doors remained open for MUT to propose its final position on various unresolved issues, including financial matters.
 Meetings for discussion can only be held if MUT suspended directives that were leading to students' suffering, MCAST said in a statement.
 It urged the union not to discard months of work over the collective agreement.
 ""MCAST has even proposed to go to an arbiter to reach an agreement on unresolved matters, following a series of meetings during which the parties were expected to table their final requests.
 ""MCAST calls for dialogue that safeguards the interests of educators and students, and urges for the halting of directives that impact life on campus.""

MCAST students who missed out on exams to get ‘administrative pass’,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/mcast-students-missed-exams-get-administrative-pass.1094739,07-02-2024,005229.png,"MCAST students who could not sit for their exams or assessments due to union directives will receive an automatic ‘administrative pass’.
 In a circular issued on Friday, students were told they would automatically progress into the next academic year.
 “An administrative pass will be assigned to unassessed study units with unavailable final grades,” it said.
 The decision was made after the Malta Union of Teachers ended its industrial action, which included a directive not to hand out marks to students.
 When the dispute was resolved last week, students were told they can now receive their exam and assignment marks.
 But those who missed out on sitting their exams will get an administrative pass, which will allow them to automatically continue their course from one year to another or automatically progress from one MQF level to another.
 The number of students this will affect remains unclear. Questions have been sent to the education ministry.
 Students can then attempt to convert their administrative pass into a final grade “at the earliest opportunity” but will retain their pass even if they fail pending or repeat assessments, according to the circular.
 MCAST said the measures were due to the “exceptional extenuating circumstances” that occurred towards the end of the year.
 These circumstances resulted from recent directives, including students not being presented with their exam or assessment marks and staff being asked to limit communication with students, management and administration.
 In a statement last Friday, the union said it had agreed on a way forward with the government that will lead to a “satisfactory conclusion” of negotiations for a new collective agreement.
 Other directives that remain in force include an order to student support services staff not to answer phone calls or act on any communication from administration and management, excluding emergencies and crises.
 The college aims for any outstanding results to be released by July 26 and students are encouraged to contact their institute’s administration office with any queries.

Private lesson mania: Six in 10 Maltese pupils get private tuition,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/private-lesson-mania-six-10-maltese-pupils-get-private-tuition.1093685,26-06-2024,005264.png,"Six out of 10 secondary school students in Malta attend private tuition, according to a survey.
 Mathematics was the most popular subject for tutoring across all ages, followed by Maltese, English and physics, according to research into tutoring trends.
 The research shows that the least likely to attend private lessons were children in early years primary education, aged between four and seven. However, even in this age group, some 29% of children attended private lessons.
 Among four- to seven-year-olds, Maltese was the most sought subject.
 The certified quantitative research exercise, completed by Esprimi in February, was conducted among 500 parents of children aged four to 18.
 For respondents, the main advantages of tutoring included the need to do extra work (47%) and for individual attention (33%), as well as to tackle significant difficulties within the subjects students were attending private lessons for.
 The survey was commissioned by a Lithuanian tutoring company, Mokosi, which intends to launch in Malta and was aimed at understanding the market and the mindset.
 Its CEO, Jurgita Jaruseviciene, who has worked in tutoring for 17 years, believed the topic of the study and its findings would give rise to “wide discussion about the effectiveness of the education system in Malta”.
 Malta’s 60% rate is high, she said, maintaining that other countries showed an average of 30 per cent.
 In Armenia at the top end of the scale, 90% of secondary students attended private lessons, while in Nordic countries like Sweden, the figure was as low as 10%, Jaruseviciene said.
 She quoted a study on shadow education in Europe: ‘Growing Prevalence, Underlying Forces, and Policy Implications’, which said that only in Northern Europe did shadow education remain modest in scale, but it was growing there too.
 According to a 2008 study of Maltese Grade 10 students – ‘Various aspects behind private tuition: A study among Form 4 secondary schools’ – 51.9% were receiving tutoring and 77.9% had done so at some time in their school lives.
 Pupils in the high-performing schools were more likely to receive tutoring and devote longer hours than pupils in the lower performing schools, the researchers had found.
  A decade earlier, another study had found that 50.5% of a sample of 1,482 upper primary and lower secondary pupils had received tutoring at some time.
 “The high number of private lessons in Malta could be cultural, it could have implications on the education system, or be the result of a mix of both,” Jaruseviciene said.
 The trend in Western Europe was now for “quick, individual and simple” crash courses that meant students did not need to spend a whole year studying to get results, Jaruseviciene said.
 While the global tendency is for individual lessons, in Malta, the children are more likely to study in groups, the research showed.
 The older the age bracket, the larger the groups, with over 30% of 16- to 18-year-olds joining classes of more than 10 students.
 This appeared to be an anomaly, Jaruseviciene highlighted, as the research showed that among parents’ top priorities, the majority of respondents (61%) wanted their children to be in smaller classes.
 Asked about online private lessons, over half would have considered that option, with the highest level of interest among 16- to 18-year-olds.
 The main concerns about this form of learning included difficulty in staying focused and for the tutor to gauge non-verbal reactions to explanations.
 Although the market research revealed that parents did not want to drive their children far for private lessons, online learning was still not too popular in Malta.
 A close location was important for half of them, while the least important priority was the possibility of online/blending learning approaches.
 The average hourly rate of private lessons across the age groups was €10, with the highest going up to €14 for students at post-secondary level – 16 to 18 years old – attending twice a week.
 While the price was not considered high, the money spent on tutoring in Malta was “big”, Jaruseviciene said, maintaining that while teachers may not earn enough, there was “another market”.
 Parents believed that online lessons, currently being attended by 42% of the survey participants, should be cheaper than face-to-face tuition. But most of those who were already being tutored remotely were not paying less.
 The findings shed light on a “grey zone” in the tax system when it came to private lessons and indicated it was “not really regulated”, Jaruseviciene said, ahead of talks with the education ministry.
 Speaking about the situation in Lithuania, where she comes from, and where individual online private lessons were partially funded by the government, Jaruseviciene said peer-to-peer learning – whereby older students would give lessons for free as part of a required 20 hours of social work in order to attend university – was encouraged.

No new roadwork permits near schools to ease back-to-school traffic,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/no-new-roadwork-permits-anticipation-back-school-traffic.1098280,19-09-2024,005265.png,"No new permits for road works near schools will be issued in the coming weeks, as part of Transport Malta's plan to ease traffic congestion ahead of the academic year, which starts next week. 
 In a news briefing on Wednesday, TM officials said new permits for road works near schools will be suspended during the back-to-school period.  
 Officials said new permits will only be issued after a thorough review to ensure minimal traffic impact.
 Contractors with existing permits must inform the road works unit before carrying out any work during the back-to-school period.
 When asked if this applied to Mdina Road in Qormi, where works were planned to be completed by the start of the academic year, Transport Malta CEO Kurt Farrugia clarified that the transport regulator is not in charge of the project.
 “We are informed that works are reaching their final stages and by next week it will be mostly complete, with asphalting works to be carried out during off-peak hours,” he said.
 TM aims to improve traffic flow with proposed minor interventions on narrow residential streets and near schools.  
 Asked why such improvements have not been carried out during the summer months, TM officials said some have been prioritised over others.
 Farrugia said that local councils have also been told to restrict permits for road closures or works during peak traffic hours, effective immediately. 
 Such permits in areas close to schools or prone to traffic congestion will no longer be granted to those seeking a road closure from Monday to Friday between 6 am and 9.30 am. 
 The agency said it believes that morning drop-offs and afternoon collections significantly contribute to traffic build-up.
 However, the new strategy will focus on enforcement to reduce illegal stops and address other limitations, such as narrow streets or inadequate infrastructure. 
 The renewed push for enforcement will see the addition of 55 enforcement officers and 10 patrolling officers on motorbikes, joining LESA and police officers on the roads next week. 
 “With consistent enforcement, we hope we will be able to improve traffic flow and safety for motorists and pedestrians,” Claudio Spiteri, Chief Officer of Enforcement, said. 
 Officers will penalise illegal drop-offs and stops. 
 During peak hours, they will remain at key intersections and in no parking zones to streamline traffic in the morning and afternoon rush hours.  
 The agency will have 27 fixed enforcement points up and running, while another eight areas will see increased patrols. 
 Transport Malta said it plans to introduce new parking restrictions and one-way traffic systems that will help reduce congestion and enhance pedestrian safety.
 Specific junctions and links will be upgraded to improve traffic capacity by addressing bottlenecks and problem areas.
 They also said that traffic signals at major junctions on arterial and distributor roads, as well as at key points on local roads, will be ""optimised"".
 Examples of such projects include the re-alignment of a bus stop in Mrabat Street, Sliema, which will prevent buses from stopping on the road. Another is the removal of a pedestrian crossing at the Mater Dei Hospital roundabout. 
 Discussions are underway with the Education Department to address situations where schools' internal traffic management ends up having an impact on arterial roads.  
 Key problem areas such as the Naxxar educational complex, the Victoria, Gozo, educational complex, Pembroke, Psaila Street Birkirkara, Misraħ Pizzuta in Żejtun and the Żokrija area in Mosta will be placed under observation in a bid to better manage traffic congestion there. 
 Transport Malta also pledged the continuation of the free tow truck service and to have better communication over several platforms including social media.

Watch: Why don't students in Malta protest?,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/watch-why-dont-students-malta-protest.1093011,30-05-2024,"005403.png,005404.png,005405.png,005406.png","On May 7, students filled Valletta’s Independence Square, packing the area in front of the law courts. They gathered to condemn remarks made by the prime minister about the judiciary.
 The demonstration was well-attended, but the crowd paled in comparison to the thousands of students enrolled in post-secondary institutions like the University of Malta and Mcast.
 What motivates Maltese students to speak out and demonstrate?
 
 In an effort to better understand contemporary student protest culture, Times of Malta went to the University of Malta to speak to students.  Around half of those approached declined to answer, because they felt uncomfortable discussing politics. But while a half-empty MEP debate played out in the University’s quadrangle, some students shared their opinions.
   There is apathy going around, but it stems from the root of the issues, it’s not that we don’t care or are lazy. If there is a protest that I feel I need to attend as a Maltese citizen, I will be there. If I feel like it is not organized well or if it is too partisan, I won’t be there.
 I believe in protests, but when I see them organized for or against a party, the argument totally falls apart. Regardless of political affiliations, if something is wrong, you need to stop it. But we must remember that there is still a fear that if you criticise a particular party, you will be associated with the other.
 Students like me are still trying to keep activism alive. Obviously, we are in the minority… but it is important to keep voicing your concerns about the country. We shouldn’t have a biased mindset and not just protest to gain political points. To talk about global issues is important but obviously, what happens locally affects us more directly.
 If I don’t feel I need to protest, why should I just because others are going? You should only protest if you believe there is something wrong. If I am happy where I am and I believe that the government is doing a good job, why should I go protest? Nobody’s perfect.
  When it comes to mainstream topics like Israel and Palestine, I am informed about them because everyone is talking about them even though the information is suppressed as much as possible, and people don’t want to talk about the dispute between those two countries. So I am informed about them and I am passionate about them, but then I don’t understand what's going on half the time in my own country. I don’t really protest because I am not really informed
 It always ends up being the same situation over and over again. The biggest problem in this country is that everything becomes so partisan. Us versus you, in any case, whatever the issue, it goes back to being binary. I have little interest or motivation to get involved, not because I don’t care but because I know the repercussions that come out of it. 
 Throughout the years, students have been at the forefront of activism, but in recent years, there has been a sort of decline. I think that’s because students don’t want to associate themselves with partisan politics. I protest according to the situation. The problem with the protests right now is that there are still partisan narratives.  
  I started my course three years ago and from my first year till now the student activism culture has changed drastically. When I started, quad was full of people, but now it's almost always empty. You don’t see students milling about and engaged. I noticed a slight decline, but when students are passionate, they will go out.
 The general student population will not show up. We have a two-party system, so you are either in party A or B, and you don’t have any other alternative. In Malta, we have a lot of tgergir, but when it comes to showing action, they don’t because they are scared of being seen and heard. You don’t have to be an activist to go on the street, at the very least, vote.

Education Commissioner calls for MCAST dispute to be resolved,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/education-commissioner-calls-mcast-dispute-resolved.1094106,18-06-2024,005444.png,"The Commissioner for Education on Tuesday urged the government and the Malta Union of Teachers to resolve their dispute at MCAST, which has affected almost 8,000 students waiting for their assessment and final exam marks. 
 Last month, the MUT ordered staff at MCAST not to disclose exam and assessment results to students after talks over the new collective agreement failed. 
 Lecturers, student mentors, senior research officers, technicians, learning support educators, student services, directors and deputy directors have all been told to follow the directives.  
 “This has led to students, including students in their final year of studies, being left entirely in the dark as to their progression and possible further studies,” a statement by the Ombudsman read. 
 “From the information available, almost 8,000 are affected in one way or another.”
 While the Ombudsman acknowledged the fundamental right of educators to engage in industrial action to voice their grievances,  he said it should not be done in a way that causes harm to students, who have a right to know the result of their studies. 
 “Both parties should refrain from using the students’ plight to put undue pressure. Furthermore, both parties should not display intransigence.”
 This is not the first time directives have left MCAST students feeling helpless. 
 Back in January, MCAST students walked out of their lectures after similar industrial action left them without exam results for two months. 
 Last month, MCAST Business Enterprise students walked out of their lecture after they were told their annual exams would not be held due to invigilators’ absence. Lecturers had told them they would not invigilate owing to industrial actions ordered by the MUT.

 In a strongly-worded statement, eight academics who form part of the department said that they were deeply concerned by the Planning Authority’s recent decision, which they said would result in the “contextual obliteration of what remained in the fort’s upper part.”
 This week, the PA voted to approve an application that will see the historic British-era barracks at Fort Chambray demolished, to make way for a hotel and apartments.
  The application was filed by developer Michael Caruana and was approved with five votes in favour and two against, despite the protests of many  heritage organisations.
 Art historians have now lent their voices to those protests.
 In a statement, the university department said it was “alarmed by the insensitive and dismissive attitude towards significant historic buildings and the manner in which they are so easily destroyed or dismantled to make way for commercial enterprise.”
 They also expressed concern at the “lack of value that context and history have”, as well as by what they said was a lack of support offered by institutions and professions “that are actually meant to protect, conserve and foster regeneration of historic monuments.”
 They noted the irony of Malta celebrating its 50

 Full-time employment reached almost 287,000 in June – the most recent month for which data was available – more than a 5% increase compared to the year before, NSO figures released on Monday show.
 The number of part-time workers also increased by almost 6% to reach 35,000.
 The main gains were seen in the private sector, which swelled its workforce by more than 6% to reach over 234,000 full-time workers.
 The number of public sector full-time workers increased by a more modest figure, meanwhile, climbing by just under 2% to reach more than 52,000, the NSO said. 
 The figures continue a largely unbroken trend of employment increases since 2005. Despite some short-term blips, the number of workers has continued to rise over the years, doubling the 150,000 seen two decades ago.
 The country has seen a large population increase during the same period, however, rising by 140,000 since 2005, according to NSO figures.
  A closer look at NSO figures shows employment gains were not confined to one or two sectors, but all industries seeing gains.
 Full-time employment saw the biggest proportional gains in hospitality, with the proportion of workers engaged in food and accommodation jobs rising by almost 13%, followed by household activities (12%) and professional, scientific and technical activities (8%).
 Meanwhile, the water supply industry saw the biggest proportional increase in part-time workers (17%), followed by financial and insurance activities (15%) and the arts, entertainment and recreation sector (12%).
 In terms of numbers, hospitality and the motor trade contributed the most to full-time employment gains, with almost 5,000 new workers entering the professions.
 Part-time employment was boosted most by professional, scientific and technical activities and administrative and support services, which grew by a combined 1,500 workers. 
 Full-time employment for men and women rose at similar rates, increasing by 5% and 6% respectively, while the number of full-time self-employed workers rose by 725, the NSO noted.
 But while the figures are likely to come as good news to many, the number of registered unemployed rose by a third over the same year to reach almost 1,200 people.

Education ministry racks up hefty expenses on travel and luxury cars,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/education-ministry-racks-hefty-expenses-travel-luxury-cars.1097628,09-05-2024,006267.png,"The education ministry has racked up considerable expenses related to travel and the purchase or hiring of luxury vehicles in recent months.
 According to a list of the ministry’s direct orders published in The Malta Government Gazette this week, taxpayers paid €14,634.14 for Education Minister Clifton Grima and his head of secretariat to spend nine days in a Paris hotel during the Olympics.
 The bill covered two hotel rooms at the four-star Hôtel Le Relais Saint-Honoré, including breakfast and city tax.
 In reply to questions, a ministry spokesperson said that Grima’s stay in Paris during the Olympics was “essential” due to several key engagements.
 “These included meetings organised by the French government, the International Olympic Committee and the Commonwealth Ministers Meeting. Additionally, there were other meetings, including a productive meeting with the president of the Commonwealth Games Federation about the potential for Malta to host future events. The minister was also present to support our Maltese athletes competing in the Games,” he said.
 “All these meetings were arranged well in advance with the respective counterparts, reflecting Malta’s commitment to international sport relations.”
 Travel expenses for two additional ministerial delegations also involved considerable expense.
 Five business class tickets for a delegation to China cost taxpayers €19,475, while six tickets to Estonia cost €16,500.
 Times of Malta asked the ministry why the cost of these flights had risen so much when searching for commercial flights to these destinations revealed they were presently available for purchase at least a third of the cost.
 The spokesperson said that, while Grima did not travel to Estonia himself, all of the flights were procured for official purposes and that the costs “reflect the specific requirements of official travel”.
 These, he said, may sometimes differ from standard commercial fares due to the need for flexibility and adherence to procurement standards.
 The list of direct orders spending also revealed that the ministry spent some €121,228.83 procuring luxury cars to be used by Grima as well as education permanent secretary Matthew Vella.
 The public purse found its drawstrings plucked open to fund a €73,771.20, five-year lease for a BMW X3 x Drive 30, to be used by Grima as a ministerial car.
 Additionally, the ministry also bought a new electric vehicle for Vella, a BMW iX3 for €47,457.63.

 Prime Minister Robert Abela toured the San Ġwann primary school yesterday as the final preparations were being made.
 Educators, he was quoted as saying, are a crucial part of the children’s future, hence, the country’s strong investment in teachers. He recalled that, this October, educators will see increases in their salary thanks to the “best” agreement ever signed a few months ago.
 In a statement signed by education shadow minister Justin Schembri, the Nationalist Party said that, for children to progress and achieve their goals, schools, teachers and educators required not just support and encouragement but also the tools to succeed.
 It said policies that support equal and fair education, helping children and young people develop themselves throughout their learning journey must continue to be shaped.
 “For the PN, the focus should be on preventive, inclusive, creative and digital education,” the statement said.
 The Church's Secretariat for Catholic Education welcomed the students and teachers, particularly 2,000 new students joining its 55 schools.
 It said it had held a series of meetings for new teachers, underlining the principles of quality education, Catholic ethos and respect for everyone's dignity.

 The union and government have been locked in negotiations over a new collective agreement for several months, and last week MUT said the negotiations appeared to be going nowhere. 
 The MUT also called out Clifton Grima for lying about wage increases promised to teachers. The union said Grima's talk about teachers getting a €10,000 raise and new teachers starting on a €36,000 salary “are nowhere to be found in government's financial proposals to MUT”.
 Addressing a press conference in front of the Maria Regina Qawra Primary School, Gauchi said allegations made by MUT that the government was backtracking on what was already agreed is worrying and has demotivated many educators.

 ""The government cannot keep expecting educators to solve the country's problems on the one hand, and at the same time treat educators as push-overs.  Whilst the country boasts of record economic growth, it cannot keep short-changing educators.""

Which beaches in Malta have the cleanest bathing water?,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/which-beaches-malta-cleanest-bathing-water.1097803,09-12-2024,006660.png,"The localities with the cleanest bathing water are mostly found in Gozo and Comino, a recent study has found.
 Only three of the top 10 were in Malta, according to a recent analysis of ocean bacteria levels by University of Malta professor Victor Axiak.
 Popular swimming areas such as Ramla Bay, Comino’s Santa Marija Bay and Mġarr’s Għajn Tuffieħa all made it into the top 10, while other favourite spots such as Xlendi and St George’s Bay appeared near the bottom.
 Balluta was the least clean locality listed in the study which, only using data from 2021 to 2023, did not take into account the recent contamination which led to the bay being closed for two months.
 Gozo’s Ramla il-Ħamra, Daħlet Qorrot, Marsalforn, San Blas and Ħondoq ir-Rummien were joined by Comino’s Santa Marija and San Niklaw localities to occupy seven of the 10 spot spots.
 Only Għajn Tuffieħa, Wilġa St Julian’s and White Tower Bay in Malta featured in the top 10.
 Meanwhile, popular tourist hotspots Sliema, Mellieħa and St Paul’s Bay were among the five least clean areas. 
 
 In total, 44 localities across Malta, Gozo and Comino were included in the study, which was carried out using data collected from 87 coastal stations by the Environmental Health Directorate.
 Axiak looked at weekly levels of two types of bacteria, Escherichia coli and  Intestinal enterococci, from each station for three years. He used this data to calculate a value representing the fifth highest levels of contamination for each locality.
 Scoring the highest overall, Balluta was used as the yardstick by which to measure other localities, representing full, or 100% contamination.
 Axiak said he used the two types of bacteria as to “check whether a bathing locality is fit for bathing”, adding the presence of each usually suggested sewage leaking into the sea.
  However, he stressed that while some beaches fared better than others, according to EU and World Health Organisation (WHO) standards, “almost all 87 stations were officially classified... as fit and safe for bathing”.
 “Only 1% of the data failed to satisfy these safety requirements,” he said.
 
 Describing the levels of contamination in Balluta as “astoundingly high” and 10 times the level of the best beaches, the university professor said that in general, busy bathing areas and those in densely populated urban areas “rarely make it in the top cleanest 10 spots”.
 The quality of the country’s bathing water has been called into question this summer after contaminated water led to the closure of several popular beaches.
 Balluta Bay was closed for around two months due to E. coli contamination, leaving tourists disappointed and residents and businesses owners frustrated.
 The beach was later engulfed in murky green water attributed to algae growth described as a “red flag” by marine biologist Alan Deidun, who suggested sewage leaks could accelerate the growth. The Water Services Corporation (WSC) later insisted their network was not to blame.
 Meanwhile, in early July, St George’s Bay in Birżebbuġa was closed for a second time after becoming contaminated with sewage traced to a blockage in a nearby public toilet.
 Several spots in St Paul’s Bay also saw closures over the summer.

Malta on track to receive 3.2 million tourists by end of the year: Deloitte,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/malta-track-receive-32-million-tourists-end-year-deloitte.1092849,22-05-2024,006857.png,"Malta is on track to see 3.2 million tourist arrivals by the end of the year, new data published on Wednesday revealed.
 The same data reveals the number of tourism arrivals jumped by 30% in the first quarter of the year when compared to 2023, increasing by some 134,000 arrivals.
 According to the data, some 526,000 people visited Malta in the first three months of the year, with the number of guest nights spent in Maltese hotels increasing by 481,000 compared to the same period last year.
 The data was presented by researchers from Deloitte, who presented the latest numbers for the tourism industry during the Malta Hotels and Restaurants Association’s hospitality forum on Wednesday.
 Spending from tourists in Malta also increased at pace by 30%, with visitors leaving €406 million in the economy during the year’s quarter.
 The study suggests that if the industry continues to operate at this pace, Malta is on track to see 3.2 million tourist arrivals by the end of the year.
 In 2023, Malta received over three million visitors, over eight percent higher than the previous record high in 2019- when almost 2.8 million visitors travelled to Malta. 
 Occupancy of hotel rooms also remained at a healthy pace, with 5-star hotels seeing an increase of 5.3 percentage points, 4-star hotels a 1.8 percentage point increase and 3-star hotels a 1.4 percentage point increase when compared to the same quarter in 2023.
 On average, 5-star hotels charged €135.50 per room, 4-star hotels charged €61.40 per room and 3-star hotels an average of €41.60 per room.
 These marked increases of 7.9%, 13.7% and 8.6% respectively.
 Deloitte Financial Advisory Director Matthew Xuereb pointed out that, despite seeing improvement in both occupancy and room rates, median 5-star and 4-star operators only broke even when considering their gross operating profit, with the bottom quartile of those who reported their data ultimately making a loss.
 The “elephant in the room” he said, is the availability of bedstock, which jumped by 6.2% or some 850 rooms from 2019 to 2023, with signs that occupancy has started to lag in some sectors.
 Occupancy in 5-star hotels went down by 7.6% but managed to stay on top of things as the room rate has gone up by 22% in tandem.
 As continued growth in arrivals will stimulate further demand for investment, Xuereb urged a concerted effort to “manage expectations”, especially when educating the market.
 He said the sector must focus on offering quality, noting that higher quality properties can command higher rates, allowing them to better absorb shocks in the market.
 In terms of airlines, with Ryanair becoming a major contributor to Malta’s growth in flight capacity, Xuereb questioned whether the country should remain so dependent on the carrier for its long-term growth ambitions. 
 In his address, MHRA president Tony Zahra said that maintaining air links is critical in keeping the tourism industry stable and suggested that courting the North American market more will result in higher-spending tourists. 
 “We need direct connections to America because the American market is the best market because they will spend the largest amount of money,” he said. 
 Referring to the MHRA’s 2022 carrying capacity study, which found that Malta would need 4.7 million tourists to sustain occupancy, Zahra said the country desperately needs to improve its infrastructure to reach those heights and that some of these issues could only be solved through “divine intervention”.
 “It is clear that there are some areas where our decision makers must make some unpleasant decisions, but while not making any decision at all is also an option, would that be the right option?” he questioned.
 Surefire ways hoteliers can work to future-proof their business is to make sure they are offering good hospitality and that their staff is well trained. The industry should also look towards artificial intelligence to see how it can improve its offering, he suggested. 
 Shadow Minister for Tourism Mario DeMarco told conference attendees that while numbers continue to provide a promising outlook, more must be done to ensure the product remains up to scratch and that local residents are not fatigued by tourism to the point that they begin to reject it. 
 The country’s infrastructure, specifically roads, public transport, the health sector, energy production and waste disposal, are already buckling under the strain of the growing population but pushed to their limits at the peak of tourism arrivals that could threaten to cripple the industry and the country as a whole, he said.
  “Increasing tourism arrivals by 30% without planning for such an increase was obviously going to have the impact that we are seeing every day,” DeMarco said. 
 “I am not advocating for a cap on tourism numbers, but a planned approach to manage the country’s carrying capacity that takes into account the people who already live in Malta.” 
 So far, no study has suggested what the “magic number” of tourist arrivals it is the country should aim for, and this is a critical piece of information that the country must establish going forward, he added. 
 While this problem is not unique to Malta, DeMarco pointed out the growing movement of residents irked by tourism activities, including those protesting to reclaim pavement space from restaurants, Valletta residents pushing back against loud music played late at night and frequent complaints of a lack of enforcement. 
 “It is useless to continue to work on this if the community does not want to welcome more tourism,” he warned. 
 DeMarco said there is not enough information on what KM Malta Airlines is doing differently to prevent ending up in the same situation as AirMalta, which was forced to shutter. 
 He also criticised the Malta Tourism Authority for not being transparent about how it spends its marketing budget. 
 On his end, Tourism Minister Clayton Bartolo said the government has promised to spend €6 million on new public cleansing equipment to be distributed all over Malta, but with a particular focus on its tourism zones.
 He said focusing on public cleanliness will not only improve Malta's appearance but also improve it as a tourist destination.
 He said the MTA is also engaged in competitive marketing practices as it is seeking out every leverage to sell the country to travellers over competing destinations.
 This includes highlighting sustainability and the country’s authentic heritage values as well as diversifying into new niches, such as military tourism. He added that the cruise industry is also making positive growth in Malta this year, with the number of passengers expected to exceed the 1 million mark by the end of the year.

All clear: no reports of traffic congestion as schools reopen,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/all-clear-no-reports-traffic-congestion-schools-reopen.1098527,25-09-2024,"007129.png,007130.png,007131.png,007132.png,007133.png,007134.png","Traffic was moving easily on roads from St Julian’s to Paceville and Pembroke when Times of Malta visited them, with no stops at expected junctions such as the Paceville roundabout or Swieqi tunnels. 
 In Pembroke, where residents have previously complained about the number of schools within short distances of each other creating traffic chaos, roads were also relatively clear at around 7.15 am, with a few cars making quick stops at designated points for drop-offs and quickly continuing on their way. 
  
 Driving through a small section of the Coast Road, the Pembroke Junction and Regional Road was mostly seamless, with traffic coming to a stop at the appropriate junctions and quickly resuming. 
 There was some congestion at the Swatar and Mater Dei exit of the Birkirkara Bypass, creating a small tailback that slowed down traffic coming from the skatepark roundabout at around 7.30 am. 
 But once over this obstacle, cars flowed down the bypass freely and only came to a significant stop a few metres ahead of the main junction between Birkirkara, Lija and Mosta. 
 Car build-up increased when Times of Malta reached the Technopark roundabout in Mosta, close to Pama Supermarket. But there were no significant stops or prolonged standstill. 
 The detour from Pantar Road through rural Attard eventually led to the town’s primary school, where the load leading out was closed to traffic. 
 Although the closure required a turn-around to avoid a dead-end, under the watchful eye of the on-duty police officers, traffic did not congregate much in the area as the next road over connected motorists to the main road out of Attard. 
  The rest of the journey between 8 am and 8.30 am, ran smoothly through Mrieħel, Marsa, Qormi, Żebbuġ and back to Mrieħel with no congestion to speak of. 
 Motorists who travelled from the south of Malta towards the centre and the north similarly reported not encountering any significant traffic or delays. 
 While traffic was slow-moving on the Marsa Junction, it flowed without issue. Even the Marsa-Ħamrun bypass – a notorious traffic blackspot – did not experience the intense congestion many feared.
 Noticeably, most of the main junctions had at least one Transport Malta official on hand to direct traffic, with busier junctions even having two or three officials there. 
 The increased presence of the authorities on the roads is part of Transport Malta’s plan to ease back-to-school traffic congestion. 
 The plan includes other efforts such as pausing roadworks during rush hour in busy areas and putting a stop to councils issuing permits for road closures during these times. 
  Transport Malta also said it is focusing on stepping up enforcement on illegalities that contribute to congestion, such as illegal stops or parking, in a bid to decongest areas that typically suffer from traffic build-up. 
 This is not to say that there is an absence of cars on the road. 
 Times of Malta previously reported that  school buses are set to ferry 33,761 students across 3,449 routes this scholastic year. 
 Some 14,000 of those children are ferried to state schools while roughly 19,730 children will be taken to Church and Independent schools.

Students criticise KSU's Freshers’ Week for putting commercial interests over student experience,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/national/131452/students_criticise_ksus_freshers_week_for_putting_commercial_interests_over_student_experience,30-09-2024,000020.png,"Three student organisations have publicly criticised KSU for allowing commercial enterprises to dominate the upcoming Freshers’ Week at the University of Malta, calling for a shift in focus towards student and academic activities.
 In a joint statement released by Studenti Graffitti, Pulse, and S-Cubed, the organisations expressed disappointment that KSU has, once again, given preference to private companies rather than focusing on creating a more inclusive and educational environment for new students.
  The statement argued that spaces such as the central quadrangle in front of Students’ House, Parking Number 4, and areas leading to the Gateway Building will be largely taken up by corporate sponsors, leaving little room for student organisations to engage with freshers.
 ""Freshers' Week should be an opportunity for new university students to meet fellow students, speak to different organisations, and get familiar with the University of Malta. Instead, this week is going to be dominated by commercial enterprises that have no relevance to students’ educational experience,"" the statement read.
 The student organisations are frustrated that, for another consecutive year, they have been relegated to a confined space in front of the university library. They also noted that the crowds and noise caused by the event would disrupt students studying in the library or attending nearby lectures.
 For the past two years, Studenti Graffitti and Pulse have advocated for a change in how Freshers’ Week is organised. They have called for students and academics to be the main focus of the week, and for student organisations to have access to prime spaces for their activities.
 However, according to the joint statement, KSU has yet to act on these requests, prompting the organisations to come together with S-Cubed to intensify their demands.
 The student groups also suggested that the University of Malta should provide financial assistance to KSU to ease the financial burden and encourage a shift away from heavy corporate sponsorship.
 ""We believe that KSU should strive to make immediate changes in the infrastructure and planning of Freshers’ Week and to put the interests of students first,"" the statement concluded.  ",Nicole Meilak ,Education
MaltaToday survey: Concerns about foreigners and traffic eclipse inflation worries,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/data_and_surveys/131564/maltatoday_survey_concerns_about_foreigners_and_traffic_eclipse_inflation_worries,06-10-2024,000086.png,"Summary

 Concern about foreigners working in Malta has re-emerged as the country’s top worry, especially among Labour Party supporters and non-voters, a MaltaToday survey shows. 

 The concern about foreign workers tops the list of voter concerns with 22.4%, while a separate concern with overpopulation appeared in the list with 8.1% citing it as their topmost worry. 

                     The combined results of these two concerns indicates that nearly a third of Maltese voters are concerned about the influx of foreign workers and the linked issue of overpopulation. 

 Significantly, concern about foreign workers is the topmost worry (26.5%) for those who say they will not vote if an election is held now. Current Labour voters are also more concerned about foreign workers (24.8%) than Nationalist voters (17.4%).

 The survey also shows that the second-highest concern is traffic with 21%, followed by corruption at 14.1%. Inflation, which was the highest concern in February has dropped to fourth place at 10%. 

                     Foreign workers, traffic and corruption top list of concerns

 In a clear sign that inflation has been brought under control, concern about rising prices has dropped from being the country’s main concern in February to fourth place. 

 Inflation has been overtaken by concerns about foreigners working in Malta, traffic, and corruption in a MaltaToday survey asked people to list their topmost concern. 

 Moreover, overpopulation has emerged as a separate concern, ranking in sixth place. This means that nearly a third of Maltese voters (31%) are either concerned about foreigners working here or by the sheer growth of the country’s population. 

 A comparison with a similar survey conducted in February shows that concern about inflation has dropped by 19 points, while concern about foreigners has remained stable at 22%. On the other hand, concern about traffic has increased by 12 points. Meanwhile, concern about corruption has dropped by three points to 14%, while concern about overdevelopment and construction has increased by the same rate to 9.5%. 

 The new issue on the radar is a generic concern about overpopulation and the perception that the country has become overcrowded, a sentiment expressed by 8% of respondents. 

 The overall picture emerging from the survey is that the Maltese are less concerned about bread-and-butter issues and are more focused on the consequences of the economic model, namely the increase in foreign workers, traffic, and environmental pressures. 

 The three other minor concerns mentioned by less than 3% of respondents include the environment (3%), low wages and income (2%), and healthcare (1.5%).

 Concern about foreigners highest among non-voters 

 A breakdown by current voting intentions shows that concern about foreigners is greatest among non-voters (26.5%), followed by Labour voters (25%) and is substantially lower among Nationalist voters (17%). 

 Concern about traffic is highest among Labour voters (28%), drops to 21% among non-voters, and decreases further to 14.5% among PN voters. 

 Significantly, corruption, is the main concern of PN voters (27%) but drops to fourth place among non-voters (10%), among whom this issue is overtaken not just by concerns on foreigners and traffic but also by concerns on construction. Concern about overdevelopment drops to 9% among PN voters and to 8% among PL voters.

 Construction worries higher among females, young voters 

 Concern about foreign workers tops the list for all age groups except those over 65 years, among whom this issue is overtaken by traffic and corruption. However, older people are more likely to mention overpopulation as their main concern (12%). 

 Concern about inflation (12%) remains higher among those over 65 years old, dropping to 7% among 16- to 35-year-olds. 

 However, concern about overdevelopment and construction is significantly higher among 16- to 35-year-olds. Among these young voters, 17% mentioned this issue as their topmost concern, compared to just 6% among those over 65. Concern about construction is also significantly higher among females (13%) compared to males (6%).

 South Harbour concerned about foreigners 

 Concern about foreigners rises to a staggering 31% in the Labour-leaning South Harbour region, which includes the party’s Cottonera strongholds. In contrast, concern about foreigners is lowest in Gozo (18%) and the more cosmopolitan North Harbour region (also 18%), which includes Sliema, Gzira, Msida, and St Julian’s. 

 Significantly, concern about construction and overdevelopment is now highest in the Southeastern region, which has seen a notable increase in construction activity over the past decade. In this Labour-leaning region, 15% mentioned this issue as their main concern. 

 Concern about traffic is highest in the Western region, which includes localities like Zebbug and Attard, where this issue emerges as the main concern for 23% of respondents. 

 Significantly, Gozo is the only region where corruption emerges as the top issue (26%). This dissatisfaction with corruption is particularly interesting on a small island characterised by networks of patronage, although it remains to be seen whether this result is a one-off or an emerging trend.

 Corruption concerns tertiary-educated 

 Corruption has also emerged as the main concern of tertiary-educated respondents (20%), along with traffic. Concern about foreigners is highest among the secondary-educated (29%) and lowest among those with a primary level of education (15%) and the tertiary-educated (17%). 

 However, the latter are also more likely to be concerned about overpopulation. In fact, among those with a university level of education, concern about overpopulation (13%) has overtaken concern about construction (8%). Concern about overpopulation is even higher among those with a primary level of education (16.5%). 

 Significantly, in a clear indication that concern about overdevelopment is no longer a middle-class preserve, concern about construction is highest among those with a primary level of education (11%) and those with a secondary level of education (10.5%).      ",James Debono ,Education
Teachers’ union declares trade dispute with MCAST,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/national/131423/teachers_union_declares_trade_dispute_with_mcast,27-09-2024,000107.png,"The Malta Union of Teachers will hold a protest on Tuesday after it delcared a new trade dispute with the vocational skills college MCAST.
 The union and MCAST have been locked in negotiations over a new collective agreement for the past two years and nine months.
 The collective agreement involves eight grades and includes lecturing grades, student support services grades, student mentors, and directors, LSEs, technicians grades, and senior research officers.
 “In the last days there was a deterioration of negotiations from MCAST which led MUT to reconsider its position. To this effect and in view of the latest communication received from MCAST yesterday, which is a regression in negotiations, the MUT is hereby declaring a fresh trade dispute with MCAST,” MUT president Marco Bonnici said.
 The protest will be held outside the MCAST administration block on Tuesday 1 October at 11am.
 MCAST lecturers have expressed concern that their working conditions are still governed by a collective agreement which expired nearly three years ago.
 MCAST lecturers had voiced concerns about the lack of transparency and feedback from the union representing them.
 The last collective agreement was signed in 2018 and expired in December 2021.
 Last November, the MUT issued directives for MCAST lecturers but lifted them in January, claiming to have found a way forward. It again issued directives in May but felt secure enough to partially lift the directives in June.
 The disruption caused by the directives has created a backlog of work which now needs to be addressed along with preparatory work for the new academic year.  ",Matthew Vella ,Education
Education Ministry says number of educators recruited ‘significantly higher’ than resignations - The Malta Independent ,independent,https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2024-10-19/local-news/Education-Ministry-says-number-of-educators-recruited-significantly-higher-than-resignations-6736265037,19-10-2024,000191.png,"
                
        

         The Ministry for Education said that the number of educators being recruited is 'significantly higher' than educator resignations, a statement said Saturday.
 The Ministry referred to recent information presented by the Education Minister in Parliament related to the education sector, and the number of educators who were hired, and who resigned.
 The statement showed a table with the different grades of an educator. There were 51 teachers who resigned, but 177 more were hired.  The statement showed that there were 33 Learning Support Educators (LSE) who resigned, but 71 were hired. Two Kindergarten Educators resigned, with two more hired.
 There was only one Assistant Head who resigned, while 25 others were hired. The total number of resignations was that of 87 educators, while those hired amounted to 275.
 ""It can be noted that in every case, the number of hires was significantly higher than the resignations. In fact, when compared to the overall educator population, the affected ratio was 1.1% for resignations and 3.7% for hires.
 The Ministry said it ensures that a meeting is held with each official who has submitted a resignation, during which, among other things, the reason for the resignation is discussed.
 In several cases, these employees remain within the education sector and even start employment in higher education institutions, where their expertise is needed due to the increasing number of students continuing education after completing secondary school.
 This comes in the context of Malta's early school-leaver rate continuing to decline, the statement said.

"Malta population in 2070 to grow to 811,000",maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/national/129008/malta_population_in_2070_to_grow_to_811000_,06-05-2024,000214.png,"Healthier life years after retirement, older workers, and unprecedented population increase: this is the picture of Malta over the next half-century. 
 Population projections from the finance ministry’s annual report on ageing submitted to the European Commission place the island’s population in 2070 at just under 811,000 – a 53% increase over present figures of 527,000. 
 Not only will Malta host even more people in what is already one of the densest places on earth – 1,666 people per square kilometre – but there will also be fewer young people being born as a healthier population grows older. 
 Indeed, the share of very young people aged up to 14 will decrease from its current 13.4% share, to 11.1% in 2070, while those aged over 65 will increase from 19.3% to a whopping 33.6%. 
  Medical advancements will also guarantee greater life expectancy for men, rising by over six years to reach 87 in 2070, and for women to reach close to 91. 
 And net migration, the difference between incoming and outgoing migration, will fall from 11,456 in 2022 to just under 4,000 in 2070. 
 With one person in three aged over 65 towards the end of the next century, this demographic change means a greater share of the working population aged 20-64 will be bearing the financial ‘burden’ of the elderly: from 63.2% currently financing the pension pot and healthcare cost, that ratio will fall to 51.5% in 2070. 
 Dependency ratios – those who are likely to be “dependent” on the support of others, youths and pensioners, for their daily living – better illustrate the kind of ageing society Malta will be living in, in 2070. 
 The old-age-dependency ratio – those aged over 65 relative to those aged 20-64 – will increase from 30.5% to 65.4% in 2070; while that for those aged over 75, relative to the 20-74 age bracket, will also grow from 11.5% to 30%. 
 In this scenario however, there will be more people gainfully employed in the labour market. For example, there will be far more workers aged 55-64, increasing from 55.3% to 71.8% in 2070. 
 Men’s average exit age from work, currently at just under 63, will edge up to 63.6 years in 2070, and women from 63.1 to 63.6, an increase that reflects the rise of the statutory retirement age by 2027, lengthening the contributory period by 2034, and the incentives to defer retirement. This should result in more people with full contribution postponing retirement by one to four years. 
 With an ageing population comes a higher spend to finance the national pension pot, currently costing 6.2% of Malta’s GDP. By 2070, it will be 10.5% of GDP while revenue from contributions would have fallen from 7.6% to 7.2% of GDP. By increasing retirement age and the contribution period for full pension eligibility, the projected increase in pension expenditure is lowered.   ",Matthew Vella ,Education
Malta with least educated population despite EU’s third highest spend on education,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/national/129867/malta_with_least_educated_despite_eus_third_highest_spend_on_education,27-06-2024,000241.png,"Malta has one of the EU’s highest shares of people with a low level of education, Eurostat data shows.
 According to the EU statistics agency, 40.8% of the population has less than upper secondary education attainment.
 The only other EU member states with similar education statistics are Portugal, Italy, and Spain with 46.2%, 41.7% and 40.1% of their respective populations having low levels of education.
  The Eurostat data shows that 31.1% of the Maltese population obtained medium education, which comprises upper secondary and post-secondary non-tertiary education.
 The data distinguishes between general and vocational qualifications for this educational level, with the latter being more focused on specific jobs.
 In nearly every country, there are more people with medium-level credentials with a vocational orientation rather than a general orientation. This was not the case in Malta. “The extent to which such qualifications prevail in a country reflects both national education systems and labour markets,” Eurostat noted.
 According to Eurostat’s data, 28.1% of Maltese are highly educated, which includes people who attended universities and other tertiary education institutions.
 The data also notes that Malta, along with Denmark and Luxembourg, stands out due to the difference of education levels between men and women, where the difference stands higher than 7% in favour of women.
 Education spend is high, but outcome is below average
 A 2023 European Commission report on Maltese education and training notes the discrepancy between Malta’s expenditure on education and its outcome.
 The report notes that Malta’s spend on education and training in 2021 totalled 12.7% of total public expenditure, making it the third highest in the EU. The Commission noted that this shows, “the relative importance and weight of the education sector compared to other areas of public spending.”
 Despite this, the same report highlights that Malta’s education outcomes are “still below the EU average...”
 The report says that Malta’s sizeable spend could be the reason behind a 10% fall in the rate of early school leavers registered in 2022. This rate stood at 33% in 2005, when it was at an all-time high.
 Government ‘confident’ of initiatives
 Responding to MaltaToday’s questions on how Malta’s low output in education is being addressed, a spokesperson from the Education Ministry referred to changes within the National Education Strategy.
 The 76-page document launched in 2023 was created through a series of 200 meetings with students, families, teachers, and other stakeholders. The government spokesperson stated that the strategy is creating a shift from compensatory measures to preventive measures to address early school leavers.
 “This strategic shift focuses on early intervention to address potential educational challenges before they manifest, ensuring that resources are utilised more effectively to support students from the beginning of their educational journey.”
 The spokesperson listed initiatives such as the enhancement of early childhood education and teacher training as well as the development of inclusive education practices.
 Vocational training was also highlighted, as the spokesperson noted a “strong emphasis” on this form of training, “to provide alternative pathways for students, aligning education more closely with labour market demands and helping to reduce dropout rates.”
 According to the spokesperson, government is confident that these measures will make the country’s education spend more impactful.
 “It is also important to recognise that such comprehensive reforms take time to show their full impact, and we are committed to continuously improving the educational system for long-term success,” the spokesperson concluded.  ",Matthew Farrugia ,Education

The number of non-Maltese students during the same academic year increased by 15% over the previous year.
 The majority of the 59,491 students enrolled in pre-primary, primary, and secondary education were male (51.9 per cent). During academic year 2022-2023, 45.8 per cent of the students enrolled were aged between 5 and 10 years, while 37.6 per cent of students were aged between 11-15 years.  State-run institutions accounted for 59.4 per cent of total enrolments, while 26.9 per cent attended church-run institutions. Students enrolled in independent schools accounted for 13.7 per cent of total enrolments at these levels.
 Total students enrolled in mandatory education during 2022-2023 stood at 49,916. Of these, 54.8 per cent attended primary school, while the remaining 45.2 per cent attended secondary school. When compared to academic year 2021-2022, students increased by 1.1 per cent and 2.7 per cent in primary and secondary schools respectively. The average class size for all schools at the primary level was 18.6 students per class, and 19.2 students per class at secondary level. When analysing class size by type of school, the lowest class sizes at both primary and secondary levels were seen in State schools, while church schools held the highest average class sizes at both levels.
 The district hosting the largest number of school levels in 2022-2023 was the Northern Harbour District (34.0 per cent), followed by the Southern Harbour District (18.9 per cent). In parallel, the majority of students attended schools located in the Northern Harbour District (37.7 per cent), followed by the Southern Harbour District (16.6 per cent). The district hosting the smallest share of enrolled students was the district of Gozo and Comino with 7.1 per cent. More than a quarter of enrolled students resided in the Northern Harbour District (26.8 per cent) while 19.4 per cent of students resided in the Northern District. When looking at dynamics of commuting from residence to school, more than two-thirds of all enrolled students attended schools within the same district of residence (68.9 per cent). Conversely, 31.1 per cent of students attended schools outside their district of residence.
 The number of non-Maltese students enrolled in pre-primary to secondary education during 2022-2023, increased by 15.6 per cent when compared to the previous academic year. The majority of non-Maltese students attended either State-run or private institutions. One in every 4 students enrolled with private institutions were non-Maltese (25.0 per cent), while in State-run institutions 21.1 per cent of students enrolled were non-Maltese. The absolute majority of students enrolled in Church-run institutions were Maltese (99.0 per cent). 63.5 per cent of non-Maltese students enrolled in pre-primary to secondary education during 2022-2023 were third-country nationals.
 When examining foreign languages studied at secondary level, Italian was the most popular language, with over half of the secondary level students learning it (54.5 per cent). Fewer than a quarter of the students studied French (24.3 per cent), while 15.2 per cent studied Spanish and 12.4 per cent studied German.

Minister Galdes ousts Malita Chair as electoral fraud scandal unfolds,theshiftnews,https://theshiftnews.com/2024/05/20/minister-galdes-ousts-malita-chairman-as-electoral-fraud-scandal-unfolds/,20-05-2024,000431.png,"Housing Minister Roderick Galdes has requested that former Labour MEP Marlene Mizzi be removed from Chair of Malita Investments, one of the government entities implicated in electoral fraud and gerrymandering in Siggiewi.
 The Shift is informed that Galdes and Mizzi disagreed about how the government’s financial vehicle company conducted its business.
 As a result, Galdes ordered that the former Labour MEP be removed from her €24,000-a-year part-time role and replaced by someone closer to the minister.
 It is unclear whether Marlene Mizzi’s removal from the top job at Malita Investments is related to the ongoing election fraud scandal.
 Malita Investments plc is a company where the government has a majority stake and invests in affordable housing.
 It is currently embroiled in a scandal after the Court heard how several individuals were coerced by government officials to make false declarations to have their ID cards transferred to unfinished apartments so that they could vote in Siggiewi, Housing Minister Roderick Galdes’ constituency.
 Siggiewi is a highly contested locality. A few votes can decide which party will take the locality’s mayorship for the coming years.
 Following a case presented by the PN, the Court identified Malita Investments and Identity Malta as the government entities coordinating this fraud by arranging the change of ID cards of several people who had been promised an apartment in  Siggiewi so they could vote at the locality in June’s elections.
 In court, officials from Identity Malta said under oath that their instructions came directly from Jennifer Falzon, the CEO of Malita Investments.
 However, in a company announcement, the Board of Malita and Falzon refuted any suggestion that they were involved in this electoral fraud. They asked the Police Commissioner to investigate the Identity Malta officials who made these claims.

KSU issues apology for the removal of Moviment Graffiti’s Freshers’ Week stand - The Malta Independent ,independent,https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2024-10-03/local-news/KSU-issues-apology-for-the-removal-of-Moviment-Graffiti-s-Freshers-Week-stand-6736264580,03-10-2024,000440.png,"
                
        

         Kunsill Studenti Universitarji (KSU) published a statement on Thursday in which it apologised to Moviment Graffiti for events which took place on Wednesday during Freshers' Week at the University of Malta, in which Moviment Graffiti's stand was reportedly removed for displaying material relating to reproductive rights.
 KSU had posted on social media on Wednesday explaining its decision, saying that it had made the decision ""not to allow any abortion related entities to participate in Freshers' Week, no matter the stance of pro-life or pro-choice"". It added that the event of Freshers' Week did not provide an adequate platform for such a discussion ""to take place with the gravitas it deserves"".  With its statement on Thursday, KSU said that the Life Network Foundation should also have been allowed at the event, and continued that neither censorship nor stigmatisation was ever the council's intention.
 ""We regret that our actions came across this way. In our pursuit of a genuine and well-meaning effort to ensure this debate takes place in a more serene environment where mature and civilised conversation could be fostered, an important discussion was stifled,"" the council said.
 KSU said that the University campus should always be a forum for debate, and added that this is a value close to the council's heart which also drives their work and advocacy. It commented that ""the anger generated by the events of this week shows that there must be a national discussion on the issue"", and added that KSU will be proposing the start of a student assembly to student organisations on campus involving all interested students to debate and decide on an official position for the council to adopt moving forward.
 KSU concluded that it intends to conclude this process by the end of the scholastic year.
