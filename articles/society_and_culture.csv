In pictures: Early beach fashions in Malta ,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/in-pictures-early-beach-fashions-malta.1096515,15-08-2024,"002052.png,002053.png,002054.png,002055.png,002056.png,002057.png,002058.png,002059.png,002060.png,002061.png,002062.png,002063.png,002064.png","I have been postponing, over and over again, my response to the request by a reader for pictorial spreads about beach fashions in early Malta because I believed it a difficult commitment to satisfy. 
 Differently from today, not a single one of the hundreds of pre-war postcards shows swimmers on beaches. Paying humble homage to Victorian prudery, card publishers banned that subject as entirely taboo, and public photographers too.
  Adults, especially women, in bathing costumes, may appear, but very exceptionally, in private family albums.
 One 1930s photograph, showing women in the most chaste of swimming gear, has a note handwritten on its back: “I don’t think this should be in the album.”
  Curiously, the only postcard I know of which shows a bathing scene was most likely meant as a morality warning. Published round 1905, it shows policemen arresting a boy swimming in the nude. Apart from that, absolutely nothing.
  Women in swimwear start appearing, timidly at first, aggressively later, with the explosion of the tourist boom that followed Independence. You can date post-war Maltese postcards rather accurately, by measuring how skimpy the bikinis are.
  In an island surrounded by vast expanses of sea and espoused to tropical heatwaves, one would assume sea bathing to have been ingrained in popular culture. 
  If it was, it left very faint records in history. Apart from Toni Bajjada, whose marathon swims during the 1565 Great Siege became the stuff of legend, almost no mention of sea leisure, games or sports appears anywhere in our annals before the 20th century. 
  Malta had to wait till 1928 to send its first water polo team to the Amsterdam Olympic Games which, coincidentally, featured my mother’s brother, Edoardo Magri, later judge.

 Soċjetà Filarmonika Santa Marija will now rent the property from the government without fear of eviction – something it and many other band clubs faced following court rulings about outdated pre-1995 rent laws.
 The government announced the €360,000 purchase in a statement on Saturday.
  Culture Minister Owen Bonnici said band clubs were hugely reliant on their premises, which served as community gathering spots and played essential roles in the organisation of village feasts.
 It is band club members who often drive community initiatives, Bonnici said.
 “It is crucial that we take proactive measures to protect band clubs,” the minister said.
 
 In total, the government is expected to spend €19 million to buy back all the band club properties that are privately owned.
 Other band clubs that have had their property purchased by the government are:
 In a separate statement, the Lands Ministry said that it has secured an arrangement for a Sliema-based band club to keep its leased premises for an additional 50 years.
  The Soċjetà Filarmonika Sliema signed a deal extending its ground rent arrangement at an event presided over by Lands Minister Stefan Zrinzo Azzopardi. 
 Band club president  Jesmond Vella said the deal provided valuable peace of mind.

A year of hope - 10th edition of Caritas Christmas Day lunch launched,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/a-year-hope-10th-edition-caritas-christmas-day-lunch-launched.1102206,12-09-2024,"002129.png,002130.png,002131.png","Sylvia Pace has seen an increase in lonely people attending the annual Christmas Day lunch organised by Caritas for those in need - where she has been volunteering for nine years. 
 “Nine years ago, when I first volunteered, most people who attended could not afford food. But things have changed. Now there are more and more people who come because they are lonely,” said Sylvia who will be helping out again during the 10th edition of the meal which will be held at the Archbishop's Curia.
 “The first time I volunteered I wanted to see what it was all about and help. But now it would not be Christmas without it.  The atmosphere is lovely. It’s genuine Christmas joy,” she said.
  Francesca Abela has been helping ever since the first edition. “Helping and giving, especially at this time of year, is so rewarding,” she said as she encouraged people who will be alone on Christmas day to reach out and attend.
 Last year about 500 people turned up for the lunch – during which the large corridors of the Curia were transformed into a massive dining hall.
  Josef Pace, the psycho-social services coordinator at Caritas, said this year there would also be a Caritas representative on each table to take the contact details of anyone vulnerable who wants to be followed up during the year.
 “This is the year of hope,” he said.
 Caritas director Anthony Gatt said there were many people who were suffering from loneliness. A 2022 survey carried out by the Faculty of Social Wellbeing showed that loneliness remained a major social issue in the community,  with 55 per cent of Maltese saying they feel alone.
 “One woman who attended the lunch last year told me: ‘Eating a piece of bread with you is better than eating a turkey alone’. A former inmate who volunteered to help also told me he was touched to be told ‘thank you’ when he was serving food to people,” he said.
 He added that, when it came to volunteers, the lunch was oversubscribed. “Some of our volunteers came as guests in previous years and then returned as volunteers,” he said.
 The food will again be provided by The Alfred Mizzi Foundation and cooked and served by an army of volunteers, including chefs from the President's palace. Also involved will be the St Peter’s Foundation.
 Episcopal Vicar Martin Micallef said the Christmas Day lunch was “a tangible expression of love”. “It is a message that the Church welcomes everyone and has place for everyone.”

"'Stop commercialising Freshers' Week', organisations urge KSU",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/stop-commercialising-freshers-week-organisations-urge-ksu.1098784,30-09-2024,002153.png,"For the third consecutive year, the organisers of Freshers' Week have come under fire for 'commercialising' campus activities that are meant to help new students familiarise themselves with the University of Malta.
 Moviment Graffitti, Pulse and S-Cubed slammed  Kunsill Studenti Universitarji (KSU) on Monday for choosing to ""serve the interests of private companies whose only purpose is profit"" instead of celebrating the work of students.
 In a statement, the three said the KSU Freshers’ Week should be a week during which new university students have the opportunity to meet other students,  speak to different organisations, meet fellow student activists and familiarise themselves with the university. 
 ""Instead, this week is going to be taken over completely by the many companies that sponsor KSU and which will occupy the central spaces at the university.""
 The central quadrangle in front of the Students’ House, Parking Number Four and the space leading to the Gateway Building are going to be dominated by private companies and commercial enterprises that have nothing to do with university students’ educational experience, they added.
 This year, organisations have once again been relegated to a restricted space in front of the main university library where there will be a lot of crowds and it will be hot. The three added that, as in previous years, the loud music will be a nuisance to students working in the library or attending lectures in the vicinity of these spaces.
 Studenti Graffitti has been calling for a change in the way Freshers’ Week is organised since 2022.
 ""We would like student organisations and academics to be at the core of this week’s activities, where they will occupy the majority of spaces with activities for students and academics within the University of Malta.
 ""Despite these calls, KSU did nothing. Therefore, we are joining two other organisations, Pulse and S-Cubed, to get our message across: We believe that activities organised by students should be at the centre of this special week.""
 They added that KSU should be financially assisted by the University of Malta itself.

More streets named for priests than for women,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/more-streets-named-priests-women.1092700,20-05-2024,"002307.png,002308.png,002309.png,002310.png,002311.png","There are more streets named after priests, friars, bishops, popes and other clergymen than there are named after women, a new study has found.
 The stark gender imbalance stretches all the way to the heavens, because male saints also largely outnumber female saints on the plaques of Malta’s 7,500 streets.
 There is some solace for women, however, as the saint with the most streets named after them is a woman – the Virgin Mary.
 This is part of what has been keeping Dr Yanika Borg very busy over the past few months.
  Through geospatial analysis, web scraping and data analysis, the 34-year-old Maltese data analytics expert based in the UK found there are over 7,500 streets in Malta with more than 6,500 different street names, and that over 3,000 of them are named after someone.
 She then pieced the data together from information gathered from the University of Malta library, Times of Malta and from the internet to uncover the patterns behind those plaque names.
 In the study, titled What’s in a name? A brief look at gender diversity in the street names of Malta, Borg highlights a stark gender imbalance.
 Of all the streets named after people, only 12 per cent are named after women.
 “More are named for male clergy (popes, archpriests, bishops but mostly priests ‒ ‘Dun’) than for women,” she said.
 There are a few women who have been notably celebrated in street names, such as in Vittoriosa, where there is a famous street named after soprano Hilda Tabone, who sang opera in Malta and in Paris in the 1960s, and a street in Sliema named after Russian princess and ballerina Nathalie Poutiatin Tabone, who found shelter in Malta after fleeing the uprising of the Bolsheviks in the late 1910s.
 But far more men are acknowledged and commemorated in street names.
  Moreover, more than a quarter (28%) of Maltese streets named after people are named after saints, Borg found. And again, male saints “still take the centre stage here”.
 It is a female saint, however, that appears on most plaques. Through her various religious titles – such as Santa Marija, l-Assunta, il-Bambina and il- Vitorja – the Madonna has the most streets named after her.
 “St Catherine follows at a very distant second (she is the second most popular lady saint, 12th most popular overall),” Borg said in her study.
 “St Paul is the most popular male saint, but even he doesn’t hold a candle to the Madonna’s mighty presence.”
 After the Virgin Mary, St Paul has the second highest number of streets named after him, followed by St Joseph and St John.
 “Jesus places in a distant 10th position,” Borg found.
  The study also found only seven per cent of streets are named after politicians.
 “Here, once again, it’s a whirlwind of men, with the few Maltese women involved in politics who are commemorated via street names being Agatha Barbara (first woman president), Evelyn Bonaci (a member of parliament in the 1960s and 1970s), Maggie Moran (president of the women’s group in the Labour Party) and Mabel Strickland (a member of parliament in the 1950s and 1960s and a founder of The Times of Malta).”
 Other women do feature in a handful of streets, the study found, but only by virtue of being related to a male politician. Among them, Dom Mintoff’s mother and wife – Ċetta Mintoff and Moyra Mintoff.
 “I find it uncomfortable that these women are being defined by their relation to a man, but in my research I wasn’t able to find anything else about them,” Borg noted.
  The study also found there are more streets named after painters, sculptors, actors, playwrights, poets, musicians, band conductors and statue-makers than there are streets named after politicians.
 Again, women barely feature here.
 “They make up less than 10 per cent of streets named after cultural figures.”
 Borg has a PhD in synthetic biology from University College London and was part of a team of women who sailed across the Atlantic Ocean in 2019 with the international, not-for-profit organisation eXXpedition to gather data on microplastics in the ocean.
 The details about the study on street names, as well as the raw data, can be found on her newly-launched website thedataknitters.com where she colourfully – and often comically – illustrates her findings cleverly, concisely and simply through pictures, maps, tables and graphs.

Pope Francis responds to concerns raised by Maltese parents on trans doctrine,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/pope-francis-responds-concerns-raised-maltese-parents-trans-doctrine.1091849,21-06-2024,"002426.png,002427.png","Pope Francis has responded to concerns raised by a Maltese LGBTIQ parents' group over fears that a new Vatican document could be interpreted as condemnation of transgender people. 
 In early April, the Vatican released a document titled Dignita Infinita, which outlines contemporary threats to human dignity, including war, digital violence, gender theory and sex changes, amongst other topics. 
 Drachma - a Maltese group for parents of LGBTIQ people, felt the need to write to the Pope about this document as they feared it could further sour the relationship of queer Catholics to the Church. 
 Pope Francis, they said, has responded to their concerns with an ”open heart”.
 Even though the document maintained the Church’s long-standing position on gender theory and gender affirming surgery, Drachma, felt they had to push back against this position. 
 Drachma is an organization that provides a space for anyone who believes in God and is seeking sexual and spiritual integration within their life.
 Louise Grech, the coordinator of Drachma Parents said, “There were lots of good points in the Digita Infinita, but the message relating to trans people was abrasive and merited a response.”
 That is why, on April 23, the organisation sent a letter to Pope Francis outlining their concerns.
 “Almost immediately after we sent the letter, we received a response in which he said he received our message with an open heart and encouraged us to continue our work,” said Grech.
  The organisation fears that outlining gender theory and affirming care as a 'threat to human dignity' could further isolate Catholic trans people and their families from each other, their communities and their faith. 
 “We are already seeing Trans people being kicked out of their homes and an increase in suicidal ideation,” said Grech.
 Such drastic reactions often result from the parents of trans children feeling wary of society’s reaction to their children’s gender identity or because of their religious beliefs pushing them into a dangerous dogmatic direction, she said. 
 Grech also noted that it was clear to her that there was no consultation with the community or experts.
 “This needs to be collaborative, and the Church needs to be on board. We need them to listen, to learn, and to understand.”
 Nonetheless, the organisation maintained that they believe Pope Francis has helped change the culture positively.
 They outlined instances where the Pope met with trans women and when he met with Sister Jeannine Gramick, a nun who was shunned for working tirelessly with the LGBTIQ community.
 Grech hopes there will be more space for communication and collaboration on these matters in the future and maintains that her organisation will continue to move forward in a positive direction.

In album after bulging album, I found hardy any images of women at work (a working woman was not a mara tax-xogħol). With perseverance, I eked out enough photos for what, I trust, has turned into an enlightening project.
  At a time when society assigned sharply distinct roles to men and women, not surprisingly women mostly figure in traditionally feminine ‘domestic’ functions, like parenting, nursing, spinning and weaving, lace-making, tailoring, cooking, washing and ironing.
  In agriculture, the heavier tasks, like ploughing, reaping, threshing, watering, transport, fell on men while women appear mostly engaged in marketing agricultural produce. Not to mention construction, metal work, carpentry, whitewashing, husbandry. Never a woman worker in sight.
  The only exception in the building trade were the ballata, those women who laid and battened waterproof roofing made of powdered terracotta (pozzolana). I do not have photos of these.
  One trend, very prominent and consistent in early image-making shows that women did not carry heavy loads in their hands or on their shoulders but precariously balanced on their heads, the African way. These counterpoising feats, so universal up to the war years, now belong to the past.
  Also noticeable, the almost total absence of obesity in mature women, who never left the house with heads uncovered.
  Relatively few early commercial photographers showed interest in women at work. Horatio Agius from Cottonera (1844-1910), could be an exception. In the late 19th century, he marketed a popular series of Maltese figurines, which included several women displaying their work attributes. Besides him, little else.
  I may follow this up with another feature about women in less fatiguing pursuits.

 Not a stealthy, gradual transformation.
  On the contrary, one that is dramatic, transformative, and revolutionary.
 Are they serving Valletta, or is Valletta serving them?
 They once helped feed the city. Now the city is feeding them.
  Before, most cafés and pubs vaunted distinct personalities, possibly because they attracted different clientele.
 The bourgeoisie had hijacked Cordina, the unchallenged doyen, turning it into a social club – the same people sitting interminably at the same tables, bartering gossip.
 And the flirts too – Cordina only employed the prettiest waitresses.
  Café Premier, the reincarnation of the historical Café de la Reine, catered mostly for passing trade but also for music lovers; and for chess devotees, morphing into their informal national club.
 Mutumallu, in Du Balli, open 24/7, became the haven for insomniacs.
  Gambrinus, Museum and the Central thrived almost exclusively on lawyers and their clients from the courts nearby.
 What united them?
 They all served pastizzi and  qassatat.
  Relatively few restaurants in Valletta then – the British, and, to buttress imperial loyalty, the Britannia, the Osborne, Frascati, Malata for ravioli, Dimitri’s, Alexandra’s, Bologna, Cadena and the fish and chips eateries in the Gut, mostly forgettable.
  ‘Puliti’ boozers rooted for Captain Caruana, Eddie’s, Charles Grech, Tikka, Ellul’s and, later, The Pub. To the Lantern gravitated tipplers and gays alike.
 Some of these Valletta protein and carbohydrate dispensers promoted business through publicity postcards.
 I am homing in on a few of the later ones, mostly from the 1970s to the 1990s, by specialised publishers like David Moore, Vulcan, Penprint, Sinet, Promotion Services and Artex.
 Mainstream producers, like Cathedral Library, Perfecta, ABC Library and Alfred Galea Zammit also reserved niches for business postcards.

 Eliza Demanuele, now 12, was looking forward to celebrating the next religious milestone with friends.
 Her mother, Marthese Camilleri, had invited all her classmates and ordered in food for the event.
 But in the end, only one child turned up, Eliza’s best friend.
 “I felt sad for Eliza, and she even saw me cry one time,” her mother said.
 “But I was still happy she had her best friend there”.
 Eliza has been diagnosed with non-speaking autism, which means she has difficulty with speech.
  The neurodevelopmental disorder means she also has challenges with socialising and is often left out of invitations to others’ parties.
 But Marthese says her daughter goes through life with a big smile and is described as the “sunshine” in their household.
 Recently she started music therapy and has begun humming along to the songs she likes.
 She is on the waiting list for Villa Bianca, the Malta Trust Foundation’s provider of music therapy for children who have little access to such artistic experiences.
 As she approaches her teenage years, her mother said she is determined that her daughter won’t spend her teen years without friends.
 She hopes that in the future, she will be able to access a device to help her communicate.
 “I wish to someday have a conversation with my daughter,” she said.
 
 With the Malta Trust Foundation, set up by former president Marie-Louise Coleiro Preca, Eliza is learning how to socialise and create friendships.
 The foundation seeks to support vulnerable communities through initiatives that are both educational and empowering.
 From noon to midnight on Saturday, The Malta Trust Foundation will be holding a televised marathon. Donations can also be made via the BOV mobile app on 79520040 or a cheque can be sent to The Malta Trust Foundation.

 An initial phase of this restoration project saw workers restore the Polverista gate section of the bastions, which joins Cospicua and Fgura.
 Stonework in that section was in a bad state of disrepair and parts of it had to be rebuilt from scratch, the Culture Ministry said in a statement on Saturday.
 The Cottonera Lines date back to the period of the Knights of St John. They were designed by Antonio Maurizio Valperga.
  Workers are now cleaning the stone of dirt and dust and replacing any stonework that has lost its shape or structural integrity over time. Windows on the bastions are to get new galvanised steel protectors, to prevent pigeons from roosting in them.
 Works are being carried out by the Restoration and Preservation Department.
 Culture Minister Owen Bonnici and Local Councils parliamentary Secretary Alison Zerafa Civelli – a former mayor of Cospicua – visited the site this week. They were accompanied by Cospicua Mayor Marco Bonnici and Fondazzjoni Kottonera chairman Joe Mizzi.
 Bonnici said the second phase of works is expected to cost €650,000 and once completed will mean more than 4,500 square metres of bastions will have been restored.
 “The Cottonera lines are an important part of our national identity and restorng them not only improves the area’s historic value but also benefits future generations,” he said.
 He thanks Restoration Department workers for their contribution.
 Zerafa Civelli praised Cospicua’s local council for having pushed for the project to be carried out.

Lawyers urge Identità: 'Halt policy change harming TCNs seeking work in Malta',timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/lawyers-urge-identita-halt-policy-change-harming-tcns.1097009,21-08-2024,002540.png,"A group of immigration lawyers have flagged a change in policy and an ""alarming situation"" unfolding at Identità that they say is causing unnecessary hardship for third-country nationals seeking to work in Malta.
 The sudden change in policy undermines the integrity of Malta's migration process, they are claiming, urging Identità to recognise challenges faced by TCNs in meeting a 180-day deadline to get a visa.
 As things stand, TCNs are allowed to apply for work permits while residing outside of Malta. Upon the approval of their application, they receive what is known as an Approval in Principle letter, which grants them 180 days to present themselves before Identità in Malta.
 
 However, lawyers note that over the past years, this 180-day period has proven to be an unrealistic deadline for many applicants abroad, primarily due to the extended processing times of visa applications in their countries of residence.
 This creates a troubling scenario where once individuals finally receive their visa to enter Malta, their 'approval in principle' letter would have expired.
 Until recently, this situation was managed with a degree of understanding, with people who obtained a visa being allowed to enter Malta and proceed to Identità to finalise their work permit application, even if the letter has expired.
 However, a group of concerned lawyers and legal procurators on Wednesday said that over the past few days, people presenting themselves at Identità with a valid visa but an expired letter were told their visas were being revoked.
 For these lawyers, this is a ""drastic and troubling change"" that has caused significant distress and confusion.
 They believe the change in policy reflects a lack of compassion and common sense in addressing what is already a challenging and bureaucratically burdened process.
 ""These people have often waited for months to secure their visas and travel to Malta, only to be met with further unexpected and unnecessary obstacles upon arrival.
 ""The latest adopted position demonstrates an alarming disregard for the challenges these individuals face, many of whom have sacrificed much to come to Malta in search of work and a better life,"" they said, warning this change in policy also undermined the trust people placed in Maltese institutions.
 They categorically condemned ""the practice of bringing third-country nationals to Malta under false pretences or any form of exploitation"".
 They said such actions not only betrayed the trust of those who sought a better life but also tarnished Malta's reputation as a fair and just society.
 It was essential that the migration process remained transparent, humane, and free from abuse, they added.
 ""We are deeply concerned by these recent developments and call for an immediate review and remedy to this situation. It is imperative that Identità adopts a more compassionate and logical approach, recognising the practical challenges faced by TCNs in meeting the 180-day deadline due to visa processing delays.
 
 ""We demand that Identità halts this arbitrary revocation of visas in cases where the 'approval in principle' letter has expired due to circumstances beyond the applicants' control and are merely trying to comply with the process as best they can under the circumstances.""
 They urged for a more reasonable and humane solution that acknowledged the reality of visa processing timelines and respected the basic rights of those affected.
 ""We appeal to the relevant authorities to intervene and ensure that this shift in policy is promptly addressed. The current approach is unsustainable and runs counter to the principles of fairness and justice that should underpin our immigration system.""

Jake Vella dies at 15 following long illness,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/young-athlete-jake-vella-dies-aged-15.1097257,30-08-2024,"002686.png,002687.png,002688.png","Updated 6.30pm
 Inspirational teenage athlete Jake Vella, who suffered from a rare condition, died on Friday, aged 15.
 For most of his life, Jake had been fighting an extremely rare condition that caused him to gain weight rapidly despite eating healthy and training continuously.
 His condition took a turn for the worse over the past few days and he died at Mater Dei Hospital, where he had recently been living and receiving treatment.
 His parents Josie and Maruska thanked their family, friends and medical staff, doctors and all nurses who were part of Jake's difficult journey, most especially the Disneyland ward, which was Jake's home for the last 22 months and the ITU ward, where Jake fought his last battles.
 ""Lastly, we would like to thank the public for the constant support that they have shown us. 
 ""Jake has taught us what life is all about, and he will forever live in the hearts of many. We have no words for the bravery he has shown throughout these years,"" they said.
 Inclusion Minister Julia Farrugia Portelli announced his death on Friday morning and paid tribute to Vella's aspirational attitude towards life. 
  ""We lost a boy who inspired a lot of people. You will remain in our hearts always,"" she said. 
 Vella became a beloved, renowned face when he went public with his condition and began documenting his constant fight with the disease while remaining positive and full of energy and determination.
 His neurological condition, known as Rapid-onset Obesity with Hypothalamic Dysfunction, Hypoventilation, and Autonomic Dysregulation (ROHHAD), affects mostly children and there are only around 100 confirmed cases of it worldwide.
 The exact cause of ROHHAD remains unknown and research on it is inconclusive.
  It could be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, but no specific gene has been definitively linked to the condition yet.
 Although immensely painful and uncomfortable, the condition did not dampen the young man’s spirits.
 Vella not only soldiered on but also turned into a philanthropist, organising swimming challenges and sports events with other athletes to raise funds and awareness for  abandoned animals and other causes.
 He worked especially closely with the wife of the Prime Minister, Lydia Abela. The two ran a Christmas campaign, called  Rigal bi mħabba b'differenza, urging hospital visitors to donate foodstuffs for abandoned animals.
  
 Vella had also started to learn boxing and playing the drums, guitar and the piano.
 His relentless efforts won him awards for being an  inspirational athlete and  animal rights activist, and last May he broke the national record for youngest person to swim 100 kilometres in a pool.
 His last public appearance was earlier this month during a live telethon that was raising funds for Inspire. Vella joined via video call from the hospital to urge people to donate funds for the organisation which helps people with disability.
 In a clip aired during that telethon, his parents, Josie and Maruska said there were no signs of the condition when he was born. He was cheerful and went to school normally.
 “Then all of a sudden he began to gain weight rapidly,” Maruska, said. “When he was just four or five, in a few months he went from weighing 17 kilograms to 27 kilograms, and multiple tests and MRIs would not explain what was going on.”
  Eventually, they were told he was diagnosed with ROHHAD, following which he spent years trying everything he could to lose weight, all the while struggling with the symptoms.
 The situation took a turn for the worse two years ago when Maruska was diagnosed with cancer.
 “There was a period when I was afraid I was going to lose them both,” Josie said.
  News of Vella’s death triggered an outpouring of grief and tributes to the teen and his inspiring outlook on life. 
 Both Prime Minister Robert Abela and his wife Lydia expressed sadness at the loss. 
 “Jake left an impact on many people. He always thought about others more than he sought out help for himself,” Robert said in a Facebook post. 
 “The dreams that he had and shared with Lydia, Giorgia and many other families led to beautiful initiatives and for this, we thank him from the bottom of our hearts.""
  Lydia meanwhile recalled how Jake never pitied himself despite the huge challenges he faced.
 Instead, he strived to improve the situation of others, including the voiceless, such as animals, she added.
 European Parliament President Roberta Metsola referred to Jake as a hero who inspired whole generations.
 ""Thank you, Jake. Despite the challenges you faced, you never gave up.
 ""As I told you the last time we met, Malta and Gozo are proud of your legacy.""
  Paying tribute, Opposition leader Bernard Grech said the teenager will be remembered for his bravery courage and beautiful laugh.
 ""Despite the several obstacles and challenges, you never gave up and always made sure to help others.
 ""Your love for swimming and sport inspired many. The whole country admired you and followed your accomplishments with love.""

Defence and observation posts at wartime aerodromes and airstrips,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/defence-observation-posts-wartime-aerodromes-airstrips.1096408,08-08-2024,"002689.png,002690.png,002691.png,002692.png,002693.png,002694.png,002695.png","Not much has been written about the defence and observation posts which were constructed or converted from farmhouses at the perimeter of the former wartime aerodromes and airstrips in Malta. The article by David Spiteri Staines on the Malta FlyPast Issue 6 gave me an impetus to start researching this particular topic.
 A document at the archives of the public works department sheds some light on the acquisition of land needed for the construction of defence posts at the Luqa airfield in 1941.
 A letter by the War Department (WD) sent to the Department of the Public Works (DPW) in April 1941 says that the former requested permission to construct two defence posts along Ta’ San Tumas Road, Luqa, in the vicinity of the Civil Government Division. The first defence post, which measured 15x20 feet, was to be located on a plot of wasteland along the road. The WD asked for permission to be granted encroachment terms on this post.
  The second post, which was still not constructed, was to be in a field. There was no objection to transfer the land − which was civil government property and formed part of lands adjoining the Luqa reservoir − to the WD. However, it seems a problem was encountered regarding this proposed post. Correspondence about it was still being exchanged in 1942.
  By 1942, there were five aerodromes and airstrips in Malta, which were at Ħal Far, Ta’ Qali, Luqa, Qrendi and Safi. The perimeter defence of an aerodrome was under the responsibility of the aerodrome station command. An army officer, known as the station defence officer, was appointed to each aerodrome as the station commander’s military adviser.
 The brigade commander, in whose section the aerodrome was situated, was responsible for coordinating the defence of the aerodrome with the aerodrome station command, station defence officer, command mobile forces and command supporting arms.
  The perimeter defence consisted at least of one infantry company and RAF personnel as detailed by RAF. Each aerodrome had an infantry battalion whose primary role was mobile defence of that aerodrome. One company of this battalion was located for immediate counter-attack purposes. The command mobile forces allotted to an aerodrome were responsible for taking action to prevent the enemy from capturing the aerodrome should they see that the perimeter defence could no longer deal with the situation.
 The aerodromes of Ħal Far, Ta’ Qali and Luqa were run by a battalion company each from the Devon Regiment, Manchester Regiment and the Royal West Kent Regiment.
  The best lines of approach onto the aerodrome for mobile troops in counter-attack role were to be carefully investigated and coordinated by brigade commands to ensure rapid action in emergency situations. Personnel of the perimeter defence also had to be aware of lines selected, so as to avoid any possibility of their fire being misdirected during action by mobile forces.
 In 1942, two 18-pounders manned by gunners of the 13th Battery, Royal Malta Artillery (RMA) covered Ħal Far; at Ta’ Qali were two 18-pounders by the 48/71 Battery, Royal Artillery (RA) and Safi had two 18-pounders manned by the 13th Battery, RMA. No mention of any field artillery defence of Luqa and Qrendi was made.
  The aerodromes were also defended by heavy anti-aircraft barrages and light anti-aircraft guns. Light machine gun protection against low-flying attacks was to be provided by troops allotted to the perimeter defence, augmented by brigades when the situation required.
 On the other hand, if it was not possible to use the Safi and Qrendi airstrips, the sunken mines already laid were to be detonated and so the strips would be rendered useless. The last action to be conducted in the defence of the aerodromes was to obstruct them by surface mines and tubular scaffolding.

Migrants share trials and triumphs of life in Malta with the Archbishop,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/migrants-share-trials-triumphs-life-malta-archbishop.1092253,05-10-2024,002790.png,"Working migrants shared the highs and lows of their life in Malta with Archbishop Charles Scicluna last month, in an event commemorating the feast of St Joseph the Worker. 
 The group of people, who hail from sub-Saharan and West Africa and South and Southeast Asia, shared their stories with the Archbishop in an event organised by the Church’s Migrants Commission and Justice and Peace Commission. 
 In a statement, the Curia said that during the event, migrants said that while Malta has become their home, where they feel safe and are able to form meaningful relationships, they also face abuse and exploitation at work and struggle with xenophobia and bureaucratic delays. 
 “Those present reported experiences of deep suffering when facing asylum procedures, or when attempting to obtain or renew the single work permit. One issue that deeply impacted all workers’ quality of life - of whatever nationality - was the exorbitant increase in housing costs witnessed over the last few years,” the statement said. 
 The participants also talked about wanting to find more stability and security for their children born in Malta as, despite living and working in the country for many years, they still lack proper and secure documentation and live in constant fear of being deported.
 The group discussed the need for there to be more transparency on pathways to long-term residency and citizenship. 
 Sciculuna said that the experience underscored the importance of honouring human dignity in all spheres of life.
 “We need to listen to one another and we need to be able to give hope to each and every one of us,” he said.

Malta Chamber slams decision to pardon benefit fraudsters,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/malta-chamber-slams-decision-pardon-benefit-fraudsters.1091636,21-06-2024,002936.png,"The presidential pardon granted to social benefit fraudsters further reinforces a culture of impunity and has also undermined Malta’s new president, the Malta Chamber said on Saturday.
 “Government needs to be on the side of what is right and send clear signals that it will not come to the rescue of abusers or restrain those who want to set things straight,” the Chamber said.
 “This is what good governance is about. Anything short of this will come across as pandering to the masses and playing for time, which is running out.”
 The Chamber’s statement comes two days after Times of Malta revealed that hundreds of people who have admitted to claiming severe disability benefits they were not entitled to will receive a presidential pardon.
 The decision prompted outrage among some quarters, with some criticising President Myriam Spiteri Debono for it. In reality, despite its name, a presidential pardon is recommended by the prime minister, with the president formally signing it.  
 Speaking on Friday, the prime minister defended the decision to issue the pardons by saying many of the fraudsters did not know they were breaking the law and had gone through “trauma” when they found out.
  The fraud is believed to have lasted years and cost taxpayers upwards of €5 million. Beneficiaries have told police that they were helped to register for the benefits by Labour Party officials, including former MP Silvio Grixti and ministerial driver Roger Agius.
 Agius’ lawyer has claimed in court that a top official at Michael Falzon’s social policy ministry, Mark Calleja, played a key role in the fraud.
 Falzon has insisted he knew nothing about the scheme but stopped short of defending Calleja.
 In its statement on Saturday, the Chamber expressed incredulity that the scheme could operate for years “without anyone batting an eyelid”.
 That, it said, “indicates that there is no accountability, as well as  no internal auditing systems to detect and deter abuse, and that people are either actively involved in fraudulent activities and profiting from them, or they have grown accustomed to seeing them occur.
 “Like the three monkeys, they see no evil, hear no evil, and say nothing about it,” the Chamber said.  
 The integrity of everyone involved in the payments – including Falzon’s ministry – has been put into “considerable question”, it said.
 The Chamber fears many of the fraudsters given a presidential pardon are now being lined up for jobs in the public sector.
 Bearing in mind that the public service is the largest employer, one hopes that this urgency to cleanse the conduct of people who abused from social benefits is not intended to facilitate a quick transition from dependency on benefits to recruitment with the public service, whether directly or through agencies,” it said.
 
 It also expressed concern about the growing habit of turning top jobs at government authorities and agencies into a game of musical chairs, with occupants moving from one entity to the other after a few months.
 “The practice of leveraging resignations to give the impression that action is being done, discourages capable people from taking on these crucial roles and executing the significant reforms required to shift course,” it said, noting that people who only occupy these key roles for a few months do not have enough time to take charge and identify systematic abusive practices.

Popular Tunisian influencer dies in Malta,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/popular-tunisian-influencer-dies-malta.1094074,17-06-2024,003126.png,"Updated 6pm
 A well-known Tunisian social media influencer died in Malta on Monday morning of a suspected heart attack.
 Sources told Times of Malta that Farah El Kadhi died at Mater Dei Hospital. 
 Details are still scant but sources said the 36-year-old architect was rushed to hospital suffering from a cardiac arrest at around 6.30am. 
  She was in Malta on holiday, while also promoting a series of companies and services through Instagram posts.  
 Her profile featured posts of her in St Julian's and aboard a boat docked at the Vittoriosa marina, among others. 
 Farah had no signs of any visible injuries though sources said an autopsy will be carried out and a magisterial inquiry has been opened to establish the exact cause of death.
 Tunisian influencer Soulayma Hneynia, who resides in Malta and took part in the first season of Love Island Malta described Farah as a ""truly wonderful person, known for her kindness, generosity, and warmth.""
 ""Her positive spirit touched everyone who had the privilege of knowing her.""
 In another story, she said El Kadhi died 'peacefully in her sleep' following a heart attack.
 
 According to El Kadhi's Instagram, she was an architect with Key Concept company.
 Known as one of Tunisia's most popular social media influencers, Farah had more than one million followers on Instagram. She used her following to promote her fashion brand bazarbyfaf and various other brands that paid to feature on her profile.

Ambulance in Valletta kept waiting as tables and chairs obstruct path,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/ambulance-valletta-kept-waiting-tables-chairs-obstruct-path.1097094,22-08-2024,003224.png,"Another ambulance was delayed in attending to a patient by tables and chairs obstructing its route in Valletta, witnesses said on Thursday. 
 The incident occurred at around 1.15pm in St Lucia Street, just past the law courts and parallel to St John's Co-Cathedral in Valletta, where several wine bars and eateries are known to have outdoor furniture installed. 
 A picture snapped by a passer-by shows the ambulance waiting to squeeze past the tables, chairs and umbrellas that littered the street, as staff tried to usher their patrons and allow the vehicle to pass unobstructed. 
 The issue was flagged by PN deputy whip Paula Mifsud Bonnici. 
 ""Despite all of this government's promises, the security and safety of people, especially Valletta residents, are not a priority,"" she said. 
 One woman who was in the area at the time told Times of Malta that the ambulance was on its way to a patient and that she felt compelled to help clear the street furniture away.
 ""Unfortunately, in case of an emergency, an ambulance or fire engine is absolutely impossible to pass through,"" she said. 
 ""I was helping myself to move the tables, chairs, umbrellas and large coffee cups out of the way. Then once the ambulance managed to pass through St Lucia and collected the patient I guided the driver to pass back from the same street."" 
 This is at least the second time this year that an emergency vehicle has been documented encountering difficulty while navigating through Valletta's table and chair-congested streets. 
 Back in March, local residents group Residenti Beltin published footage of an ambulance struggling to squeeze through a throng of outdoor catering furniture in Republic Street, reigniting a heated ongoing debate about the take up of public spaces by businesses. 
 Last year, the University of Malta, which has a second campus in Valletta, was pushed to file a judicial protest against the local council, as it said the situation of tables and chairs outside its own front door had descended into ""chaos"". 
 In 2023, Valletta's traditional Holy Week activities were marred as faithful participants had to wade through tables and chairs and contend with loud music being played during the solemn Good Friday procession. 
 Residents took to the streets to protest the saturation of tables and chairs in their locality, while in Mellieħa, demonstrators  occupied the furniture put out by a db group-run establishment in the village square, despite having no permit to do so at the time. 
 In Victoria, Gozo, a similar situation unravelled earlier this year in St George's Square, where NGOs gathered to protest the takeover of the square's limited space by cafes and restaurants. 
 This came after the Archpriest of St Geroge's Basilica went public with his grievances with the square's ""landgrabbers"" whom he said refused to compromise while rubbishing authorities' claims that they had no remit to intervene.

Teatru Malta announces auditions for new troupe,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/teatru-malta-announces-malta-first-fulltime-theatre-troupe.1093024,27-05-2024,003041.png,"Teatru Malta, the national theatre company has issued a call for auditions for four performers to join its theatre troupe. They will be able to work a 40-hour week.
 The troupe is designed to blend performance with behind-the-scenes roles to create a team that can perform on-stage as well as operational tasks, but its primary role will be creative.
 Teatru Malta artistic director Sean Buhagiar said: “The idea came from observing the versatility and adaptability of local artists who also perform and manage various logistical tasks or have other jobs in the creative or non-creative sphere, which they still enjoy and help them to make a living.”
 Teatru Malta was inspired by the concept of the circus to structure the troupe’s roles and tasks. The performers would be on stage but also help with other tasks behind the stage. Buhagiar said the troupe could expect to perform roles such as acting, directing, dramaturgy, content creation, project management, dancing, writing, translating, proofreading, web management, social media management, or videography.
  “We want the opportunity to be flexible to produce an avant-garde classical piece with only some members of this ensemble, to produce a festival, translate scripts, create shows for or with the communities and more,” said Buhagiar.
 The performers must have significant experience in theatrical quality-led performances and possess all-round performance skills, including acting, dancing and singing. They must be 18 years or older, and proficient in Maltese and English.
 The system of full-time ensemble actors is routine practice throughout theatres in Europe. In fact, ŻfinMalta has had a full-time dancer company since its formation. Theatre practitioners who spoke to Times of Malta praised  Teatru Malta’s efforts for the initiative, with many saying it was about time.
 The initial contract will be for 12 months, starting in September but, beforehand, there will be an initial research and development phase throughout the summer. Buhagiar also said the potential exists for a medium- to long-term relationship after that. Those engaged will have a 40-hour flexible working week and remote working. The annual salary is €25,000 excluding VAT.
 The application closing date is June 17.

Historic Birkirkara mill turns 300,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/historic-birkirkara-mill-turns-300.1094077,22-06-2024,"003044.png,003045.png","The historic building in Birkirkara known as Il-Mitħna tal-Maħlut, now the Mill – Art, Culture and Crafts Centre, is celebrating its 300th anniversary since it was built in 1724.
 Built under Grandmaster Manoel de Vilhena, the windmill was used to produce flour to help feed the growing population at the time. The grandmaster had set up Fondazione Vilhena, through which five windmills were built in Birkirkara, Żejtun, Żurrieq, Naxxar and Rabat.
  By 1929, the Birkirkara mill was no longer needed and, by time, it became a residential space and even a shelter used by many people in World War II. It remained a residential space until a blacksmith took it over in the 1970s.
 Throughout the 1980s, the Works Department sought to renovate the structure. Coincidentally, at the same time, one of the fathers of modern Maltese art, Gabriel Caruana, began looking for a space to convert into an art and culture centre. By 1990, together with his wife, Mary Rose Caruana, he took over the building and opened the arts and culture centre that is still running today.
 So, this is not only the 300th anniversary of the building but also the 34th anniversary since the Caruanas opened the cultural centre.
 Caruana’s daughter, Raffaella Zammit, who is also the Gabriel Caruana Foundation’s executive director, said: “It was always my father’s dream to create an arts and community space. He always wanted a space for people to create together.
 “My earliest memory, in fact, was him at the mill inviting people to paint together. And we hope to maintain that communal spirit.”
 Zammit said that part of the reason the building and art space has survived for so long is because it has always held an important role in the community.
  Even today, besides running an artistic programme, which helps foster a community of creatives, the Gabriel Caruana Foundation also organises initiatives for other communities to engage with the space. These range from Ktieb tal-Istaġun, a project created for kindergartners to learn more about the weather, to  Layers of Being, a project created to help fight loneliness in the elderly community.
 “We want to take this opportunity to celebrate all our different communities and projects,” Zammit said.
 The foundation will celebrate this milestone on June 21 and 22 with the event Mawra sal-Mitħna, featuring a series of activities for people of all ages.
 The programme includes collaboration between no.site.studio and the Gabriel Caruana Foundation to reimagine the public space around The Mill and a walking workshop around Birkirkara and Balzan where the public is invited to explore concepts of care in public space, which is part of an artistic project by Zammit.
 When asked where she hopes to see the mill in 300 years, she said: “Well, firstly, I hope it’s still standing [laughing]. I hope it remains a sustainable building that continues to be a space for creatives, artists and the community of that time.”

Police investigate ‘no Pakis’ rental advert,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/police-investigating-no-pakis-rental-advert.1096864,20-08-2024,003052.png,"The police have said they are investigating a rental property advert that warned against applications from “Pakis, Indians, Arabs and Philippines”.
 The advert hit the headlines earlier this month when the company responsible, Alliance Real Estate, blamed the incident on human error, adding it was obligated to follow landlord “restrictions” on tenants. 
 But prominent human rights lawyer, Neil Falzon, said restricting housing based on skin colour or nationality was illegal, calling Maltese law “crystal clear” on the matter.
 A police spokesperson confirmed an investigation into the incident was “underway” but did not provide further details.
 
 Meanwhile, sources said the investigation was looking into the incident itself – as well as the company responsible.
 A listing for a three-bedroom apartment in Żebbuġ appeared on the Alliance Real Estate website earlier this month before later appearing on property aggregate website propertymarket.com.mt.
 Alongside a note explaining the property could be turned into a five-bedroom terraced house, the description also read: “no Pakis, Indians, Arabs and Philippines” (sic).
 The term ‘Paki’ is a derogatory term for a person from Pakistan that has also been used to contemptuously describe people of other South Asian nationalities.
  Alliance Real Estate said the words appeared online after an “internal comment” was published by mistake instead of the intended property description.
 The listing has since been removed from propertymarket. com.mt – which distanced itself from the advert when contacted by Times of Malta – and edited on the Alliance website to remove the reference.
 Alliance CEO Michael Bonello subsequently penned a Times of Malta opinion piece acknowledged the ""unfortunate incident"" and  calling for reforms to address ""legitimate concerns"" landlords had.
 
 Commenting on the case, Falzon said “anyone refusing to offer a service to a person simply on the basis of their skin colour, nationality or origin is breaking the law... the law requires you to treat people with decency and respect”.
 But according to the Malta Malayalee Association, which represents members of the Indian community, such discrimination is commonplace.
 A spokesperson for the organisation said South Asians were “more often than not” turned down for properties because of their nationality.
 “Apartment owners often reject Indians from renting their apartment just because of where we are from,” he said, adding the community had not been surprised by the incident.
 Real estate agents told Times of Malta they normally tell prospective tenants a property isn’t available if faced with restrictive landlords.

Real estate CEO calls for tenant screening following ‘no Pakis’ listing,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/real-estate-ceo-calls-tenant-screening-following-no-pakis-listing.1096510,08-09-2024,003097.png,"Landlords should be able to screen potential tenants before signing a lease agreement to avoid rental discrimination, Michael Bonello, CEO of Alliance Real Estate says in an opinion article in today’s Times of Malta.  
 The article comes shortly after Alliance advertised a property with the warning “no Pakis, Indians, Arabs, and Filipinos” after accidentally publishing an “internal comment” instead of the property description. 
 The term ‘Paki’ is a derogatory term for a person from Pakistan and has also been used to contemptuously describe persons of other South Asian nationalities. 
 Bonello says the “discriminatory language was mistakenly published” and was a one-off incident made by a “junior employee”. However, the incident highlights issues within the rental market, he points out. 
 Online platforms where landlords and tenants can review each other is another proposal Bonello makes. 
 In his article Bonello calls for the introduction of a set of standards to be upheld by tenants, adding that greater protection should be given to landlords. 
 Stronger protections for landlords would allow them to rent their property with peace of mind while adhering to anti-discrimination laws, he says. 
 “Implementing a new national framework on lease agreements with clear terms regarding tenant behaviour, maintenance responsibilities, and eviction procedures can minimise disputes – protecting both landlords and tenants alike,” Bonello says. 
 He also says landlords should have access to rental history reviews and credit checks, pointing out at such systems exist abroad. 
 Similarly, tenants should be able to access databases where landlords are reviewed. 
 Bonello also calls for allowing higher security rental deposits for “higher-risk tenants” to provide financial protection against potential damages and unpaid rent. 
 Property owners often trust tenants with their life savings, so it is not uncommon for landlords to have concerns about the type of tenants that will rent out their property, he says. 
 “Will they respect the building and its other residents? Will they honour their contract and payments? Or will they trash the property, leaving me with a hefty cleaning bill, or worse?” he asks. 
 “Although people may come from different cultures, everyone must abide by local laws and cultural norms.” 
 Bonello says this is not a racial issue; it is a business matter and requires adequate policies to address it. 
 “Landlords are not racists. They simply want to protect and maximise their investment, just as any other investor would with any other asset,” he says.

 Now, at 36, Roberta Huber has joined St Margaret’s Monastery in Cospicua as a postulant nun. And beaming from ear to ear, the bubbly former IT programmer is the happiest and most fulfilled she has ever been.
  “When I was younger, I used to observe nuns and think theirs was a terrible choice. I was repelled by the idea,” Huber says from behind a grille.
 But today, her excitement to embark on this “adventure” is palpable. Even though she is moving from a web-designer world to restricted internet access and will never tick off her bucket list a trip to the US, or see the sea again, Huber feels “really free”.
 She may be speaking from behind bars – the Teresian community of eight nuns leads a traditional cloistered life – but she does not feel imprisoned as, she acknowledges, others may believe, having shed the shackles of material needs and ego.
  Huber understands people could find all this incomprehensible; and think she is ‘wasting her life’ when she could be putting her skills to a worthier cause, rather than confining herself; and possibly escaping her problems.
 Her life choice may seem “odd” given the “many opportunities and distractions out there, so much media to consume, so much more to detach from nowadays, easy travel…
 “But my vocation was not something I conjured up myself… It was a ray of light.”
 ‘I was actually praying for a boyfriend’
 From a young age, Huber stopped going to Mass and receiving the sacraments. Then, in her 20s, because she felt so “uncomfortable” in life, she decided to “give God a try”.
 Always uneasy, she felt awkward about everything, she admits. “I felt something was not right.”
 In hindsight, she already knew God existed. “I felt I was talking to someone and not an imaginary friend when I asked him to give me a sign.” That sign came, and Huber “fell in love” with God, describing it as “amazing”. She started attending prayer groups and took it seriously.
 But while she was getting closer to what she wanted, she still could not find a community she really belonged to.
 “In that moment, as I was praying before the Blessed Sacrament, I understood that God was calling me for a religious life. How did that happen? I just understood it.”
 Huber was happy and excited, but she was also shocked. “I did not like the idea at all. I thought it was terrible”, she admits.
  Huber had a boyfriend at the time, and she resisted the calling. Eventually, they broke up and she started praying for another. “I was actually praying for a boyfriend, but it seemed it was not God’s will, so I got upset and abandoned everything again.”
 Things just went from bad to worse after that: “I knew it was something I would keep feeling. The thought did not go away. “This was an invitation. It is my path to my final destination. Anything outside that would make my life doubly hard and, in fact, it was doubly hard. Things that seemed so easy for others were much harder for me.
 “I knew it was the right thing to do, but I was not happy with the idea at all.”
 Burying the thought, Huber worked with an investment management company… until again, she started to seek something she could not put her finger on. “At 30, something was still missing. What it was, I had absolutely no idea.” So, Huber decided to move to Poland for a couple of months to figure out what to do with her life.
 The next step was a boot camp computer programming course “because I like problem solving” – and she really enjoyed it. She found a job as a web developer with a video game company in the Czech Republic for over two years. But although she had just started a career in programming and loved the job, she still felt incomplete, and the anxiety persisted. “Four years older, life was still the same, so I decided to surrender myself to God.”
 It was a short process. Huber stopped going out and meeting people. She was working from home and her life was about prayer. “This was it! I had prayed for a couple of months about it, and I felt it was the right and most obvious thing to do.”
 Confident about her decision, Huber resigned her job. But still resisting the cloister idea, she got in touch with the Dominican Sisters, with a plan to “start lightly”. She was invited to the UK for three months and the idea kept maturing to the point that she felt a need for more silence, more prayer and more time with God.
 Huber got in touch with St Margaret’s community almost a year ago, spending the first three months visiting every weekend until she entered officially as a postulant in February. It will take her eight years for her solemn profession, with the first five being temporary vows, and the rest, her novitiate.
 From now on, she will only go outdoors for health reasons and anyone visiting will do so from behind iron bars, she says matter-of-factly.
 One of four siblings, everyone has supported her, and her parents were “very happy” about her decision.
  Huber is the youngest of her new family. Madre Paulina Xuereb is 58 and the next nun is in her 70s. The oldest is 96; one is in a wheelchair and another blind. But Huber does not feel the age gap, she says as she points out that one sister has watched the grand total of three films in her life. The young nun feels her own presence among the community has brought hope and joy. “They can pass on the life.”
 St Margaret’s Monastery went from 21 nuns down to nine in the last 50 years, and vocations are on a sharp decline in Malta’s five cloistered communities.
  Huber, however, never really gave much thought to the fact that she is the only woman to choose this path. “I suppose it is exciting for me. It feels like God is up to something; that he is leading us into a new season; some new age.” Neither does she have any specific project to entice others through her own enlightening experience.
 “We are open to guiding, helping and putting in a good word. We do not shut the doors as opportunities arise. But our vocation is about prayer, and we must preserve time for that.
 “The cloistered life is also important because the less distractions and the more silence, the more open you are to God.
 “I am not keeping my schedule busy with appointments. We are here for that interior solitude, alone with God and no other thoughts.”
 But if she had to send a message to the girl she was in her 20s, engulfed in turmoil and holding back, what would she say?
 “Trust God. Take the leap. It is exciting,” Huber says about a life of intense prayer, and about loving God. “If you do his will, even in the smallest of ways, you will be a channel of grace for the rest of the world,” she says about her role. “This is an adventure – experiencing heavenly joy. You are spending your time with the source of life. Can you be doing anything greater than that?”
 Finding freedom
 Huber will miss the sea but prays for those enjoying their summer and the views she will never set eyes on.
 In the outside world, the young woman was obsessed with make-up and loved perfume. But giving up brands – and her favourite fragrance, Viva Voce by Valentino, starring Lady Gaga – has been so liberating.
 “I did not find it that easy to shed them. But while I was discerning a vocation, this was the first thing the spirit led me to do. I started wearing different clothes and I stopped using perfume. That is the spirit of God working.”
 Huber also stopped looking in the mirror as much, and realises it was in preparation for her time in the convent.
 “There aren’t many mirrors here; just one in the elevator and I have my own small one,” she giggles, admitting she did check it before the interview “to see if I had any aerials sticking out of my head”.
 On the topic of chastity, Huber says this is a grace. It could sound like nonsense to others, she admits. But Christ says: ‘Let anyone accept this who can.’
 “We are called to be intimate with God,” she continues, adding it is hard to explain, and that the physical aspect just does not enter the picture.
 “I had a boyfriend at the time and recall saying to myself that I seemed to love this guy like a mother and that I really wanted to love everybody else like that too. I did not feel like I want to be fully committed to one person.
 “Later, it occurred to me that I wanted to be a spiritual mother really. These things are buried in the soul and find ways to manifest themselves.”
 For Huber, the biggest sacrifice of cloistered life is living in a community, which means having to sacrifice your ego.
  “It is all about purging yourself of your ego and filling up that space with God… I lived a very independent life, doing things my way; what I wanted, how I wanted,” she says. “Now, I’m in the process of learning to surrender my ego and sacrifice my will. When you are free from your ego, that is true freedom. I feel really free.”
 People question whether being a cloistered nun is a form of escape from the big, bad, outside world. But Huber insists that “unless it is your vocation, you would not survive it in here”.
 She was psychologically screened before entering. “They check for this kind of thing,” she points out. “You have to be here for the right reasons; otherwise, you will make everyone miserable. It has to be genuine. It is really about picking up your Cross every day.”
 About facing the outside world, Huber believes people need to discover God, insisting they need him, whether they resist it or not. “In so doing, you will start to find him more interesting than anything else, including the self.”
 Huber has a different perspective on life: “It is not about this one, but about eternity.” For others, again, this may be nonsense, but for her, being in communication with God is “so real – even more real than anything out there, which will just fade away”.

Marsaxlokk public toilet draws a royal flush of politicians,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/marsaxlokk-public-toilet-inauguration-draws-royal-flush-politicians.1098444,23-09-2024,003410.png,"Updated 1.50pm
 A minister, junior minister and Opposition MP were all on hand to inaugurate a new public toilet block in Marsaxlokk on Sunday.
 Owen Bonnici, Alison Zerafa Civelli and Janice Chetcuti were among a nine-person group of dignitaries who smiled for the camera as they posed for photos inside and outside the seaside restroom facility.
  Marsaxlokk’s local council spared no expense in unveiling the latrine, with a promotional video clip featuring drone footage taking viewers on a tour of the block.
 The block features a nappy changing stand, a toilet stall for users with a disability and two showers with squat toilet fixtures, the video clip shows.
  Photos published on the local council’s Facebook page showed that councillors and mayor Stephen Grech also joined the minister, junior minister and MP for the inauguration.
 The toilet block's inauguration was timed to coincide with Jum Marsaxlokk, a council-organised event that celebrated the southern fishing village. 
 Owen Bonnici is Malta’s culture minister. Alison Zerafa Civelli is the parliamentary secretary for local councils, working within Bonnici’s ministry. Chetcuti is the Opposition’s spokesperson for animal welfare and consumer affairs.
 Bonnici said he was in Marsaxlokk to tour the town and attend events organised by the parish and local council during Jum Marsaxlokk and was shown the new toilet block during the visit. The latrine was funded through money provided by the local councils directorate, he noted.
 The inauguration recalls a similar event back in 2016, when then-Gozo Minister Anton Refalo was the guest of honour as a public toilet was inaugurated at Ħondoq ir-Rummien. On that occasion, the government had taken things one step further by issuing a press release about the inauguration through the Department of Information.
 Marsaxlokk's public toilets have proven to be remarkably newsworthy in recent years. In 2016 CCTV cameras in a public toilet block's common area. 
 The issue resurfaced last year, when photos of the cameras prompted outrage on social media. Mayor Stephen Grech subsequently reassured people that the cameras were switched off and effectively served as decoys to deter would-be vandals.

Sick Syrian children put in detention after being denied entry,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/sick-syrian-children-put-detention-denied-entry.1102509,16-12-2024,003531.png,"Children as young as three were detained for days at the Safi detention centre while awaiting deportation after being refused entry into Malta along with a Syrian woman.
 The children and the woman, who hold humanitarian protection in Greece, flew to Malta but were denied entry.
 In such cases, passengers are usually returned immediately on the flight they arrived on, human rights lawyer Neil Falzon explained.
 However, several of the children had chickenpox and could not return immediately due to health concerns. Instead, they were placed in the women’s detention centre in Safi, he said.
 Times of Malta independently confirmed the claim and reported that they were returned to Greece on Wednesday.
 “Instead of providing the woman and children with the necessary support, care and attention in an appropriate accommodation setting, the government decided to lock them up,” said Falzon, director of human rights NGO Aditus Foundation.
 “Furthermore, Malta chose to detain them in a detention centre that has been repeatedly condemned as exposing children and vulnerable persons to inhuman and degrading treatment,” Falzon said.
 Children should at least be kept in an open centre, he said, adding that if a child is sick, they should be cared for in an appropriate environment.
 “The detention centre is definitely not appropriate,” he said.
  Government sources said the sick children were cared for and given treatment while in detention.
 Falzon asked whether the health of those detained at the centre was considered.
 “If health concerns prevented their placement on a flight, what about the health concerns of exposing others at the Safi detention centre to chickenpox?” he asked.
 Falzon said that a woman travelling alone with a group of children, some of whom were sick, should have raised the alarm about issues such as trafficking and abuse.
 He alleged that the government did not ensure the safety of the woman and children was safeguarded.
 “Malta denied them access to any form of independent information or support. From information available to us, it looks like their apprehension was immediately and automatically followed by their detention at Safi Barracks,” he said.
 Falzon called for more transparency in Malta’s migration system.
 “Malta’s policy deprives detained people of access to lawyers and other forms of support,” he said.
 In this case, for example, Aditus only learned of the woman and children’s detention by “sheer chance”.
 “As it stands, the system places vulnerable people in an invisible zone, cutting them off from assistance,” he said.

 The purchase was announced by the culture ministry in a statement on Wednesday. 
 It is the tenth band club property to be bought by the government, which plans to invest €19 million in similar premises across the country.
 The clubs all faced eviction from their premises, which they occupied at artificially low rental prices thanks to rent laws dating back 30 years. 
 But following court judgements which ruled that those laws went against owners' right to enjoy their property, such clubs faced eviction. 
 The other properties the government has bought are: Marsa's Marija Regina, Attard's Stella Levantina, Kalkara's San Giuseppe Filarmonika Sagra Familja, Birkirkara's Duke of Connaught's Own, Paola's Antoine de Paule, Sliema's Stella Maris, Birżebbuġa's San Pietru fil-Ktajjen, Qormi's Anici and Mosta's Soċjetà Filarmonika Santa Marija.
 Agreement has been reached on a further two properties but the final contract has not been signed.
 Culture Minister Owen Bonnici said that band clubs play a crucial role in fostering cultural development and that it is often the people in these clubs who promote art and education in their communities. 
 ""These organisations depend a lot on the spaces they occupy to carry out their work effectively in the heart of the communities and therefore an eviction would not only seriously endanger their operation but also threaten their existence,"" he said.
 He said it was ""esssential"" that the government take measures to protect and safeguard the clubs.

 Born in 1933 in Żejtun, Seychell was ordained a priest at the age of 23.
 In addition to Fondazzjoni Nazareth, he also co-founded Caritas and was instrumental in establishing the house for retired and elderly clergy in Birkirkara.
 In 2016 he also famously opposed an agritourism development that was set to engulf the Munxar cliffs in Marsascala. Twenty years earlier he had also fronted the building of a hotel in the same area.
 Affectionately known as Dun Anġ, his lifelong mission statement was to remove vulnerable persons from institutionalised care and place them in homes offering them an alternative family structure.
 Fondazzjoni Nazareth’s mission was inspired by this objective. It provides alternative family to persons with physical or mental disabilities who have no family or are unable to live with their natural family..
 In early September 1995, Dun Anġ Seychell opened a first residence to cater for four people with physical or mental disability.
 A second home, named after Fr Lawrence Degabriele, was opened in 2002; a third, the Jean Vanier home, was opened in 2009.
 Dar San Ġużepp Ħaddiem was closed down in 2023 because the foundation could not keep up with the rental costs.
 Throughout his life, Dun Anġ was also a regular contributor on newspapers and religious and social broadcasts on TV and radio.
 As his death was announced on the Facebook page of the NGO he set up, tributes poured in to honour his memory.

Homeless child to undergo life-changing spinal surgery in the UK,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/homeless-child-undergo-lifechanging-spinal-surgery-uk.1098557,26-09-2024,"003856.png,003857.png","Four-year-old Nina* is homeless. She loves playing with the bare doll house at the YMCA shelter where she lives – but whenever she needs to reach the upper level of the wooden toy house she has to ask for help – because she cannot stand up.
 Nina has cerebral palsy – a condition that affects movement and coordination. It is caused by damage to the developing brain, most often before birth.
 She needs to undergo spinal surgery in the UK in November to address her muscle stiffness. This will be followed by therapy, and she will then need a wheelchair and standing frame to be able to support her as she learns how to walk.
 But the wheelchair and standing frame will cost about €10,000 – and her mother, Anna*, does not have the money.
 YMCA Malta – an NGO that supports the poor and homeless – has now stepped in to help Anna and Nina raise funds for the equipment.
 Anna timidly shares parts of her story and asks not to be named because Nina is about to start school.
 “I have nothing to hide but I don’t want people recognising her at school and knowing so much about her life,” her mother says.
  Some parts of their story are too painful to talk about. Anna looks into the eyes of her social support mentor – Marie-Claire Dimech – for encouragement as she explains that her husband left her and her daughter, and they ended up without a home after facing financial problems.
 She has other relatives but they have their own problems and cannot take them in. So, two months ago, she moved into one of the YMCA shelters with her daughter.
 Nicola Falzon, community services manager, explains that the shelter staff are helping Anna slowly pick up the pieces.
 “It’s easy to say that she should go work. But, at the moment, Anna cannot work since her time is dedicated to Nina 24/7. She carries her around everywhere she goes as the child cannot walk due to her condition,” Nicola says.
  Anna nods and adds: “But now she is starting to question. Now she wants to walk.”
 Staff at YMCA are supporting Anna to applying for school and Nina is set to start soon – freeing some time for Anna to be able to work.
 But, right now, the priority is the operation and making sure Nina has the wheelchair, that costs €6,000, and standing frame, which costs €3,200.
 Whoever may help Anna and Nina may donate through the YMCA official channels and write ‘Support for Nina’. https://ymcamalta.org/donate/.
 Aġenzija Sapport, a government agency said on Thursday afternoon that it was stepping in to fund Nina's needs.
 Fundraising by the YMCA for this and similar causes will continue, however. 
 The Malta Community Chest Fund will also be assisting with the equipment and expenses the mother will incur when travelling abroad for medical treatment with her daughter.

 His initial goal was to raise €500 and run 100km but, in the end, he completed a 1,000km run challenge and raised €10,000 for Puttinu Cares.
 He had told Times of Malta: “I know that I would never have started running if it weren’t for her, so, every time I’m successful with my running, I know I owe it to Rebecca.”
 Rebecca, known to many as Becs, was only 15 years old when she passed away on January 3, 2021, after months of battling cancer.
 She suffered from Ewing’s Sarcoma, a rare and extremely aggressive form of bone cancer.

"St Paul's Church façade restoration project halted by Valletta mayor, PN claims",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/st-paul-church-facade-restoration-project-halted-valletta-mayor.1098147,16-09-2024,003873.png,"The Valletta mayor “illegally” annulled a contract for the restoration of the façade of the locality’s St Paul’s Shipwreck Parish Church, PN councillors have claimed.
 In a statement on Monday morning, the PN slammed Olaf McKay, the locality’s new mayor, for his “unacceptable” behaviour during a local council meeting earlier this month, when he unilaterally decided to annul a contract previously approved by all members of the local council.
 The statement, signed by PN Valletta councillors Ylenia Montfort, Roberta Bonello Felice and Vince Fabri, referred to a contract which was approved and granted for restoration works on the church’s facade during a meeting held last month.
 The Church of St Paul's Shipwreck is one of Valletta's oldest churches, dating back to the 1570s. Last year, the former Valletta mayor, Alfred Zammit, announced the restoration project for the church's façade and works were to include a new lighting system.
 According to the statement, the contract was approved unanimously by the Local Council which was then “duty-bound” to proceed by informing all tenderers of the Council’s decision and opening the appeal period.
 “It seems that without the knowledge of some Local Council members, this process was not triggered, and the small contract was brought back for discussion at the next meeting, held on 3 September,” the statement read. 
 Before that meeting, councillors had requested an urgent meeting, but the request was ignored by McKay, they said.
 According to the PN councillors, the local council’s lawyer was also present at the September 3 meeting. The statement said the majority of the local council had disagreed with the lawyer’s advice, and the Nationalist Party had asked for several clarifications which remained unanswered. 
 “At this stage, the mayor declared that he alone had the right to annul the contract on the basis that he is the mayor,” the statement read. 
 “Amid many disputes between the councillors, the mayor stated that he would cancel the contract because he had the authority to do so as mayor. He also made allegations against one of the PN councillors, which he did not substantiate.”
 The mayor went on to declare the contract would be annulled, despite the majority of the councillors disagreeing with his decision, the statement read.
 “The cancellation of this contract was entirely in breach of the law, as decisions within the Council must be made by the majority of councillors, not by one person,” it said.
 “Furthermore, the Local Council administration should only act on the decisions made by the majority of councillors.”
 In a Facebook post, St Paul’s Parish Archpriest, David Cilia and the Collegiate Chapter, said they had been informed through third parties that the local council had dropped the tender for the restoration of the church’s facade. 
 The statement was published days after the local council meeting.
 The Archpriest slammed McKay’s decision which, without any discussions with the Chapter, had once again halted the tender for the project, he said, adding it was the second time the tender had been stopped.
 “The Chapter expresses its displeasure that the local council is discriminating against parishioners of the St Paul’s Shipwreck parish with a persistence the likes of which we have never seen.”
 The statement concluded it would be in contact with government authorities to ensure the abusive council does not have ""the last word"".
 The PN councillors said further action will take place in the coming days in response to the mayor’s “illegal” actions.
 Contacted by Times of Malta, McKay said he had evidence that showed the council had been left with ""no option but to cancel the tender, which was not yet awarded to any bidder.""
 He said the evidence would be submitted to the public contracts review board which had been asked to look into the matter, but that he was unable to comment further while the case was under review.

 What evidence survives indicates that on particularly joyous celebrations, skilled artificers were imported from Italy. 
  More particularly from Sicily – some Maltese terms are giveaways of their Sicilian, rather than Italian, origins, like maskli from Sicilian  masculi,  giggifogu, Sicilian  jocu di focu,  trikkitrakki, Sicilian  tricchi tracchi,  porvli,  fjakkli,  murtali,  musketterija,  razzi,  suffarelli,  girandla,  serpentelli,  stoppìn,  kruċetti.
  Not to mention the tour de force of all fireworks displays – the kaxxa nfernali, which shares nothing with Satan and the underworld but just reflects an illiterate misreading of  cassa finale.
 Any joyful occasion provided a good excuse – mostly religious festas and important civilian celebrations, like visits by royalty, military victories, political milestones.
 In Malta, new money is now sneaking fireworks into baptisms, weddings and graduations.
 Still one step behind Palermo, where well-wishers celebrate the release of long-time murderers from prison by letting off murtali, little realising how aptly the word describes their victims.
  Postcard publishers and photographers have long realised the spectacular potential of fireworks, even before colour made that more obvious still.
 The German Geo Fürst, monarch of image-making in Malta in the interwar years, had a heyday during the 1935 George V jubilee celebrations, for which the authorities voted £600 to be spent on fireworks. Richard Ellis would not be outdone.
 He too had earlier recorded some amazing images.
  Fireworks continue to divide the people – some hate the shattering noise, the pollution, the inconveniences, the dangers ever lurking in the kmamar tan-nar and the unexploded petards which maim the unwary.
 Others find that a fair price to pay to keep alive an old and frankly astonishing tradition.
 The military authorities banned fireworks during World War II.

 Għal Għawdex said the megalithic site in Xagħra had “significant historical and archaeological importance,” home to prehistoric temples it said were “essential” to the country’s heritage.
 The coalition said that while an SCH investigation in 2012 had concluded there were no findings of enough importance to exclude it from a building zone created in the area some six years earlier, recent findings suggested otherwise.
 Last year, residents reported finding bones and shards of pottery in exposed soil as excavation work got underway at a construction site close to Santa Verna.
  “Upon further investigation by SCH, these bones were confirmed to be prehistoric remains, likely within a secondary burial context,” Għal Għawdex said in a statement on Sunday.
 “This discovery underscores the importance of continuous and effective monitoring in this archaeologically sensitive area.”
 The group of NGOs said that in light of ongoing works in the area, particularly new road Triq George McAdam, it was “seeking greater transparency” from the superintendence.
 “Specifically, we request that SCH provide clear information on the interventions currently being undertaken, any discoveries that have been made, and the future plans for developments in this area.”
 The NGOs called for “transparency and accountability in how archaeological investigations and monitoring are conducted,” stressing it was the public’s right to be informed about such developments.
 In 2022, the Planning Authority (PA) halted building works in Xagħra after “potential cultural features” were discovered at a development site just 50 metres away from Santa Verna.
 In that case, investigations into the discovery of a cave at the site were initially hampered when it transpired the cave was on private property. Two years earlier, the SCH had raised concerns about the development, pointing out the area was “archaeologically sensitive”.
 This is not the first time development works in sensitive areas have hit the headlines, in some cases internationally; in November, London-based newspaper The Times  reported local reactions to the PA’s decision to allow a 22-apartment block of flats to be built less than 200 metres away from the Ġgantija temples as one of “horror”.
 The news outlet noted that at 5,600 years old, the temples are the world's oldest remains of a free-standing building and the world's second oldest religious building.
 Six architects were subsequently investigated by the Chamber of Architects (KTP) for their work on projects in the area surrounding the Ġgantija temples.

Fact-check: Can a property owner rent their property to whoever they want?,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/factcheck-can-property-owner-rent-property-want.1096500,08-09-2024,"003876.png,003877.png,003878.png,003879.png,003880.png,003881.png","Claim: A property owner can rent their property to whoever they want.
 Verdict: A property owner cannot legally preclude certain people from renting their property based on their race or ethnicity. But they have a little more flexibility when barring children and pets.
 An advert for a Żebbuġ rental apartment warning that several ethnic minorities need not apply, caused outrage earlier this week.
 “No Pakis, Indians, Arabs and Philippines,” the notice said, lest anyone think the property was available to all.
 When the news broke, Alliance Real Estate, the agency advertising the property, quietly deleted the advert, admitting that the notice had accidentally let slip a request from the property’s owner.
 “Some owners decide to restrict certain cultures, nationalities or ages of tenants, others may decide to restrict all pets or certain types of pets,” the agency said, adding that it registers these requests through an internal comments section in its database.
  Some fumed at the discriminatory nature of this practice, others argued that a property owner has every right to choose their prospective tenants.
 Others still wrote to Times of Malta, asking whether law really does bar tenants from setting the terms of their rental properties to exclude some people.
 It’s not that simple, and with good reason.
 Modern history is rife with tales of people being denied access to housing because of their religion, skin colour, nationality or sexual orientation.
 There’s no need to look too far from home for examples of this.
 In the early 20described as “ignorant of all sanitary precautions”.
 A century later, the tables have turned, with migrants in Malta frequently bearing the brunt of discriminatory housing practices.
 This week’s incident is far from new.
 In 2011, another estate agency, Simon Estates advertised a rental property in Qawra, adding the phrase “no arabs, blacks or young boys (sic)” to the tail-end of the advert. Although it was told off, the agency ultimately  escaped punishment.
  A study commissioned by Malta’s equality commission just a few months later found that several property owners  “are not interested in renting their properties to categories generally referred to as ‘Arabs’, ‘Blacks’ or specific nationalities, including ‘Libyans’ and ‘Chinese’”.
 The equality commission told Times of Malta that it intends to “repeat this study so that it provides an updated picture of the situation”.
 In any case, it’s clear that the problem has persisted throughout the past decade.
 In 2022, one Bangladeshi businessman described how he was left mulling a move away from Malta, his home for almost two decades, after he was repeatedly turned away by property owners because he is “a Muslim man and a third country national”.
 Unsurprisingly, the law has stepped in to stop this sort of discrimination, at least on paper.
 A 2007 law, known as the Equal Treatment of Persons Order, prohibits direct or indirect discrimination against people based on their racial or ethnic origin, effectively making it illegal to deny a service (“including housing,” the law says) because of a person’s ethnicity.
 The same law also makes it illegal to advertise a service in a way that “promotes discrimination or which is discriminatory”.
 What’s more, if there is enough prima facie evidence to suggest that a prospective tenant has been discriminated against, the burden of proof lies upon the property owner, so it is ultimately up to them to convince the courts that they haven’t acted unfairly.
 The penalty for breaking this law? A fine of up to 1,000 Maltese Liri (roughly €2,330) and a six-month stint in prison. It is unclear whether any of these punishments have ever been imposed.
 But breaking this law won’t land you with a criminal record since it constitutes a civil, not criminal, offence.
  While this law, based on the EU’s race equality directive, speaks specifically of race and ethnicity, other tweaks to Malta’s laws – and its constitution - over the years have ensured that discrimination on other grounds, including gender, sexual orientation, and religion, amongst others.
 A landmark equality bill, meant to enshrine these protections under a single cap, was brought before parliament several years ago, but appears to have stalled after objections raised by church schools and some medical associations.
 Still, even without the updated equality bill, advertising a property to prohibit people of certain race or ethnicity remains illegal.
 In its response to the news, the equality commission said that the agency’s explanation that the comment was intended for internal use is “a blatant admission that discriminatory and illegal criteria are used and normalised in their services”.
 “Furthermore, the claim that they are bound to follow their clients’ discriminatory requests is both illegal and ethically wrong,” the commission said.
 But, lawyers say, although Malta's laws are clear in prohibiting discrimination, things are a little less clearcut in practice, with people finding ways to select their tenants without falling foul of the law.
 ""In reality, these anti-discrimination laws only really come into play in cases that are blatant,"" one lawyer told Times of Malta.
 No, property lawyers say that the law doesn’t explicitly speak about this, effectively giving landlords a free hand over whether they are willing to rent out their property to families with children or pets.
  In practice, many landlords opt to bar pets from their properties, putting pet owners in a sticky situation when moving from one rental property to another.
 This prompted animal welfare commissioner Alison Bezzina to call for the introduction of tax incentives for landlords who rent out pet-friendly properties.
 Malta’s anti-discrimination laws, like those in other EU member states, make it illegal for a property owner to bar people from certain groups (including ethnic or racial groups) from renting their properties.
 If a person feels that they have been unfairly discriminated against, it is up to the property owner to show that they have not acted in a discriminatory manner.
 But property owners are free to set their own terms when it comes to deciding whether to allow people with children or pets to rent their properties.

One out of every six people in Maltese households at risk of poverty in 2023,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/one-every-six-people-maltese-households-risk-poverty-2023.1093860,13-06-2024,003916.png,"One out of every six people in Maltese households were at risk of poverty last year, according to data released on Wednesday by the National Statistics Office.
 Figures from the European Statistics on Income and Living Conditions survey show that 88,462 people were under the poverty line in 2023 - meaning that 16.6% of the local population was at risk of poverty.
 This translates to a drop of 0.1% over 2022.
 A fifth (22%) of those at risk of poverty were aged under 18 - up by 2.7 percentage points from the previous year.
 A decrease of 0.2 percentage points was meanwhile observed among people aged 18 to 64, bringing the ARP rate for this age cohort down to 12.1% in 2023.
 The rate for those aged 65 or more went down to 29%, equivalent to a decrease of 1 percentage point.
 Material and social deprivation 
 Material and social deprivation indicators are based on 13 items, of which seven relate to the person’s household and six relate to the person. 
 These are when a household faces unexpected expenses; affording a one-week annual holiday; avoiding arrears (in mortgage, rent, utility bills and/or hire purchase instalments); affording a meal with meat, chicken or fish or vegetarian equivalent every second day; affording to keep the house appropriately warm; having access to a car/van for personal use and replacing worn-out furniture.
 They also include whether a person affords to replace worn-out clothes with new ones; have two pairs of properly fitting shoes; spends a small amount of money each week on him/herself; has regular leisure activities; gets together with friends/family for a drink/meal at least once a month and have an internet connection.
 When compared to 2022, the highest increases in 2023 were recorded in the group of respondents who said that their household was unable to afford a meal with meat, chicken, fish, or vegetarian equivalent every second day, and those whose household found it difficult to face unexpected financial expenses. 
 Wellbeing
 On a scale from zero to 10, where zero represents not satisfied at all, and 10 represents completely satisfied, respondents at risk of poverty or social exclusion reported lower average scores when it comes to their satisfaction with overall life, financial situation, current job, and personal relationships when compared to those not at-risk-of-poverty or social exclusion.
 Average scores for overall satisfaction about at-risk-of-poverty or social exclusion were slightly higher in 2023 when compared to 2022.
 Particularly, in 2023 respondents at risk of poverty or social exclusion reported a mean score of seven for satisfaction with their overall life - an increase of 0.2 points from 2022 and a mean score of 6.2 for satisfaction with their financial situation, translating into an increase of 0.4 points.
 They also reported a mean score of 7.4 for satisfaction with their current job - an increase of 0.1 points from 2022, and a mean score of 8.5 for satisfaction with personal relationships, representing an increase of 0.3 points.

It was an auspicious day for the monarchy and the empire.
 Much less for Malta. The island’s cherished self-governing constitution had been revoked and Malta was being ruled by a military governor’s one-man diktat.
 In no uncertain words, London had told the humiliated Maltese in the name of the king: you are not capable of governing yourselves.
  And, yet, when the empire-builders organised spectacular activities to celebrate the king’s jubilee, the mortified populace swarmed to cheer and applaud. Slap the people in the face, demean them – they will still find your free bread and circuses irresistible.
   The festivities reached the highest loyalist pitch – lavish street decorations enlivened with kilometres of bunting, life-size mock-ups of the monarchs, band marches, fireworks, a water carnival, concerts, floats decorated with imperialist symbols, banquets, floodlighting of historical landmarks, school children on holiday.
  The facades of many shops and clubs competed to advertise devotion to the colonial power. Sales of jubilee souvenirs rocketed.
  Not one single manifestation of dissent is on record at the outrage of having your political autonomy and democracy smothered in the name of benevolent despotism. Business as usual.
  The Church organised a most solemn Te Deum in St John’s Co-Cathedral, no doubt to thank providence that our distant rulers did not trust us to take care of ourselves. King George died shortly later.
  Postcard publishers rode the bandwagon too. Besides the usual images of decorations and festive events, special high-quality composite souvenir postcards were put on sale. The Malta postal authorities also issued a set of handsome commemorative stamps.

 The fundraising event, to raise money for the Malta Community Chest Fund, kicked off at 8.30am from San Anton Palace, Balzan. 
 This was the first charity walk under President Myriam Spiteri Debono.
 Participants passed through Birkirkara, Santa Venera, Ħamrun and Floriana. 
  Among those participating in the ‘Mixja mal-President’ were President Myriam Spiteri Debono, Prime Minister Robert Abela, Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech, and several other politicians from both sides of the House. 
 The walk ended in at St. George’s Square, in front of the Grandmaster’s Palace in Valletta. 
 There Spiteri Debono spoke about a new agreement between MCCF and the government, where the government will take over responsibility for the funding of medicines for cancer patients. During her speech she emphasised that the foundation will continue to support those in need. 
 She said MCCF provides support not just to those in need of oncological care, but also provides support for a wide range of other social needs. 
 She said there will be other fundraising efforts this year, including L-Istrina. Earlier this week, Spiteri Debono confirmed the Boxing Day fund-raiser for MCCF will proceed as usual. 
 She encouraged everyone present to show the same spirit of solidarity shown during the walk in the coming weeks, during other fundraising events, particularly during L-Istrina.
 Following the speeches, Abela presented a donation of €20,000 to the MCCF from the Just Causes Fund.

25% of irregular TCN employers are in hospitality,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/25-irregular-tcn-employers-hospitality.1093144,31-05-2024,004281.png,"A quarter of businesses irregularly employing workers from outside the EU last year were from the hospitality sector, according to government figures.
 Of the 1,695 employers found to have irregularly engaged workers from outside the EU – persons known as third country nationals (TCNs) – 436 were active in accommodation and food services, home affairs ministry figures show.
 These accounted for 26% of the total, with the sector by far the most represented among the 20 listed.
 The next most represented sector was wholesale and retail trade including the repair of vehicles and motorcycles (267 employers), followed by administration (179) and construction (168).
 Times of Malta requested the breakdown after Home Affairs Minister Byron Camilleri revealed the number of employers found to have employed non-EU workers irregularly last year in response to a parliamentary question by Nationalist MP Graziella Attard Previ.
 Figures tabled in parliament show the number of such irregular employers increased year-on-year from 2021 to 2023, albeit at a slowing pace; while 1,060 employers were caught in 2021, by the next year this had jumped 36% to 1,446.
 The following year, this number increased by less than half the previous rate, rising by 17% to 1,695 employers.
 Responding to questions, a home affairs ministry spokesperson said almost nine out of 10 businesses (88%) caught employing third country nationals irregularly had regularised their position, with the rest either fined or sent to court.
 “The remaining 12% were either given a fine... or referred to the Courts of Justice,” the spokesperson said, noting more than a quarter of offending employers (29%) were referred to court.
 Employers were referred to the courts if their workers were without an employment record and work permit or had a permit with another employer, she explained.
 Businesses whose workers had no employment record but a valid permit with that same employer were issued a fine instead, she said.
 The spokesperson added the country’s employment agency, Jobsplus undertakes “regular monitoring mechanisms, including physical inspections and administrative checks to ensure that employers abide by the local labour market regulations”.
 She did not respond to questions about what actions, if any, had been taken against those workers found to have been employed irregularly and if any had been deported from the country.
 Hospitality workers, especially food couriers, have been linked to irregular employment and working conditions in the past, with one study from the Department for Industrial and Employment Relations (DIER) finding such workers were not getting enough time to rest.
 The study also found employers had deducted money from their workers’ first salary to pay for their uniforms and work equipment.

Valletta music legend Maestro Vinny Vella dies aged 96,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/valletta-music-legend-maestro-vinny-vella-dies-aged-96.1094481,26-06-2024,"004314.png,004315.png,004316.png","Updated 4.25pm with minister's reaction
 Valletta's Maestro Vinny Vella Senior died on Wednesday aged 96.
 Vella played the clarinet and saxophone, with his career spanning from the 1940s to the 1990s.
 
 He was the leading musician and director of the band Vinny’s Blue Jackets and performed alongside several local and foreign performers including Albano Carrisi, Bobby Solo and Wilma De Angelis.
 His name was synonymous with venues such as The Premier, Phoenicia, Strait Street and Chalet. 
 His grandson Jamie told Times of Malta Vella was also among the musicians at a ball in Malta attended by then-Princess Elizabeth during her stay on the island. 
  On Facebook, Jamie recalled Vella as ""a true legend by every measure"".
 ""To many he will be remembered as the larger-than-life Meastro. To us he was simply ‘nannu Vinny’ - the centre of our family. Thank you  nannu for the love, wisdom, memories and - thank you for the music.""
 As news spread of his death on Wednesday, several took to social media to bid farewell to the ""legend"".
 Fellow musician Mark Spiteri Lucas said that Vella, together with other musicians, many of whom were from Valletta, had helped shape the local musical scene during the second half of the twentieth century.
 ""Rest in peace maestro and thank you for how many people you have blessed with your music,"" he said.
  Valletta councillor Ray Azzopardi said the locality had lost an ""icon"".
 ""There is no need to describe Vinny because everyone knows who he was and what he did in his life. Vinny certainly left beautiful memories and he thrilled everyone with his music.""
 Culture Minister Owen Bonnici described Vella as a ""legend"". 
  ""Vinny Vella will always be remembered for his leading and outstanding role in the live music industry, particularly in post-war Valletta,"" said Owen Bonnici. ""As his grandson Jamie aptly stated, the Maestro was a true legend by every measure.""
 Vella is survived by his three children, Tania, Carmen and Vinny Jr - who followed in his father's footsteps and forged his own musical career.

 Vella died aged 15 earlier this month as a result of complications caused by a rare disease he suffered, ROHHAD (Rapid-onset Obesity with Hypothalamic Dysfunction, Hypoventilation, and Autonomic Dysregulation). 
 Despite his medical condition, he took part in triathlons and actively encouraged people to exercise and stay healthy, inspiring thousands.  Vella was also an animal rights activist.
 The Xirka Gieħ ir-Repubblika is Malta's highest honour, awarded to those who demonstrate exceptional merit in the service of Malta or of humanity. 
 Abela, who is the wife of Prime Minister Robert Abela, announced her intention to nominate Vella for the prize during a visit she paid to his parents in Birżebbuġa, having first discussed the idea with them.
 She described Vella as a hero.
 “He was an extraordinary altruist who always sought to spread joy, despite his personal struggles. He transmitted love and brought people together,” she said.
  Abela said Vella was an example of the value of never giving up.
 She said she was sure that many people would back her decision to nominate him for the Ġieħ ir-Repubblika award.

Watch: A different kind of theatre is about to open in Sliema,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/watch-a-different-kind-theatre-open-sliema.1091949,21-06-2024,"004344.png,004345.png,004346.png,004347.png,004348.png,004349.png","A 116-year-old theatre in the heart of Sliema has been completely refurbished and is about to revolutionise the concept of a community theatre.
 The Salesians Theatre plans to host all kinds of events, from traditional drama to jazz nights to stand-up comedy, even doubling up as a day care centre for the elderly.
 “We want to get people together beyond the theatre and what is happening on stage. Theatre belongs to the people, and their engagement with the arts can help their general well-being,” said artistic consultant Rosetta Debattista.
 She believes the theatre experience should be much more than merely buying a ticket, watching a performance and going back home. For Debattista, a renowned musician and tutor, it is all about engagement, people and socialisation.
  Teatru Salesjan intends to work with children, youths, persons with disability, migrant and foreign communities, for which Sliema is a catchment area.
 Even the 480 banquet chairs – not your standard theatre seating – were chosen to enhance the versatility of the space, offering a cabaret-style set-up; while large round tables have been purchased so the auditorium can host a variety of events, including gala dinners.
 The project involved demolishing the balcony, gutting the stage and its ceiling, and creating the space for a hydraulic stage in the future – although that would cost a further €150,000. The second phase is the regeneration of the theatre’s annex, which would serve as a cultural centre, but that will not be happening anytime soon because of a shortage of funds.
  The theatre will transcend the actual building since there are plans for part of Ġuże Howard Street, where the theatre is located, to be pedestrianised and lined with trees. Works on the car-free road are scheduled to start in September, paving the way for the breathing space in line with the community theatre’s role.
 Debattista listed the many dormant community theatres and the importance of “decentralising” from Valletta to bring the arts into society’s day-to-day life.
 Starting tomorrow, the Golden Years Festival will kick off its community goal in a big way. Held over a series of Monday mornings, it is welcoming the elderly, 18 per cent of whom live in Sliema, to listen to live jazz music from the 1930s through to the 1950s and socialise in the theatre.
 “The elderly can feel lonely, and this would be an environment in which they can enjoy themselves and feel comfortable,” said Debattista, the theatre’s creative lead.
  Beyond the programme of events, which will bring to life the concept of community theatre at the heart of the project, lie two problems.
 The theatre has racked up a huge debt of around €500,000, which it fears will eat into the arts sector if it is forced to charge high rental fees for its use.
 The project cost €1 million and the strain of that debt on a theatre risks falling on the arts, Debattista feared.
 “We need to keep rates reasonable for artists; not to alienate them,” she continued.
 If it is not affordable to artists, the box office would feel the pinch of “ridiculous” prices, Debattista said, pointing out how arts events were becoming so costly for audiences, which means excluding a large chunk of society.
 But a community theatre was about building a relationship with its audience and not a once-a-year activity, Debattista insisted.
  Debattista also feels that running a theatre strictly on a voluntary basis was a thing of the past, with the cost of living meaning people needed to get paid for their work.
 “We need more financial assistance and volunteering has become a bite-size approach. A theatre cannot be run on this,” said James Spiteri Tanti, a member of the executive committee made up of three volunteers.
 Spiteri Tanti, who has been involved since 2011, would not have it any other way: “I believe in what this place can do for society because I am not too happy with where society is going.”
 While there is enough passion, drive and commitment to keep the project going, the dry coffers are a headache, and the committee is scratching its head to see how to raise funds to cover the shortfall that keeps “ballooning”.
 They are appealing to the business community to recognise the potential of organising events in the upgraded space.
  “Once it starts being used, the wheels will start turning,” they believe. “But we need help in the next five years to get going,” they maintained, appealing to benefactors.
 Spiteri Tanti would like to reawaken an interest in the arts in the country and garner patrons’ support, as is the case overseas, where long lists of families fund the arts.
 A membership scheme will soon be launched, allowing subscribers to “feel part of the theatre and benefit from this”.
 But the end goal is for Teatru Salesjan to transition to independence and become self-sustainable.
 The team is grateful for funding to the tune of around €500,000 from the Arts Council and Teatru Malta, the Planning Authority and the Social Causes Fund over the years.
 The large Calì painting and proscenium arch décor on top of the stage were also restored through BOV’s €60,000 sponsorship, while the BOV Joseph Calleja Foundation and ADRC Trust have both been considered a “lifeline”, helping with the budding theatre’s education and community programme.
 Even the contractors engaged on the project have been helpful, with their flexible payment terms, Spiteri Tanti said.
 “Why don’t we give up? We cannot,” he continued.
 “Because although society is disconnected today, we still believe in it and in what the arts can bring to it. This is what we can do, rather than just be armchair critics on social media.”

NGOs want timeframe for new law suspending planning applications under appeal,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/when-law-suspending-planning-applications-appeal-come-force.1097594,09-04-2024,004378.png,"Some 20 organisations are calling on the government to set a timeframe for the implementation of a new law set to suspend planning applications until the entire appeals process has been concluded. 
 Earlier this week, the planning ministry promised new legislation ensuring that when a planning application is disputed at the planning appeals tribunal or even the Court of Appeal, construction will not be allowed to go forward until these appeals are concluded. 
 On Wednesday, the NGOs called for the immediate implementation of such a measure.
 They said despite the promised changes, there has been no commitment to any timeframes.
 Furthermore, there were no guarantees that the new legislation would solve the problems Malta and its citizens were facing, the activists added.
 The NGOs are protesting a recent decision by the PA to overturn a court of appeal judgement presided by Chief Justice Mark Chetcuti. That decision, they said, was ""flagrantly abusive"".
 The sanctioning is linked to the development of apartment blocks with pools in rural Gozo which was proposed in two different applications in 2020 and 2021.
 Activists had insisted the applications could not be judged singularly and in a vacuum, as they formed part of an attempt to fragment a mega-development to avoid the scrutiny such a large project would require. 
 In one of the applications (PA2035/21), Mark Agius, a developer and business partner of Portelli, applied to excavate a site and construct 29 apartments, 20 basement garages and a pool. The proposal was approved in 2021.
 Heritage NGO Din L-Art Ħelwa had filed an appeal against the PA’s approval. When the  Environment and Planning Tribunal also approved the development, it took the issue to the law courts.
 In March, Chief Justice Mark Chetcuti noted that the EPRT had incorrectly applied policies when it approved the development.
 The court noted that the approved pool and penthouse floor level should not have been approved, and the permit for this part was revoked.
 However, by then both the pool and the penthouses had been constructed and an application (PA/03869/24) to sanction two of the illegal penthouses was filed by Tarlochan Singh.
 In the application, Singh declared he is not an owner of the entire site, but is authorised to carry out the proposed development through an agreement with the owner.
 Flimkien għal Ambjent Aħjar and DLĦ protested the sanctioning with the latter applying for the revocation of the sanctioning permit.
 Arnold Cassola has meanwhile asked the Commissioner for Environment and Planning within the Office of the Ombudsman to look into the matter.
 On Wednesday, the group of NGOs said the fact the PA ""feels it can disregard the Court of Appeal’s declaration and final judgment and subsequently sanction this property is not acceptable and accentuates the urgency with which the planning laws need to be amended"".
 The rule of law should apply across the entire legislation including that of planning and environmental issues.
 They are calling for an urgent meeting with the Prime Minister and the planning minister to discuss the proposed amendments and set a timeframe.

 In comments posted to a Cottonera residents' Facebook group, one person said they had been left without power for 12 hours while others reported losing power around midnight. 
 Other residents in the area told Times of Malta they woke up in the middle of the night due to the heat, as air conditioners and fans were left without power. 
 Enemalta told Times of Malta that two high voltage cables suffered two separate faults affecting Cospicua and Senglea.
 ""Our teams were immediately dispatched and several substations were reconnected to the grid within minutes. However, three substation could not be connected until the faults were located and fixed. As a result, Enemalta’s teams worked on two fronts: on one hand, by using alternative sources of power, to power up the substations and on the other, dedicated teams kicked off on the fault location. Once the fault was identified, the laborious works started immediately. We are working round the clock so that these repair works as completed as soon as is technically possible.""
  This latest outage comes after a summer of sporadic power cuts across the country which, while not as bad as last year, left many residents and businesses fuming.
 Iklin and parts of Birkirkara and San Gwann suffered long power cuts on Friday night and Saturday. 
 Last week, Marsaxlokk residents and business owners told TImes of Malta they were becoming  increasingly frustrated after suffering repeated power cuts this summer. A week before that, Enemalta completed the  installation of a new 60-megawatt diesel-powered emergency power station.
 Enemalta says Malta has enough electricity to power the country and that the emergency facility will serve as backup should a main source of power fail. The company has however acknowledged problems with its distribution network, following years of chronic underinvestment

"Identità delays mean I cannot marry in Church or legally work, man tells court",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/identita-delays-mean-i-cannot-marry-church-legally-work-man.1101474,27-11-2024,004640.png,"A Ghanaian man and his Maltese partner, who have been together for seven years and entered a cohabitation agreement last year, have accused Identità of dragging its feet to issue a residence permit, which would allow him to work and them to get married in Church.
 Prince Kwadwo Asomah and Josephine Portelli filed a judicial protest, in the First Hall of the Civil Court, against state identity management agency Identità. They are calling on the authority to issue the residence and work permits according to law.
 “My partner deserves to work with dignity like other people who are married to a Maltese citizen. The same rules should apply to everyone equally,” Portelli said.
 Speaking to Times of Malta, Portelli explained that she met Asomah through social media when he was living in Italy. In 2019, he flew to Malta and continued their relationship.
 He was claiming refugee status – first in Italy and then in Malta. During that time, he was given a temporary work permit which he had to renew regularly. However, his refugee application was rejected and his work permit was revoked.
 In the meantime, the couple made plans to get married but could not get married in Church, as they wished to, as he did not have the necessary documents. Asomah even got baptised while living in Malta.
 So they entered a cohabitation agreement, under the Cohabitation Act, in July 2023.
 In the judicial protest, they noted that their cohabitation was recognised by Identità. According to cohabitation law, a cohabitant has the “same rights granted to a person who is married or in a civil union in terms of rights related to labour and family”.
 Last March, he applied for a residence permit and provided all the necessary documents. But still, the authority is dragging its feet and, as a result, he cannot exercise his right to work legally.
 They called on Identità to issue the documents or face further legal action.
 “What is causing the delay in issuing a residence permit card to a person in a stable and durable relationship when Identità had already recognised the relationship by issuing a cohabitation certificate? Is there something beyond? Perhaps a hidden policy to make it difficult for TCNs to get what is entitled to them by law as the Cohabitation Act does not make any distinction between who can enter into a cohabitation?” she said.
 Lawyer Analise Magri and legal procurator Mark Sultana signed the protest.

Byron Camilleri welcomes 'more scrutiny' as Identità racket inquiry announced,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/byron-camilleri-welcomes-more-scrutiny-identita-racket-inquiry.1096694,13-08-2024,004645.png,"Home Affairs Minister Byron Camilleri said he is ""looking forward to more scrutiny"" after a magistrate upheld a request to hold an inquiry into an alleged scam involving the government's identity agency.
 The allegations revolve around Identità issuing Maltese ID cards to foreigners based on forged documents.
 On Tuesday afternoon, Camilleri - who is politically responsible for Identità - said the agency has always acted correctly by reporting illegalities to the police.
  ""When Identità, through its internal processes, found that something was done wrongly, it was the agency itself that reported the issue to the police,"" Camilleri said.
 Those reports led to court prosecutions and sentences, he added.
 ""People who say Identità did not take reports seriously are wrong because it was the entity itself that flagged and reported the cases to the police,"" he said.
 ""This does not mean we don't want more scrutiny; I am the first one to say that I look forward to more scrutiny. This is what is right, and anything that someone did wrongly should be investigated,"" Camilleri said.
 The Home Affairs Minister further stressed: ""For as long as I've been a minister, I have always made sure that justice was done; no one can say that I ever tried to hide anything.""
 Anyone against whom evidence of wrongdoing was found would have to answer to the courts, he added. 
 Lawyer Jason Azzopardi requested a magisterial inquiry two weeks ago in a sworn court application. 
 Azzopardi bases his claims on statements made by an anonymous man who attended VIP parties where the party's organiser bragged about how easy it was for her to get work permits for her workers through contacts at Identitá.
 She claimed these public officials were paid “large sums of money” or offered free invites to her parties where cocaine flowed “abundantly” and prostitutes mingled with distinguished guests.
 The parties were attended by politicians from both parliamentary parties, Azzopardi said. 
 Azzopardi claimed that since 2015, some 18,000 identity cards have been issued based on fake marriage certificates and that Identità officials have fabricated other documents.
 When asked about the 18,000 figure, Camilleri responded that the numbers given to him by Identità are ""completely different.""
 Asked to elaborate, Camilleri said more details will come from the investigation.
 When questioned about his silence on the issue when it first surfaced at the end of July, Camilleri maintained that he has always given comments when asked.
 Identità also released a statement following news of the inquiry, emphasizing its full cooperation with investigations. 
 The agency said it initiated an internal probe, which led to individuals being charged in court after passing all of its evidence to the police. 
 Identità said it maintains zero tolerance for abuse, committing to ongoing collaboration, including in the Magisterial Inquiry, to uphold public trust.
 Rule of law NGO Repubblika said in reaction that this saga has once again highlighted police inaction despite the public evidence that Azzopardi brought forward.
 This led him to seek a magisterial inquiry instead, they said. 
 They also said that the racket has put Malta's national security under threat as it means that authorities cannot know if the information displayed on ID documents is genuine or not. 
 Repubblika said the government has been systematically lying as fake ID cards have all been issued with false addresses.

Notaries ordered not to sign Identità lease form over verification concerns,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/notaries-ordered-sign-identita-lease-form-verification-concerns.1097642,09-05-2024,"004730.png,004731.png","The Notarial Council has ordered notaries not to sign a new Identità lease agreement form because the document does not guarantee that the signatures on a rental contract are genuine.
 As of this week, third-country nationals applying for residence need an attested lease agreement as part of their application process.
 The new measure, announced last week was designed to fight abuse of the system amid claims that thousands of ID cards were issued on the basis of forged documents. 
 Notaries, lawyers, and legal procurators are authorized to sign the Lease Agreement Attestation Form.
 But notaries are objecting because a form for the registration of the leases allows the possibility to attest the signatures without witnessing the signing, a spokesperson for the Notarial Council said.
  “Without witnessing the signature and assuring that the person signing the document is who they say they are, through an identification document there is no legal certainty,” the spokesperson said.
 The Notarial Council spokesperson said notaries can still attest lease agreements, but they should not sign the accompanying Identità form.
 It issued a directive on Wednesday saying: ""With immediate effect, the Notarial Council directs the Notarial College that the new form for the registration of leases, as issued by Identity Malta, should neither be signed nor filled out by the Notary until further notice,” the directive issued by the council to all of Malta’s notaries said.
 “The Notarial Council emphasizes that the legal certainty, which notaries are responsible for guaranteeing, must always be upheld,” the statement said.
 Notaries “should only sign a rental agreement if all parties have signed in their presence and provided identification via an identity card, driver’s license, or passport,” the council said in a statement.
 “The Notarial Council does not agree that notaries should sign documents presented to them already signed because, naturally, the notary cannot confirm the identity of the signatory, nor can they ensure that the document was truly signed by that person,” they said.
 They added that notaries cannot guarantee the title of a property without doing the related research.
 Tenants union Solidarjetà has also criticised the new measure, saying it is “rash and misguided” and further financial pressure on tenants because of the costs associated with verifying documents.

How has Malta changed? Five trends revealing Malta's changing face,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/how-malta-changed-five-trends-revealing-malta-changing-face.1095856,08-05-2024,004677.png,"A wide-ranging report published by Malta’s national statistics office gives a glimpse into Malta’s changing face, revealing how the country’s social and economic fabric has undergone a drastic transformation in just a few years.
 The report, the 2024 edition of Malta’s regional statistics, sheds light on a wide range of issues, from demographics to tourism, construction and poverty.
 We pored through the report’s endless tables to pick out five trends that show the extent of this transformation. 
 This is hardly surprising, given the government’s well-documented policy of attracting foreign workers to supplement Malta’s economy and plug gaps in the workforce.
 By the end of 2022, people between 30 and 49 made up roughly a third of the country’s total population.
 In Gozo alone, the number of people aged 30 to 39 shot up by 40% since 2017, going from just over 4,000 to more than 6,000. Meanwhile, Malta saw an increase of more than 20,000 people in this age group, an increase of almost a third since 2017.
 Other age groups – between 20 and 29, and from 40 to 49 – also saw dramatic, albeit lesser, increases.
 But so did the number of elderly people in the country, with the number of people between ages 70 and 79 up by over a quarter in both Malta and Gozo. Meanwhile, the number of youths and children has remained virtually unchanged.
 
 In practice, Malta’s migration patterns appear to be disguising the country’s ageing population.
 The same report reveals that Malta’s old-age dependency ratio (the number of persons over 65 or under 14 years old compared to those of working age between 15 and 64) has remained steady at around 27 since 2017, despite the huge boost in Malta’s working-age population.
 Even if we take migration out of the equation, Malta’s population is on the rise, albeit to a far lesser degree.
 Almost all towns across Malta and Gozo are seeing a natural increase in their population, even though this has slowed in recent years.
 The big exceptions? The southern harbour area, which includes the three cities, Żabbar, Paola and Valletta, amongst others. Gozo and Comino had negative natural population growth in 2021 and 2022.
 Here, the number of people dying far outnumbers those being born. While 634 people were born in the region in 2022, 1,109 died during the same year, meaning that there were almost 500 fewer people in these towns, excluding people who moved there.
 
 The region has been seeing a gradual decline in its native population for years, but this has ramped up drastically since 2020.
 Households’ disposable income has crept up steadily throughout the years, rising from an average of €27,500 in 2017 to nearly €35,000 in 2022.
 But income inequality across Malta’s different regions has risen even more sharply.
 Back in 2017, people across Malta’s six regions all had roughly similar amounts of disposable income, ranging from around €23,000 in Gozo to €29,500, with only households in Malta’s western towns (including Rabat, Siġġiewi and Żebbuġ) having over €30,000 in disposable income.
 Seven years on, things look markedly different. By 2017, households across all regions had seen their disposable income swell by at least €8,000, with households in southeastern towns (including Marsascala, Marsaxlokk, Żejtun and Birżebbuġa) seeing an even bigger €13,000 bump in their disposable income.
 But northern harbour towns (which include Sliema, Gżira, Msida, Ħamrun, Birkirkara and Qormi) have only seen a meagre €2,700 increase in disposable income.
 This inequality is reflected in the number of people at risk of poverty. While this has either dropped or only increased marginally across all regions, the number of people living below the poverty line in northern harbour towns has shot up.
 
 By 2022, over 36,000 people living in these towns, almost one in every four persons, was considered to be at risk of poverty. This figure was 22,500 (or 16%) in 2017.
 Malta’s construction boom could be slowing, if the number of building permits is an indication.
 At the height of the boom, in 2019, a little under 2,800 building permits were issued across Malta and Gozo. This effectively meant that almost 12,500 new dwellings were approved.
 By 2023 this had dipped by more than a third to 1,700 permits and 8,100 dwellings.
 These numbers first dropped during the pandemic year of 2020 but have remained relatively unchanged since, suggesting that this is more than just a Covid-related blip.
 
 But, while fewer buildings are being built, the number of dwellings in each building is inching upwards, suggesting that either the buildings are getting larger, or dwellings smaller.
 Back in 2017, each building permit housed four and a half dwellings, on average. By 2022 this had gone up to a little over five, before settling at a little under the five mark last year.
 The pandemic appears to have turned Gozo into a holiday destination for many Maltese, with the number of Maltese people travelling to their sister island shooting up when lockdowns were imposed in 2020 and remaining high ever since.
 While the 331,500 Maltese residents who holidayed in Gozo in 2022 is lower than both 2020 and 2021 (which topped 361,000), it is far higher than the 215,000 who visited the island in 2019, before the pandemic hit.
 Maltese visitors now make up some 72% of all tourists to Gozo and a little over half of the 1.8m bed nights spent on the island.
 
 But relatively fewer people are now choosing to stay in rented accommodation during their stay (whether it’s a hotel or a self-catering rental), with more and more people opting for “non-rented accommodation”.

‘No Pakis…’: estate agent accidentally publishes internal ‘restriction’,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/no-pakis-estate-agent-accidentally-publishes-internal-restriction.1096356,08-06-2024,004689.png,"A leading estate agent advertised a property with the warning “no Pakis, Indians, Arabs and Philippines” after accidentally publishing an “internal comment” instead of the property description, it has admitted.
 The comment described the landlord’s “restrictions” in respect to prospective tenants, a spokesperson for Alliance Real Estate said, stressing the company was obliged to enforce such restrictions.
 But restricting housing or any other goods or services based on nationality or skin colour is illegal, according to a prominent human rights lawyer.
 Apologising for the incident, the spokesperson said Alliance would change the wording of its internal comments to “kinder language”, adding no offence had been intended by its “colloquial tone”.
 A listing for a three-bedroom apartment in Żebbuġ appeared on the Alliance Real Estate website on Friday afternoon, later appearing on property aggregate website propertymarket.com.mt.
 Alongside a note explaining the property could be turned into a five-bedroom terraced house, the description also said: “no Pakis, Indians, Arabs and Philippines” (sic).
 The term ‘Paki’ is a derogatory term for a person from Pakistan that has also been used to contemptuously describe persons of other South Asian nationalities.
 The listing had been removed from propertymarket.com.mt by Sunday afternoon and the listing on the Alliance website was edited yesterday morning to remove the reference.
 A spokesperson for Alliance said the description had appeared when an “internal comment” by the company had been published by mistake.
  “Unfortunately, the reality is that it is not uncommon for landlords to impose restrictions on the types of tenants they would accept living in their properties and we, obviously, have to abide by these specifications,” she said.
 “Some owners decide to restrict certain cultures, nationalities or ages of tenants, others may decide to restrict all pets or certain types of pets.”
 The spokesperson said that, in Alliance’s database, “we have an internal comments section where these specifications are listed so that property advisers do not need to check with the landlord every time.
 “Unfortunately, what happened in this case was that the internal comments were incorrectly entered in the wrong place, and these were published on the advert instead of the actual description.”
 She said the company had implemented a “stronger internal approval process” and changed the wording it used internally to “kinder language when it comes to this kind of restriction, even though this is not intended to be public”.
 Neil Falzon, director of human rights NGO Aditus, said restricting access to housing based on nationality is against the law.
 “Maltese law is crystal clear: anyone refusing to offer a service to a person simply on the basis of their skin colour, nationality or origin is breaking the law... the law requires you to treat people with decency and respect,” he said.
 “Anyone seeing these ads should report them at once and the property owners should be punished and shamed,” he said, calling for more enforcement of equality legislation.
 Propertymarket.com.mt distanced itself from the listing, saying the listings on its website reflected those on the websites of estate agents.
 “Whatever is on their website appears on our site... we take these things seriously, but our website just replicates listings,” a spokesperson for the company said.
 “We do review listings, but this one slipped through the net,” he said, stressing the property had been removed from the company’s website “within an hour” of appearing online.
 Tenants of a Sliema apartment shared by around 40 foreign workers said in June last year that, though while they wanted to find alternative accommodation, “most people don’t rent to an Indian or someone from Bangladesh”.
 They said such attitude restricted their choice of housing, often forcing them to rent cramped accommodation similar to the property in Sliema.
 “Everywhere we go, we get shown apartments that look like this… lots of places like Qormi and Buġibba, the situation is the same.”

"Cab fleets find a way of hiring new drivers, despite work permit ban",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/cab-fleets-skirting-new-hire-ban-temporary-permits.1098423,23-09-2024,004777.png,"Cab fleets have found a way to temporarily hire new third-country national drivers despite a government policy that rejects new work permit applications in the industry.
 The fleets do this by acquiring a temporary work permit, commonly known as a “blue paper,” for their new hired personnel who are already based in Malta. Third-country nationals (TCNs) are from outside the EU.
 Among the fleets actively employing new drivers is a company partly owned by former economy minister Chris Cardona and another company owned by Gozitan businessman Mark Agius.
 In July, the government said new applications by third-country nationals for cab driving and food courier work permits were being turned down because the market had “reached saturation”.
 The Home Affairs Ministry had said this applied to people abroad seeking a job here and those already in Malta who were changing their employer. Those applying to renew their permit with the same employer are being accepted.
 But while waiting for a decision on whether to approve or reject a new work permit application, Identità’s policy is to issue the “blue paper” when a third-country national is already working in Malta and is applying to either renew their permit with their current employer or changing their employer.
 Therefore, employees engaged with a new employer are allowed to legally work at their new job until a final decision is taken or the temporary permit expires after two months.
 A joint statement by Identità and JobsPlus said authorities have not issued any work permits for new applications in the cab industry, adding that it was the agency’s practice to issue the “blue paper”.
 “As with any other workers, TCNs applying for a change of employer application are provided with an interim receipt, commonly known as the ‘blue paper’, a procedure that has been in place for many years. This document is revoked once a final decision regarding their application is made.”
 The policy was introduced to allow workers already based in Malta to continue working and earning a salary while waiting for Identità’s decision.
 “Agius Trading” is one fleet that has been actively employing drivers since the government announced the policy change. The company is owned by Mark Agius, known by many as ‘Ta’ Dirjanu’, and his siblings Joseph and Maria.
 Agius is a close business partner of Gozitan mega-developer Joseph Portelli. 
 Replying to questions, a spokesperson for Agius Trading said the company has been forced to employ workers using temporary work permits to keep operations going.
 “Agius Trading owns 200 cabs and, like other cab companies, is facing serious challenges in the industry due to an overnight change in regulations,” the spokesperson said.
 They said the company’s policy has always been to employ drivers already in Malta who may wish to change employers for better rates.
 “However, the government has even stopped allowing ‘change of employer’ applications in this industry, which effectively puts us in the same dilemma as those who bring foreign workers from abroad for this industry,” the spokesperson said.
 “The only thing the government is allowing at the moment is for Identità to give two-month temporary work permits until it concludes its labour study and charts a way forward for the industry.
 ""Therefore, yes, cab drivers who are being employed with Agius Trading and other cab companies today are doing so on this ‘blue paper’, a temporary work permit that expires after two months.
 “This is obviously not an ideal way to plan your career or business, but this is the situation facing cab drivers and employers in Malta today.”
 IWS Global Limited, a company jointly owned by Chris Cardona and his business partner Matthias Vidergold, have also been actively hiring new employees.
 Times of Malta listened to phone calls between IWS representatives and TCNs who expressed interest in joining the company as drivers.
 IWS representatives confirmed they are actively hiring drivers in the calls.
 The caller asked if he should worry about the new government policy and if he would be impacted by the policy on the cab industry, but the IWS representative said he would not.
 IWS told the caller to tell any of his friends to apply with the company as well, either as cab drivers or food couriers.
 “Feel free to share my email with your colleagues,” the representative said, adding that the company “does not have a limit on the number of people they will hire”.
 In another call Times of Malta listened to, IWS confirmed that the company is hiring cab drivers, adding that Identità is likely to approve the application.
 “If you are eligible and you fulfil the criteria for the vacancy, ID Malta will not fail to give it to you,” another IWS representative told another caller.
 “If you have everything according to law, I don’t see why they will refuse your file or have any rejection.”
 The IWS representative said that the government is accepting applications for drivers who are changing their employers but remain in the industry.
 Identità sources confirmed this is not the case.
 Replying to questions specifically about IWS, Identità and JobsPlus confirmed that no work permits for cab drivers or food couriers were issued to IWS.
 “Like many other companies, IWS applied to employ workers in this sector; however, as with other fleet operators, no permit was granted. Identità and JobsPlus have issued various refusals, while other applications are still under review.”

Dog owners take part in charity walk around Mater Dei in memory of Jake Vella,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/dog-owners-take-part-charity-walk-around-mater-dei-memory-jake-vella.1102491,15-12-2024,"004995.png,004996.png,004997.png,004998.png","Dog owners and their furry friends took part in a charity walk around Mater Dei hospital on Sunday morning in honour of the late Jake Vella.
 Jake was just 15 when he died in August after a long battle with an extremely rare condition that caused him to gain weight rapidly despite eating healthily and training regularly.
 The teenager was an animal lover and received full-time care at Mater Dei during the last two years of his life, one marked by continued charity work.
 Sunday's walk in aid of the Association of Abandoned Animals (AAA) was the third annual 'Paw Walk' but the first to take place without Jake.
  Despite the cloudy and rainy weather, the entrance to Mater Dei Hospital was alive with the sound of excited dogs as the group prepared to get underway.
 Shortly before the walk began, an officer from the 'K-9' police dog unit marched to stand to attention in front of a banner of Jake before performing a salute – along with his dog. The officer later presented a Christmas card including a picture of Jake to his parents, Josie and Maruska Vella.
 Following words from Jake’s parents, Winter Moods singer Ivan Grech led a performance of Maltese favourite Xemx joined by those present.
 Speaking to Times of Malta, Jake’s mother Marouska said the pair were “very happy that despite the bad weather people came to join us” while thanking those in attendance for their “continuous support.”
  Commenting on Jake’s posthumous honour at Friday's 50th anniversary Republic Day celebrations, Jake’s father Josie said it was a surprise for the family, but that Jake deserved the award.
 ""We are very proud that our son, after his death, was honoured for Gieħ Ir-Repubblika... we think Jake was the youngest person to get the award in the past 10 years,” he said.
 Speaking about her son’s absence, Jake's mother said it was “not easy that Jake is not with us during these moments, but we are proud that what Jake started, we will continue.”
 Describing the event as Jake’s “dream”, she added the family intended to continue holding the walk every year.
 “We wish a good Christmas and New Year to the public. And we thank Malta and Gozo for all their support for our son.""
  Like last year, Sunday’s walk was in aid of the Organisation for Abandoned Animals (AAA), an NGO dog shelter in Birżebbuġa.
 AAA sanctuary manager Rosalind Agius said the walk “means a lot to us and is very helpful,” explaining the funds raised would go towards the upkeep of the centre.
 Paying tribute to the late teenager, she said ""Jake collected thousands for us every year and that’s a lot for anyone, let alone a young boy.""
 Walkers were joined by culture minister Owen Bonnici and fisheries junior minister Alicia Bugeja Said, with well-known animal activist and TV presenter Moira Delia and athlete Fabio Spiteri also in attendance.
 Describing Jake’s death as “heartbreaking,” attendee Laetitia Agius – a friend of the Vella family – said she joined the walk alongside her husband and son to honour Jake’s memory and to encourage others to join in.
 Dog owner Alison Caruana said she joined the walk to help contribute to animal causes, adding it was her second time joining the annual event.
 Organiser Joanna Mallia said, ""Jake loved animals, that's why we're doing this; We try to keep his memory alive.""
  Jake's neurological condition, known as Rapid-onset Obesity with Hypothalamic Dysfunction, Hypoventilation and Autonomic Dysregulation (ROHHAD), affects mostly children and there are only around 100 confirmed cases of it worldwide.
 The exact cause of ROHHAD remains unknown and research on it is inconclusive, though it is suspected to be linked to a combination of environmental and genetic factors.
 No specific gene has yet been identified as causing the condition, however.
 His death earlier this year provoked an outpouring of grief, with public figures including Prime Minister Robert Abela, his wife Lydia and European President Roberta Metsola among those to pay tribute to the late teenager.

‘Families of migrant children should be regularised’ - children's commissioner,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/families-migrant-children-regularised-children-commissioner.1097240,26-08-2024,005034.png,"The children’s commissioner has urged the government and its authorities to exercise caution when considering the deportation of migrant children and their families.
 In a statement on Monday, the Office of the Commissioner for Children said was “closely following” media reports of families facing deportation after living in Malta for years.
 On Saturday, Times of Malta reported the Ethiopian community was “ living in fear” after dozens of Ethopian nationals had been rounded up by police and sent back to Ethopia, despite living and working legally in Malta for up to 19 years.
 Calling for caution in the treatment of migrant children and their families, the commissioner said migrants who had settled in Malta and integrated into Maltese society “should be given a more definite and permanent status”.
 This was important to allow children to access their rights as prescribed by the United Nations (UN), including the right to education, the commissioner said.
 “Children who are born here, irrespective of their status, only know Malta as their home and therefore we believe that it is in the best interest of these migrant children for the status of the entire family unit to be regularised,” the commissioner said.
 It said such protection ""safeguards the children’s fundamental right to a family life.""
 The commissioner called for such regularisation to be extended to ""migrant children born in other countries but who have settled and integrated here whether or not they enjoy international protection.”
 ""No child should be made to live in fear of deportation; they have a right to live in a safe and secure environment”, the commissioner said.
 One Ethopian national told Times of Malta his community was being ""treated like criminals, like animals” and said he feared authorities knocking at his door.
 He said he was left scared after five of his friends were arrested at work and taken into detention following their application for refugee status being rejected.
 Until recently, they had temporary protection status and had a yellow book that allowed them to work legally. Some even had their own businesses.
 Responding to questions last week, the home affairs ministry said persons arriving in Malta irregularly who do not qualify for international protection are offered a voluntary return package.
 “If they refuse the voluntary return scheme, they are then subject to forced return, depending on the level of cooperation by the country of origin”, a ministry spokesperson said.
 The spokesperson added that actions taken affecting the Ethiopian community were in line with an EU decision to step up readmission efforts with the country following an assessment carried out by the European Commission.
 In January, migrants and activists took to the streets of Ħamrun and Valletta calling for policy changes that would grant migrants and their children born in Malta residency, social rights and stability.

 Caruana was born on April 22, 1946, in Ġżira and made his debut with Ġżira United in the second division when he was 16 years old, in a match against Mosta. 
  Several clubs expressed interest in Caruana at the start of his career, with rumours that he was going to be snatched up by Sliema Wanderers FC.
 However, in a surprising twist, Caruana ended signing with Floriana FC instead. Caruana was an immediate star with Floriana and played there for six seasons, winning two championships and two FA Trophies. 
 He would later leave Floriana and join Sliema in 1970. Despite only being with the club for a short time, Caruana saw the club win another two championships in his three seasons there. 
 He retired from playing professional football in 1974. 
 News of Caruana's death sparked several tributes, including from the Nationalist Party, for which he served as a local councillor.
 Last June, Caruana was once again elected to the Ġżira local council on the PN's ticket. 
 ""Hugh Caruana, aside from his illustrious sports career was a local councillor for the PN and until last June continued to work with a lot of love for Ġżira and the Nationalist Party"" the party said in a statement. 
 Christian Micallef, one of Caruana's former colleagues on the sports show Replay, said Caruana was a ""jokester with a heart of gold"". 
 ""My mind wanders back to the pleasant memories Hugh and I shared, particularly on the programme Replay,"" he said. 
  In a tribute post, Floriana FC said Caruana was one of the club's ""icons"". 
 ""Hugh Caruana left an indelible mark on our club's rich history both as a player and as a coach as his legacy will last forever in our hearts,"" they said. 
  Sliema Wanderers added that Caurana would always be remembered for the role he played in winning the club three consecutive Premier League titles in the early 2000s while serving as an assistant coach.

Activists demonstrate against 'cycle of exploitation' dairy industry,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/activists-demonstrate-cycle-exploitation-dairy-industry.1094337,22-06-2024,"005060.png,005061.png","Animal rights activists took to the streets of Valletta on Saturday in a theatrical demonstration against commercial dairy production.  
 Three female activists from Animal Liberation Malta could be seen wearing pumps attached to their breasts and holding up placards with slogans including “dairy is scary”, ”milk is not human(e)” and ""not your mother, not your milk”. 
 The protest took place at the Triton Fountain just outside the city gates, where activists demonstrated wearing chains, numbered ear tags and were smeared in fake blood. 
 The pumps worn by the female activists were connected by pipes to containers of what appeared to be milk, in symbolic reference to the commercial milking of cows and other animals used to produce dairy products.
 In a statement, Animal Liberation Malta said the “entire dairy industry is based on the exploitation of the reproduction system,” describing the collection of semen from bulls and subsequent artificial insemination of female cows “sexual abuse” and “rape”.
 Activists pointed to the slaughter of male calves and repeated impregnation of female cows as evidence of the “cycle of exploitation” they said defined the dairy industry.
  Attacking the tactics of the industry, Animal Liberation Malta said that while milk consumption was in “sharp decline globally, the dairy industry keeps growing by constantly pushing subsidised milk to be included in more and more products, even those that traditionally did not include any dairy.”
 Noting that “humans are the only animals that continuously consume milk from other animals and continue to consume milk throughout their lives,” the group urged the public to consider dairy-free alternatives.
 “Animal Liberation Malta highlights the fact that there is a compassionate, cruelty-free alternative to animal milk that is plant-based. Furthermore, plant-based milk is more environmentally friendly and natural to drink than milk from other species.”
 Activists from fellow animal rights group Anonymous for the Voiceless also took part in the protest.

MaltaPost finally accepts card payments - but not for everything,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/maltapost-introduces-card-payments-branches.1093061,28-05-2024,005331.png,"Card payments are finally being accepted for certain services in MaltaPost branches, the country’s national postal service has confirmed.
 Customers can now pay for stamps, stationery and postal fees by credit or debit card in branches across the country. 
 The change will be welcomed by customers who have long complained about being forced to pay with cash. 
 However, while certain services can now be paid for by card, bill payments, Western Union transfers, mobile phone top-ups and ‘One-4-All’ gift vouchers will remain cash-only. 
 When Times of Malta visited MaltaPost branches in St Julian’s and Birżebbuġa on Saturday, both confirmed they had started offering card payments recently. 
 When contacted, a spokesperson for the company said the roll-out of card payments had started late last year and had been completed in the last week.
 Asked why card payments had not been introduced sooner, the spokesperson said there had been “valid commercial reasons” for the delay, stressing it did not make business sense to do so earlier.
  Describing criticism of the company for not offering card payments sooner as “unfair”, the spokesperson said the company had eventually decided to “take the plunge”, however.
 He added that unlike other organisations such as banks, MaltaPost had retained all of its branches after the COVID-19 pandemic and was committed to “retaining a presence in the heart of the community.”
 
 He said the company operated around 40 post offices and an additional 20 sub-post offices across Malta and employed around 300 postal delivery workers nationwide.
 A report published last month found most MaltaPost users are satisfied with the services provided by the postal company and would even be willing to pay extra for stamps if the company used that money for green initiatives.
 A survey carried out by the communications regulator late last year showed that 72% of respondents said they were satisfied or very satisfied with the country’s postal service.
 Meanwhile, just 15% of respondents said they had lodged complaints with MaltaPost, compared to the high 34% complaint rate registered in a similar survey in 2021.

Broadcasting Authority tells critics they didn’t ‘read the law’ on RTK decision,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/broadcasting-authority-tells-critics-didn-t-read-law-rtk-decision.1097167,23-08-2024,005355.png,"The Broadcasting Authority has hit back at critics lambasting it for fining a radio station that refused to give a platform to a far-right group, saying that its detractors ""haven't read the law"". 
 On Wednesday the BA fined RTK 103 €4,660 for refusing to give a platform to the far-right party Imperium Europa on Andrew Azzopardi's Saturday morning radio show. 
 The party was founded by and is led by Norman Lowell, who has been convicted by Maltese courts of inciting racial hatred. 
 RTK 103 has said it will be appealing the decision, while groups such as PEN Malta and the IĠM have come out in support of the radio station and criticised the BA's decision. 
 PEN Malta said that through its decision the BA had ""legitimised racism as a political view"" while the IĠM called the decision ""nonsensical"" and that racism ought not to be protected by state authorities. 
 However, in reply to the backlash, the BA said on Friday that it ""follows the law, interprets the law as it is and enacts what is in the law"". 
 ""It is clear that what was broadcast across several media platforms shows that those reporting and criticising did not read the law in the context of the decision and didn’t read the decision in its entirety,"" they said. 
 The authority said that its decision never spoke about giving space to any candidates of any party, including those from Imperium Europa, as the law speaks about ""viewpoints"" and not about candidates. 
 ""Therefore every observation and criticism should be oriented towards this context,"" they said. 
 The BA added that the board's secretary has no decision-making role within the board and that it is not true that the secretary refused to recuse himself. 
 The board secretary, Adriano Spiteri, was until recently an active member of Imperium Europa. 
 ""The authority denies that the secretary did not want to recuse himself but it was the board which decided about the request for his recusal, a fact which is also listed in the decision,"" they said.

I published a book about him and his work, and I cherish his personal album in which he pasted a copy of every postcard he marketed. Or thought he did – I found a few he missed placing in it.
 Fürst (1888-1964) came to Malta to work as secretary in the German consulate and married a Maltese lady. During World War I, the British interned him as an enemy alien and he picked up painting and photography in the Verdala prisoner-of-war camps. After the hostilities, he came back to Malta as a professional photographer, artist and postcard publisher, until the eve of WWII, when he was denied permission to return to the island.
  As an artist, he mostly painted sailing ships – clippers, cutters, galleons, schooners. In photography, he widened his interests, though the sea remained his consuming love. Fürst scoured the harbours, shooting sailing vessels and warships with his Agfa camera, to the point that he raised alarming suspicion of being a Nazi spy. Though he admired Hitler openly, it is unlikely he worked for German espionage – after the war, Lord Mountbatten warmly encouraged his return to Malta.
  Fürst’s affinity to sails translated into a vast output of postcards in which sailing vessels strike a lyrical note. I have, very randomly, chosen a few from the many. No other camera artist, before or after him, had captured the wedding of the winds and the waters with such poetry as Fürst did in the 1930s.

MOAS marks 10 years of saving lives,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/moas-marks-10-years-saving-lives.1097187,24-08-2024,"005252.png,005253.png","An NGO that launched the first privately-funded migrant search and rescue operation in the Mediterrnean turns 10 this month.
 MOAS, or the Migrant Offshore Aid Station, says it has rescued over 200,000 people around the world since it first began operations in August 2014.
 Having initially focused on aid missions in the Mediterranean, MOAS has since expanded to provide support in the Aegean Sea, Bangladesh and now Ukraine, where it medically evacuates severely wounded patients from the war’s frontline.
 Ten years since MOAS’ inception I look back with admiration at all we have achieved, but I also know that we still have much to do, and we need to continue to forge ahead if we are to have the greatest impact possible in the field,” said founder Christopher Catrambone.“On this our 10
 MOAS began operating in the Mediterranean with its flagship vessel the Phoenix. It would rescue over 40,000 people from the sea in the ensuing three years. Before long, other NGO-led sea rescue operations were following its lead.
 In 2017, the organisation shifted its focus to Bangladesh, where Rohingya refugees were making their way after fleeing Myanmar. MOAS established field clinics in refugee camps and delivered food aid. The NGO says it aided over 90,000 people there and has trained over 12,000 volunteers in Bangladesh to respond to weather emergencies and fire hazards.
 The NGO has also delivered food aid and medical supplies to Yemen, Somalia and Sudan.
 During the COVID-19 pandemic, it shifted to producing and distributing face masks: almost 900,000 masks were distributed in Bangladesh and around 10,000 in Malta.
  The NGO maintains a Malta link through various education and integration projects it runs for migrants and asylum seekers.
 Since the Ukraine conflict outbreak in 2022, MOAS has worked with 150 medical professionals and a fleet of 50 ambulances to rescue and treat the war wounded. It says it has saved 45,000 lives and treated over 30,000 patients through its Mobile Medical Unit, in collaboration with Ronald McDonald House Charities Latvia.
 The NGO has also launched a book, “Sirens of Hope”, that delves deeper into its Ukraine work as part of a series of activities to commemorate its 10th year in operation.

Church organisations call for detained Ethiopians to be released immediately,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/church-organisations-call-detained-ethiopians-released-immediately.1097370,29-08-2024,"005290.png,005291.png,005292.png","Updated 4pm 
 The Ethiopian nationals who are being detained and facing deportation after having lived and worked legally in Malta for years should be released immediately, the Migrants Commission, the Justice and Peace Commission and JRS Malta urged the authorities.
 The two commissions, which form part of the Archdiocese of Malta, and JRS Malta issued a joint statement in which they “wholeheartedly condemned” the recent arrest of several Ethiopian nationals, who were rounded up, detained and told they would be sent back to Ethiopia.
 
 They called on all Members of Parliament, especially the Social Affairs Committee, to convene and discuss this matter with urgency so that, in collaboration with civil society organisations, they could find a solution that respected individual rights and safeguarded every member of our society.
 In a separate call, 38 civil society organisations urged the government to regularise the position of people whom it had allowed to make Malta their home. 
 Last week Times of Malta reported how the  Ethiopian community is “in shock” and “living in fear” as a number of people who have been living and working legally in Malta for up to 19 years, were being arrested at their place of work.
 At least five were arrested and sent to detention and told they would be sent back to Ethiopia. 
 They were told that their application for refugee status had been rejected. Until now, they had temporary protection status and had a yellow book that allowed them to work legally. Some even had their own businesses and started a family.
 The children’s commissioner has urged the government and its authorities to exercise caution when considering the deportation of migrant children and their families.
 Lawyers who work with migrants said that, whenever people of a particular nationality are rounded up, it typically means that a delegation from that country is on the way to Malta.
 The delegation would typically include government officials who would facilitate deportation by providing travel documents after verifying the origin of the people in detention.
 The Home Affairs Ministry said persons arriving in Malta irregularly who do not qualify for international protection are offered a voluntary return package.
 “If they refuse the voluntary return scheme, are then subject to forced return, depending on the level of cooperation by the country of origin. The Ethiopian nationals you are referring to have been detained in order to safeguard their return to Ethiopia, following positive signals from the Ethiopian authorities related to cooperation on the safe readmission of their own nationals,” the ministry said, adding that this course of action follows a decision at EU level to step up readmission efforts with Ethiopia following an assessment carried out by the European Commission.
 But many criticised the method used. Katrine Camilleri, from JRS Malta, said: ""Picking up people from their homes and workplaces, or from the streets, without notice, and locking them up, often for weeks, until they can meet a visiting delegation who will interview them, determine whether they are nationals, and decide whether to issue the documents required to send them back, is a horribly painful and humiliating process for the people involved.”
  She said that these people have not committed any crime - on the contrary many worked legally and paid tax and social security contributions.
 “They are treated like criminals, handcuffed every time they need to leave the facility where they are being held, and deprived of all control over their lives. Even if they are not sent back, they risk losing their job, or having their rent contract revoked, because they cannot work or pay rent while they are in detention. If they are sent, they are deprived of the opportunity to sort out their affairs with dignity, because it is impossible to do that from the confines of a detention centre…
 ""Given the harm that detention causes, and the inherent harshness and violence of this course of action, even where it is in accordance with the law, it is impossible not to ask whether there is a more humane way of dealing with people, using deprivation of liberty only as a measure of last resort where there is truly no other option,” she said.
 In the joint statement, the Church in Malta urged the authorities to create realistic pathways to regularisation for these Ethiopians and other individuals. 
 “We consider these recent actions to be unjust, indiscriminate and cruel and call upon the government to immediately release these individuals and to regularise their position,” the entities said.
 The three entities said these Ethiopians were being targeted under the pretext of having come to Malta irregularly to seek asylum, which at the time was not granted. Despite this, most spent years living and working with the knowledge and authorisation of the authorities, who granted them employment licences, and residence permits.  
  Over the years they have contributed to society and become an integral part of the community, paying their taxes and social solidarity contributions.
 “They are valued and trained employees, whose experience will be hard to replace. They are our neighbours, our colleagues, our friends, the people who greet us in the street, who care for our elderly relatives, and cleaned our hospital wards during the COVID-19 pandemic,” the entities said.
 These incidents are the latest in a series of raids, which saw the lives of tens of migrants who had made Malta their home upended without warning and locked up so that preparations could be made to send them to their country of origin, they said.
 Beyond the impact such actions had on these persons, it created a climate of fear and insecurity for members of society who over the past years contributed to everyone’s well-being.
 ""These actions are constant reminders by the State of how easily it can arbitrarily and indiscriminately trample over all the accomplishments these members of society achieved through their hard work and sacrifices,"" they said.
 In a statement on Thursday afternoon, 38 civil society groups, university faculties and writers urged the government to regularise people whom the government allowed to make Malta their home.
 ""The five arrested men have had their lives uprooted without any warning. They were forced to leave their jobs, homes, friendships, and belongings behind.
 ""Within minutes, their lives were rewound as they were taken away to the same place where they had first encountered Malta so many years ago: a detention centre. There, procedures are underway to send them back to a country they barely know, where their support system may be non-existent, and where they may be at risk of harm.""
 This has had a ""devastating impact"" not only on the arrested people but on whole communities, including neighbours, colleagues, partners, schoolmates and friends.
 ""They are one of us and Malta is also their home. We appeal to the government to create a pathway to regularisation for these and other rejected asylum-seekers who have lived and worked in Malta for years with the authorisation of the competent authorities.""
 They said something similar had been done in other EU states.
 They urged the government to release the Ethiopian detainees, and people of good will to stand against the inhumane practice of rounding up people who have built their lives here and have become, in more ways than one, part of who we are.

But the rest of the island has not been spared time’s erosion of its history. A number of its foremost structures had to pay the ultimate price to real or perceived progress.
  The unrelenting blitz of World War II, besides Valletta, targeted mercilessly the three antique harbour cities and their surroundings, like Marsa and Kalkara, and the exigencies of defence sacrificed other outstanding edifices, like Gourgion palace, in Gozo, and Chateau Bertrand, in Ta’ Qali.
  Genuine progress in transport and communications found no way of saving the narrow baroque entrances to fortified cities. Not one single decorated gate of Valletta of the knights has survived – all demolished.
  Same for Floriana. Porte des Bombes has suffered modifications at least five times, to render it unrecognisable. 
  And the massive Notre Dame and St Anne’s gates had to be obliterated, to facilitate the flow of traffic.
 And we must mercifully overlook the ‘accidental’ collision by a service truck that destroyed the original Fleur-de-Lys gate that was slowing down heavy military vehicles.
  Malta never took on board with genuine passion art nouveau architecture, like Vienna, Prague, Turin or Budapest had done, becoming world shrines for the new aesthetic. But Sliema did put in some effort to catch up in the first quarter of the 20th century. Creditable landmarks stood out, with refined art nouveau detailing, like Casa Said, the Chalet and the Meadowbank Hotel, among others. 
  Apart from Balluta Buildings, in St Julian’s and the Lombard Bank branch, in Tower Road, virtually all the others have been razed to the ground, to make way for fletsijiet u penthowsis with a sea view.
  This is the fifth feature about prominent landmarks that somehow define Malta and that, for a variety of reasons, have now gone missing.
 My final two-part series documents instances, outside Valletta and Gozo, of what Malta has lost. Some vanished in World War II but the robust contributions of insensitive reconstruction and of ‘development by metastasis’, should never be underestimated. It’s only fair to credit where credit is due.
  This, to some, may sound like nostalgia for fuddy duddies. But Malta was never another of the hundreds of odd islands dotting the Mediterranean. 
 The neolithic people and the Order of St John had imprinted on it a unique, unrepeatable and spectacular cultural profile, which made it outshine every other small detached land mass in Europe. Without them, Malta would have been another forgettable Pantelleria or Lampedusa.
  So why this hysterical rush to inter our main claims to civility? Several neolithic sites, like Corradino, were destroyed by deliberate vandalism or institutional neglect.
 The systems of fortifications left by the Order (like the impressive Valletta lines outside city gate), which are absolutely unique in Europe for might and elegance, have frequently and joyfully been flattened out, a lust that failed to spare even British fortifications like the Victoria Lines and the forts excavated in the bowels of cliff masses.
  The Vandals ravaged the rest of Europe in the fifth century AD. They postponed their conquest of Malta to a later date. 
 Are these vanished landmarks just the tip of the iceberg? That would be an exaggeration. But I only illustrated losses of which I had photographs in my collections.

Military Malta was probably also one of the most photographed.
  Compatibly with security defence regulations, which banned camera use in public spaces, authorised photographers recor­ded thousands of images of warfare – armed personnel, dogfights, maritime convoys, demolition units, anti-aircraft gunnery, military sports. You name it. These have, justly, found their place in many published war memoirs.
  The same cannot be said of images of everyday life in wartime. Very few photographs seem to have been taken or to have survived – a rarity indeed. 
 We know that, more or less, life of the inhabitants went on, notwithstanding the daily bombings, the dangers, destructions, racketeers, famines, terrors, underground shelters, epidemics and black markets. But we know this mostly through written and oral tradition, not through visual representations. 
  I thought it my duty to put together as many images as possible of civilian life in Malta under the blitz and to break my rule of limiting any one subject to just one self-contained feature. In this special case, I intend to spread my collection over two or three instalments. I trust readers will agree that it would be unsociable to hide rare historic treasures, many never published before.
  The quality of the images will vary. Some come from scans of pristine real photographs while others are copies I had lifted from rare printed publications. Most of the people who appear in them have passed, with possible exceptions of some of the youngest children.
  I salute the ‘natives’ and celebrate their memories, their endurance, resilience and stoicism. Without them, Malta’s survival against murderous Nazism and fanatical Fascism would have been unthinkable.
   I have already commented on the abundance of wartime photographs of military activities and on the scarcity of images of the everyday life of the people besieged. The same imbalance scars most of the written memoirs of Malta’s battles for survival. Countless narratives, the majority by British authors, record the terrible war years, with candour, with vainglory, with chilling humour, with defiance.
  But most of the storytellers leave the impression of having won the war in a country virtually devoid of any indigenous population. The Maltese, if at all, feature only as background noise, unsuitable for the loud festival of British self-congratulation.
  To learn how we natives lived the second world war, narratives by local authors have to be tapped; to mention some who come to mind: Philip Vella, Charles J. Boffa, Michael Galea, Joseph Micallef and Charles B. Grech. Their testimonies remains invaluable. Ernle Bradford too has an excellent and sympathetic account but not as an eyewitness. 
  The only outstanding British narrative of Malta in the second world conflict in which the Maltese figure as major players remains the one by Stewart Perowne, author, historian and diplomat. What a breath of honest fresh air to find a member of the British intelligence services, no less, paying a grovelling tribute to the faultless Maltese wartime internees and deportees to Uganda and castigating the colonialist abuses they suffered, already amply denounced by His Majesty’s judges before him.
  I am today publishing a second batch of photographs of ‘ordinary’ life during an extraordinarily cruel siege. Nothing boldly heroic, nothing epic – just images of struggles for survival, of the ability to adjust to adversity, to meet death as routine and the exceptional as normality.
   More images of beleaguered Malta struggling for survival against lethal odds during the Fascist and Nazi blitz. Torrents of bombs conspired with famine and malnutrition, with dearth of fuel and nasty epidemics to cheat life, not of glamour but of hope.
  Some memories stick out more than others – the ubiquitous rationing of virtually everything, from foodstuffs to clothing, from toys to cosmetics, from petrol to cigarettes, from overseas postal services to radios.
  The precious ‘ration book’, the exorbitant black market, hand-me-down clothing, the town and village Victory kitchens that doled out inedible gruel that claimed some remote acquaintance with goats’ meat, over which interminable queues squabbled, and the governor proudly on air to announce a handful of beans as a Christmas bonus.
  And then the epidemics; some the results of chronic malnutrition. Waves of scabies, scarlet fever, rickets, bubonic plague, scurvy, infestations of lice, infantile paralysis, substitute medicines and the first mentions of mysterious antibiotics.
  New crimes appeared on the official statute book – listening to enemy radio, hoarding edibles, unauthorised photography, black marketeering, harbouring draft dodgers and visible lights at nighttime. And the unofficial ones too, like speaking Italian, defeatist propaganda, humming Italian opera or driving German cars. Other laws seem to have been suspended: Italian and German pilots parachuting from stricken enemy planes routinely lynched on landing; no prosecutions are recorded.
  Any life that could shifted underground. At first, huge communal shelters like disused railway tunnels or basements of large public buildings turned into makeshift dormitories, before private rock dugouts became widespread.
 
 Daily and nightly, the besieged cooked, gossiped, played, slept, prayed and made love in the bowels of the earth, while the Macchis and the Junkers pranced overhead.

Ex-Paralympian praises food courier for act of kindness,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/former-paralympian-praises-stranger-act-kindness-car-breakdown.1097923,09-11-2024,"005636.png,005637.png","A former Paralympian has taken to social media to underline how a small act of kindness can go a long way after a stranger went out of his way to help him change his tyre.
 On Tuesday evening, Thomas Borg was driving home when he hit a pothole, which tore his tyre in the Ta’ Kandja area of Siġġiewi.
 The 22-year-old sales representative and former Paralympian, who participated in the Tokyo 2020 Games, pulled over and began fixing the tyre.
 It was a slow process for Borg, who was born without a right forearm.
 In the 30 minutes it took him to lift the car, hundreds of cars drove past.
 “All of a sudden a food delivery man pulled up next to me on a motorcycle,” he told Times of Malta.
 The driver was Hajat from Pakistan, who had just finished his shift and told Borg he wanted to help him. Hajat lifted the car, replaced the tyre and packed everything back once he was done. 
 “While he was working, we began chatting, and he told me about his life, how life is difficult back in Pakistan, and how he tries to help his family by sending money back to them,” he said. 
 The pair spoke about life in Malta, different cultures and what unites them.
  Borg was moved by Hajat's kindness and willingness to help a stranger. 
 “Just like me, Hajat had a long day at work, and he could have continued driving home to rest, but instead he stopped to help me, a stranger,” Borg said.
 At a point, Borg tried to pay Hajat for his kind gesture, but he refused. Instead, they posed for a picture. 
 Borg said he feels society fears the unknown and people have stopped trying to learn about those who are different from them.
 “We have stopped being kind to one another, we have stopped going out of our way to help others,” he said.
 “But today I was reminded that kindness knows no boundaries. Hajat didn’t help me because of where he’s from, he helped me because that’s simply who he is - a kind and generous person.”
 He said he decided to share his experience on the popular Facebook page Are you being Served? to remind others to be a little kinder to one another.
 “Smile at someone, lend a hand if you see someone in need, and remember that we’re all neighbours here,"" he wrote.
 The post received hundreds of comments and was flooded with praise for both Borg and Haya. Some people said it was the best post they had seen all day.
 “What a beautiful lesson! This should make us think deeper, judge people less hastily, respect everybody and be kinder whenever and wherever necessary,” one person commented. 
 Others commented that they knew Hayat and described him as a man with a “golden heart” and a “top guy”.
 “Thank you for reminding us that kindness goes a long long way,” another said.
 Borg said he hopes the post will inspire others to do something kind.

‘I fled to Malta after Assad’s army killed my village. Now I dream of home’,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/i-fled-malta-assad-army-killed-village-now-i-dream-home.1102464,15-12-2024,"005711.png,005712.png","A Syrian refugee who was forced into military service under Bashar al-Assad’s regime dreams of returning home to Syria after more than a decade of building a life in Malta.
 Since arriving in Malta in 2013, Maher Ibrahim has built a family and a successful business, Ta’ Vera Paints and Building Materials, in Tarxien. 
 “I have been here for 11 years. At this point, I feel Maltese,” Ibrahim said.
 Raised in Al-Sukhnah, a small town about 70 kilometres from the ancient city of Palmyra, Ibrahim once aspired to become a computer engineer. However, those dreams were shattered when he was conscripted into the Syrian army after finishing secondary school. 
 “If I said I didn’t want to be in the army, I would have been sent to prison, and this is nothing like a Maltese prison; it is much, much worse,” he said.
  Ibrahim recounted stories he had heard about the brutal conditions in Sednaya prison, infamous for its reports of torture, starvation and rape. The tipping point for Ibrahim and his family came after his return from military service when Assad’s soldiers entered his village. 
 “As they arrived, people went to welcome them, but they ended up killing them all. I thought, if you’re willing to kill those who welcomed you, what would stop you from killing me?” he said.
 Thousands of people from Al-Sukhnah left the town after that to find safety nearby, including Ibrahim and his family. However, his family knew they would not remain safe for long and slowly, one by one, each member of Ibrahim’s family fled towards the Turkish border without passports or identification.
 From Turkey, he took a boat to Greece where eventually he boarded a plane to Malta, where he has lived ever since.
 “Maltese people have opened their hearts to me and my community, and I am incredibly grateful,” Ibrahim said, expressing profound appreciation for the island’s hospitality.
 As well as setting up a business, he and his Syrian wife married in Malta and their two daughters were born in the country.
  With the fall of Assad’s regime, Ibrahim’s thoughts have turned to reuniting with his family, who are now scattered across the globe – cousins in Malta, a brother in Saudi Arabia and a sister in Qatar. 
 “I felt like a bird finally being released from a cage on Sunday,” he said.
 “I woke up scared every day for me and my family. Now I feel free.”
 However, despite his elation, Ibrahim remains cautious about the future. His dream is to return to a safe and rebuilt Syria, where his young daughters can thrive. 
 “I don’t want a country run by soldiers or the sons of soldiers. I want to see Syria as a democracy, led by professionals and businessmen who can rebuild the country positively,” he said.
 But while Syrians are planning a cautious return home, some of the local reaction to the regime downfall has been dispiriting. 
 Omar Rababah, a Maltese-Syrian human rights activist, took to social media to express his joy about the future. But his post was littered with racist comments saying the Syrian community should now go back to their own country. 
 “The reaction didn’t totally surprise me,” Rababah, who was raised in Malta, said. 
 He said they are told to go back to their country or similar cruel comments every year when there’s traffic because of people heading to the Mosque for Eid prayers.
 “Sometimes it feels like we’re their favourite punching bag,” he said.
 “Judgmental people make sure to leave their two cents, and that’s what it is more than anything: judgement and a lack of understanding.”

Floriana’s largest wartime shelter rediscovered,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/floriana-largest-wartime-shelter-rediscovered.1093052,31-05-2024,"005772.png,005773.png,005774.png","When freelance researcher Steve Mallia was approached by the Floriana local council to work on a project on a school well, the last thing he thought he would find was the locality’s largest shelter.
 Spanning from the Floriana primary school to the end of the granaries, the shelter had not been accessed for six to seven decades.
 “We found it by pure chance and coincidence,” said Mallia, who specialises in Maltese reservoirs.
 Working underground on the project a few weeks ago, he first noticed markings on a wall that looked like the entrance to a shelter.  After asking permission from the council, he reopened the entrance and was amazed at the discovery. 
 “Thousands of people pass through Floriana every day, and no one has any idea about the world that exists below them,” he said of what the Department of Public Works calls the largest shelter in Floriana. 
 A few days later, he was joined by Conrad Neil Gatt, a photographer and amateur historian, who filmed their experience traversing the shelter for his YouTube channel.
 As they entered the shelter, they found stairs and a long, narrow passageway with a series of small wall shrines, stalagmites and stalactites. 
 They came across multiple wall carvings dating to World War II, old Portanier Trufruit bottles and a room painted black. 
   “It was painted with black tar to help lower the humidity because this room was used by the church to store some of their most precious items during the war because St Publius church was heavily bombed,” Mallia explained.
 The shelter also has a rarely seen feature – it is split into two levels. 
 Mallia said: “I have been inside hundreds of shelters, but I have never seen one like this.” 
  As they traversed the lower level, which would also have been used to shelter people in the war, they found around 70-80cm of water in some sections.
 “Because of special confined spaces like that, you always need to bring a gas detector and, most importantly, a friend. When I enter a shelter, I want to keep going until I reach the end and hit a wall. It can be dangerous, but I will take that risk.”
 The shelter has 30 rooms and can accommodate around 400 people. However, Mallia believes it could hold another 400 in the lower level as well. 
 Mallia and Gatt hope the shelter will be cleaned and restored so people can access it at least once a year, an ambition endorsed by Floriana mayor Vince Borg. 
 Borg said the shelter still needs to be cleaned and safety checks carried out. Still, if everything goes according to plan, he would like to see it open for the public this coming October in time for the council event Ġenna ta’ Ġonna, a yearly open day in Floriana for people to enjoy and appreciate their public gardens and cultural heritage.

Watch: Chicken nugget record-breaking team bite off more than they can chew,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/watch-chicken-nugget-recordbreaking-team-bite-off-chew.1101166,17-11-2024,"005815.png,005816.png,005817.png","An attempt to break the Maltese record for the most chicken nuggets eaten in 20 minutes ended in disappointment on Sunday after a team of seven fell short by 24 nuggets.
 Overseen by national records organisation The Malta Records, Sunday’s challenge saw seven men face off against 350 chicken nuggets in a garage in Siġġiewi, cheered on by family and friends.
 However, despite giving it everything they had, the team only managed 215 nuggets – not a poultry effort, but, alas, not enough to beat the existing record of 238 set by an Mġarr team in 2019.
 The endeavor was instigated by Tyrone Debono, who suggested to his friends they attempt the feat as a fun team activity in honour of his upcoming thirtieth birthday and to raise funds for animal shelters.
 So, after a trial run a few weeks ago, when the team claimed to have managed 250 nuggets, they contacted Jeffrey Saliba at The Malta Records and set a date for the attempt.
  On Sunday afternoon the table was set, equipped with condiments, napkins, water and seven trays of 50 recently air-fried chicken nuggets, one for each contestant.
 “One of the main rules is that during the 20 minutes, they cannot stand up... within that, they can do whatever they want; add salt, pepper, mayonnaise, ketchup – but they cannot stand up,” explained Saliba before the attempt.
 Before the event started, Saliba counted all the chicken nuggets and made sure they each measured 6cm by 4cm in line with competition rules.
 Speaking before the attempt, team captain Daniel Debattista said the team was “excited and a little bit hungry,” adding that while they had not followed any kind of training regimen, they had decided not to eat anything that day.
 Meanwhile, standing supportively on the sidelines, Debono’s mother-in-law said her son-in-law and his teammates were “very brave.”
  After a quick countdown, the attempt got underway to cheers and applause from the watching group of around 20 family members and friends, who kept up a barrage of encouragement – and some teasing: ""You’re going too slowly!”
 Towards the end of the attempt, members of the team could be seen breathing heavily, staring down at their tray of defiant nuggets as they battled to complete the challenge.
 
 But it was not to be.
 After 20 minutes of competitive eating, time was called and the remaining nuggets counted; with 125 remaining, the team had missed beating the record by 24, equivalent to less than four nuggets each.
 Reflecting on the failed attempt, Debattista said ""it was tough... far more difficult than you'd expect,” adding that the nuggets used in the record-breaking attempt were of a firmer consistency than those the group had used for the practice attempt.
  Stressing the activity had been a fun one, however, the 30-year-old said, “it’s an experience we will remember forever, maybe we’ll try it again in a year’s time.”
 Debattista and Debono were joined by 30-year-old Christian Gafa, 34-year-old Norbert Galea, 29-year-old Luke Vella and Gareth Azzopardi and Duane Azzopardi, both 31 years old.
 Will the team members ever be able to eat another chicken nugget after Sunday?
 “Yes, for sure, but not this week,” said Galea.
 And while the group’s failed attempt must have been a bitter nugget to swallow, it will have come as good news to others. Saliba said three band clubs were eyeing the group's bid with a view to beating their score should they have managed to break the record. 
 Should the team attempt the feat again, they may be well placed to expand their personnel; in 2013, Roberto Rizzo consumed two metres of raw Maltese sausage before finishing off an 18-inch pizza in 30 minutes the following day, according to The Malta Records.

Olympics controversy: 'Judge not according to the appearance' - French embassy,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/olympics-controversy-judge-according-appearance-french-embassy.1096055,30-07-2024,005924.png,"The French embassy has reacted to dismay in some quarters over a scene in the Olympics opening ceremony seen as mocking the Last Supper, quoting the artistic producer saying that was not what was being depicted.
 The conference of French bishops, as well as Malta's Archbishop Charles Scicluna were among those who condemned the scene.
 The archbishop even urged the public to write to the French ambassador in Malta to raise their objections. 
 In a statement, the French embassy said it was sorry that Christians felt offended by the dinner scene where some believed they detected a parody of the Last Supper.
 The embassy added a quote from St John saying: “Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment”.
  The embassy then quoted the ceremony's artistic director explaining how the scene did not depict the Last Supper at all.
 ""So no, it wasn't my inspiration. In fact, I think it was quite clear that Dionysus was coming to the table. Why Dionysus? Because he is first and foremost the god of celebration in Greek mythology, and the painting is called ""Les Festivités"". He is the god of wine, an important symbol in France, and the father of Sequana, the goddess linked to the river Seine. (...) You will never find in me any desire to mock or denigrate. I wanted to organise a ceremony that would repair and reconcile, and that would reaffirm the values of our Republic: liberty, equality and fraternity"".
 The embassy said France was proud of its heritage and patrimony: it watched in horror as the cathedral of Notre-Dame in Paris burned down, and is following with emotion the stages of its reconstruction.
 France, it said, was also the country of free thought, secularism, the freedom to believe and the freedom not to believe. As such, the country cherished the freedom of creation, the freedom that guided the opening ceremony of the Paris 2024 Olympic Games.

Luqa local council opposes crematorium close to Addolorata cemetery,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/luqa-local-council-opposes-crematorium-close-addolorata-cemetery.1100336,31-10-2024,006112.png,"The Luqa local council has added its voice to that of the Paola council and is objecting to a proposal to build a crematorium on private land close to the Addolorata cemetery.
 Earlier this month, the Paola local council filed its objections to PA/05280/21 after holding an urgent council meeting to discuss the latest developments with its architect, Jesmond Mugliett. Mugliett had originally filed the council’s representation to the project in 2021.
 The council’s objection comes after Times of Malta reported how the island’s first crematorium could be up and running within two years. Johann Camilleri, whose company is behind the application to develop the first crematorium, said his team was revising plans submitted three years ago.
 Now, the team is downsizing its original plans for a 700-square metre site to one of 500 square metres, the maximum allowed by the new policy. 
 The changes were discussed by the Luqa local council this week.
 In a statement issued on Thursday, the local council said it opposed the project as the pollution caused by the crematorium was detrimental to the locality's residents.
 ""The local council is calling for an Environmental Impact Assessment because Luqa cannot take any more air pollution and soot.
 ""Luqa is already surrounded by industrial areas and hosts the Malta International Airport. The existing aeroplanes' noise pollution and vehicle pollution are substantial, and something that residents are still suffering from.""

‘Genuine refugees are protected’ Camilleri says as migrants face deportation,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/genuine-refugees-protected-camilleri-says-migrants-face-deportation.1101304,21-11-2024,006012.png,"There are several safeguards in Malta’s asylum system to ensure that those who are denied refugee status really do not merit asylum, Home Affairs Minister Byron Camilleri has insisted.  
 He was speaking following a Times of Malta interview with Yosuf Ahmed Adam, one of several  Ethiopian migrants who have been detained since August and told they will be deported to their home country as they cannot be granted refugee status. 
 Adam, who has lived in Malta for 13 years, told Times of Malta that returning him to Ethiopia in a region plagued by conflict could mean he would be killed or imprisoned.   
 Camilleri said the procedures followed by the International Protection Agency, including an appeals process and recourse to the courts, ensured that genuine refugees were not deported.  
 “The decision on refugee status is based on whether one would have left a country because of war or other factors - such as being gay or following a religion that will lead to consequences,” Camilleri said.  
  And once the agency takes its decision, it is subject to an appeal and the courts, he said.  
 Anyone who qualifies as a refugee will be helped, Camilleri said, but anyone who does not should be sent back. Not doing so would encourage more people to make the perilous crossing across the Mediterranean, the home affairs minister said. 
 “Should we have policies that incentivise irregular sea crossings via smugglers that lead to a large proportion of deaths? Should we have policies that turn the Mediterranean into more of a cemetery?” he asked.  
 Ensuring that people who did not qualify as refugees were returned meant that fewer people crossed the Mediterranean and there were fewer deaths.  
 He stressed that this was a policy followed across Europe and home affairs ministers of the 27 EU member states were constantly pushing the European Commission to focus more on irregular migration returns.  
 
 This group of Ethiopians are being returned to their country through an EU initiative, Camilleri said.  
 Over 900 asylum seekers have been returned to their country in the last four years after their asylum applications were rejected.  
 Some returned voluntarily, and others were forced to do so, he added. 
 Asked about Adam’s case, in the context that he had learnt Maltese and contributed to the labour market for 13 years, Camilleri said it was not a shortcoming of the state when a long time elapsed before migrants were returned.
 When a person refused to cooperate and return voluntarily, there were delays from some countries for the forced repatriation,” Camilleri said.  
 “The fact that you did not cooperate, in my opinion, should not lead to other decisions,” he said.  
 Camilleri said that the Ethiopians have been kept in detention since August because of court proceedings from their end.  
 “They can leave tomorrow if they want to, but because there are proceedings in court, there is some delay. Everything revolves around cooperation; you can keep forcing delays, but eventually, there will be the same decision”.  
 Home Affairs shadow minister Darren Carabott said asylum proceedings should not take this long.  
 ""We stand firm with the fact that the law is clear on who is to be granted international protection, and those laws must be enforced - our country needs to show that our laws are respected and no one is at liberty to enter our country illegally,” he said.
 “However, the law also states that asylum applicants should be granted a decision in a 'reasonable' time, both during the initial proceedings with the protection agency but also in the subsequent appeals. The latter part - the 'reasonable' time for adjudication is where the government is falling short"". 
 The government had to ensure an expedited process and not allow asylum proceedings to take 13 years, Carabott said.  
 “Due to the government's failure to ensure such an efficient process, it has created a victim status,” Carabott said when reacting to Adams’s situation.

 Their good-humoured banter from dawn right through rush hour on Bay Radio helped thousands of people start their day or hold on to their senses as they were stuck in traffic jams.
 Yet, on Sunday, the duo, who recently became husband and wife, announced that their show had reached the end of its run.
 Their last show was actually at the beginning of August, shortly after their wedding.  
 But for the two presenters, the show was much more than just an average job.
 They journeyed within it from being complete strangers to colleagues, friends, and eventually, husband and wife. 
 “The show meant everything to us, it’s our baby so to speak. I started working on the show at 17, and now, I am married to my co-host,"" Ylenia told Times of Malta . 
 ""We joke now about how we never imagined that we would get together and marry. This programme saw us grow up together and was with us through different parts of our lives. It means so much to us.”
  The newlyweds said the decision to end the breakfast radio show was not their own. 
 “Radio management decided to change the schedule, and we were offered to host the afternoon show,” Daniel said.
 “But we felt it did not make sense to start a brand new afternoon show after we had such a good eight-year run on our morning show.”
 The decision came at the same time as a Broadcasting Authority survey, not for the first time, showed Bay Breakfast was the country’s most popular radio programme. 
 No farewell show was announced because the station wanted to keep the new schedule under wraps. A new breakfast show started on Monday.
  “We stopped hosting the show back in August, and many listeners thought we were just on a long honeymoon,” Daniel said. 
 “But once people saw we were back in Malta, Ylenia started to receive messages asking when we would return to the radio.”
 Ylenia said it was “bittersweet” to not host a farewell show, but said the couple ended on good terms with 89.7 Bay.
 The ending of their show coincided with the popular radio trio of Vibe FM Jonathan Abel, JD Patrick and Martina Zammit bidding farewell to The Morning Vibe programme after a decade of entertaining listeners. 
 Ylenia started to work with Daniel on the breakfast show after they hosted a New Year’s special show together. At the time, she had already worked for two years on the breakfast show, and Daniel was general manager at 89.7 Bay. 
 “They (the station) liked how we sounded together and decided to put us [together] on one show,” she recalled. 
 “It is very cute to think we shared our lives on this show,” she said. 
  She said the couple received thousands of messages from listeners when they announced they would no longer host the show.
 “Some even suggested we start a petition to host the show once again, imagine that,” she laughed. 
 She said her fondest memories were of charitable events the duo hosted, particularly a radio show that was on air for 33 hours. 
 For Daniel, one of his most cherished moments was when the duo were to announce they were an official couple in 2021.
 “It was a week when many people were speculating on social media whether we were a couple or not. Some people were also sharing pictures of us holding hands in Valletta,” he recalled. 
  “It was exciting to finally announce our relationship,"" he said
 “We were nervous because we didn’t know how the station would react,” Ylenia added. 
 Two years later, Daniel proposed to Ylenia during a Jonas Brothers concert, her favourite band. This July, the couple said 'I do'. 
 Both thanked their listeners for their support and love. 
 ""Every moment of the show was a great memory, and we couldn't have done it without the listeners,"" he said.
 Will the couple return on air? 
 ""We do plan to be back on air,"" Daniel said, with Ylenia asking listeners to keep an eye on their social media for updates.

 Jake battled a rare condition called ROHHAD (Rapid-onset Obesity with Hypothalamic Dysfunction, Hypoventilation, and Autonomic Dysregulation), and was known for his gratitude and kindness throughout his life.
 He died last week.
 His Saturday morning funeral began with a cortege of cyclists following his hearse from Mater Dei Hospital to Birzebbuġa in a commemorative ride, a tribute to the young athlete who defied his condition by competing in triathlons.
 Once there, friends and family carried his white coffin – inscribed with his last words ""Thank you Ma, thank you Dad"" – into the church, where dignitaries including Prime Minister Robert Abela and his wife Lydia, Opposition leader Bernard Grech, former President Marie-Louise Coleiro Preca, and other public figures were in attendance.
 Vella used the publicity he attracted to raise awareness for various causes, including charities that helped abandoned animals. His love for animals was evident in the final gesture at his funeral, where attendees were given small bags filled with treats for stray animals.
  In his memory, mourners wore white and bright colours.
 The poignant moment when Jake’s coffin was carried out of the church to the song You Raise Me Up left few dry eyes as mourners stood to applaud Vella, celebrating his life of courage and perseverance.
  Archbishop Charles Scicluna, who presided over the funeral service, described Jake as an extraordinary example of love and resilience.
  “We thank God for giving us such a kind-hearted Maltese youth who gives us courage, a sense of hope, and who makes us very proud,” the archbishop said.  "" For all of this, we thank you, Jake.""
 Carmen Mangion, Jake's nurse, encouraged attendees to be like Jake, ""who despite his own suffering worked tirelessly to help those in need.""
 A visibly emotional Lydia Abela said, ""Jesus watch over Josie and Maruska who were by Jake's side till his very last breath. Let them continue to hear Jake's last words and also look over other parents who lost their children.""
 President Emeritus Coleiro Preca used her speech to remind mourners about Jake's repeated pleas for peace.

"Jobsplus raids courier, cab firms amid employee abuse claims",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/jobsplus-raids-courier-cab-firms-amid-employee-abuse-claims.1095984,30-07-2024,006338.png,"Jobsplus officials raided three courier and cab fleet companies as the government agency investigates claims of employee abuse.
 WT Global, Ferrugia Fleet and Mela Cleaning, which employ cab drivers and food delivery couriers, got the unannounced visits in recent days, sources close to the operation said. The officials were looking for pay slips, work contracts and any documentary evidence that may point to illegal labour practices.
 The raids followed a meeting Jobsplus held with third-country national couriers who took industrial action over exploitative working conditions earlier this month. “The names of those three companies featured heavily in that meeting,” one source said.
 Times of Malta reached out to all three for comment. Only Ferrugia replied.
 “We gave all the requested documents when Jobsplus came to our offices. We are willing to cooperate with the authorities because we have nothing to hide,” the company’s owner, Fabrizio Ferrugia, said.
 
 WT Global, Ferrugia and Mela are among the companies that have recently been shunned by Jobsplus.
 Employment and Home Affairs Minister Byron Camilleri said in parliament earlier this month that companies accused of exploiting food couriers will be barred from hiring workers until investigations into the claims are carried out.
 Following the statement, it was revealed that hundreds of TCNs applying to work as cab drivers and food app couriers are having their work permit applications refused in what government sources described as part of a crackdown on abusive employers.
  The home affairs ministry said on Friday that cab driving and food courier work permits were being turned down because the market had “reached saturation”. Applications were being rejected for people abroad seeking a job here as well as those already in Malta who needed to change their employer. Workers renewing their permit with the same employer would not be affected, they said.
 Most third-country nationals who live in Malta need a work permit to reside in the country because they come from non-EU countries. That permit, which must usually be renewed every year, is directly tied to an employer.
 In the last two weeks, 409 work permit applications in the courier and ride-hailing industry were refused, sources told Times of Malta. Over half of them were change-of-employer applications that originated from Malta and the consisted of applications coming from abroad. Of the 235 refused change-of-employer applications, 116 refusals originated from WT Global.
 WT Global employs hundreds of workers. The company has Malta’s largest cab fleet, with over 300 vehicles registered. It is also known to have a large number of motorcycles operating on food delivery apps.
 Several workers who had applied at Identitá to change their employer reported receiving their work permit refusals from the agency responsible for issuing work permits in recent days. The refusal letters included a warning that, unless they have alternative authorisation to stay in Malta legally, they may be violating the Immigration Act.
 The letters shocked many TCNs who have been through logistical nightmares to get a job in Malta. “I was shocked. I did nothing wrong but, still, I was being told to leave the country,” said one man who had applied to work as a cab driver.
 Government sources said change-of-employer applications at these companies needed to be refused to avoid “abuse”. “Had we left that option open, we risked that the fleets could use another company to bring workers to Malta and then change their registered employer once here.”
 Still, the government, via Jobsplus, is willing to find alternative employment for those caught in the crossfire, sources said, emphasising that deporting such workers is not the government’s intention.
 In an opinion piece published on Sunday, Camillieri condemned employers who neglect workers’ rights, saying the government was conducting thorough investigations into the working conditions of food delivery couriers. He said the government would not tolerate exploitation.

'Do not refuel tanker headed to Israel or we will call protest': Graffitti,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/graffitti-calls-government-block-military-fuel-shipment-israel.1096223,08-02-2024,006363.png,"Updated 4pm
 Moviment Graffitti has called on the government to forbid passage and refuelling services to a fuel tanker on its way to Israel, as its delivery will contribute to further violence against Palestinians. 
 In a statement on Friday, the group highlighted the movements of two military jet fuel tankers - the Overseas Santorini and the Overseas Suncoast - which they said regularly deliver fuel to Israel's air force. 
 Such operations, supplied by the company Valero on behalf of the US government, have been condemned for their role in the “systematic oppression and violence against Palestinians”. 
 One of these vessels - the Overseas Santorini - is expected to approach Maltese waters imminently. 
 The activists said the tanker was likely to stop to refuel in Malta between Friday evening and Saturday afternoon.
 It urged people to report sightings on noseassantorini@proton.me and to be prepared for an impromptu protest if it did stop to refuel here.
 Times of Malta is informed that the vessel was unlikely to call into port.
 At 4pm, a Transport Malta spokesperson said the island had not received any request from Overseas Santorini.
 Earlier, Moviment Graffitti said it had written to Transport Minister Chris Bonnet and Transport Malta asking them to block the transit and docking of the vessel in Maltese waters.
 “Moviment Graffitti strongly urges the Maltese authorities to prohibit the passage, entry, bunkering, servicing, and docking of this vessel to prevent the fuel from reaching Israel, where it would contribute to further violence,” they said. 
 They said that this appeal is in line with those made by international groups calling for a global energy embargo on Israel “to end its ongoing genocide and ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian people”, called  ‘No Harbour for Genocide’.
  “Israel's actions have been deemed grave violations of international law, including the principles outlined by the International Court of Justice, which has issued binding orders that continue to be disregarded,” they said. 
 The letter also references a UN resolution passed in April 2024, which expresses deep concern over the transfer of jet fuel to Israel in violation of international law. 
 “Additionally, the Arms Trade Treaty obligates states to prevent the transfer of arms, including fuel, that could be used to commit genocide, crimes against humanity, or other serious breaches of international humanitarian law,” they said. 
 Malta has a constitutional commitment to promote peace, security and social progress among all nations, Graffitti said and this should prevent the tanker from transiting through Maltese waters, docking, or receiving any services from Maltese ports.

Notarised lease agreement needed by applicants for residence permit,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/notarised-lease-agreement-needed-applicants-residence-permit.1097541,09-03-2024,006462.png,"Third-country nationals applying for a residence permit will now require a notarised lease agreement, Identità said.
 Previously, such applicants were required to present a Housing Authority registered lease agreement when applying for a permit.
 The new practice, which came into force at the beginning of the month, adds another requirement.
 “Any property lease agreement presented as part of a residence permit application must be officially attested by a notary, lawyer, or legal procurator. This additional layer of verification is being introduced to further ensure the accuracy and reliability of the information provided to the agency,” Identità said.
 The change is part of a broader effort to streamline the residence permit application process and curb misuse of the system, it noted.
 “By requiring lease agreements to be attested by a qualified legal professional, Identità aims to promote greater accountability from both property owners and tenants and ensure that all parties involved adhere to legal standards, while enhancing safeguards against false declarations,” it added.
 These measures, Identità said, reflect an evolving framework focused on maintaining transparency and good governance across all functions under its remit.
 The change comes amid allegations made by lawyer Jason Azzopardi, who said that a scam within Identità saw ID cards being issued on the basis of forged documents. He publicly claimed that about 18,000 ID cards were fraudulently issued.
 Azzopardi has also alleged that people’s properties are being used as the home addresses of people receiving fraudulent ID cards.
 A magistrate accepted Azzopardi’s request for an inquiry, which is now ongoing.
 Sources in Identità believe that documents have been issued following fraud but that the wrongdoing is not from the entity but those applying.
 Identità said the new requirement will have a substantial impact on reducing system abuse, providing a more secure and reliable process for all stakeholders.

 A 77-year-old pedestrian, who died after being hit by a van in Qormi on Tuesday afternoon, has been named locally as Carmen Buttigieg from Żebbuġ.
 The motorcycle rider who died hours later in a Rabat crash has been identified as Cristi Robles, from Colombia.
 Their deaths happened on the same day that a 40-year-old Indian man, named as Balu Ganesh Balakrisha died in a head-on collision in Żebbuġ. 
 Robles, whose full name was Cristi Alejandra Robles Valderrama, died at roughly 11pm following a high-speed motorcycle crash on Triq tat-Tabija in Rabat, along what is known as the town’s Għeriexem promenade.
 The Colombian woman was riding pillion when the motorcycle smashed into an electricity pole. The driver, who is also from Colombia, is in a critical condition.
 Eyewitnesses have described seeing the two women drinking alcohol together in the hours before the crash, sources told Times of Malta. 
 The 33-year-old victim lived in Mtarfa. Her Facebook profile listed her as being originally from Colombia's capital city, Bogota. 
 The fatal crashes are being probed by magistrates.
 Their deaths bring to eight the number of people who have died on Malta's roads so far this year, which is equivalent to the death toll this time last year.
 Emergency doctor Michael Spiteri, who assisted on the scene of Thursday's accident in Rabat, urged people to take more care in light of these three fatalities taking place in the span of a day. 
 ""Three lives lost, many families shattered, some injured requiring months of recovery,"" he said.

Watch: Women carry statue in Vittoriosa feast celebrations for the first time,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/watch-women-carry-statue-vittoriosa-feast-celebrations-first-time.1096560,08-09-2024,"006595.png,006596.png","For many decades it was the domain of men, but 12 women took it upon themselves to carry the heavy statue of St Lawrence in Vittoriosa on Thursday, the first time in the parish's history.
 The event occurred during the traditional ‘Antiviġilja’ march on Thursday, the day before the eve of the feast of St Lawrence.
  The statue, which depicts St Lawrence helping the poor, is particularly heavy because it features four figures. Typically, it takes 16 to 18 men to shoulder the statue.
 The women carried it for an hour and a half down Triq il-Mina L-Kbira, while singing with the local marching band.
 Maria Cassar Inguanez, one of the women who participated, expressed her excitement at being part of this historic moment.
 ""It was very heavy, but I am so proud I got to do this. We didn’t plan it; it just happened, and it was worth every second,"" she said.
 Cassar Inguanez has been a regular attendee of the feast since childhood and is also actively involved in the preparations.
 ""If you work for the feast, you deserve to carry the statue. I think it is only fair,"" she added.
  During the march, some men supported the women by helping to steady the statue from behind.
 The women carried it until they reached Il-Kolonna (the column), where the statue was traditionally hoisted up with ropes, a method historically used for lifting heavy materials in the Isla Maċina.
 The women in Vittoriosa are echoing trends in some other localities. In Marsaxlokk, for example, fishermen's wives carry the statue of Our Lady of Pompeii during the feast as a gesture of gratitude for protecting their husbands at sea.

NGOs slam PA's 'haste to recommend destruction' of historic Fort Chambray,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/ngos-slam-pa-haste-recommend-destruction-historic-fort-chambray.1102198,12-09-2024,006861.png,"Four NGOs on Monday slammed the Planning Authorities' ""haste to recommend the destruction and development"" of the historic Fort Chambray. 
 Last week, MaltaToday reported that plans to demolish the British-era barracks at Fort Chambray, part of a broader redevelopment including a hotel and residential units, are set to be approved. 
 
 A final decision on the barracks by the Planning Board is set for December 12.
 On Monday, Din l-Art Ħelwa - Għawdex, Wirt Għawdex, Għawdix and Moviment Graffitti said the PA had issued two recommendations for approval: one for the demolition of the historic British Barracks, and another for the development of Fort Chambray into an aparthotel, apartment blocks and commercial facilities. 
 The groups said the recommendations for approval were issued despite around 1,400 objections against the demolition of the 1895 barracks, and the various requests by NGOs for the scheduling and protection of the site.
 ""Even the Gozo Regional Development Authority has taken a clear stance against the demolition of the Chambray Barracks, stressing that Gozo’s heritage should be protected and preserved because it is a vital part of Gozo’s identity.
 ""Such destruction of our heritage constitutes a violation of the Cultural Heritage Act and runs counter to PA Circular 3/20 (6.5) that protects the context of scheduled buildings,"" they noted in a statement.
 They said the PA and the Superintendence of Cultural Heritage were treating the Fort Chambray site - made up of almost exclusively Grade 1 and 2 scheduled buildings - as ""simply an infill building site with scant consideration for its historic, cultural and architectural value"".
 They added that the proposal to demolish the barracks violated the Fort Chambray Development Brief’s Existing Buildings Retention Policy, which states that the barracks - along with other historic sites within the fort - are to be retained, restored and conserved.
 
 ""Despite misleading claims that the barracks are in poor condition, the barracks are still in a very salvageable state and should be restored and converted into a cultural hub or repurposed for sustainable tourism.
 ""Fort Chambray stands as a symbol of the failures of both Nationalist and Labour administrations, who over the past 30 years of failed concessions, have left it to rot as they handed it over to different developers.""
 They said the betrayal of the people could not have been clearer last June, when the government and the Opposition voted in favour of a parliamentary resolution to allow the original concessionaire to sell the government concession and transfer extensive tracts of land to a group of other developers.
 ""Moreover, the government will be responsible for the consolidation works of the terrain underlying the fort, the restoration works and the maintenance of the fortifications.
 ""Essentially, this means that the people will be paying for the restoration of the fort to allow the developers to pocket millions out of it.""
 They reiterated their call on the government to halt the plans for Fort Chambray and ""do the right thing"".
 If the PA was allowed to do whatever it wanted, the NGOs warned they were willing to take the necessary action to make those responsible for the destruction of our heritage answer before the law.

"Church collections up €500,000 in one year",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/church-collections-500000-one-year.1099191,10-09-2024,006917.png,"Church collections last year were the highest in a decade with over €2.9 million collected in parishes during mass, figures obtained by the Archbishop’s Curia show.
 One of the reasons may be the increase in Catholic non-Maltese residents, the Church’s administrative secretary, Michael Pace Ross explained.
 The Curia’s annual financial report for 2023 indicated a 20% increase in church collections.
 Further data obtained by the Curia showed that church collections had amounted to €2.5 million in 2014, rising to €2.6 million in 2017, 2018 and 2019, then dropping to €1.5 million and €1.9 million, respectively, in 2020 and 2021 when the coronavirus pandemic kept people away from churches. Collections increased to €2.4 million in 2022 and €2.9 million in 2023.
 “We are seeing a number of Christian communities who are practising their faith in Malta… We are also seeing that these Catholic non-Maltese residents are contributing in their own way towards this [increase in church collections],” Pace Ross said.
 The spike in collections contrasts with the projected decline in mass attendance among locals.
 According to the most recent Sunday mass attendance census, conducted in 2017, attendance is projected to sink to only 10% of Malta’s Catholic population by 2040.
 Taken every 10 years, five such censuses have been carried out so far by Discern, the Institute for Research on the Sign of the Times.
 The first was taken in 1967 and showed 81.9% attendance that dropped to 37% in 2017. Projections into the future give a 20% attendance in 2030 and 10% around 2040.
 However, the 2020 national census, compiled by the National Statistics Office, showed a sharp rise in foreigners living in Malta.
 Data showed that Malta’s foreign population increased by over 95,000 people in the past 10 years. There are now over 115,000 non-Maltese nationals in Malta, just over 22% of the total population.
 A third of foreigners in Malta are EU citizens. A further 7% are from other European countries that are not EU member states.
 Italians are the most prevalent foreign nationality at 12%, followed by British residents at just over nine per cent. Other common nationalities include Indian and Filipino, both at just under seven per cent.

Former chair and CEO of Broadcasting Authority puzzled by decision to fine RTK,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/former-chair-ceo-broadcasting-authority-puzzled-decision-fine-rtk.1097175,26-08-2024,006941.png,"A fine imposed by the Broadcasting Authority on RTK103 for failing to invite members of Imperium Europa, the party founded and led by Norman Lowell, to a programme hosted by Andrew Azzopardi has revived questions over Malta’s broadcasting laws.
 Reacting to the fine, RTK103 – a Church-owned radio station – argued that the decision impinges on editorial freedom “forcing it to air extremist, racist, far-right political views”.
 But in laying down its decision, the BA said that every station covering current affairs or political issues, including this year's European Parliament elections, “should have a wide representation of different opinions”. 
 Speaking to Times of Malta, former BA CEO Pierre Cassar said that obliging a private station to go against its own editorial decisions is a “risky” move. 
  Cassar, who was at the authority’s helm during the 2011 divorce referendum, says that this decision raises questions over how stations are to act not just in terms of balancing representation across the political spectrum, but also when discussing sensitive issues such as abortion.
 Recalling the tricky balancing act the authority had to play at the time, Cassar questioned how stations are to ensure impartiality without breaching their own editorial stances.
 “How would stations like RTK103 and Radju Marija have to act in the case of an abortion referendum? Are we expecting the Church to go against its teachings?” he asked.
 Cassar also questioned why the matter of impartiality only cropped up after Imperium Europa filed a complaint, despite the BA having vetted the 60-strong list of guests on the show. 
 Cassar also points to what he sees as a procedural anomaly in the way the case was treated, where “two different procedures were amalgamated into one”.
 “Normally a complaint and a charge are treated separately, with the investigation into the complaint determining whether there is scope for a charge and, eventually, a fine,” Cassar says.
 In this particular case, Cassar says, the two processes were bundled together, in a move that he described as “highly unusual”.
 The authority’s former chair Joe Pirotta agrees that RTK103’s editorial stance must be safeguarded.
 “RTK has its own identity and its own remit, which includes being a vehicle that does not encourage racism. If the radio is trying to protect that identity, then that must be respected,” he said.
 Pirotta said that RTK103’s position also must be “sympathetically considered” in light of the situation where “the BA wants to give further publicity to a leader who regularly spews a programme based on racial hate”.
 Pirotta admits that the BA finds itself in a tricky situation, bearing “a very heavy duty to ensure impartiality”, while balancing it with “a general interest to truth and fairness and the protection of freedom of speech”.
 But ultimately, Pirotta says, “an element of common sense must prevail”.
 He says that things are complicated further by Lowell’s past conviction on three charges of racial hatred, for which he was given a two-year suspended sentence.
 “You cannot say that a particular party should be banned because you don’t like their politics or views. But in this case, the leader of the party has been convicted”.
 
 Both Pirotta and Cassar agree that the broadcasting world’s approach to impartiality has become obsolete, with archaic rules effectively forcing the regulator’s hand in some instances.
 “The way we look at impartiality and balance need to be revisited,” Cassar says. “We are still obsessed with linear media such as TV and radio, when things have long since moved on”.
 Pirotta agrees that “we are now living in a totally different world” to when broadcasting laws were drafted, suggesting that several provisions in the law – most notably the controversial clause instructing the BA to consider impartiality across the entire spectrum of stations – should be scrapped.
 “A lot could be done if the law that says that BA may consider the private stations to balance each other out were to be removed,” Pirotta says. “Ultimately, private stations should have the same responsibility to ensure impartiality as the State broadcaster”.

 Moviment Graffitti said the march will denounce the ""government’s inaction against the commercial tables, chairs and structures that are choking our pavements, squares, streets and beaches"".
 Residents and visitors of the capital often flag the chaotic situation of tables and chairs on Valletta streets.
 Last year, tables and chairs on Merchants Street triggered a judicial protest by the University of Malta against the Valletta local council.
 The Ombudsman's Office has even taken to parliament to demand proper rules and procedures for outdoor catering areas.
 Earlier this year, independent party Residenti Beltin uploaded footage of an ambulance squeezing past tables and chairs.
 
 The issue of tables and chairs is not limited to the capital.
 The Marsascala local council last year asked the Lands Authority to demarcate areas where restaurants and cafes can take out their tables and chairs. It also urged the authorities to act on illegalities.
 The locality's residents claim businesses are taking pavements away from pedestrians, often illegally, making it difficult to navigate sidewalks, especially for those with pushchairs or mobility issues.
 The situation is also frustrating Sliema residents, where a local took the unusual step of applying for permission to take up public land herself instead of a commercial entity.
 Residents and activists have also expressed frustration about the taking up of public space in the Mellieħa Square.
 Residents from these localities and others will be joining the protest on Sunday, which will kick off at around 12.15pm close to the MUŻA museum on Merchants Street.
  The protest is being organised by Moviment Graffitti, Sliema Residents Association, Residenti Beltin, Marsaskala Residents Network, Azzjoni Tuna Artna Lura, Residenti Melliħin, Residenti San Pawl il-Baħar and Marsaxlokk Heritage Group.
 In a statement ahead of the march they said that despite the various promises made by the government that it will curb the excessive encroachment of public spaces by businesses and restore public access, ""effective action and serious enforcement are still nowhere to be seen"".
 ""This rampant take-up of public land by businesses is adding to the deterioration of our quality of life,"" they added.
 The march forms part of the Il-Bankini taċ-Ċittadini campaign launched five months ago.
 ""We shall be marching through the streets of Valletta — that look more like an obstacle course with each passing day — to highlight how safe and public access is practically non-existent.
 ""The various demands put forward by residents’ groups from some of the most affected localities - including a call for the law to be made more robust, effective enforcement, and transparency in the way encroachment permits are issued - have largely been ignored by the authorities. Repeated meeting requests to the Prime Minister to discuss our proposals have so far been met with deafening silence,"" they added.

 From around the mid-19th century, they became the largest single employer in Malta, responsible for putting food in the mouths of innumerable families, for triggering trade union con­scious­ness and for defining barriers between the rulers and the ruled. Dockyard workers turned into formidable political forces.
  A glass ceiling endured, through which the Maltese rarely broke – higher positions almost automatically went to Britons, however worthy or competent the native.
 Security of employment depended on negative, transient circumstances, like international tensions and armed conflict. 
  Dockers’ plight influenced the native language, like gaxxin, the leftovers from ships’ tables, which went to feed the hungry who could not afford proper food.
 Military establishments, like Admiralty dockyards, discouraged (at times banned) photography. That explains the relative scarcity of images of workshops and mechanical and engineering equipment.
  Our dockyard boasts of at least one culturally outstanding distinction. In 1858, a British expedition ransacked the Greek Mausoleum of Halicarnassus, in Bodrum, Turkey, one of the Seven Wonders of the World, built c. 300BC. 
  The looters carted off all the unique sculpture and decoration to UK museums. 
 They left the plain hardstone blocks in Malta, to face the new extension of Number One Dock, then being built. Malta has wonders of the world but they are hidden in slime.
  The contribution of Maltese dockers to the survival of democracy in World War II cannot be underestimated. It is problematic whether those merits still flourished after the end of the conflict.
  I may contribute a dedicated feature to the floating dock, if I have enough images.

A planter at a new Gozo school blocks wheelchairs. Locals are not surprised,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/a-planter-new-gozo-school-blocks-wheelchairs-locals-surprised.1101998,12-08-2024,006971.png,"Individuals with disabilities in Gozo have expressed their frustration over the lack of accessibility and inclusion initiatives on the island, with one federation arguing that progress often “stops at Ċirkewwa”.
 The Gozo Federation for Persons with Disability, an umbrella organisation representing six voluntary entities, has long been advocating meaningful action to address the systemic barriers faced by the community.
 The federation’s chairperson, Kevin Cutajar, said members have grown tired of attending numerous meetings and receiving empty promises.
 “We often attend meetings where we are told our ideas are good and our concerns valid, but no action follows,” said Cutajar.
 “We know there is a minister whose role is to work on inclusion, yet it feels like that message stops at Ċirkewwa. It is very frustrating and that is why we are continuously calling for action to improve the situation.”
 The federation flagged several issues, including insufficient educational resources, inadequate professional support and an inaccessible infrastructure.
 It highlighted how teachers catering for students with visual impairments and autism rarely visit Gozo, and the inclusive education coordinator responsible for Gozo’s middle and secondary schools is shared with the Mellieħa school. Meanwhile, the Sannat Special Unit is not provided with this service.
 Infrastructure challenges are also rampant.
 Many pavements are “practically inaccessible” according to the federation, due to cars parked on ramps, tables and chairs obstructing pathways and planters blocking access.
 A concrete planter outside the newly inaugurated €18 million primary school in Rabat has exacerbated the problem. It blocks access to the ramp, leaving insufficient space for wheelchair users to navigate.
 One federation member told Times of Malta that a wheelchair cannot manoeuvre around the planter to access the ramp due to insufficient space.
 The new primary school was inaugurated back in September and replaced the old school which was around 170 years old.
 The Commission for the Rights of Persons with Disability (CRPD) said it was looking into the matter. Commissioner Rhoda Garland said the commission is in contact with the Gozo college principal.
 “We are currently investigating the planters, we have spoken to the principal to ascertain the facts so that we know how to deal with the case,” Garland told Times of Malta.
 In response to questions, the Inclusion Ministry acknowledged the concerns and affirmed its commitment to finding solutions. A spokesperson said the ministry has engaged with Gozitan civil society groups to better understand the challenges and is collaborating with all stakeholders to identify solutions.
 “The minister herself emphasised during CRPD’s recent conference in Gozo that, while CRPD’s survey has shown positive trends, there are concerns that need to be addressed,” the spokesperson said.
 Additionally, the ministry offered Gozitan civil society direct representation within its civil society committee and created a subcommittee within the Autism Advisory Council to focus on regional needs. Discussions have also been initiated with the Gozo Ministry to tackle the flagged concerns.
 “The ministry remains committed, as mentioned by the minister, to continue efforts together with different stakeholders in Gozo to ensure that no one is left behind in the implementation of disability-related obligations, policies and strategy actions in Gozo.”
 Questions sent to the Gozo Ministry remain unanswered.
 The Gozo Federation for Persons with Disability consists of the following organisations:  Gozo Association of the Deaf (GAD), Gozo Aid for the Visually Impaired (GAVI), Voice for Inclusion Gozo Association, Ability for Disability Association (AFDA), Inspire and Arka Foundation.

 The open-air event will take place on 25 August at 4.00pm in Marsalforn, Gozo.
 Arm wrestling is a sport where two opponents place their elbows on a raised surface, their arms bent, and their hands tightly gripped. The winner is the person who forces their opponent's hand down to the tabletop.
 The competition is divided into several categories based on weight: under 75 kg, under 90 kg, and over 90 kg.
  There will be specific categories for women and left-handed participants. A separate open category will be available, not based on gender or weight class, but rather on the participants' dominant hand. 
 The founder of Arm Wrestling Malta, David Apap, reminisced on his early interest in the sport and recalled ""fond memories"" of arm wrestling at school among his friends.
 After witnessing a tug-of-war event in Għarb, he realised arm-wresting could have a good following in Malta. I
 Inspired by this thought, Apap founded the club 12 years ago after the National Arm Wrestling Association ceased organising arm wrestling competitions.
 ""I've always been passionate about sports and wanted to introduce something new to Malta,"" Apap continued.
 ""Our first competition was a hit, and people have been asking for more ever since.""
 While some competitors train year-round, the competition is open to everyone, with no age restrictions. Apap proudly mentioned that past participants ranged in age from people in their twenties to those as old as 69.
 Winners in each category will receive both a cash prize and a trophy, making the competition not only a test of strength but also an opportunity for recognition within the arm wrestling community.

  Over the centuries, in Malta, the choice fell on a limited number of four-legged creatures – horses, mares, donkeys, mules, oxen and, but only exceptionally, dogs. Other beasts of burden, like camels, elephants and reindeer, do not feature in the Maltese landscape.
 Horses dominated. At first for trekking distances, carrying loads, policing, in battle and for sports.
 Cavalry warriors already featured in the 1565 Great Siege, and jousting on horseback also seemed familiar. In Hospitaller times, the number of equines to a carriage denoted the status of the passenger – only the grand master could have six. Lesser dignitaries had to make do with four, two or even one. Horse and donkey racing (Strada dei giannetti) featured prominently in old, popular festivities.
  Up to relatively recently, karrettuni drawn by horses, mares, donkeys or mules served most street hawkers, ice cream or kerosene vendors, blade-sharpeners, bread carts, water carriers or road sprinklers, used daily in hot summers to settle the dust on non-asphalted roads. I am only listing a few. 
  Today, horses mostly appear harnessed to sulkies in trotting races and as tired folklore in the tourist-nostalgia karozzin, which boasted many Victorian ancestors, two or four-wheeled, like the  kaless, the Landau and the dozen variants of the gentleman’s traps or carts.
  On the other hand, oxen and mules dominated heavier agricultural functions, like ploughing the fields, going round in windmills threshing wheat or working the waterwheel (is-sienja).  Photographers and postcard publishers relished the pairing of man with beast, and many pre-war records thankfully survive.

"Monica Attard, icon of the Maltese stage, dies aged 74",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/actor-presenter-monica-attard-dies-aged-74.1091970,21-06-2024,"007350.png,007351.png,007352.png","Monica Attard, a TV and radio presenter and actor who thrilled theatre crowds for decades, has died aged 74.
 Attard was born in Sliema in 1949 and spent practically all her life in the town.
 Her stage career began at Sliema’s De Porres Theatre, where she and a small group of friends started putting on plays.
 She nurtured that hobby by attending the Manoel Theatre Academy of Dramatic Art, studying under the tutorship of Adrian Rendle.
  As her talent developed, so did her passion for the stage, and Attard would go on to work on dozens of theatre productions, ranging from Shakespeare’s Anthony & Cleopatra to  Oliver Friggieri’s Rewwixta and Arthur Miller’s Broken Glass.
 Attard’s talents also translated to radio and television.
  She worked on several audio dramas that were transmitted via Reddifusion and also worked as a radio announcer for several years with Radju Malta before moving on to Radio 101 and TV station Net.
 Attard gradually slowed down her rate of work as she entered retirement, but continued to perform in the occasional play.
 Actor and director Charlotte Grech was one of the last ones to work with Attard, having directed her in the play 'Her Say' at Spazju Kreattiv in 2022.
  ""She was a consummate perfectionist. Working quietly. And showing us how to hold an audience glued to their seats, watching out for every inflection. It was a joy to direct her in this piece and a huge learning curve for me,"" Grech told Times of Malta following news of Attard’s death.
 Actress Sarah Camilleri said: ""You may have taken your final bow, but your spirit lives on in the laughter, the tears, and the profound impact you've had on all who were lucky enough to know you. Rest in peace, dear friend. You'll always hold a special place in my heart.""
  Attard's daughter Nicky Hesla wrote on Sunday: ""After bravely battling cancer for so long, my beautiful mother Monica Attard has found peace. Your incredible strength throughout these challenging months has revealed the depth of your character and the inner beauty that defined you.""
 Nationalist MP and former presenter Claudette Buttigieg was among the first to pay tribute. 
 ""Rest in peace, dear Monica,"" Buttigieg wrote. ""A woman of great dignity and respect and an excellent actor and presenter.""
 Culture Minister Owen Bonnici said Maltese theatre had ""lost one of its giants"".
 Writing on X, formerly Twitter, Bonnici said the actor had ""represented so much for the arts scene to so many. She will forever be an inspiration.""
 Attard is survived by two children and grandchildren.

  Hotels, restaurants, tour operators and other tourist-oriented activities by far account for the bulk of postcard publicity. But even other commercial and non-commercial genres sometimes resorted to promotion by postcard. This spread will take a cursory look at later advertising for non-hospitality activities.
  By the time Independence had energised a major tourist boom, postcards intended for promotion had assumed a relatively standard format – in full colour, generally with ‘composite’ multiple photographic images rather than creative artwork, the name quite prominently displayed on the front and, occasionally, some info, mostly contact details, on the back.
  Non-commercial advertising ranged quite widely – witness some postcards publicising Mount St Joseph Retreat House in Tarġa Gap, Mosta, anti-drug abuse propaganda issued by Aġenzija Sedqa, founded 30 years ago in 1994, and that wonderous and unrepeatable vanity project, the Mystique complex, in Madliena, the dreams in bricks and mortar of the late visionary Marquis Joe Scicluna, now so sadly abandoned and vandalised.
  The main Maltese postcard publishers saw to the major part of the production of these niche promotional tools instruments. These include established staples like the doyen of Maltese postcard publicity, David Moore, Perfecta Advertising, Anatlus (Wilfred Sultana & Associates Co. Ltd), and Vulcan Advertising. Many appear to be self-published or are identified only by the printers, like Interprint, Union Press, Penprint.
 Compared to other mainstream ‘Having a wonderful holiday in Malta, weather really lovely, wish you were here’ postcards, rather few of these promotion cards can be found postally used. Those that survive were mostly kept as souvenirs or curios rather than used to send messages.

It is an annual festival that celebrates nature while promoting a healthy lifestyle. The event also aims to bolster a sense of identity among the small community.
 The central attraction of the event will once again be the infiorata, which this year will be composed of no less than 7,000 pots of petunia, a seasonal spring flower. 
 Among other activities, Ninu Cremona Street will be transformed into a centre for well-being. 
 Inspired by the name of the locality, the council will offer ‘Xarba Klin’, a rosemary-flavoured drink, together with seasonal fruit and fruit cake, among others.
 In the discussion corner, named Eco Café, visitors will learn about various interesting topics related to nature, including wildflowers with Alfred Baldacchino, the wonderful world of flowers with Antoine Vella, the use of herbs in recipes with Carmen Tedesco, and aromatherapy with Joyce Muscat.
 The public will also be encouraged to actively participate and learn about gardening. At the end of the event, all the pots making up the infiorata will be given away for free, to encourage residents and visitors to decorate their balconies, gardens and homes with them.
 Entertainment will be provided by St Pius X Musical Society of Lija and the Spiteri Lucas Band. Established and emerging visual artists, whose art is often inspired by nature and the Maltese landscape, will have a dedicated space.
 Festa Fjuri is being organised in collaboration with a number of NGOs and agencies involved in the environmental field, including Ambjent Malta, Project Green, ERA, Friends of the Earth, and Move for Trees, all of whom will be present at the event to engage with the public. The Lija/Iklin Football Youth Academy and the Iklin Scout Group will also be present during the festival.

New wellbeing services for LGBTIQ+ individuals and their families,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/new-wellbeing-services-lgbtiq-individuals-families.1094729,07-01-2024,007498.png,"The government on Monday launched psycho-social services for LGBTIQ+ individuals and their families, including personalised and group support sessions.
 The services also include community outreach, professional training sessions for people who want to support LGBTIQ+ employees, counselling and therapeutic services to LGBTIQ+ individuals and their families.
 They are being offered through a collaboration between the Human Rights Directorate within the Parliamentary Secretariat for Reforms and Equality and the Foundation for Social Welfare Services (FSWS), which have just signed a five-year agreement for the services. 
 For the time being, the services will be provided at the Wellbeing Hub in the A3 Towers in Paola. Once work on a Valletta building are completed services will be moved there.
 During the launch, Parliamentary Secretary Rebecca Buttigieg said the services will ensure the well-being of those individuals and their families who want to overcome the trauma and stress they face because of prejudice and stigma. 
 She said the Wellbeing Hub service is evidence of the government’s commitment to inclusivity and equality, which she said could not be solely achieved through legislation, but also through support services. 
 According to the EU LGBTIQ+ 2024 survey, 62% of LGBTIQ+ individuals in Malta are fairly or very open about their identity, while another 14% feel discriminated against at work.
 
 Another 59% experienced harassment in the past year, slightly higher than the EU average of 54%.
 FSWS CEO Alfred Grixti said through the agreement specialised professionals employed by Appoġġ will provide a personalised service to the individuals who seek their help.

The children born in Malta who have no passport,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/the-children-born-malta-no-passport.1093003,25-05-2024,007597.png,"Stateless children living in Malta should be granted “some form of regular status” to uphold their “fundamental right to a family life”, the children’s commissioner has urged.
 In a reply to Times of Malta questions, a spokesperson for the Office of the Children’s Commissioner said there are migrant children who are stateless or risk becoming stateless and the office continues to advocate for their rights and voice its concern about the issue with the authorities.
 “Children who are born here [in Malta], irrespective of their status, only know Malta as their home and, therefore, we believe that it is in the best interest of these migrant children for the status of the entire family unit to be regularised since this safeguards the children’s fundamental right to a family life,” the spokesperson said.
 “This regularisation should not be limited to those children who are born in Malta but equally to those migrant children who were born in other countries but who have settled and integrated here whether or not they enjoy international protection.”
 The children’s commissioner is appointed to uphold the rights and freedoms of all children living in Malta.
 The current commissioner – former Ta’ Xbiex mayor and former Housing Authority chairperson Antoinette Vassallo – was appointed in 2022 and her pleas for the recognition of stateless children join those of many migrants’ rights activists, who, over the past months, have been pushing on the authorities to give more rights to migrants who were denied asylum.
 Most migrants who are denied asylum are allowed to work in Malta and are obliged to pay tax and social contributions but have no access to free education. While working, they have access to healthcare but no social protection. 
 This means that if they are injured, taken ill or can no longer be gainfully employed, they will not receive any social, medical or unemployment benefits. They are similarly not entitled to a pension once they reach retirement age.
  They are also not allowed to marry, even if they enter loving relationships and form a family of their own.
 Moreover, children born in Malta to parents who have been rejected asylum inherit their parents’ lack of documentation, have no social protection and are technically stateless.
 According to recent data, there are at least 171 stateless people in Malta, almost half of them aged under nine.
 Some of these families have been living and working in Malta for as long as 20 years and they live in Maltese villages, their children go to school there, play an instrument with the local band club and help with the village feast or have joined the local sports nursery – yet, they are still not considered Maltese, they cannot represent Malta in a sports or artistic discipline and are frustrated for being continually referred to as ‘migrants’ or ‘aliens’.
 The Office of the Children’s Commissioner said that, on various occasions, it advocated publicly for the rights of migrant children through statements and its annual reports  and “also brought it concerns to the attention of the relevant entities”.
 “The Office believes that migrants who have settled in Malta and integrated in Maltese society should be given a more definite and permanent status even if they do not qualify for any form of international protection,” the commissioner’s spokesperson said.
 “If irregular migrants are not repatriated within a short period of time from their irregular entry into Malta, migrants and their families should be given some form of regular status that would legitimise their long-term stay in Malta, therefore enabling children to access their rights including their right to education among many others.”
 The issue of undocumented migrants resurfaced last February after Kusi Dismark – a man who had lived, studied and worked in Malta for 13 years – was forced to leave the country or be deported and his was not the only such case.

 After years of hard work and raising a family, last Thursday, 72-year-old Corlett took to the stage alongside his coursemates and graduated for the first time with a Diploma in Journalism. 
 “I felt there’s a few brain cells had gone to sleep, so I wanted to wake them up somehow,” Corlett jokingly said, explaining why he went back to studying.
  Originally from New Zealand, while Corlett passed his University Entrance exam in New Zealand back in 1971, he took on a job in construction and then later on in mining. He also played professional rugby for a couple of years and then moved to America, where he met his wife, who is Maltese. 
 When he moved to Malta, he wrote for the Malta Rugby Football Union, but that experience wasn’t enough and felt he wanted to “hone the art a little bit more”, so he applied at the University of Malta as a mature student. 
 Despite the age gap between him and the young students, Corlett said he found support and built friendships. 
 “Some told me ‘You’re like my grandfather’, so they got close to me because of that,” Corlett said. 
 What is next for the graduate? 
 “I’m processing the opportunities that may arise after today,” he said.

How common is discrimination in the property rental market?,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/how-common-discrimination-property-rental-market.1096702,17-08-2024,007677.png,"Estate agents are divided on how common discrimination is within the rental sector but agree that, in a seller’s market, landlords have the final say. 
 Pointing to “cultural differences” between Maltese and some third-country nationals as one reason for discrimination, most real estate professionals say that, while they might not agree with a landlord’s preferences, they have to adhere to their requests.
 And while one estate agent insists his company “won’t work with racists”, most industry professionals Times of Malta spoke to said they tell clients the property is no longer available if a landlord insists on not renting to a person based on their nationality. 
 Meanwhile, a spokesperson for members of the Indian community said South Asians are “more often than not” turned down when applying to rent a property and told: “We do not want to rent to Indians.”
 Housing discrimination hit the headlines last week when Alliance Real Estate blamed one of its property adverts warning “no Pakis, Indians, Arabs and Philippines” (sic) on an internal memo that had been published by mistake.
 A spokesperson for the company said it was “not uncommon for landlords to impose restrictions on the types of tenants they would accept living in their properties” and that the company was obligated to follow such restrictions. 
 But Neil Falzon, director of human rights NGO Aditus, said the law was “crystal clear” that restricting access to housing based on nationality was illegal.
 One industry source told Times of Malta such discrimination was widespread but “more common among landlords with multiple properties who rely on them for their income”.
 “The first thing they’ll ask is the nationality, then about any kids and pets. They tell us [their requirements] and what can we do? The demand is greater than the supply, so landlords can pick and choose,” the source said. 
 “It’s a bit of a minefield... on one side it’s wrong but that’s the business we’re in – and that business is doing very well at the moment.”
 But Dhalia CEO Alan Grima called the Alliance case an “isolated” incident and said landlords with such restrictions represented a fraction of the total. 
 And QuickLets and Zanzi Homes founder Steve Mercieca said that while he had been “shocked” by the levels of discrimination when he entered the sector, it was “not as widespread as it used to be”.
 However, he said the company “doesn’t have any control over what landlords allow... there’s a sentiment in Malta that certain nationalities have lower incomes and bring more tenants than planned”.
 RE/MAX chairperson Kevin Buttigieg agrees, noting it wasn’t uncommon to rent to a person of a particular third-country nationality, only to end up with three or four additional people sharing the apartment.   
 Pointing to “cultural differences” such as odours from certain cuisines as reasons for landlords refusing tenants of certain nationalities, he said attitudes to such differences were “unfortunate but that’s the way it is”.
 
 While Buttigieg wouldn’t be drawn on how common discrimination was in the sector, saying it was “difficult to tell” and depended on the area, he said real estate agents’ hands were tied. 
 “At the end of the day, the landlord is the landlord, and they can do what they want; it’s a difficult situation.”  
 Pressed on the legality of landlords discriminating when letting out a property, Buttigieg said: “In my opinion, it is against the law but we are not going against the law ourselves [as letting agents]”.
 A spokesperson for the Malta Malayalee Association said landlords “often reject Indians from renting their apartment just because of where we are from”.
 Owners do not hide behind any excuses, he said, adding that seeing adverts explicitly excluding Indians was also common.
 “When we saw that Alliance had an advert prohibiting Indians, Pakistanis and others, we were not surprised,” the spokesperson said.
  Addressing fears that South Asian cooking can leave behind strong odours, he said landlords often charged higher prices to tenants from South Asia as a result. 
 “Indians end up paying a premium for housing… Very often, we spend half our wage or more on housing.”
 When faced with restrictive landlords, Buttigieg said he would tell prospective tenants a “white lie and say the property isn’t available” while offering to show them somewhere else instead. 
 And Grima said that while Dhalia would still contact landlords about such tenants and supply references where possible to help applications, prospective tenants would be told the property was “not available” if the landlord insisted.
 “Landlords are spoilt for choice; within a few hours they’ll have various tenants to choose from.... there’s an under-supply [of properties].”
 He said such incidents were rare, however, adding discrimination was not confined to third-country nationals and that there had been similar requests in relation to European tenants in the past too. Grima noted that such requirements had become less prevalent over time, pointing to changes to rent laws limiting the number of tenants per property as having put the minds of landlords at ease.   
 Meanwhile, Mercieca said that his company would “try to change their mind” if a landlord asked to exclude prospective tenants based on their race or nationality – but refuse their business if they didn’t.
 “We blacklist people who are racist, also because they’re not as easy to deal with. We won’t work with racists,” he said.
 Pointing to the company’s experience in Cyprus, Spain and Portugal, Mercieca said that in other countries rental properties were managed by a third party, meaning landlords rarely met tenants. 
 “When properties are managed it’s always better; they’re more organised and it means tenants don’t have to deal with hot-headed owners... because the tenants never meet the landlords,” he said, calling for such an approach in Malta. 
 Buttigieg thinks rental laws need a “major overhaul,” arguing for increased protections for both tenants and landlords. 
 “I would go a step further and say there should be some kind of court to make quick decisions in cases of disputes between landlord and tenants,” he said.
 “This is really needed as it’s a serious business; a landlord invests his money in the property and needs protection and, at the same time, a tenant pays good rent for the property and needs protection. I believe this will solve a lot of problems.”
 When asked what steps were being taken to address housing discrimination, a housing ministry spokesperson pointed to the publication of “anti-discrimination information sheets” as a measure taken by the ministry to address the issue.
 The National Commission for the Promotion of Equality (NCPE) said it was planning to repeat a study into housing discrimination which, when last carried out in 2012, found “numerous examples of direct and indirect housing discrimination in Malta”.

 The new law comes amid reports of overcrowding in properties, with foreign workers paying cheap rent to sleep in rooms crammed with bunkbeds.
 In the legal notice, the number of occupants allowed in an apartment is based on the number of bedrooms and bathrooms it has.
 A maximum of two tenants can occupy a single-bedroom apartment, a maximum of four can reside in a two-bedroom residence and six people can share a three-bedroom dwelling.
 Four-bedroom and five-bedroom accommodations must have two bathrooms to house eight and 10 residents, respectively.
 The law, which does not apply to families, will take effect within two months, at the end of October.
 Those in violation of the law are subject to a fine ranging from €2,500 to €10,000 and can also be prosecuted in court.
 It comes after Housing Minister Roderick Galdes announced plans for new rental regulations in March. 
 Existing planning regulations already limit occupancy to six people per dwelling but these regulations carry no penalties.
 Overcrowded apartments have been a recurring issue in Malta’s rental market.
 On Tuesday, Times of Malta reported that a policeman was renting out a cockroach-infested three-bedroom house in Sliema to  16 tenants, each paying €250 a month.
 A former tenant described how he was attracted to the property by its low rent and “no deposit policy” but soon found the conditions at the house “really difficult”.
 “I did my best to keep the place clean but there were 16 people... I should have been able to come home and relax but I was sad,” he said.
 Last year, Times of Malta also revealed how a Sliema apartment was housing  40 tenants, with up to nine people sleeping in a single room.
 Most are foreign workers, who struggle to find affordable housing and are often discriminated against.
 Last month, a housing agent advertised a property with the warning “no Pakis, Indians, Arabs and Philippines” after accidentally publishing a landlord’s “restrictions” for prospective tenants.

Malta marks 82nd anniversary of Operation Pedestal – the day the country was saved - The Malta Independent ,independent,https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2024-08-14/local-news/Malta-marks-82nd-anniversary-of-Operation-Pedestal-the-day-the-country-was-saved-6736263467,14-08-2024,000025.png,"

 Malta has marked the 82nd anniversary of Operation Pedestal, the day when Malta was saved from starvation at the height of the World War Two hostilities.
 On 15 August 1942, the battered and bruised merchant carrier SS Ohio laboured its way into Valletta, as Malta felt the worst of the Second World War, having suffered from thousands of bombing raids and being on the verge of absolute starvation.
 The Ohio was the fifth and final merchant vessel to make it into Valletta - nine others were at the bottom of the ocean in various parts of the Mediterranean, having been sunk by relentless Axis bombing runs. The convoy brought much needed supplies to Malta.
 In a speech marking the event, the President of the Republic, Myriam Spiteri Debono, said the Maltese re-christened Operation Pedestal ""il-Konvoj ta' Santa Marija,"" endowing it with religious overtones, ""since because of the dire situation which prevailed in 1942, in our ancestors' eyes the safe arrival of fuel and other supplies seemed to be due to a Marian miracle."" 
 This does not seem at all far-fetched, when one remembers that only five of the fourteen merchant ships reached the Grand Harbour; suffice it to say that certain writers refer to this convoy operation as the last Axis victory in the Mediterranean. If this was a numerical success for the Axis, it was a strategic victory for the Allies, since it averted famine and dire straits of more want for the Maltese and the surrender of the island fortress, which circumstances seemed inevitable, the President said.
 ""Today, as we commemorate the eighty second anniversary of Operation Pedestal, we also celebrate the stamina and resilience of the Maltese population and the British Forces and remember the dashed lives and hopes deprived of realizing their full potential, of those who died in the process of fighting for victory,"" she added. 
 ""It would be a waste of time, pointless, if as we remember the hardship of the Second World War, and particularly the Siege of Malta, we are not moved by the injustice of war and of the armed conflict situations prevailing around the world today. The suffering of the populace, in the Middle East, as well as the war in Ukraine, are reminders that humanity has not yet forsaken violence and atrocity but is still employing atrocity and violence, fostering more hatred instead of reconciliation.
 ""To be worthy of our forefathers, to ensure that their loss of life and limb, their suffering during the Second World War were not wasted, the present Maltese generations, regardless of our small size and resources have a constitutional duty to actively pursue peace and strive for harmony in a world which is witnessing a resurgence of human suffering, a perpetuation of brutality by humans against humans, resort to weapons of war instead of discussion and dialogue as tools for achieving and maintaining peace. We owe a moral debt to our ancestors, to combat this trend.""

Exhibition celebrates 50 years of Malta as a republic,newsbook,https://newsbook.com.mt/en/exhibition-celebrates-50-years-of-malta-as-a-republic/,07-12-2024,000114.png,"Tista' taqra bil-
 Heritage Malta has launched The Republic of Malta: The First Fifty Years, 1974-2024, an exhibition at the Grand Master’s Palace in Valletta, commemorating five decades of the nation’s journey as a republic. The exhibition runs until March 2025. Hosted in the Palace’s revamped Uccelliera – formerly the space where Grand Masters kept exotic birds as a status symbol of their power, and today fittingly a hall dedicated to the Republic of Malta, the exhibition features a rich collection of documents, artifacts, and multimedia displays exploring Malta’s struggle for self-determination – evolving from a people ruled by foreign powers to a res publica, and its achievements as a sovereign state. The exhibition was launched during an official ceremony, featuring distinguished guests including national leaders and Heritage Malta representatives. The exhibition also underscores the pivotal role of the Presidency in safeguarding democracy and fostering unity. In her speech, President Myriam Spiteri Debono defined the Republic as “a symbol of a nation and a people that are endowed with the wisdom our forefathers accumulated over the past centuries”. Describing this exhibition as one that pays tribute to the Maltese as a nation, the president accentuated the importance of increased civic education so that “a strong appreciation of what it means for one’s country to be a Republic, belonging to the people, and the people choosing their leaders and mapping their way forward”, is instilled in our youth. Prime minister Robert Abela stated that the constitutional development of the Republic is integral to the very essence of Malta’s identity. Quoting from the Constitution, Abela emphasised that Malta is a democratic republic based on work and the respect for the fundamental rights and freedoms of people. He said that the President of the Republic of Malta represents national unity. “Our country has achieved great things when united”, Abela remarked, noting the significant reforms carried out by the Government in recent years, including the process the Head of State is appointed. The prime minister concluded his address by stressing the vital importance of safeguarding Maltese identity and acknowledged Heritage Malta’s “significant” work in preserving and commemorating the achievements and history of our nation. National heritage minister, Owen Bonnici; Heritage Malta chairman, Mario Cutajar, and CEO, Noel Zammit, also addressed the launch.",Monique Agius,Civil Society
Bolt’s abuse of workers enabled by government’s employment policies: Il-Kollettiv,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/national/130615/bolts_abuse_of_workers_enabled_by_governments_employment_policies_ilkollettiv,06-08-2024,000120.png,"The continued abuse of workers by Bolt and affiliated recruitment agencies is a direct result of the government’s inadequate employment and immigration policies, NGO il-Kollettiv has said.
 “Bolt and its associated recruitment agencies’ model amounts to modern slavery,” said il-Kollettiv secretary Wayne Flask. “Every year, thousands of workers are brought to Malta expecting to find a job and a decent quality of life; every year, thousands of them have to go back to their countries of origin impoverished, humiliated, and indebted to their families.”
  Earlier this week, Bolt reported an alleged drop of 19% in its taxi drivers’ workforce, accompanied by a retaliatory surge in tariffs, after the government announced it will be suspending temporary work permits in this sector.
 “Bolt has flooded the market with workers and vehicles, and is now using its “partners” as a shield against industry regulation. These workers are brought here under false pretences, after paying huge fees and up to 50% of their salaries, and forced to live in squalid conditions as a result,” he said. “Every time a worker is sent back, they are replaced by another, who has to pay huge fees and commission to the agency, irrespective of whether there’s a job for them or not. While workers suffer inhumane conditions and residents suffer Bolt’s increase in “economic activity”, only a few individuals really benefit from this model.”
 He blamed government economic policies for the situation, saying government discourse should shift from “unneeded foreign workers” to “unneeded and unfitting economic policies which are straining lower-income workers”.
 The group heavily criticised the existing 10-day policy, whereby third-country nationals who lose their job and remain unemployed for more than then days are sent back to their country of origin. “It is impossible even for seasoned professionals to find a new job within 10 days, let alone for thousands of foreign workers imported here without any training whatsoever.”
 The group expressed its solidarity with stricken workers, and called on the government to immediately review its employment and migration policies.
 “The government should stop taking haphazard, knee-jerk decisions which have the effect of shocking the system, to the detriment of workers and residents. The mantra of putting economic growth above human rights and the integration of workers in society has led to the normalisation of slavery. The government should show a firm hand in regulating the new markets that have emerged unbridled in the last years, whilst offering support to the affected workers. In particular, the practice of subcontracting workers should be eliminated, as this is the single biggest factor leading to widespread abuse in both private and public economic sectors,” it said.
 Il-Kollettiv also called for a capacity analysis of the various economic sectors to determine how many workers are needed in each. “The number of workers needed by the construction, tourism, catering and healthcare industries must be studied, determined, and capped. This study should also shine a light on what skill sets the country needs, and the government should be providing direction and facilities for these workers to be re/trained.”

Vicki Ann Cremona confirmed as President of Repubblika - The Malta Independent ,independent,https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2024-09-07/local-news/Vicki-Ann-Cremona-confirmed-as-President-of-Repubblika-6736264000,07-09-2024,000123.png,"
                
        

         Vicki Ann Cremona has been confirmed as President of Repubblika during a meeting organised for members on Friday.
 Cremona, in her speech, said that in June, as it does every year, Repubblika began preparations for the 7th anniversary since the assassination of Daphne Caruana Galizia but this year, it invited prominent French TV journalist Francoise Laborde as well as a victim of Mafia who had the courage to say 'no' even though they burnt his shop and threatened his life, to speak. She said that Repubblika's activities around Daphne's anniversary are a primary part of its fight for truth and justice and for that reason, encouraged participation and support, even financially, so that it ""may show the Mafia that Repubblika is still there, will stay there and is not afraid of it.""  Cremona said that it is not easy to take the role of the President of Repubblika when there are so many scandals that crop up on the daily. She stressed the injustice suffered by those who only ask for their rights but don't know any ""bigwigs"" in government and are not rich.
 Cremona said that one cannot but note that the greatest victims of corruption are the sick and defenceless, since these scandals show clearly that it is them who got the worst of it. She mentioned, for instance, the hospitals deal, and the disability racket.
 She stressed that people's identity was also stolen and given to someone else.
 Cremona said that this year, the theme she wishes to develop within Repubblika and its members is 'education and citizenship' since it is not always easy to understand the importance of the need to make big reforms in parliament or the law, such as that regarding whistleblowers.

Planning minister refuses to meet 10 associations on planning issues,theshiftnews,https://theshiftnews.com/2024/11/22/planning-minister-refuses-to-meet-10-associations-on-planning-issues/,22-11-2024,000141.png,"Planning Minister Clint Camilleri has refused to accept a meeting with ten associations that wanted to speak to him and the prime minister on issues connected to planning, the organisations said.
 In a joint statement, the ten NGOs claimed that, on Tuesday, Prime Minister Robert Abela was busy titillating developers with the prospect of even more development through changes in the local plans that would permit unbridled development in every corner of Malta.
 Meanwhile, the associations added, the prime minister continued to take the public for a ride by promising reforms in the processing of applications that were never carried out. The developers were still being allowed to build without the permit being made definitive.
 The organisations that issued the statement include Din l-Art Ħelwa, Flimkien għal Ambjent Aħjar and Graffitti.
 Reform in this matter has been promised by the prime minister as far back as May last year and has been reiterated many times, with no result.
 When they asked to meet Prime Minister Robert Abela and Minister Camilleri, the associations wanted to make two points:
 Minister Camilleri had promised that a draft reform bill would be ready by September.
 It is the residents and their associations that have to bear the brunt of objecting to the applications, and many times, the developers just continue with construction even when the courts later rule against the development.
 This has led to a proliferation of illegal developments, such as Joseph Portelli’s illegal pools in Qala and  penthouses in Sannat, Gozo.
 By failing to correct such an imbalance, the NGOs said, the government was undermining democracy and decreasing the quality of life for all.

"Homelessness faces ‘huge stigma’, crippling victims and those trying to help them - YMCA CEO - The Malta Independent ",independent,https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2024-10-27/local-news/Homelessness-faces-huge-stigma-crippling-victims-and-those-trying-to-help-them-YMCA-CEO-6736265251,27-10-2024,000171.png,"
                
        

         With an acknowledged rise in Maltese homelessness, those sleeping rough are afraid to speak up for fear of labelling and even harassment by society, Anthony Camilleri, CEO of Malta YMCA told the Malta Independent on Sunday. He said that though homelessness is rising, those who are roofless remain invisible to society out of shame and are too scared to speak out about their suffering.
 In Malta, YMCA began in 1976 as a youth group organising events and festivals for young people with a hub in the heart of Valletta, where today the organisation has its head office. However, it soon became clear for the first YMCA leaders that homelessness was a real issue in Malta, Camilleri said.  ""Those who came before me recognized that many young people were sleeping in the streets due to drug use and addiction. This marked the start of our work with homeless individuals. We were the first organisation in Malta to address homelessness, and now, thankfully, other NGOs have also stepped in to provide additional services,"" he said.
 ""Most people are afraid to say that they are experiencing homelessness because of the stigma attached because they do not want people to label them as 'lazy' or 'problematic' or be bullied and harassed simply because they do not have a place to call home,"" Camilleri said.
 ""Homelessness in Malta is mostly invisible because people delay taking action to address their circumstances and are ashamed to admit that they do not have anywhere to live. If they become homeless, they'd rather stay with friends, moving from one place to another, which leads to the issue of couch-surfing.""
 Camilleri explained that the stigma surrounding personal struggles, whether it's homelessness due to a sudden illness or poor life choices that might invite blame, prevents people from speaking openly about their experiences. ""In the past, we often had people coming to us with all their belongings in a garbage bag, and that still happens. However, these days, it tends to be more discreet, with individuals using shopping bags or a backpack.""
 Despite the ongoing local culture of shame, Camilleri noted that in the rare instances when someone experiencing homelessness speaks out, ""the community responds remarkably well.""
 The local stigma surrounding homelessness is more pervasive than many realise, affecting the funding of YMCA, a voluntary NGO, Camilleri said. He explained that ""fundraising has become extremely challenging."" Whilst people are starting to recognize that homelessness is on the rise, there is still a prevailing attitude of, 'It's their fault,' which hinders YMCA's fundraising efforts. ""Our mission is to highlight that these individuals are suffering and the majority are Maltese. Unfortunately, one of our challenges is that we seldom have people willing to share their stories due to the taboo surrounding the matter,"" he added.
 ""While foreigners have traditionally made up the largest group experiencing homelessness, in the past two years, Maltese cases have surpassed those of migrants. This doesn't mean all the foreign cases involve third-country nationals; we also see EU nationals. For instance, between January and June, we had 22 EU nationals, while 166 cases involved Maltese individuals, which is a significant number.""
 Camilleri said that from January to June the YMCA received 43 referrals per month, in other words over 250 cases referred in 6 months, but could only accept 119 cases in the 3 shelters which the YMCA runs. He said that of the 119 cases, 50 successfully 'moved on' to independent living.
 Camilleri stressed that 'moving on' does not mean being provided with a roof over one's head, since individuals who have experienced homelessness and are still attached to this traumatic event have often led to intergenerational patterns of homelessness. He explained that this 'intergenerational pattern' means that parents without a roof can have children who end up without a roof and so on, in ""a vicious cycle that must be broken.""
 ""Homelessness is, more often than not, a trauma, and this trauma leads to the formation of 'homeless' identity often coloured with a set of actions, beliefs and behaviour. So, our job at the YMCA is to actually pull them away from this identity by reminding them that they are more than this temporary state in their lives. Only through acknowledging this trauma, its pain, what led to it and working on themselves holistically, can they actually move on.""
 Camilleri highlighted other shifts in trends of homelessness over the past years. ""When I first started at YMCA, we had only one shelter, and most of the service users were unemployed. At that time, unemployment was considered one of the main causes of homelessness. Today however, all of the people in our shelters are working, and they were employed before they started residing with us. If you were to visit a shelter during the day, it would be empty because everyone is out at work, except for mothers with young children or a few still seeking employment. Most of our residents now have jobs, but their current challenge is covering all their expenses due to low wages and the high cost of living.""
 ""People need to understand that homelessness is multifaceted,"" he said. ""It's not just the person begging outside a supermarket who might struggle with addiction or the person without shoes. There are far more cases than we realise. It could be that the person sitting next to you at work is living in a shelter for homeless persons, and you wouldn't know. We had a case of a female professional, who was homeless for two months after having to leave her home, until she managed to get her life back on track. We've also seen people working in government jobs who became homeless, as well as students currently studying at MCAST or University. These students won't tell you they're living with 34 others in Dar Niki Cassar.""
 He also highlighted that homelessness affects children, who are blameless in their situation adding, ""We have kids who are picked up for school by the bus right in front of the shelter. They go to school and then return to the shelter at the end of the day.""
 ""The issue is whether their income is enough to cover expenses. While it's great that we have free healthcare, some medications still come at a cost. For example, certain medications can cost up to €50. We've had employed individuals who were saving up, but when a sudden health issue arises, they find themselves struggling to afford their medication. In those cases, we've stepped in to assist with the costs.""
 Camilleri went on to shed light on the YMCA's struggles with funding. ""When organising a marathon on TV, it costs about €50,000, a fact that the public often isn't aware of. This means that the first €50,000 raised on the day goes directly to cover the expenses, not including staff costs for the work done beforehand. On the day of the event, all staff volunteer their time, working more than 12 hours without getting paid. In fact, right now, we can't afford to hold a TV marathon every year."" He stressed that this creates a vicious cycle: the lack of monetary donations undermines YMCA's marketing efforts, which in turn limits their ability to attract further donations. He went on to point out that this is particularly essential in a small country with intense competition amongst NGOs, making it crucial for YMCA to sustain its operations and run marathons more frequently.
 Camilleri highlighted that during the pandemic, YMCA established the Platform Against Homelessness, which served as a ""catalyst"" to bring NGOs together to define homelessness and propose recommendations to the government. ""For instance, we advocated for the removal of the requirement that individuals must have an address to apply for social housing, and the government responded positively. Despite this progress, we currently lack a similar catalyst to unite NGOs, particularly in the area of food provision,"" he said.
 Camilleri highlighted the existing gap between food bank services, including soup kitchens and other NGOs that work directly or indirectly in the field of homelessness. ""There is a growing sense of entitlement among individuals asking for food donations. They might have received food from the Food Bank and then go to another NGO, taking more than their fair share. It raises the question: why collect a box from the Food Bank if you're already receiving meals from the soup kitchen? We as NGOs could work more effectively together, optimising resources and minimising instances of service abuse.""
 Camilleri pointed out an additional challenge with food donation. ""For example, if a particular product is provided, where will roofless people cook it? There's little benefit in receiving food if there's no means to prepare it. This is precisely why we've set up a self-service kitchen at the Drop-in Centre to address these issues.""
 When asked about the government funding, particularly the recently reported extension of a €2 million agreement with the Ministry for Social Policy and Children's Rights, Camilleri clarified, ""People mistakenly believe that YMCA is now financially stable because of the renewal of the agreement. While this package is designed to provide financial support for the services offered at our residential facilities, it is still not enough. YMCA also operates a Drop-In Centre that caters for 40 to 60 individuals daily, along with outreach initiatives that this year delivered over 33 activities, engaging 848 young people. Additionally, we offer prevention initiatives that include 685 sessions of counselling and psychotherapy, none of which receive external funding. YMCA also benefits from a 3-year agreement with Agenzija Zghazagh through Invest Scheme that supports some of our youth work initiatives but to be able to cover the remaining costs, YMCA relies on fundraising and monetary donations. To sustain our entire operation, YMCA requires between €900,000 and €1 million annually.""
 When asked about the recent statistics released by the Ministry for Social Policy and Children's Rights, which indicated significant decreases in poverty and material deprivation alongside record-low unemployment despite the rising number of homeless Maltese individuals, Camilleri responded, ""From our cases and YMCA's research, largely due to gaps in national statistics on homelessness, we've identified two key issues. Firstly, society is becoming more fragmented, leading to weakened relationships and increased family issues. Secondly, the dissolution of social classes has financial implications, resulting in critical family conflicts that sometimes contribute to separation and divorce. There is a stark divide between individuals who are financially stable, enjoying higher salaries and greater disposable income and those who remain in poverty, as many still struggle with limited spending power amidst rising food and rental costs.""
 He continued: ""While some might argue that rents haven't increased but have merely been adjusted, I understand the reasoning behind this perspective. However, we must recognize that this leaves many people behind. The government needs to acknowledge the importance of progress but should ensure that no one is left behind in the process.""
 Returning to the fragmentation of society, Camilleri said, ""I believe there is a growing divide between the upper and lower classes, with the middle class slowly disappearing."" When asked about the Prime Minister's promise for substantial tax reductions for this ""disappearing"" middle class, he answered, ""It's a good incentive because currently, individuals earning €50,000 are taxed the same as those earning €19,500, which simply doesn't make sense. We need to start incentivising people based on their actual needs. This principle should also apply to utility bills; why provide the same incentives for everyone? If I have €10 in my pocket, I shouldn't receive the same discount as someone with €500. There are many benefits available, but we need to ensure that they are distributed equitably, taking individual circumstances into account.""
 Camilleri pointed out an additional problem, that ""Malta does not have a legal definition of homelessness, and this absence of definition can lead to inconsistent practices."" Although living a vagrant life is illegal, the police frequently support the YMCA in its efforts to raise awareness and provide the necessary services to those experiencing rooflessness who are encountered by the police through their work or by YMCA's Y-Visible's outreach team, he said.
 On the other hand, Camilleri said, ""We've encountered instances where individuals experiencing rooflessness were reported living on benches in public spaces, meant for community use, resulting in the benches being removed. There have also been occasions when roofless individuals making use of public spaces were forcibly removed.""
 As the issue of homelessness is on the rise, the need for mental health services is also increasing Camilleri said, adding that this is the feedback received from various organisations working in the mental health sector. He said the increase in demand is always felt during the month of October, thanks to the various initiatives and campaigns to commemorate World Mental Health Day.
 ""In fact, so far this year, the YMCA has 65 active service users who are benefiting from its psychotherapy services, with some of the service users being referred from other services that could not keep up with the demand,"" Camilleri said. ""The most common issue which our therapists deal with is that of general anxiety, whereby the service users are anxious about the outlook of their future,"" he noted.
 In light of this, Camilleri said, ""We often forget that the experience of becoming homeless is also a traumatic one, where the person has literally lost everything. They lost their home with virtually no support and losing their identity and dignity in the process. Entering a shelter for persons experiencing homelessness is usually the last resort when the person has exhausted all other resources so that they do not end up sleeping rough. As part of the care program, we give them the necessary tools, such as psychotherapy, in order for them to be able to work on themselves to be able to move out.""

"Residents, activists protest in Valletta against rampant takeover of public spaces by business  - The Malta Independent ",independent,https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2024-09-22/local-news/Residents-activists-protest-in-Valletta-against-rampant-takeover-of-public-spaces-by-business-6736264323,22-09-2024,000179.png,"
                
        

         Activists from Moviment Graffitti, FAA and a coalition of resident networks today took to the streets of Valletta for a protest march to demand immediate action against the encroachment of public spaces by commercial establishments. Five months after the launch of the ""Il-Bankini taċ-Ċittadini"" campaign, activists and residents declared that despite the many promises by the Government that the situation will be addressed, things are still the same, and that is why they felt compelled to take to the streets in protest.  The march started in Merchants Street - a prime example of the takeover of our public spaces by endless rows of tables, chairs and other catering furniture - and continued along some of the most cluttered streets, including St. Lucy Street, Old Theatre Street, and Strait Street. With placards showing messages like ""Enforcement not mockery"", ""Where's the balance?"" and ""Corrupt authorities"", the activists and residents made their point that the time for useless talk and empty promises is over, and that the people are now fed up.
 Their demands for the current law on outdoor catering areas to be revised and made more robust, for more transparency in the way the Lands Authority issues encroachment permits, and for the right of residents to take action against the theft of public land, have so far been ignored. They explained how despite their requests to meet the authorities and the Prime Minister to discuss the demands and proposals presented by the coalition of residents, the situation was never addressed, and it kept going from bad to worse.
 Residents coming from Sliema, Valletta, Marsaskala, Marsaxlokk, Cottonera, St Paul's Bay and Mellieħa are fed up with seeing their pavements, squares, streets, and even their beaches, taken over by tables, chairs, deckchairs and furniture placed by commercial establishments.
 They insisted that they are not against outdoor catering areas, as long as these do not completely take over the space and show respect to residents. The activists stated that it is evident that the balance between business interests and the right of people for unhindered public access is non-existent. They highlighted that the situation has now completely gotten out of hand, and abuse of public land has now become the norm. The responsible authorities, namely the Planning Authority, the Lands Authority, and the Malta Tourism Authority, keep serving the interests of business, and no real effort is being made to enforce against contravener's and safeguard public access.
 The march ended in front of the Lands Authority, where the activists insisted that the total lack of transparency and secrecy by which the Lands operates when it issues encroachment permits are of significant concern. They declared that it is high time that the deals overseen by the Lands Authority start being scrutinised, and that the abuse of public land for private profits must stop. At a time when our country is being developed at a very alarming rate, open and public spaces are essential for the community.
 The residents and activists declared that after the demands they presented in the policy document and their requests for a meeting kept falling on deaf ears, they were being left with no choice but to escalate their actions.

Fondazzjoni Sebħ says its support to the vulnerable will cost €3 million by the end of the year - The Malta Independent ,independent,https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2024-09-23/local-news/Fondazzjoni-Sebh-says-its-support-to-the-vulnerable-will-cost-3-million-by-the-end-of-the-year-6736264351,23-09-2024,000227.png,"
                
        

         Fondazzjoni Sebħ, a Church‑run NGO, estimates it will cost around  €3 million by the end of the year to continue supporting vulnerable members of society, including children, families, and women and children escaping violence.  Sebħ’s Director Yvonne Mallia turned a spotlight on the meaningful work Fondazzjoni Sebħ has carried out behind the scenes and said that to sustain all its services it had used up €2.4 million last year.
 During a milestone event on Monday morning, Fondazzjoni Sebħ launched its new brand conveying messages of love, protection, renewal, hope and a deep‑rooted commitment to support women, children and families. This was made possible through a partnership and full sponsorship of 9H Digital and thanks to the support of the Digital Presence Office of the Archdiocese of Malta.
 Around €1.8 million of the €2.4 million was allocated to support children in Sebħ’s residential homes, with an expenditure of around €45,000 per child, to cover basic needs such as food, healthcare, education, therapy, daily maintenance of the homes and round the clock care provision. This made it possible for 48 children to make one of Sebħ’s four residences their home — Dar Fra Diegu, Dar San Nikola, Dar Sagra Familja and Dar Santa Tereża — where they can live and grow in a cherished, safe and dignified environment.
 Mallia said that by the end of 2024 the expenditure per child was set to increase by €19,000, reaching €64,000 due to an increase in running expenses and a substantial increase in staff required to offer the children the individualised and specialised attention they require.
 “We are anticipating that if Fondazzjoni Sebħ is to continue delivering the necessary and improved level of support and care to the children in residence, we will need around €3 million by the end of this year,” Mallia said.
 Over the years, the financial support provided by the Church in Malta, and in more recent years by the State through Public Social Partnerships, has enabled Fondazzjoni Sebħ to evolve from institutionalised care to a more personalised environment. Nowadays, the children live in small groups and apartments intended to provide a family environment.
 Mallia added: “Our homes offer specialised care with new forms of therapy. With the support and close collaboration of the Children in Need Foundation, we have developed an in‑house therapeutic service focused on trauma ‑informed practices. This strengthens the holistic development of the children entrusted to our care.”
 Fondazzjoni Sebħ also provides support to families through Il‑Milja, that helps women and their children escaping violence, including domestic violence, human trafficking and forced prostitution, as well as forced abortion. In 2023, the cost for this service for 39 persons (17 women and 22 children) was €415,000. This year, the cost is expected to increase to over €500,000. During the past two years, 30 families were provided with necessary support to address their traumatic experience as well as their psycho ‑social needs, in preparation for an independent life in the community free from abuse.
 The Community Family Service is another service offered by Fondazzjoni Sebħ, aimed at early intervention, reducing poverty, and providing family support and preservation. 75 families benefited from this service in 2023.
 “Fondazzjoni Sebħ aims to enhance the residential services offered by the Church by strengthening therapeutic support and investing in human resources, particularly through the new aftercare services, which have been set up to provide ongoing support to children leaving residential care and to women leaving Il‑Milja as they transition to independent living.
 “To achieve this, we will actively listen to those we serve, engage more specialists and collaborate with other organisations to bridge the existing gaps in support for vulnerable women and youth.
 “Our efforts to raise awareness about Fondazzjoni Sebħ’s work will strengthen our role as advocates for vulnerable members of society, ensuring they have a brighter and more dignified future. Through Sebħ, the Church remains committed to providing a safe environment where children, youth and families can thrive,” said Sebħ’s Director.
 During the press conference, Fr Martin Micallef, the Episcopal Vicar for Diaconia, also pointed out that the Church was this year on the eve of the Jubilee of Hope and Pope Francis had invited all Christians to be instruments of hope.
 “Fondazzjoni Sebħ is showcasing its renewed commitment to being a source of hope for all those who benefit from its services. The Church in Malta is committed to continue supporting this Foundation as it accompanies children, youths and adults.”
 He thanked the management and all Sebħ employees for their impeccable work, as well as the Archdiocese of Malta and the Government for their continued support. Lastly, he thanked the benefactors and the Maltese and Gozitan people for their generosity.

I have just separated and have a child with my ex. What happens to my will?,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/i-separated-child-ex-what-happens-will.1098421,28-09-2024,000229.png,"The answer to this question all boils down to how the separation process happened.
 There are two ways in which you can obtain a personal separation: through a court judgment or through a notarial contract of personal separation, which trigger different processes.
 When a married couple cannot reach an amicable agreement, the only way they can separate is through a court judgment.
 This means going to court, engaging lawyers and finally, after some time, usually years, the judge will decide on the manner in which the couple can separate.
 When delivering judgment, it is highly unlikely that a judge will delve into succession matters. The judge would usually focus on the children, if any, and their custody and maintenance, as well as the property the couple jointly owns.
 Important considerations will be taken into account and finally the judge can make a final decision.
 So when a court issues a separation judgment, it’s crucial to visit a notary soon after to create a new will. If you don’t do this and die intestate (without a will), your ex-spouse will have the right to inherit your assets alongside your children, if you have any.
 Most couples separate through a notarial contract of separation. With this type of contract, both parties can renounce their inheritance rights and revoke any previous wills.
 Even if your separation contract includes this provision, it’s still important to visit a notary to create a new will and specify how you want your estate to be distributed.
 If the separated spouse has no children, you can leave your belongings to anyone you choose without restrictions. However, if there are children and you don’t create a will before passing away, the law will protect your children, ensuring they inherit everything you owned at the time of your death.
 It’s very simple: you will be signing a will to simplify your children’s life.
 If a parent leaves a will, the children won’t have to go through the lengthy and tedious process of going to court to apply for an Opening of Succession. This procedure can take between three to six months, and basically, it is the judge who determines who the legal heirs are.
 This document, issued by the court, has the same effect as a will. Therefore, it’s much easier to sign a will and have peace of mind knowing that your affairs are in order.

Lack of government transparency ‘a hotbed for corruption’ – MEA,theshiftnews,https://theshiftnews.com/2023/09/11/lack-of-government-transparency-a-hotbed-for-corruption-mea/,11-09-2023,000233.png,"The Malta Employers Association has called on the government to “rationalise Malta’s labour force”, raising concerns about strained infrastructure to support tourism and a lack of government transparency serving as a “hotbed for corruption”.
 In its Budget proposals, the association noted how the current labour force suffers from a “squandering a misallocation”.  The MEA called for an end to the government’s Community Work Scheme, saying it was leading to “unproductive employment in the public sector” and a “leaking bucket labour force” as younger generations migrate.
 An entire section of the MEA’s report dedicated to transparency and disclosure called for radical changes in the government’s current practices. The MEA called for “full public disclosure of contracts and remuneration conditions of persons occupying positions of trust.”
 The association also suggested that key authority positions, such as the Attorney General and Police Commissioner, be approved by a two-thirds parliamentary majority rather than direct appointment.
 Addressing employment and human resources, the MEA said that while the influx of foreign employees, which the government is opaquely trying to address through new legislation, is partially due to demographic trends, it is also true that it is “a direct result of squandering and misallocation of our own human resource.”
 The association called for a redistribution of the public labour force to channels with increased demand, such as health, reducing manpower “where there are wasteful practices.”
 “In Gozo, the labour resource has been depleted due to unproductive employment in the public sector. The Community Work Scheme should be discontinued, and employees channelled into productive work in the private sector,” it said.
 The MEA noted how “The rules of public procurement are being flagrantly ignored with contracts amounting to millions of euros being awarded through direct orders,” leading to “an unlevel playing field among businesses”.
 It said, “At best, this creates serious suspicion and a sense of unfairness. At worst, it serves as a hotbed for corruption.”
 It also suggested that all government contracts with third parties be made public “within a reasonable time but certainly not exceeding three months” from when they are signed.
 The association said the construction industry needs to be re-oriented “towards infrastructural projects, rather than on new buildings,” as “it is evident that the current state of the infrastructure cannot keep up with the demand of increased buildings and the corresponding spike in population.”
 Speaking on the local tourism industry, the MEA suggested a more strategic approach, avoiding Malta “becoming a ‘party island’, and potentially attracting the type of tourism other countries are trying to steer away from.”
 Concluding its report on budget recommendations for next year, the MEA suggested the Malta Council for Economic and Social Development as a forum for private-public discussions ahead of the budget, expected to be announced in October.

Data protection concerns about Malta Rangers Unit’s bodycam use dismissed,newsbook,https://newsbook.com.mt/en/data-protection-concerns-about-malta-rangers-units-bodycam-use-dismissed/,01-09-2024,"000259.png,000260.png","Tista' taqra bil-
 The Malta Ranger Unit has confirmed that information and data protection commissioner Ian Deguara has considered their rangers’ use of bodycams to be legitimate, days after Deguara was involved in a meeting with hunters’ lobby FKNK. Last Wednesday, the FKNK claimed that a meeting it held with Deguara and justice minister Jonathan Attard confirmed that only police officers could wear bodycams. It consequently advised its members to file data protection complaints should they spot anyone else using them. But the Malta Ranger Unit – whose volunteer rangers do use bodycams – was subsequently invited to meet Deguara to address the FKNK’s concerns, and the meeting had a positive outcome for the MRU: Deguara “did not order any changes” to the rangers’ bodycam use. The MRU explained that its rangers do not begin documenting anything unless they observe an ongoing crime, and that whenever this documentation does not lead to court charges – such as instances where a verbal warning is deemed sufficient – that documentation is destroyed after a few days. They also stressed that rangers do not enter private property unless ordered by authorities on site to do so. But the MRU also highlighted that the use of bodycams was also motivated by safety concerns: they were acquired in the wake of “several physical and verbal attacks on our rangers.” The NGO stressed that the bodycams were intentionally extremely visible, and that whenever they were activated, a sound is emitted and a red bulb is lit to make clear that recording has started. In this context, it said that it was evident that the FKNK had presented a “misleading image of our operations” to Deguara: one which its own meeting with the commissioner appears to have addressed. Even so, the MRU said that it was deeply concerned about the FKNK’s instructions to their members, and in this context it directly addressed the FKNK “out of concern for the safety of our rangers and for other representatives of constitutional official bodies.” It said that should any FKNK member – or anyone else – engage in violence, threats or intimidation against its rangers on the belief that they could not use bodycams, it did not exclude holding the organisation partially responsible for the misinformation provided. It also urged the FKNK administration to be “cautious and responsible” in its statements, “and not to indirectly incite their members” with information that may lead them to act on baseless grounds. The NGO stressed that its concerns were already being vindicated, citing an individual who threatened that whenever they see someone using a bodycam who is not a police officer, they would strip the person of their clothing, seize the bodycam, and even imply that they would cause them physical harm in the process. It also reminded that it was the duty and obligation of every citizen who knows of a crime to report it and gather the necessary evidence to assist in investigations and strengthen the prosecution’s case. The MRU said that it was disappointed to note that over the past few months, it has made several attempts to meet the FKNK and see how they can work to safeguard the country’s nature where they ostensibly share the next goal. This, it said, was particularly saddening given that many hunters and trappers acted in good faith, with many even supporting the NGO and approaching it to report illegalities they are aware of. In this spirit, it highlighted another comment in the same thread where the previous individual made his threats, one who argued that hunters and trappers acting legally should not feel threatened by people using bodycams for protection, adding that they should be met cordially and offered a coffee instead. Such individuals, it added, deserved praise “because it is precisely this attitude that ensures the sustainability of hunting and trapping.” The FKNK, it argued should follow suit and accept various environmental NGOs’ offer to collaborate and advance their common interest of conservation.",John Paul Cordina,Civil Society
Repubblika blasts ministers' reluctance to answer parliamentary questions,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/national/129808/repubblika_blasts_ministers_reluctance_to_answer_parliamentary_questions,19-06-2024,000267.png,"NGO Repubblika has expressed its preoccupation with ministers refusing to respond to parliamentary questions.
 In a statement on Wednesday, the NGO said that the Speaker's reluctance to act when ministers don’t respond to parliamentary questions is “a threat to democracy.”
 Some government ministers have a reputation of ignoring the opposition’s questions by responding with non-answers. 
 Just yesterday, infrastructure minister Chris Bonett could not respond to questions related to infrastructure works across the country, as PN MP Joe Giglio asked the minister for details on the projects’ projected and actual costs.
 Bonett chose to completely ignore such questions, instead giving the same non-answer to six different questions. Bonett’s replies simply stated that the projects were part of a €700 million “investment” that aimed to “strengthen the quality and security of road infrastructure.”
 “In a parliamentary democracy, government must account for its actions in Parliament.” The NGO stated that Speaker Anġlu Farrugia’s position does nothing to quell government’s “insult” when it refuses to provide information related to its work. 
 Repubblika said that it expects the Prime Minister to assure that his ministers give all requested information in Parliament, as they called onto the Speaker to “put a stop to the arrogance of ministers who think that they don’t need to account for their actions.”  ",Matthew Farrugia ,Civil Society
Maltese language organisations hold differing approaches on how to empower the language - The Malta Independent ,independent,https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2024-09-22/local-news/Maltese-language-organisations-hold-differing-approaches-on-how-to-empower-the-language-6736264302,22-09-2024,000294.png,"
                
        

         Following the 90th anniversary since the Maltese language became recognised as an official language of the Maltese islands earlier this summer, this newsroom reached out to Maltese language organisations to discuss the empowerment and preservation of Maltese language locally.
 The Malta Independent sent questions to the Centre for the Maltese Language (ĊIM), the National Council for the Maltese Language and the respective university student organisation for Maltese students, L-Għaqda tal-Malti (GħMU). Out of these three, the National Council for the Maltese Language did not respond.  The university students said that ""the extent to which Malta is actively preserving and empowering the Maltese language varies across different sectors"". They noted that while voluntary organisations, such as themselves, and the academic sector play a vital role in fostering a deeper appreciation for the Maltese language and cultural heritage, ""there are significant concerns at a broader level, particularly with regard to the role of government entities"".
 GħMU told this newsroom that ""more robust support is needed to bolster language and literature within the national context"".
 ""For example, government communications often contain substandard Maltese,"" the university students described. ""There is also a pressing need for greater investment in local literature, including the establishment of more bookshops, among other initiatives.""
 Additionally, the students highlighted the issue surrounding the recently-founded Centre for the Maltese Language and its lack of recognition; despite being set up in 2023, ĊIM is not recognised by seven Maltese language organisations. GħMU also spoke critically of the Centre's appointed CEO, Norma Saliba.
 ""We strongly condemn the appointment of a chief executive who lacks the appropriate qualifications for the role,"" the student organisation stated. ""This lack of meritocracy, and clear promotion of nepotism, is not only an insult to our language but also to those dedicated to promoting Maltese.""
 In response to our questions, the Centre's CEO, Norma Saliba, emphasised the significance of engaging the younger generation in all efforts to empower and preserve the language. Acknowledging that ĊIM is still in its infancy after being set up by the Culture Ministry last year, Saliba noted that her Centre has taken up numerous initiatives to safeguard and strengthen the Maltese language.
 Saliba told this newsroom that ""to keep a language alive, you need to nurture it"" and said it was greatly important to invest in today's younger generation. Saliba detailed that the Centre's initiatives to safeguard and strengthen the Maltese language are mostly constructed through signed agreements; while many such agreements are signed with the government agencies, other signatories include partners from the private sector's media industry.
 The CEO described that in ĊIM's first year, six agreements have been signed with public entities. These agreements aim to promote the Maltese language by targeting different sectors of the population and by trying to improve the language's online visibility through the use of digital resources that aid in the development of digital Maltese language tools.
 ""Together with the relevant stakeholders, ĊIM shall leave no stone unturned to ensure that we do not only preserve, but also strengthen our national heritage,"" Saliba said.
 Saliba added that ĊIM will be launching new projects and initiatives, such as a national campaign, to emphasise the benefits of bilingualism among children, parents and educators. She remarked that this campaign will focus on the pros in using both official languages - English and Maltese - in day-to-day communication.
 When asked what practices should be improved upon to better empower and preserve Maltese, Saliba mentioned the national campaign, referenced ĊIM's public-private partnerships with media companies (where it offers proofreading services for subtitling and voiceover scripts). She added that her Centre has been ""vocal"" in advocating for Maltese to be prioritised in both internal and external communications within the Public Service sector.
  
 'There is still much to be accomplished' - GħMU
 While Saliba acknowledged that ""the challenges are many"" in this mission, the University student organisation spoke much more critically on what is desired.
 The association stated that efforts to support the island's unique language and its vernacular require robust support from both the state and the private sector.
 ""While voluntary organisations play a valuable role, their impact is inherently limited,"" the student organisation remarked.
 The university students thus provided suggestions to boost Maltese across five categories: reading, writing, media quality, language professionals in government entities and audiovisual language professionals.
 The youths first said that ""reading should be considered the soul of a nation, impacting our social and political life"" and thus stated that ""promoting reading should be a national priority"" throughout all stages of life, not just in education. The students thus said that ""it is concerning that there isn't a single bookshop offering a variety of books at the University of Malta"".
 In December 2023, university students, led by its student council (KSU), organised a memorial styled demonstration at the site of what was labelled as the last bookshop around the area - Minerva Bookshop. The site that once held this bookstore is now set to host an 11-storey hotel. KSU's organised ""funeral"" was supported by 20 other student organisations at the time.
 To improve Maltese writing, GħMU called for the government to provide financial support for translators and writers to be able to work full-time and contribute to the literary landscape.
 On media quality, the students suggested that newsrooms employ full-time proofreaders. GħMU noted that ""national broadcasters must significantly improve the quality of their content"". Using some of the island's most popular television series as examples, such as Love Island and  MasterChef, the students called for the shows' producers to further prioritise the use of proper Maltese.
 ""This does not mean we expect poetic language, but a respectable level of Maltese is necessary to avoid presenting language as a mere mix of expressions,"" said GħMU.
 The students also suggested that all government institutions hire language professionals within each entity. They also expressed their disappointment that the domestic scene has not followed upon the linguistic support observed at the European Union's institutions, despite Maltese only becoming an official EU language in 2004. Maltese was deemed the honour of being an official language of the Maltese islands 90 years ago, on 16 August 1934.
 The students' final suggestion called for the country to invest in professionals who are skilled in audiovisual language work, such as subtitling. They said that this would benefit bilingualism, support the deaf and hard-of-hearing community, and build on existing projects since this practice can be extended to cartoons.
 Supported by the Centre for the Maltese Language, a Maltese children's streaming platform entitled Perlina TV will be available for use come this November. According to Saliba, this platform ""will be brimming with audiovisual content solely in Maltese"".
  
 Safeguarding bilingualism amid contemporary challenges
 Through the popularity of social media and the influxes of foreign workers inflating the country's population, both the student organisation, as well as Saliba, commented on the importance of promoting bilingualism.
 The student organisation even went a step further from Saliba's mentioned bilingual policy, arguing that parents should not have to choose between speaking to their children in English or Maltese. Instead, they believe parents should communicate in both languages, along with a third.
 The youngsters described that knowing multiple languages, ""especially with Maltese as a foundation, offers cognitive, educational and economic benefits"". Additionally, in today's globalised and increasingly interconnected world, Maltese society's widespread bilingualism/multilingualism can provide us with more opportunities.
 They maintained that ""maintaining our unique language while embracing others allows us to contribute more meaningfully to international dialogues, enriching our own experiences and those of others"".
 ""Although the debate often centres on English and Maltese, it should expand to include multilingualism as a whole,"" said the students. ""Learning additional languages broadens cultural understanding, leading to positive outcomes in various sectors, including tourism, literature, the legal system and beyond.""
 On bilingualism, Saliba noted that it is ""crucial"" and that ""upholding an equilibrium (between Maltese and English) remains key"".
 ""While the use of the English language is increasingly gaining ground, there is in principle nothing wrong with that - bilingualism is crucial,"" Saliba said.
 To maintain this equilibrium, ĊIM has agreements in place to provide foreign carers working at the St Vincent de Paul Residence with courses on basic Maltese as well as on the country's rich history and culture (supplied by Heritage Malta).
 The students from GħMU highlighted growing concerns among locals that the recent and ongoing influx of foreign workers could lead to the Maltese language being overshadowed by the country's other official language, English. Secondly, many migrants see Malta strictly as a place for work, and therefore, do not bother as much to engage in local culture. To address this, the students said that ""the Maltese language should be prioritised and actively promoted by the government authorities to ensure it remains a central part of life on the island"".
 To this extent, a survey commissioned by ĊIM this past February found that 84.3% of Maltese citizens agree that foreigners who live in Malta should learn the Maltese language, Saliba highlighted.
 When questioned about maintaining the Maltese language's unique vernacular, the chief executive told this newsroom that ""this is definitely not something that ought to fall squarely upon ĊIM's shoulders"". Instead, she is of the opinion that certain jargon should be taught to children during their formative years and that certain appropriate terminology should be sought on the media.
 Both the GħMU and Saliba agreed that we should be proud to have Maltese as our own unique language. While Saliba highlighted the Maltese language's unique characteristics, adding that it is a privilege for our small nation to have its own language, and a luxury for Maltese to be recognised officially at local, international and at EU level, the student organisation responded with a more historical perspective.
 GħMU told this newsroom that ""the Maltese language is a living testament to our history, reflecting centuries of influence from various cultures that have shaped the island"". The students also iterated that having a unique language fosters a local sense of belonging and community among its speakers, strengthening social bonds, and acting as a strong social connection through our shared identity.

Opinion: The caring society,theshiftnews,https://theshiftnews.com/2023/11/24/opinion-the-caring-society/,24-11-2023,000295.png,"Among the proposals included in a public consultation document issued by the Social Policy and Children’s Rights Ministry is a ban on cigarette sales to individuals born after a due date. Such proposals show a healthier side of our political society.
 Let’s face it – it is the kind of decision that is vote-neutral. Few, if any, of the yet-to-be-born persons would hold a grudge against a government for depriving them of the choice to smoke themselves sick.
 Also, the voting repercussions would, in any case, be incurred by another generation of politicians altogether. There is not much damage for those taking the decision now. It’s not the point I want to make, though- I’m more interested in highlighting how we are in dire need of this kind of legislative intervention in our society. Laws that plan create safety nets for the vulnerable that aspire to a better future.
 In retrospect, we should have been legislating this way in the early nineties as warnings started to filter on climate change and sustainability.
 A caring society would have gone beyond what turned out to be sterile measures such as polluter pays or Corporate Social Responsibility. That was a more challenging call than outlawing tobacco for future generations.
 When you ask people to sacrifice their way of life to hope for a better future, you start hitting brick walls.
 Therein lies the Gordian Knot.
 Our political system was conceived to have a select group of planners catering for the welfare of all of society. Beyond representation, there was also a guarantee that politics was at the service of the common good. The equation faltered, though, when politicians realised that legislating for people’s immediate gains and comfort was far more popular than working out the tougher rules that would guarantee an investment in a better future.
 The modern political class goes to great lengths to seem to be the conscientious legislator we all expect. In Italy, for example, the representatives spent hours of debate before introducing a bill prohibiting “synthetic meat”. In the land of salami,  prosciutti and  mortadella, the idea of synthetic meat was declared to be anathema. Pity there is no such thing as synthetic meat, anywhere.
 The Maltese government, on the other hand, is preparing a new law to criminalise virginity testing. There is no information on whether such tests are carried out in Malta, but if there is a law to criminalise them, it’s always good, right? Just in case.
 Back to the laws for a better future.
 Our collective administrative framework currently seems to run solely for the benefit of enterprise, development and exploitation. It’s an age-old cliché, but it does apply to the country of building permits, concrete expansion and destruction of the last few trees left standing.
 Future planning? Forget it. It is too expensive vote-wise. It causes too much discomfort.
 The laws that we have in place, the legislators that we choose to enact and amend them, these all reflect the society that we live in.
 Ask yourself, hand on heart, do you think you live in a caring society? Do we factor in the lives of our future generations?

Malta Women’s Lobby highlights underestimation of risk faced by victims of intimate partner violence - The Malta Independent ,independent,https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2024-08-13/local-news/Malta-Women-s-Lobby-highlights-underestimation-of-risk-faced-by-victims-of-intimate-partner-violence-6736263449,13-08-2024,000317.png,"

 
 The Malta Women's Lobby said Tuesday is deeply saddened and horrified with yet another femicide - that of Nicolette Ghirxi in her own home in Birkirkara.
 This heartbreaking event highlights the urgent need to address the often-underestimated dangers faced by victims of intimate partner violence, the lobby said in a statement.
 Research consistently shows that victims of violence from their partners, particularly those experiencing severe psychological trauma, may underestimate their risk of future violence. This underestimation can lead to a lack of engagement in crucial safety planning, leaving them vulnerable to further harm
 It is imperative that we, as a society, recognise the signs of such risks and provide adequate support to those who may not fully perceive the danger they are in, the lobby group said. It is also imperative for institutions offering support to potential victims to take any form of threat seriously, and it should not be the victim who assesses the risk posed, but the professionals working in the field, who are knowledgable of the fact that victims may not in a position to gauge the level of danger that they are in.
 Ms. Ghirxi's tragic death is a stark reminder of the persistent threat that intimate partner violence poses to women. Despite Johnston's ongoing harassment and the clear danger he represented, this heinous act was not prevented. We must ask ourselves: how can we better protect women like Nicolette from escalating violence? Could more have been done the moment that the victim alerted the authorities that her harasser was on the island? These are legitimate questions that we are now all asking ourselves.
 The Malta Women's Lobby calls for immediate action to ensure that victims of intimate partner violence are given the tools and support they need to understand and assess their risk. This includes:
 -    Enhanced Support Services: Strengthening the resources available to victims, including psychological support, legal aid and emergency housing, to help them recognize the severity of their situation and take necessary steps to protect themselves.
 -    Improved Risk Assessment Training: Ensuring that all professionals who interact with victims of intimate partner violence-such as police officers, social workers and healthcare providers-are thoroughly trained in risk assessment and safety planning.
 -    Public Awareness Campaigns: Increasing public awareness of the signs of intimate partner violence and the resources available to those in need. It is crucial that friends, family members, and colleagues know how to support someone who may be at risk.
 -    Policy Reforms: Urging policymakers to review and strengthen laws related to stalking, harassment, and intimate partner violence, ensuring that they provide adequate protection for victims.

British royal family discussing how it can help ‘maximise’ Villa Guardamangia’s potential - Minister - The Malta Independent ,independent,https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2024-10-31/local-news/British-royal-family-discussing-how-it-can-help-maximise-Villa-Guardamangia-s-potential-Minister-6736265359,31-10-2024,000330.png,"
                
        

         The British royal family is discussing how it can help the Maltese government “maximise” Villa Guardamangia’s potential, Culture Minister Owen Bonnici said on Thursday, as he also announced that the first tenders for the house are set to be issued.
 The minister was speaking at a press conference at Villa Guardamangia itself in Pieta.
 Villa Guardamangia is the only house outside of the United Kingdom which British monarchs Elizabeth II and Prince Philip ever called their permanent residence, as they resided there between 1949 and 1951 – two years after their marriage and before Elizabeth II was crowned as Queen.  It was acquired by Heritage Malta some years back, and the government recently announced that it had acquired €10.2 million in funding from the European Regional Development Fund for its restoration. 
 Bonnici noted that in her subsequent visits to Malta, the Queen had also recalled the island with a sense of nostalgia, and said that Prince Edward – who visited the island recently to mark Malta’s 60
 He said on Thursday that Malta securing European funding means that the first tenders may be issued in order for restoration work to begin.  Restoration work is expected to take between four and six years.
 “Once finished, it will be for the people to enjoy,” Bonnici said.
 It may also include some contributions from the Royal Family itself.  Bonnici told journalists that when Prince Edward visited the house he was informed that the current reigning monarch King Charles has a lot of interest in the house as well.
 “The King is in talks with his brother Prince Edward and with the Royal Family to see how we can pull one rope so the enormous value in this house can be maximised,” the minister said.
 Speaking more generally, Bonnici said that 2025 will see work on 40 different restoration projects, as the government aims to continue to safeguard Malta’s heritage “and give quality to the people.”
 The Main Guard building in St George’s Square in Valletta is currently subject to a €600,000 restoration, while the Jesuit Church in Valletta will also be subject to restoration works costing around  €4.5 million, the minister said.
 Other projects mentioned were Vendome Tower in Marsaxlokk, the former tram station in Marsa, part of St Catherine’s Church in Zejtun, the Timber Gates in Mdina, the Ghajn tal-Hasselin in Marsaxlokk, and the Chapel dedicated to Our Lady of Victories in Birkirkara.
 Bonnici also said that work at the Maritime Museum will continue, with completion envisaged for 2027, and that Villa Portelli in Kalkara will be opened to the public in phases following an €800,000 restoration.
 He also announced that the first of two tenders for the Culture and Arts Hub in Marsa is set to be issued by Festivals Malta in the coming weeks.  This long-awaited project includes facilities for carnival enthusiasts and the government has secured  €15 million in EU funding for this.
 Bonnici also said that a Sculpture Garden will be built behind the recently opened MICAS Galleries in an investment of €600,000 and also announced that the Public Broadcasting Service’s Malex House will see work in order for an underground car park and new state-of-the-art studios be built.
 He also said that the Ministry will be assisting Maltese artists to participate in the upcoming Biennale in Gwangju in South Korea.
 “Arts and culture are the soul of a people. A quality country is not just discerned from its economic success but also from how much it protects its arts and culture,” Bonnici said.

Centenary of the Malta pavilion at the 1924 British Empire Exhibition,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/centenary-malta-pavilion-1924-british-empire-exhibition.1091245,21-06-2024,"000459.png,000460.png,000461.png,000462.png,000463.png,000464.png,000465.png,000466.png","In 1923, when plans were drawn up for the Malta pavilion at the 1924 British Empire Exhibition, Edward Tancred Agius (1849-1924) was a significant figure representing Maltese interests in London and the UK.
 Edward had set up business in the City of London in 1869, aged 19. With the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, he saw an opportunity to ship coal out of England to fuel the Royal Navy based in Malta and other bases around the world.
  Edward married Maria Concetta Muscat at St Catherine’s church, Valletta in 1873. He returned to London to live in Hampstead for the rest of his life but spent several months each year in Malta, especially when his four daughters married Maltese men and raised their families in Malta.
 Edward developed other businesses along the way, including the import of the first buses to Malta in 1905 and operated the first bus service with his brother-in-law, Joseph Muscat.
 In 1904, Edward’s brother was consecrated Archbishop Ambrose Agius and appointed as Pius X’s Apostolic Delegate to the Philippines. At the same time, Edward was appointed a Lay Chamberlain of the Sword and Cape. 
 Edward became the Maltese government’s spokesman in London and represented Malta at such events as the coronation of George V in 1911. He was instrumental in ensuring that the Malta pavilion was built and ready for the exhibition’s opening day. 
 In 1923, there was a preliminary exhibition to encourage the industry to participate and, besides medals, monetary prizes were also given. Dr Ugo Mifsud (later prime minister of Malta) was the local chairman of the special exhibition committee, while Edward Tancred Agius, president of the Malta Association in London, was appointed Commissioner for Malta at the exhibition. Ugo Mifsud was Edward’s nephew by his sister-in-law Philomena Muscat.
   The pavilion was modelled on a Maltese fort with the front entrance as the gateway to Mdina and the side doors as one of the gateways to Vittoriosa. We can ascertain from photos that the structure was about 60 feet square and 20 feet high. It had three rooms to show ‘Industrial Malta’, ‘Malta under the Knights’ and ‘Prehistoric Malta’.
 The ‘Malta Under the Knights’ hall had suits of armour borrowed from the Palace Armoury, in Valletta. ‘Prehistoric Malta’ had two paintings by Maltese artist Robert Caruana Dingli (younger brother of Edward Caruana Dingli). These are now displayed in the museum at Għar Dalam, in Birżebbuġa.
 Major Albert E. Abela, in his book A Nation’s Praise: Malta – People, Places and Events, Historical Sketches, writes: “The Malta pavilion covered an area of 370 square metres. The first prize for the best design of a pavilion went to architect G. Caruana and the second prize to architect Albert Laferla. The main entrance to the pavilion was a perfect replica of the main gate of Mdina, while the two side entrances were reproductions of the entrance to Vittoriosa.”
  The Malta pavilion was the most popular of the smaller nations’ pavilions. The Sphere of July 19, 1924 described it as “one of the wonder shows of the exhibition”. Elsewhere, the Malta pavilion was described as “the most scientifically arranged of the exhibits of Greater Britain”.
 The Times (of London) wrote on May 27, 1924: “Malta is able to convey a lasting impression of the island through the delightful and artistic pavilion in which 50 centuries of its history are faithfully represented. The lace section of the pavilion was the wonder and admiration of every visitor.
 “The Malta pavilion had its own garden with neat paths and flowerbeds and benches, interspersed with kiosks selling lace and other Maltese products – quite apart from traditional Maltese refreshments. The overall effect of the magnificent pavilion and its well laid out garden was to turn that cherished spot at Wembley into a little Malta.”
 Before the opening, a set of postcards was produced and these can be seen on sale in the photo of Edward Agius in the Hall of Knights.
 The 1924 diary of Edward’s son, Arthur tells us that the family (living in Hampstead and Kensington) were present on opening day and made frequent visits during the six months that the exhibition was open. On May 28, the King and Queen of Italy, accompanied by King George and Queen Mary, visited the Malta pavilion where Queen Elena and Queen Mary were presented with bouquets by Edward’s granddaughters, Marie Agius, aged 7, and Suzanne Agius, aged 6. This occasion is recorded in a framed set of photos that hangs at the Casino Maltese, in Valletta.
  On May 24, correspondence in The Tablet indicated that there was no Catholic presence at the exhibition. Funds were soon raised and, by the end of June, a small oratory was built on a spare plot of land across from the Malta pavilion. This was formally opened and blessed by Cardinal Francis Bourne on June 30.
 Sadly, Edward Agius became terminally ill in the following weeks and died at the family home of 3, Belsize Grove, on September 21. His funeral was held at St Dominic’s church, Hampstead and then, on October 10, a memorial mass was held in the oratory at the Wembley exhibition with all members of the family then in London in attendance.
  
 The exhibition was reopened for six months in 1925 but, this time, with no Malta pavilion, perhaps because there was no longer Edward’s driving force behind the enterprise. He was ever the promoter of all things Maltese from the moment he arrived in London in 1868 to his passing in 1924 and leaves behind a diverse legacy of over 420 descendants spread all around the world, mainly in England and Malta.
 Peter Agius is the great-grandson of Edward Tancred Agius. Born in Hampstead and living in Hampshire, UK he is co-administrator on the 35,000-member Malta Vintage History Facebook Group. For more information, visit www.agiusww1/empire.

PN reveals more Gozo flats with dozens of registered residents,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/pn-reveals-gozo-flats-dozens-registered-residents.1097742,09-07-2024,000569.png,"Dozens of people are registered as living in two apartments next to an office block being used as an address by 50 more, the Nationalist Party said on Friday. 
 ""It is impossible for all these people to be registered as residents at a single property,"" home affairs shadow minister Darren Carabott said in a statement. 
 Carabott released the information after Times of Malta reported that around  50 individuals were falsely declared on government databases as residing in a building owned by Gozitan developer Mark Agius on Triq Qasam San Ġorġ, Victoria. 
 That building turned out to be used as an office, a site visit showed. 
 On Friday, Carabott said that 49 other people are registered as residents at the building next door to Agius’ office block.   
 He said that 33 third-country nationals are registered to live in Flat 1, Agius Court, Triq Qasam San Ġorġ, Victoria, while 16 were listed in Flat 3 of the block. 
 Times of Malta confirmed Carabott’s claims through sources with access to a government database. 
 The revelations continue to add pressure on authorities to clamp down on housing and identity abuse, following allegations of a massive ID card racket.
 On Wednesday, Times of Malta visited four Gozitan addresses where dozens of third-country nationals are registered as residents. These included Agius Buildings in Victoria and two locations in Xagħra.   
 Three of the locations turned out to be offices. The other was a block of flats, but a resident of the block said that only locals and Maltese lived there. 
 Carabott also said that the two Xagħra locations - an apartment on Triq il-Gajdoru and a holiday home known as Janique House were supposedly housing 20 and 25 residents each respectively. 
 In his statement, Carabott directly linked the findings to a wider scandal involving Identita’. 
 Over the past few weeks, Malta’s identity agency has been engulfed in allegations of fraud, with lawyer Jason Azzopardi claiming that thousands of people have been granted ID cards on the basis of false documents. 
  Carabott noted that the PN has asked the auditor general to investigate Identita’ and that the courts are also probing the agency.
  The PN is gathering information and evidence from the public regarding the alleged scandal, which will be passed on to the inquiry, Carabott added.

 Now, in its seventh edition, the event is organised by the parishes of Mġarr and Dingli, both dedicated to Santa Maria.
 According to Mario Micallef, an organising committee volunteer, the pilgrimage is firstly an act of devotion to the Madonna, a gesture of solidarity between parishes, and also an ""enjoyable activity"".
 Just before the pilgrimage began, Angele Cuschieri and Rennie Zerafa from Puttinu Cares - a charity that supports Maltese patients receiving treatment abroad - thanked the participants and spoke of the ongoing need for funds to assist patients and their families.
 The pilgrimage started in Mġarr, where Fr Noel Vassallo addressed participants. The group then passed through several localities, including Mosta, Attard, Mrieħel and Qormi. The journey continued through Żebbuġ and Rabat, concluding at the village square in Dingli.
 Upon arrival in Dingli, the motorcyclists were greeted by Archpriest David Farrugia, who led them in prayer and blessed the participants.
 “It was beautiful to see everyone come together,” Micallef reflected afterwards. “It gives us an opportunity to celebrate Santa Maria in a unique way”.
 Santa Maria, a feast deeply rooted in Maltese culture, is celebrated with particular reverence in Mġarr, Dingli and Żebbuġ in Gozo on the Sunday following August 15. On the 15th, the feast is celebrated in Attard, Mqabba, Qrendi, Mosta, Gudja and Għaxaq.
 The feast holds historical significance due to its association with World War II. In August 1942, the arrival of Operation Pedestal, a British convoy, was seen as miraculous. Facing intense Axis attacks, only five out of 14 merchant ships, including the vital tanker Ohio, reached Malta.
 The arrival of the barely standing Ohio brought crucial supplies to the island, coinciding with the feast of Santa Maria, and has since been celebrated annually with religious significance.

'Government must stop giving away beach space for deckchairs' - Sandra Gauci,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/government-stop-giving-away-beach-space-deckchairs-sandra-gauci.1098134,15-09-2024,"000794.png,000795.png","The government must stop giving away precious space on beaches for operators to fill up with deck chairs, ADPD leader Sandra Gauci said on Sunday.
 Gauci was speaking at a protest at Buġibba's Perched Beach, where St Paul's Bay residents and NGOs Flimkien għa lAmbjent Aħjar and Moviment Graffitti occupied the small free patch of sand typically taken up by the tables and chairs of a nearby beach club.
 Struggling to be heard against music blaring from the club, the leader of Malta's green party said the situation on the beach was emblematic of a problem affecting most beaches across Malta and Gozo.
 She said that with the blessing of a permit, beach club operators had been given free reign to occupy every inch of the beach and pollute the area with unending noise and loud music.
 “Why should we have to pay to come down to swim and enjoy our beaches,“ she said.
 “I am not ready to put up with this noise when I want to enjoy the beach in peace just because someone has a permit. We resident came to live here to enjoy the sea not to be plagued by rats and mountains of garbage.”
 Gauci said that by continuing to approve permits for deck chairs and tables and chairs, the government was harming people’s quality of life.
 She encouraged the public to speak up and fight back against the encroachment of businesses onto beaches, warning if they did not, the situation would only get worse.
 “We have to fight for every centimeter, and the centimeters you don’t fight for today you will lose next summer,” she said.
  “In the meantime look around you and you can see that work is ongoing,” she continued, pointing to a nearby beachside construction site.
 ”Before you know it they’ll have taken everything and we will be left with nowhere but our baths at home to swim in.”
 Gauci said citizens must demand enforcement and not simply accept the presence of deck chairs, saying they should only be put out if someone asks for them.
 She also called for more enforcement to curb the public drunkenness and lawless behavior that springs up in the areas surrounding these establishments.
 Perched Beach, initially approved in 2006 as a sandy retreat for tourists, has seen increasing encroachment by private enterprises.
 And recently, the Planning Authority approved temporary beach furniture and a mobile bar at the popular bathing location. 
 Meanwhile, proposals to build kiosks, restaurants, and pool decks along the Bugibba promenade have been criticised heavily by residents who fear even further loss of access to the beach.
 Complaints about the way St Paul's Bay has been treated by businesses have been ongoing, with protesting residents last year saying their hometown had been turned into a “pigsty”.  
 Speaking at that event, Gauci said residents were ""tired of being victims of those who only see St Paul’s Bay as a place to make money and completely forgetting residents"".

Don't give space to 'populist instigators'- Rebecca Buttigieg on BA ruling,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/dont-give-space-populist-instigators-rebecca-buttigieg-ba-ruling.1097091,22-08-2024,000874.png,"Democracy should not be minimised by giving space to “populist instigators”, Equality Junior Minister Rebecca Buttigieg said after the Broadcasting Authority fined a radio station for failing to give a platform to far-right Imperium Europa.
 “The right to free expression must always be respected. But when this right is used to undermine the fundamental rights of others and spread hate speech, it is everyone's responsibility to ensure this dangerous narrative does not continue to spread,” she said.
 “Let us not undermine democracy by giving space to those who represent populist instigation, which, apart from being dangerous, lacks basic facts,” the junior minister said on the BA's decision.
 Buttigieg pointed out that she did not want to go into the legal merits of the case, but wanted to express her opinion nonetheless.
 Imperium Europa's Norman Lowell, a Nazi sympathiser who was convicted of inciting racial hatred, filed a complaint with the BA over RTK's decision not to invite him on its radio programme during this European Parliament election campaign.
 On Wednesday, the BA fined the radio station €4,660 for failing to invite Imperium candidates.
 The decision has sparked a wave of protests, with RTK, PEN Malta and the Institute of Journalists among those describing it as dangerous. 
 When contacted, Broadcasting Minister Owen Bonnici was cautious in his reply:
 “It has to be made clear that the Broadcasting Authority is an independent entity established by the constitution and acts autonomously from the government of the day,” a spokesperson for the minister said.
 “Issues of legal interpretation of provisions which, directly or indirectly, impinge on editorial discretion always need to be tackled very delicately and in the light of the principles relative to freedom of expression - particularly when the medium is privately owned,” the ministry said.
 The spokesperson said the case is still under judicial procedures, and the ministry will be in a better position to give its views when the case is closed.
 'I fully support RTK's position' - shadow broadcasting minister
 Shadow broadcasting minister Claudette Buttigieg said the BA’s decision completely breaches the principle of editorial freedom and she fully supported RTK's position.
 “The BA should stop policing private stations and focus more on the public broadcaster,” the PN MP said.
 The laws governing the BA should be revisited to reflect contemporary reality, she said, adding: “The concept of bias and balance should not outweigh the fundamental concept of liberty.”

"Caritas welcomes budget measures, warns low-income families might still struggle",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/caritas-welcomes-budget-measures-warns-lowincome-families.1100344,31-10-2024,000915.png,"Caritas on Thursday welcomed budget measures which it said strengthened social well-being and inclusion, however, it warned that families on low income will still struggle to keep up with basic expenses.
 Earlier this year, a study commissioned by the charity showed that the cost of food for low-income families has risen by up to 50% over the past four years with families with children barely earning enough money to cover basic life expenses.
 This meant that the cost of feeding a family of four shot up by €3,543 in four years.
 On Thursday Caritas Malta said the budget aimed for an economy based on quality of life and skills and the charity welcomed initiatives such as social security credit for those who completed a drug rehabilitation programme. 
 However, it said it hoped that, in the future, the government would consider temporary housing for rehabilitated people or those who completed a jail sentence and have nowhere to live.
 It also acknowledged an increase in minimum wage and adjustment of tax bands, however, it said families depending on a minimum salary will still struggle to cover basic expenses.
 Caritas added that the eligibility criteria - including maximum net income of €25,149 - for rent subsidy needed to be revised. It also noted that families with low income could not access so-called 'green investment'.
 And while an increase in pensions was welcome, there were still elderly couples who were struggling to make ends meet since they depended on one pension.
 Caritas also urged the government to invest in trade schools and ensure craftsmanship did not die with the older generations.

"Watch: ‘Pay €150 taxes, even if you earn €10,000’",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/pay-150-taxes-even-earn-10000.1096397,08-07-2024,000757.png,"An official at a major cab driver recruitment company has been filmed telling a worker that if he accepts a job with them, he will only have to pay €150 monthly in taxes at most, even if he makes €10,000 worth of trips.
 Video footage sent to Times of Malta shows an official at WT Global and an owner of Ferruggia Fleet – two of Malta’s largest cab driver employers – telling workers they will engage them on minimum wage contracts regardless of their earnings.
 It means they would still only pay tax on a declared minimum wage.
 Non-EU cab drivers in Malta, legally referred to as ‘third country nationals’, must be employed by companies, known as ‘fleets’,  which provide drivers for platforms like Bolt, Uber and E-cabs. Despite picking up riders through the Bolt application, these drivers are not employed or paid directly by Bolt but by fleets that are their legal employers.
  The video footage was taken at the offices of the two companies and shows officials speaking to drivers who went to inquire about salaries and working conditions on different occasions over the past months.
 Sources in the ride-hailing industry believe the practice of offering such contracts is widespread throughout the sector, not just within these two companies. Sources close to the government confirmed these two companies are among those subject to investigations by the authorities into their operations and finances, as well as worker exploitation.
 Times of Malta is informed that applicants are often unaware that the contracts being offered are unlawful.
 The two companies deny any wrongdoing.
 The footage shows the officials describing the details of the contract system.
 It is common for a driver to make €8,000 worth of trips in a month, one official at WT Global is heard telling a worker.
 Those earnings are then split equally between the company and the driver in what is known in the industry as the 50:50 model, he explains.
 After the driver deducts taxes and fuel and garage rental costs – which he must pay himself – he could be left with some €2,000 or more in hand.
 If a driver were to agree to this arrangement, the official explains, it would mean they could be pocketing that much money while both driver and company will together pay less than €300 in taxes and social security.
 Times of Malta is blurring the entire footage to protect the identity of the people who recorded the videos.
 The WT Global official told one driver: “On contract we just mention the minimum salary, which is €12,000 something per year, as per Maltese law, and according to that salary, your tax and social security will be… approximately €130, €150 maximum.”
 He elaborated to another: “Even if you make €10,000, because it’s a commission-based job and on your contract you have minimum salary.”
 “And this is normal, eh, they reach €8,000 [monthly] easily,” he tells a third driver.
 The law allows employers to pay performance-based commission to their employees but both must declare it and pay taxes on it.
 In another video recorded at the same office, the same official tells a driver some drivers work 30 days a month and make €400 per day, which they then equally split with the company.
 At Ferruggia Fleet, a company owner also explained to the driver, by way of example, that if he makes €10,000 gross in a month, that will be split 50:50 between him and the fleet.
 Later, he tells him: “In the contract you’re going to have the minimum wage but you can also ask to have a slightly higher salary, to pay more tax, so you can call your family to come.”
 Drivers who have previously worked for the two companies confirmed to Times of Malta they were engaged with minimum wage contracts and, at the end of some peak summer months, would pocket as much as €4,000 a month, after splitting the earnings with the company and after paying fuel costs and taxes.
 “Whenever a customer pays cash, my employer tells me to keep it. The rest of the money is paid to me via Revolut,” one driver stated.
 Another driver in the job for several years confirmed he worked with a similar system and his employment contract said he earned just over €900 gross monthly. Drivers, however, do not make as much money during the off-peak winter months. “In summer, I earn between €2,500 and €3,000 a month in my pocket. In winter it’s around €1,000 or a bit less” one driver said.
 In summer, he works up to a staggering 16 hours daily to make up for the slower months, he added, and in winter he drives for around 12 hours daily to make enough money to get by.
 The contracts also mention paid sick leave, vacation leave and other statutory benefits but none of that was given, the drivers who spoke to Times of Malta said.
 In the footage, the WT Global official confirms this, telling one driver he will be allowed to go on vacation and take sick leave but he will not be paid for them.
 Times of Malta sent clips of the recordings to both companies and both denied any wrongdoing.
 WT Global said: “Any information regarding conditions of work is communicated solely through our Human Resources Department.  The audio seems to depict two non-Maltese nationals whose first language is not English speaking on this subject.  We have no such person working in our HR.  Thus, this person cannot be described as a company official.
 “Thus, while the audio is not clear, at best it represents a wrong assumption of our conditions of work by someone engaging in a conversation with a third party. Furthermore, throughout the audio, the person is not giving clear answers and, at a point, refers the person to HR.”
 Times of Malta was able to confirm – through publicly available information online – that the official seen in all videos taken at WT Global states he works in human resources for the company.
 Online, he describes himself as “Operations Assistant Manager, United Human Resource – WT Global”’.
 The company went on to say: “To be even more specific, the audio claims that costs related to tyres, repairs, maintenance and garaging are accounted as business expenses and not employee costs. WT Global does not attribute these business expenses and garage costs to our employees. Also, we cover vehicle insurance related costs ourselves.
 “Additionally, our employees are not compensated on a commission basis. Couriers are paid using a percentage model ensuring the minimum wage and other entitlements at all times irrespective of business cycles, while rewarding efficient individuals.”
 It said the company is continuously checked by the Department of Industrial and Employment Relations (DIER).
 “We reserve the right to take any further legitimate action to protect our company,” it said.
 Ferruggia Fleet replied through its lawyer, saying: “The client is of the understanding that all its employment and accounting books are in order, and is fully prepared to cooperate with the relevant authorities should they have any further questions or concerns about our operations.
 “The client would also like to disclose that it has consistently worked towards achieving new levels of fairness and employee welfare.”
 Last month, Times of Malta reported how the premises of both companies, along with that of another recruitment agency – Mela Cleaning – were raided by Jobsplus officials as part of an investigation into employee abuse.
 The investigations are mostly focused on drivers’ working conditions and alleged worker exploitation in an industry that has been the hotbed of controversy since it mushroomed during the last few years.
 The companies also employ food couriers, who have often protested on the streets and complained to the media that they are forced to work inhumane hours just to earn a living income.
 Meanwhile, earlier this year, MaltaToday had already reported how WT Global’s “murky” accounts paint a picture of what seems to be “a small empire built on the cheap labour of its workers”.
 Times of Malta sent questions to Bolt, which, though not the drivers’ direct employer, is Malta’s largest cab platform, which both companies’ drivers use to operate. Bolt said it was unaware “of these allegations or arrangements and take(s) such reports extremely seriously”.
 A company spokesperson said: “Bolt does not employ drivers itself and does not have visibility nor authority over the content of the contractual relationship between the fleet operators and their drivers.”
 “All drivers are either providing transportation services independently or engaged by independent, third-party entities (fleet operators) to provide transportation services on their behalf, while Bolt provides the platform and technology to connect the drivers with their prospective passengers,” they said, adding this is a common model in the sector globally and in Malta.
 “Our goal is to provide a reliable and affordable electronic platform where transportation services are made available to passengers through the fleets and their registered drivers while ensuring fairness for all those forming part of this marketplace.
 “Bolt relies on the relevant authorities to issue approvals, licences and documentation, which are required for fleets and drivers to operate lawfully, and such authorisations are an essential prerequisite for any registration on the Bolt platform.”
 Bolt said it will terminate its agreements with any fleet operators if they are found to be in breach of law or involved in any kind of malpractice in breach of their contract.
 E-cabs would not confirm or deny whether they work with either company, saying only: ""The eCabs ride-hailing platform is open to all drivers and fleets that are licensed to work in this industry"".
 It said that following the ""serious allegations"" it is awaiting guidance from the regulators and national authorities on whether the two operators are deemed compliant by law.

Syrians in Malta celebrate Assad's fall after 13 years of war,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/syrians-malta-celebrate-assad-fall-13-years-war.1102166,12-08-2024,"000780.png,000781.png","Updated 5.50pm with comments
 Syrians in Malta took to the streets on Sunday morning to celebrate the fall of the Baath rule after 50 years in power.
 Some joined carcades, waving Syrian flags and cheering. Others joined the peaceful celebrations on foot, including in the Ħamrun Fra Diegu Square.
  Like fellow countrymen across the globe, Syrians in Malta woke up to news that President Bashar al-Assad had fled their home country's capital.
 Early on Sunday, Islamist-led rebels declared they had taken Damascus in a lightning offensive. Residents in the capital were seen cheering in the streets, as the capital was declared ""free"".
  Ahmad Kasem, who hails from a village near Palmyra, told Times of Malta: “I can’t even express how happy I am. I have been waiting for this moment for 14 years.”
 Kasem, who has lived in Malta since 2009, chose not to join the public celebrations, instead marking the occasion at home with his family
 “It was like Eid for us today,” he said.
 Sounding emotional, Kasem said the fall of the Assad regime made returning to his home country a possibility.
  “I love Malta. I mean, I have a business here, and my children grew up here and are Maltese, but you always feel something is missing, and that has been home,” he said.
 While Kasem expressed optimism about the future, Mazen Dadouch, originally from Damascus and a resident of Malta since the 1990s, struck a more cautious tone.
 “Let us not forget what happened in Libya,” he warned.
 Dadouch said he was very happy Assad had fallen and was celebrating that with his family, but expressed concern about the geopolitical complexities that could shape the country’s future.
 “I read a lot, and I am aware of all the powers in play, like Turkey, Russia, and the US, that might impact the future, so I remain cautious,” he explained.
 In Ta' Qali, dozens of Syrians gathered to celebrate news of the regime's fall. 
 But in Ħamrun, some people were reportedly warned not to wave the Syrian flag.
 Human rights activist Omar Rababah, who was born in Malta to a Syrian father, said police officers in Ħamrun were stopping people with flags in their hands and giving them a warning.
  ""The right for freedom of peaceful assembly, according to the Constitution of Malta, applies to every person, not just every citizen.
 ""Just like no one is stopped when we celebrate the results of general elections in Malta, we should not stop four cars and pedestrians with flags. Do not discriminate,"" he said in a Facebook post.

In pictures: Evolution of bathing costume fashion ,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/in-pictures-evolution-bathing-costume-fashion.1097198,09-01-2024,"000871.png,000872.png,000873.png,000874.png,000875.png,000876.png,000877.png,000878.png,000879.png,000880.png,000881.png,000882.png","Surviving evidence indicates that, in classical times, men and women swam together in the nude, whether in open waters or in communal baths.
 When the influence of Christianity became more pronounced, swimming as a pastime was actively discouraged. For centuries, public bathing rated as a lustful derangement and disappeared almost entirely from Europe. 
  Times closer to the French Revolution saw some slow revival in the enjoyment of sea leisure. For long, swimmers just stripped to their underwear; dedicated bathing costumes had to wait more than a century to gain acceptance. European legislation lagged behind, first stigmatising public male nude bathing as a criminal offence as late as the 1850s.
  Men and women started enjoying the sea wearing simplified versions of their everyday clothes – in Victorian times, long sleeves, high necklines, trousers and maxi skirts. All in heavy fabrics, like canvas or knitted wool, which, when water-sogged, conspired with natural gravity to weight the swimmer down.
  It was only in the 20th century that fashion started rationalising the bathing costume – almost full circle back to original nudity, covering just the barest essentials, progressively more minimal as time went by.
  It may sound curious that the two-piece costume for women did not result from vanity, exhibitionism or women’s lib but from the worldwide scarcity of fabrics in World War II. Allied governments rationed strictly the quantities of cloth allotted to costume manufactures, ordering them to economise to the max on what was available.
  On the scarce surviving photographic evidence, this two-part feature puts on record the evolution of the bathing costume in Malta up to Independence. I included a few quirks, like the short-lived one-shoulder vest for male swimmers and the harlequin top for pre-war water polo players.

"Mġarr family secure right to carry Santa Marija statue with €40,200 bid",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/mgarr-family-secure-right-carry-santa-maria-statue-40200-bid.1096885,18-08-2024,000959.png,"A family in Mġarr on Sunday pledged €40,200 in aid of the parish church, outbidding another family for the first time in 30 years to secure the right to carry the Santa Marija statue along the village streets.
 ""This is an old tradition. I think only people from Mġarr can understand the happiness we felt when we learnt we would carry the statue tonight,"" said Mario Muscat, who led his family's bidding efforts on Sunday.
 In Mġarr, the right to carry the Santa Marija statue during the village's annual feast is determined through an ""auction"".
 That tradition dates to 1923 - a year after the statue of Santa Marija was brought to the village.
 The 34-year-old Muscat was up against Wistin Vella, who outbid the competition every year for the past 30 years.
 At noon on Sunday, hundreds of Mġarr residents looked on as Muscat and Vella faced off in the shadow of the parish church.
 
 Parish administrator Fr Noel Vassallo, acting as auctioneer, held a microphone to the two competitors' mouths as the sum they bid became higher and higher.
 The crowd gasped when Vella bid €40,000, but Muscat quickly countered with €40,200.
 That was too high for Vella, who conceded.
 As the crowd clapped, Vella shook Muscat's hand.
 Muscat said his family was determined to win the auction this year because several family members had travelled from Australia for the feast.
 Of the 12 individuals who won the right to carry the Santa Marija statue, three are based in Australia, Muscat said.
 Simon Camilleri, Jamie Grech, and John Grima, all born Down Under, have a special relationship with the statue.
 ""Their fathers had once carried the statue, and so they wanted to carry on the tradition,"" he said.
 ""For them, it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, so they are very pleased,"" Muscat said. Eight of the 12 will carry the statue, while the other four will serve as pole bearers.
 Muscat's father had also won the honour of carrying the Santa Marija statue over three decades ago, he said.
 Muscat said the tradition helps raise funds for the parish.
 ""There are villages that spend a lot of money on other things, like fireworks. Here, our money goes to helping the church.""
 Fr Vassallo said most of the money collected in the auction will go towards works in the church's sacristy.

 Up to the Napoleonic era, cargo and warships relied exclusively on brawn and wind power to move across waters – oars and sails. Until steam engines changed all that.
   Slowly but inexorably, the Victorian age witnessed the triumph of steam power and sailing survived mostly as a leisure and sporting pastime rather than as essential to commerce and war, as it had for centuries.
  This feature records sailing vessels in or around Malta through a sequence of antique images. Boats were mostly photographed in the harbours, at their least photogenic, with their sails stowed.
  My selection includes the last remnants of powerful British hybrid warships, on which steam engines coexisted with majestic sail rigging, marine training ships for young seamen and the native luzzu and  dgħajjes tal-latini (with lateen sails) for transport of passengers and light cargoes between the islands and fishing.
  Sadly, almost none of the latter have survived.
   Maltese commercial photographers found these native boats fascinating and marketed many images as postcards, particularly Salvatore Lorenzo Cassar, but even more intensely Edward Alfred Gouder (1870-1942), whose inexhaustible 1920s series of Gozo boats must rank as one of the aesthetic tours de force in the history of Maltese photography. I included many of them in my book Nostalgias of Gozo.
  I have deliberately omitted the work of the German Geo Fürst, the lyrical poet of Maltese imagery in the inter-war years. He made sea craft with sails unfurled central to his paintings and camera artistry.
  I may, in the future, dedicate a spread exclusively to his unbearably beautiful photos.

LGBTIQ migrants and non-Maltese still face discrimination under law,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/lgbtiq-migrants-nonmaltese-still-face-discrimination-law.1092695,26-06-2024,001433.png,"Jules only felt safe to come out as a transgender woman when she settled down in Malta in her 20s. But despite being finally able to start her transition process without fear of reprisal, Malta will forever misgender her and consider her a man because she is from the Philippines.
 Likewise, at 35, Nasier can finally be his true self after making it to the island on the fourth attempt. However, any long-term partner he could have had in Egypt, where same-sex relationships are criminalised, will never be recognised by Malta for family reunification.
 Jules and Nasier are among dozens of non-Maltese who, after a childhood of torment in their home country, can freely express themselves since they are living in a country that continues to rank first on global indices measuring LGBTIQ+ legal and policy frameworks.
 However, they do not enjoy the same rights as Maltese members of the LGBTIQ community.
 That is why five organisations and several individuals came together on the occasion of International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia, Interphobia and Biphobia to call on the government to make four changes to Maltese legislation.
 Aditus, Drachma, Malta LGBTIQ Rights Movement, Rainbow Families Network and The Malta Foundation for the Wellbeing of Society recognise the “remarkable strides” in the LGBTIQ area in Malta, but the country’s asylum system and legislation “fails to fully embrace and protect those escaping oppression for their sexual identity”, they are telling the government.
 Under current legislation, Malta can describe a country as ‘safe’ for the return of asylum seekers even where LGBTIQ identities or behaviour are criminalised.
 The human rights advocates are therefore urging Malta to remove countries that criminalise LGBTIQ people or behaviour from the list of “safe countries of origin”.
  Separately, all people arriving in Malta by sea in search of protection are immediately detained in centres described as “institutional neglect” by the Council of Europe. LGBTIQ asylum seekers have often reported lack of privacy, fear of coming out, harassment, bullying and violence in detention.
 On Friday, Nasier told a meeting of people willing to support the NGOs’ call for legal amendments that when he landed in Malta he initially thought he was in an Arab country and was therefore fearful of alerting officials about his sexuality.
 It was only when he recognised the Red Cross logo, which he had seen in his home country, and met an official who was aware of his sexual identity, that he was directed through the right process that eventually landed him refugee status.
 Persecuted for his sexuality from a very young age despite trying to keep it under wraps from the age of 10, Nasier was so desperate to “choose life over death” that he sold his belongings, including his house, within a month to attempt to flee north Africa through Libya.
 He boarded a boat “headed to Europe” four times. The first time the boat “broke” an hour after departure, while the second and third time he was returned and imprisoned.
 “I knew nothing about Malta when I landed, and when I heard local people I thought I was in another Arab country so I was sure I won’t divulge my sexuality.
 “Nowadays, as a refugee in Malta I finally have a place to call home. A place that whenever I’m abroad I look forward to returning to, rather than feeling desperate to flee.”
 Aditus’ Neil Falzon said that if Malta brought its practices in line with international and European law, Nasier’s success story would not be a one-off.
 “Nasier met the right person at the right time. If Malta implemented quick assessment to determine a person’s individual needs, several others like Nasier would not be returned to a country where their true identity is criminalised.”
 Falzon added that a third loophole in Maltese law was that the island’s definition of family members stopped at “spouses and children”. LGBTIQ refugees from countries where same-sex relationships are criminalised can therefore never be reunited with their long-term partners whom they could not marry in their home country.
 Lastly, Malta’s Gender Identity, Gender Expression and Sex Characteristics Act allows only Maltese citizens to benefit from the right to gender identity. This means that non-nationals are unable to have their personal and official documents reflect their true gender.
 Marie-Louise Coleiro Preca, a former president and head of the Foundation for the Wellbeing of Society, told the meeting that such “double discrimination” resulted in the further marginalisation and vulnerability of LGBTIQ migrants.
 “Many LGBTIQ migrants still meet the same prejudices and injustices from which they sought to escape. The horrendous stories from within refugee camps and detention centres where lack of access to basic services and a heightened risk of exploitation and violence, is often the order of the day. 
 “We know that transgender migrant women are especially vulnerable to abuse, especially if detained in cisgender spaces,” she said, warning it was not enough to “simply acknowledge struggles”.

Academic and literary critic Charles Briffa dies aged 73,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/academic-literary-critic-charles-briffa-dies-aged-73.1098382,21-09-2024,001473.png,"Academic and Maltese literary critic Charles Briffa has died aged 73, the Akkademja tal-Malti said on Saturday.
 Briffa, a professor at the University of Malta, was widely respected for his contributions to the Maltese language and national literature.
 He was a Member of the National Order of Merit, having been bestowed that honour in 2020.   
 His publications touched on a range of topics, from dictionaries to studies on cultural linguistics.
 Culture Minister Owen Bonnici called Briffa ""one of our best"". 
 ""Prof. Charles Briffa's legacy will last forever in his seminal works of literature,  language, and linguistics. He was also a pillar of the educational sector,"" Bonnici said as he offered Briffa's relatives his condolences.
 “He played a great role in honing the art of literary criticism among us,” academic and former minister Evarist Bartolo said as he paid his respects.
 Muża Karkariza, a Birkirkara-focused literary group that Briffa played an active role in, was also among the first to pay tribute. 
 The University of Malta's Department of Maltese also offered its condolences.  
 Born in 1951, Briffa attended the Liceo and went on to study at the Royal University of Malta (today the University of Malta) and Oklahoma State University in the USA, obtaining degrees in English and a postgraduate diploma in Arabic.
 He began teaching at Stella Maris College, kickstarting a teaching career that would take him into classrooms of all levels, teaching English, Maltese, Arabic and Systems of Knowledge.
 In 1996, he completed his PhD in Maltese, focusing on the rhythmic patterns of Maltese literature.
 Briffa lectured at the university at both undergraduate and postgraduate level and also contributed to the university’s radio station, co-hosting several shows focused on the Maltese language and its history.
 He was a member of the Akkademja tal-Malti and served on its editorial board. In 2000, he was appointed the academy’s president, a role he filled for four years.

 Young athlete Tommy Wallbank led the early morning run in memory of his friend, which saw around 30 athletes gather at the Surfside bar and restaurant at 6am.
 The group ran to Qui-Si-Sana before looping back to the Love Sign in St Julian’s and heading back to Surfside. 
 “Although there’s nothing I can do to change that she is no longer with us; at least I can help to keep her memory alive,” Wallbank told Times of Malta after the morning run.
 Wallbank was also collecting donations for Nature Trust Malta and RMJ Horse Rescue Malta in honour of Zammit Lupi's love of animals. 
 So far, he has collected close to €1,000 in donations. 
  Wallbank’s family and Rebecca's parents, Darrin Zammit Lupi and Marisa Ford, were part of the support team cheering on runners and providing them with water. 
 His coach Fabio Spiteri, and former drug addict Miguel Mifsud - dubbed  “the sober runner” - also joined the 19km run, which was the second organised to celebrate what would have been the late teenager's nineteenth birthday.
 Rebecca, known to many as Becs, was only 15 years old when she died on January 3, 2021, after months of battling cancer. 
 Wallbank dedicates his passion for running to his friend Becs and said he owes it to her every time he is successful.
 His athletic career began in 2021 at the age of 15, when he pledged to run 1km for every €5 donated to Puttinu Cares, in honour of Zammit Lupi.
 The runner's initial goal was to raise €500 and run 100km but, in the end, he completed a 1,000km run challenge and raised €10,000 for Puttinu Cares.
 Since then, Wallbank has made a name in the local running world, surpassing his personal best time one race after another.

The people who pay thousands to carry the ‘Santa Marija’ statue,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/the-people-pay-thousands-carry-santa-marija-statue.1096758,15-08-2024,"001665.png,001666.png","For over 30 years, Wistin Vella has outbid the competition for an unusual auction prize – the right to carry the Santa Marija statue during Mġarr’s annual feast.
 Last year his family paid €15,000 for the privilege and as the bidding war returns this Sunday, he is aiming to offer even more.
 Driven by an “act of charity” as the money is used to help the community, the traditional ‘bidding war’ dates to 1923, a year after the statue of Santa Marija was brought to the village – and carrying it has become somewhat of a family tradition for Vella and his relatives.
 It is said the ‘auction’ was first held after the parish was overwhelmed with requests to carry the statue during the procession. It was decided that the team with the highest donation would earn this right and privilege, reserved only to today’s approximately 5,000 Mġarr residents.
 But this has remained firmly the domain of one family that manages to outbid the others, setting an unbeatable target offer every year.
 Vella said his grandfather started the offering over 100 years ago, when he helped pay for the statue of the Assumption of Mary, ordered from Marseilles in France through an agent in Valletta.
 The tradition passed to his uncle before it became Vella’s turn to place the family’s bid.
 Although he has consistently headed the winning team for three decades, Vella said he takes nothing for granted.
 Despite the family track record, he insists it is not a given that they will secure the highest bid again.
 “We do not know who and how much others are bidding,” he said, adding that the ‘battle’ is usually between around two to three groups.
 While his group of cousins has already established a limit for the ‘auction’ on Sunday, and it should surpass last year’s donation, he is, understandably, cagey about the amount.
  In 2022, on the 100th anniversary of the statue, this broke the record, when their bid reached a whopping €46,000 – such was their drive to carry it on that special occasion.
 Prior to that, the record bid stood at €17,000 in 2019, almost doubling the amount offered some 20 years before.
 Vella intends to uphold the long-standing tradition, but “we will only know in those 15 minutes at noon on Sunday”, he said.
 Hundreds of Mġarr parishioners turn up on the church parvis after the Angelus to watch the groups announce their bids in turn, in a nail-biting auction-like fashion, hoping to edge the others out of the running.
  If the 12 family members win, they will meet at the church at 5.30pm and proceed to carry the 800kg statue along the three-mile procession later that evening.
 The group consists of eight bearers and four others holding the forċini – wooden poles with a metal fork at one end – used to support the statue when the bearers stop for a breather.
 Although they do their utmost to be the bearers on the occasion, Vella said members willingly give up their place if they see that someone else really wants to do this.
 Besides the religious aspect of the event, he stresses on the charitable reason behind the initiative, explaining that the parish priest donates some of the money raised to a cause, while a portion of the funds will be allocated to works on the sacristy.
 Asked whether being a statue bearer was a form of sacrifice and a way of saying thank you, or of asking for some grace, Vella said that “when we carry it, we feel very grateful”.
 The feast of Santa Marija is celebrated in Mġarr on the first Sunday after August 15.

"Cost of feeding family of four shot up by over €3,500 in 4 years - Caritas",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/cost-feeding-family-four-shot-3500-4-years-caritas.1097325,28-08-2024,"001706.png,001707.png,001708.png,001709.png,001710.png,001711.png","The cost of feeding a family of four shot up by €3,543 in four years, according to a new study commissioned by Caritas.
 The cost of food for low-income families has risen by up to 50% over the past four years with families with children barely earning enough money to cover basic life expenses, the study found. 
 Whereas in 2020, food cost a low-income family with two children €7,132, this shot up to €10,675 in 2024.
 In the case of an elderly low-income couple, they spent €3,375 on food in 2020 which increased by 33% - to €4,488 this year.
 This emerged in the study titled The Minimum Essential Budget for a Decent Living 2024 published by Caritas Malta on Wednesday.
 The study, the fourth in its series, builds on three previous full studies carried out in 2012, 2016 and 2020. Two mini studies, that focused on food and health, were conducted in 2022 and 2023.
 As with previous studies, the 2024 study looked at three categories of low-income households: two children and two adults, a single parent with two children, and an elderly couple. 
 The study looked at their income – based on minimum wage, social benefits, bonuses and allowances. These were layered over  basic life expenses. It did this by creating a basic basket of goods that included: food, clothing, health items, housing and household maintenance-related items, transport, education and culture, and personal care.
  Certain items were added to the 2024 basic basket to reflect people’s needs. These included: pricing of a capsule wardrobe, one visit to a private doctor, capped heating and air conditioning use (gas cylinder use was decreased), and mobile phone monthly top-ups.  
 Assumptions were made that included: that these families had no major health expenses, were eligible for food aid packages and energy benefits, resided in subsidised housing, mainly used public transport and benefited from free education.
 Apart from the basic basket, the study looked at an augmented basket that, while still simple in terms of living, included certain choice-based expenses:  owning a car, commercial rent, occasionally eating out or ordering take-out, and pet care. 
 The findings showed that low-income households made of two adults and two children need €19,153 for the basic basket. This increases to €33,177 for the augmented basket.
 They spent €10,675 (56% of the basic basket) on food – the biggest expense across all categories. The second highest expense was on clothing (€2,148) followed by household goods and maintenance (€1,793).
  In the best-case scenario, these families received a maximum €21,132 annual income which showed that they scraped through to afford the basic basket expenses.
 The study showed that families with infants and toddlers were at a financial disadvantage as they faced one-off and recurrent expenses that amounted to over €1,800 a year. Expenses included baby clothes, food and milk, nappies and mothers’ supplements during and after pregnancy.  
 A single parent with two children needs €17, 013 a year to afford the basic basket and this shoots to €30,724 for the augmented basket. These families received a maximum income of €20,463 a year with one minimum wage, tapering benefits and other benefits bonuses and allowances. 
 This showed that single parents could not afford little luxuries such as ordering food and owning a car. Single-parent families spent €7,948 on food (47%). This expense was followed by household maintenance and expenses (17%) and personal care (9%).
  Elderly low-income couples need €14,732 for the basic basket or €26,556 for the augmented basket. They spend the bulk of their money on food (€4,488) and household goods and maintenance (€4,516). The latter could be due to the fact that their homes need more maintenance.  
 In the best scenarios, these couples receive €15,974 annual income to include one pension and other bonuses and allowances. This rose to  €21,116 if both received a pension.
 The report highlighted that low-income families could make choices that slashed their budgets when it came to the two major expenses – food and clothing.
  The cost of a seven-day menu varied for people residing in different localities. For example, a four-person family spent €171.81 a week in the southern eastern harbour. The cost of the same items was  €243 in the southern harbour.
  Similarly, picking charity shops for clothes shopping made a huge difference in the final annual cost of clothing. In the case of a family with two children, the cost dropped from €1,916 a year from regular shops to €433 from second-hand shops.
 The study went on to make various recommendations that could support these struggling families. These included:

The lion’s share obviously went to football. But other popular sports, like water polo, rowing and aquatic competitions, some cricket, horse racing, polo, athletics, tennis, gymnastics, boxing, though hardly as frequently, assert their presence too.
  By far the greatest market for ‘sports’ postcards must have been the British armed services stationed in or passing through Malta. Most of the sportsmen belonged to the army and navy – rarely the air force – and the publishers would principally target buyers keen to keep those images as souvenirs or to send messages through the mail. Noticeable is the almost total absence of women, except for a few brave exceptions wielding tennis rackets.
  A smaller section of these postcards records other sports, some so weird I could not trace their name, let alone their rules. Maybe some reader will kindly fill in the blanks of my ignorance. I have selected these freakish sports for this spread. Yes, tug of war and a rudimentary high jump, long before the Fosbury flop. Massive hurdles look more like shin ruinators than athlete-friendly props, and boring, ordinary shoes then stood in for sophisticated sport footwear. 
  These ‘unusuals’ only seem to have been practised in the periodic ‘sports day’, de rigueur for every military regiment or ship’s company, often in dire competition against each other, all sporting the loudest rivalry, later quenched in communal gallons of McEwans, Simonds or Guinness. 
  An annual sports day also became a feature in schools and colleges, though few postcards survive of non-military events.
  Many of these cards, all real photos, circulated anonymously; the ubiquitous Richard Ellis and Salvatore Lorenzo Cassar signed some of them.
