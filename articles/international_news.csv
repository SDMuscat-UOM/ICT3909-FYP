Maltese kajjik ‘Santa Maria’ spotted in French harbour,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/maltese-kajjik-santa-maria-spotted-french-harbour.1096883,18-08-2024,"000189.png,000190.png","Maltese travellers overseas are often surprised by little reminders of home on their travels, but seldom do they come across a piece of vibrant living history so far away from the island.
 That’s exactly what happened to photographer Daniel Cilia this week when he spotted a traditional Maltese kajjik (fishing boat) floating in a French harbour. 
 Against the backdrop of the colourful Honfleur harbour in Normandy, the kajjik stood out to Cilia with its familiar blue and yellow hues and the  Eyes of Osiris keeping watch from the bow of the boat, setting it apart from the more modern vessels floating nearby. 
 The boat bore the name of ‘Santa Maria’, in a somewhat auspicious reminder of the important feast week Malta is currently celebrating. 
 “I had to do a double take when I saw it, had I seen the photo I took online, I might have mistaken it for AI,” Cilia told Times of Malta. 
  After making inquiries with the Poudreux shipyard, Cilia discovered that the vessel, which was built in 1967, belonged to a family who lived in Malta at one time. 
 When it came time for them to relocate to France, they decided to bring the boat they had fallen in love with and had it professionally restored in 2021. 
 “The boat was carefully transported to Honfleur in Normandy, France from Malta in a container when the owners decided to relocate and wanted to ensure their cherished luzzu accompanied them,” Cilia said.
 “Recognising the sentimental value and the potential of the boat, the Poudreux shipyard in Honfleur undertook a comprehensive restoration project in 2021. During this process, they meticulously restored the boat to its former glory, paying attention to every detail.”
 The shipyard also brought more longevity to the Santa Maria, fitting an electric motor to the rudder in a seamless blend of traditional craftsmanship and modern technology.
 “It is a truly unique and refined boat which gets lots of attention because there is nothing like it in Honfleur harbour which is visited by thousands of tourists,” Cilia added.

‘Where are all the films?’ - Drought of foreign films has crews worried,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/where-films.1092699,20-05-2024,"000335.png,000336.png,000337.png,000338.png","A drought of foreign films in Malta this year has pushed dozens of crew out of the industry, as one production packed up for Morocco and another reportedly changed its mind about Malta and moved to the UK, Times of Malta has learnt.
 Several Maltese film crew – from makeup artists to set builders and costume designers – have vented their frustration at not having booked a job in the film industry for months.
 Seasoned industry sources said there was a dearth of productions worldwide that was inevitably having an impact on the local film service industry.
 Some crew who worked on three or four different productions last year have not been called to work on a film or TV series for six months, despite the government and the Malta Film Commission running a marketing campaign urging people to join the industry for “a guarantee of a job in films”.
 The film commissioner had predicted that 2024 would be “another record year” for foreign productions.
 The film commission’s job website opportunityforall.mt is only listing one ongoing production at the moment, a British TV series. And it is “a relatively small production” by industry standards, industry sources told Times of Malta.
 The website does list more productions for the rest of this year – Jurassic World, another two US productions, and one British and one German – indicating that the pace might pick up again in the coming months.
 The website, which has a section listing available job vacancies on ongoing productions, has no listed vacancies at the moment.
 Speaking to Times of Malta, every crew member almost unfailingly – and without being prompted – said they had been attracted to the industry by nationwide campaigns that the Malta Film Commission has been running over the past couple of years.
 One such campaign ran slogan Garanzija tal-jobs fil-films (A guarantee of jobs in film) until as recently as last month.
 “Where is the guarantee of jobs in films?” one crew member said.
 “We were promised back-to-back productions and that was true for me up until last year, but now I have been out of a job for six months and I have nothing lined up yet for the rest of the year.”
 The word around Maltese crews late last year was that there were tens of productions lined up for this year. In November, film commissioner Johann Grech told MaltaCEOs.mt that 2024 was set to be “another record year” for the film industry.
  In a reply to questions, the film commission would not explain the drought and would not say what had changed since Grech made that prediction last year.
 A spokesperson did say, however, that “employment and the value to the economy is also derived by the quality of a production, not just the total number”.
 He would not say how many productions are lined up for the rest of the year due to confidentiality clauses in the contracts with production houses, and to avoid negatively affecting future investment in Malta.
 Film industry insiders, however, told Times of Malta that apart from Jurassic World,  which is set to shoot in Malta for a few weeks this summer, the other productions are small or medium-sized by industry standards. And they were not employing many local crew, often bringing their own over instead.
 Meanwhile the film commission has almost invariably refused every request to disclose, explain or justify its often lavish, multi-million taxpayer spending on cash rebates, marketing stunts, campaigns, short films, award shows and film festivals.
 It was only through a court order that came at the end of a two-year legal battle that the commission was forced to reveal that British comedian David Walliams was paid €120,000 in taxpayer money to host the Malta Film Awards back in January 2022.
 Since then, Walliams has taken part in several other Maltese film commission events – from hosting award nights to reading books to children and starring in short films – and none of the costs were ever revealed.
 Top industry sources say the commission’s overall spend has been “astronomical” over the years and reaches millions in taxpayer money.
 The film commission refuses to disclose its spending, saying this is sensitive commercial data and its publication could have legal ramifications and harm foreign investment. Its argument is that the expenditure – no matter how big – is necessary and worthwhile because Malta is becoming a hub for the world’s best films.
 Meanwhile, Times of Malta has confirmed that a foreign production company that had planned on shooting most of its biblical-themed film in Malta went to Morocco instead.
 This is reported to be a medium-sized production, which would typically employ between 120 and 150 Maltese crew in set design, construction, makeup, props, wardrobe and other roles.
 The production was scheduled to work in Malta for several months this year and multiple sources said it relocated because its producers felt the physical and visual environment in Morocco better suited the film’s theme.
 A few Maltese crew will keep their positions and move to Morocco with the film but the rest are out of a job for months if nothing else comes up.
 One member of the Maltese crew who was meant to work on the production said: “I feel cheated because I was continually told that the film sector was thriving. I got calls every few days and messages reminding me that the Film Commission is working hard to strengthen the industry, and now I haven’t had a job in months.”
 On Wednesday in parliament, PN MP Beppe Fenech Adami asked Clayton Bartolo why the film had relocated.
 Bartolo’s reply implied that it was the PN’s fault.
 “Every person who is trying to turn the film industry into a political football is causing Maltese people to lose their job [in the industry],” he said.
 “So, you’re causing people to lose their job and then you come here asking the minister why the film left. Ask yourselves why these films left. Who is going abroad harming our country?”
  Meanwhile, last week UK news website The Telegraph reported there had been a change of mind about a Pierce Brosnan boxing biopic planned to be shot in Malta – it has moved to Leeds to benefit from the British government’s new 40 per cent film tax credit.
 The website said Malta was to be used to shoot interior scenes for the movie, starring the 70-year-old actor of James Bond fame.
 Malta offers an attractive 40 per cent cash rebate of its own. This granted more than €47 million in taxpayer money to Gladiator alone last year. Although several industry insiders have long warned the model is unsustainable, Grech and Bartolo have defended it staunchly, saying Malta cannot afford to be less generous if it wants to remain competitive in the international market.
 “Ironically, a stream of news reports previously published on the Times of Malta described the financial incentives as generous, and various individuals you quoted implied that they are unnecessary or lavish,” the commission spokesperson said.
 “Therefore these reports are now being proved as incorrect or misleading since similar incentives have been introduced elsewhere.”
 Under the rebate scheme, Malta has handed out €143 million to 54 films and television series since 2019.
 Asked whether the commission and the government were considering bumping up the rebate even further now that other countries were offering a similar one, the spokesperson said the commission “is confident that the current financial incentives are competitive but will continuously monitor competing jurisdictions and the economics of the local offerings”.
 But some industry insiders are now warning that Malta is losing its competitive edge in the industry, saying it is becoming increasingly expensive to shoot here, and that may be one of the reasons why there are fewer productions.
 The rise in costs, they say, is partly due to new guidelines for crew issued by the film commission, which stipulate that as from this year, production companies can only benefit from the cash rebate if they honour a set of new conditions for Maltese crew.
 Among the conditions, companies must not pay local crew less than minimum stipulated hourly and overtime rates, Maltese crew must not work longer hours than foreign crew, must be paid double for working on the seventh day of a week and for working on national public holidays, and must be given €20 daily as allowance for meals.
 The guidelines were designed by Grech and his team to ensure better working conditions for Maltese crew.
 “These principles were not only encouraged and eventually endorsed by leading studio executives but also fundamentally meant equal employment standards for both local and foreign workers employed by productions in Malta,” the commission said.
 “There were numerous situations in the past where unequal standards were present for the exact same job and qualification. Challenges exist, notably with local employers hiring non-EU workers despite the availability of local labour. To address this, we are looking at implementing more rigorous labour market testing (LMT) requirements for employers in areas with a sufficient supply of local workers.
 “We want to ensure Maltese, Gozitans and local residents are prioritised, especially since taxpayer-funded financial incentives are at play.”
  Yet, some crew members have complained of lack of adequate enforcement of the guidelines.
 A few of them told Times of Malta they have had to work longer hours than their foreign colleagues.
 “Our laws do not protect us at all. They aren’t even very clear. I have worked on productions where the foreign crew is treated as workers should be and we’re treated like slaves. This is what will continue to happen if we keep relying on the service industry,” one of them said.
 One insider suggested that Malta needed a more balanced approach to the industry – one that included the service industry but did not make it the industry’s focus.
 “Right now, Malta doesn’t have a film industry, it has a service industry,” they said.
 “There should be more investment in local content. If we are the creators, we can create back-to-back productions as opposed to waiting around for someone to show up. Just look at how Luxemburg, Montenegro and Iceland invest their money.
 “In Luxembourg, they create a film from beginning to end. From script writers to post-production, there are Luxembourg creatives involved, which has crea­ted an entire industry that manages to sustain itself.”
 For a direct comparison in terms of funding, in 2023, 19 local productions were awarded over €1.54 million as part of the Creative Malta scheme, while in the same year, Film Fund Luxembourg granted €3 million to just one production.
 Several film industry insiders noted that there is a general slowdown in the industry across the world, not just in Malta. It happened partially due to the actors’ strike last year and is possibly exacerbated in anticipation of a looming crew strike which might happen later this year.
 But that is not the problem, they insist. The nature of the industry has always been this volatile and sometimes production rates slow down. Rather, the problem is that Maltese crew are fed the illusion that there would be a “guarantee” of jobs for everyone throughout the year.
 “That’s not how the industry works, and as long as we remain so heavily dependent on servicing foreign productions, we will always be at the mercy of the highs and lows of the international industry and the appetites of foreign companies,” one filmmaker said.
 “That is why we have been insisting for more investment in the local industry, because more jobs could have been created had there been more focus on local productions.”
 Even worse, development of local productions has almost come to a complete halt as no funds for local productions have yet been awarded this year, another observed.

The Mosta coach who began life in a Brazilian favela: ‘I feel like I did it’,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/the-mosta-coach-began-life-brazilian-favela-i-feel-like-i-it.1093913,23-06-2024,"000696.png,000697.png,000698.png","When Romeu Romão was growing up in a favela in Brazil he had two toy options – a gun or a football. And after playing for multiple clubs and starting his own football school, he is thankful he chose the latter.
 The professional Brazilian footballer has been living in Malta since 2015 when he was signed to Valletta Football Club. The year he was signed Valletta won their 23rd Premier League.
 But the then 25-year-old had one big problem. He couldn’t speak a word of English.
 “I remember going to my first training and rubbing my tummy to signal to the trainers that I am hungry but they thought I meant that I love Maltese food (he laughed). I went to bed hungry that night because I couldn’t even ask for help.”
 He promised himself that day that he would learn English, having understood that if he really wanted to become a coach one day he needed to be a good communicator.
 Romão’s love affair with the beautiful game began at five years old in Minas Gerais, Brazil. “My dad was my first coach. And I wanted to follow in his footsteps. Not only be a good football coach but also show the kids how to believe in themselves,” said Romão.
 He said his father was a figure within their community who helped steer children away from the rampant drugs and violence around them by encouraging them to take up the sport. “It was a dangerous place to grow up. As kids we would play football right next to people openly taking drugs,” he said.
  Thanks, he says, to his father’s persistence and diligence, Romão signed his first contract at the age of 18 and went on to play with various clubs in Brazil until he was transferred to the Budapest-based team, Vasas FC.
 This transfer was the first time he went abroad. He was trepidatious about the transfer because he couldn’t speak Hungarian or English but was lucky enough to find several other players on the team who could do the talking for him.
 After Valletta, he played with Mosta, Sirens, Qrendi and Msida and has learned enough English to make his dream come true and become a coach, just like his father.
 He got started coaching with Mosta FC in 2018 and has also coached for the National Sports School and Kick Football School. But one of his proudest achievements in life was starting R90, his own co-ed football school that is open to students aged between five and 13.
 “In our first year, we only had 30 students but, three years later, I am proud to say we have well over 100,” said Romão.
 Besides being a player and a coach, Romão, now 34, is also a father of two sons, Enzo and Theo. Even though, he said, raising a family as a foreigner in Malta can be challenging, due to lack of support as well as the bureaucratic hassles he faces, he is proud of what he has achieved here.
 Romão said: “I feel like I did it. I grew up having to count my pennies to buy bread but now I count my money to buy my children and my students footballs, just like my dad.”

Watch: The Australian Tiktok horror series inspired by Maltese mythology,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/watch-the-australian-tiktok-horror-series-inspired-maltese-mythology.1095648,27-07-2024,000808.png,"A Maltese-Australian Tiktok horror drama series inspired by Maltese mythology and the migrant experience is drawing an average of around 25,000 views per episode.
 Ryan Cauchi, the creator of Greystanes, is an Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts Awards nominee based in Western Sydney Australia. He is also the proud son of two Maltese migrants.
  The series, which is found exclusively on Tiktok, is made up of 15 one-minute episodes and is set and filmed in the town of Greystanes.
 Cauchi chose Greystanes because it is a stronghold for the Maltese community and is also where his father grew up.
 Australia has the largest Maltese diaspora in the world – about 200,000 people, according to a 2021 Census. But Cauchi believes Malta’s culture and story have rarely been reflected in films and TV.
  “I wanted to highlight the Maltese culture and give the community a chance to feel represented,” said Cauchi.
 Set in 1995, Greystanes tells the story of 11-year-old Samantha and her older brother Marius. While visiting their Maltese grandmother during school holidays, the siblings discover a dark family secret and encounter il-Ħaddiela, an evil figure from Maltese mythology.
 With their grandmother leading the way, the family must come together to fight the creature − and its curse.
 Il-Ħaddiela is the Maltese mythology figure associated with sleep paralysis.
 Cauchi encountered Il-Ħaddiela for the first time 10 years ago when he read Stephen Mifsud’s book on  Maltese Bestiary.
 “When I read the book, it was like all the pieces came together and I could see this story building in front of my eyes,” said Cauchi.
 The series has been compared to the popular Netflix series Stranger Things but Cauchi said he was inspired by his childhood in the 1990s and the films he grew up watching like Stephen King’s  It or Stephen Spielberg’s  E.T.
 The series features AACTA-nominated actor Frances Duca.
 Even though Cauchi is proud of his roots he has never visited Malta.
 He reminisced about how, during his childhood, his grandfather would excitedly point out when a film, such as Popeye, was shot in Malta. 
 “I would love to come to Malta not just as a lover of the island’s contributions to film but just to see it.”
 Moving forward, Cauchi plans on continuing his Maltese association in film and would also be interested in filming in Malta.

Group rescued eight hours from Malta to be taken to port 'two days away',timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/group-rescued-eight-hours-malta-taken-port-two-days-away.1092773,21-05-2024,"000945.png,000946.png","A group of 35 people rescued eight hours away from Malta and Sicily were instead ordered to travel to an Italian port two and a half days away, despite suffering the effect of hypothermia and dehydration, rescuers say. 
 The migrants were found adrift in a fibreglass boat in the Mediterranean on Monday, according to Search and Rescue NGO SOS Mediterranee said. 
 They were rescued from the search and rescue zone shared by Italy and Malta.
 “Survivors declare having spent three nights at sea and suffer from hypothermia and dehydration,” SOS Mediterranee posted on X.
 “Three people are being medically monitored.”
 In another post, the NGO said Italian Authorities assigned the rescuers to the port of Ortona, in Italy, as a Place of Safety, despite the rescue taking place eight hours of navigation from Malta and Sicily.
 “We are heading to Ortona, on the Adriatic Coast, two and a half days of navigation away.”
  An AlarmPhone spokesperson told Times of Malta that the 35 people, including seven children, had originally left from Libya.
 Times of Malta has contacted the Armed Forces of Malta and the Home Affairs Ministry.
 Humanitarian NGOs have repeatedly accused Maltese authorities of ignoring calls from distressed migrants at sea and even illegally pushing them back to Libya.. 
 Last month, 22 organisations and academics called on Malta to stop pushing back people at sea to Libya, following allegations that 83 asylum seekers in Malta's search and rescue area were allegedly pushed back.
 In 2023, Times of Malta reported that for over a year, the authorities refused to provide data about migrant arrivals, dismissing the request as ""curiosity"".

Maltese Australian woman connects with family after 'Times of Malta' appeal,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/maltese-australian-woman-connects-family-times-malta-appeal.1093021,27-05-2024,"001377.png,001378.png,001379.png","When Linda Coppini Foot’s family left Malta for Australia in the 1950s, she was left with more questions than answers about her Maltese roots.
 She returned to Malta in April and did not know a single soul on the island. But one month later, after an appeal through Times of Malta, Coppini has for the first time met with five of her maternal cousins.
 Linda and her daughter Charlotte arrived in Malta with very little information to go by: a few photos and her family’s immigration documents, as well as the faint memory of rarely told stories about Malta that she heard as a child.
 After contacting Times of Malta to help trace her family, Coppini Foot had an influx of people contacting her with information, including Thomas Zerafa, her mother’s first cousin.
 Just two days after his 89th birthday, Zerafa and Coppini Foot met up at his home, where they both recounted how lucky they felt to have found each other. As his wife, Edith, poured everyone a cup of tea, Zerafa explained that he was orphaned as a child because of World War II.
  “I was an orphan, my father and mother were both dead, and I was in institutional care. I forgot all about my family,” said Zerafa.
 But one memory remained for Zerafa: when he was in the institution at age 15, he met Coppini Foot’s grandfather, Romeggio.
 “He came over to see me at a time when nobody else on this earth was interested in me,” said Zerafa.
 During this encounter, Zerafa remembers Romeggio telling him with tears in his eyes that he would be moving to Australia and that they probably would never see each other again. And they never did.
  ""They forgot all about us, and we forget all about them,” said Zerafa.
 He did not think about his cousins in Australia until he went on a trip there decades ago and tried to trace them but to no avail.
 “It was a huge surprise to hear about Linda and our family there because we never even knew they existed,” said Zerafa. They spent the rest of their morning with Zerafa, who told her stories about growing up in Żabbar during the war, while Coppini Foot shared stories about his family in Australia.
 While in Malta, Coppini Foot also met cousin Emily, who has the same name as Coppini Foot’s mother.
  Emily, like Coppini Foot, is a child of migrants, but her family moved to Canada. Coincidentally, the two long-lost cousins met while they were both on holiday in Malta; before the article, they never even knew the other existed.
 “It has given me a sense of belonging. I always knew I had a relation with Malta but having that connection with people makes it so much more special, and it helps me understand who I am,” said Coppini Foot.
 While in Malta, Coppini Foot only met family members from her mother’s side, while her father’s side remains a mystery. All she knows about her paternal family is that her father, Charles Coppini, was born in 1936 and lived in Unit 1, Block 1, Hubbard Flats, in Cospicua. At 19, he decided to quit his job as a footman and join his siblings, Joe and Tony, in Australia.
 Coppini Foot may still be contacted at e- lindafoot1@gmail.com.

 The Malta Independent leads its front with news that the Justice and Peace Commission, within the Archdiocese of Malta, welcomed the social measures in the 2025 Budget, yet said more should have been done in the budget to secure a dignified standard of living for those facing economic hardships. 
 In a separate piece, the newspaper reports how Culture Minister Owen Bonnici said the Nationalist Party wants to send workers at the Public Broadcasting Service to jail.

 In-Nazzjon meanwhile published comments by PN leader Bernard Grech that the government must stop stealing from the people and stop increasing the cost of living for them. 
 It separately reports how the Nationalist Party has protested in court that Public Broadcasting Services has breached a court order banning the broadcasting of a Budget advert and other politically partisan slots.
  L-orizzont reports comments from economist Philip von Brockdorff who said the country’s economic growth remained the highest in the EU.

 ""Obviously I fear for my safety but that is not stopping me,"" said one of the activists, Freedom Flotilla Coalition media coordinator Fellipe Lopez.
 Lopez was speaking to Times of Malta onboard the Handala, a former fishing vessel operated by the coalition that will soon set sail for Gaza in an attempt to break a long-standing Israeli blockade and deliver humanitarian aid.
  ""The purpose of this mission is to send a message that civil society is not okay with what's happening [in Gaza],"" Lopez said.
 He said the voyage to Gaza is expected to take a week, but this could change because of ""tensions"" in the region.
 Nonetheless, he remains confident. 
 ""In my heart, I'm 100% confident and I think everyone on board believes that too... We understand the risks, the challenge, but that is not going to stop us.""
 One woman who understands the risks all too well is 78-year-old former US colonel and diplomat Ann Wright. 
 She was onboard a boat sent by the coalition in 2010, that ended with the death of nine activists when Israeli forces raided the vessel.
  ""These people are very brave, because we don't know what's going to happen. If the Israelis stop them, we know it'll be brutal,"" she said.
 ""There are armadas of military ships that are out there... these people [the crew] are fully briefed, but they're still willing to go,"" said Wright.
 ""I'm so proud of them."" 
 While the vessel may have seen life as a fishing vessel in the past, its new purpose was clear when Times of Malta went aboard on Wednesday.
 Brightly coloured paintings adorned the hull alongside banners and slogans such as ""not in my name,"" ""free Palestine"" and ""Gaza you are not alone"".
 Messages of solidarity were scribbled all over the boat and Palestinian flags flew from beams and rigging ropes.
  Malta is the Handala's 19th stop in Europe. It arrived on Tuesday evening two days late after being delayed in Sicily and will depart in the coming days. 
 Organisers said they intend to sail directly to Gaza, but didn't rule out another stop for additional supplies.
 Crew member and documentary filmmaker Alaa Kassab said he was ""angry"" at the situation in Gaza but ""wanted to be helpful.""
 He will not be onboard the Handala for the final leg of its journey, however, explaining that as a Syrian living in Damascus and formerly Denmark, he was deemed ""too high risk"" for the mission.
 Times of Malta was told that almost 700 people had applied to join the Handala's 17-strong crew.
 Speaking at a press conference before the tour of the ship, coalition representatives said crew members from Italy, France, Norway, Australia and the Netherlands had boarded in Malta, joining Palestinian crew members and other nationalities.
  German crew member of Turkish Kurdish descent Yasmin Acar said she had been ""living in the belly of the monster,"" in Germany and called on her country to stop providing weapons to Israel.
 ""They are repeating history instead of learning from history,"" she said, adding she joined the crew because ""justice needs to be fought for.""
 Moviment Graffiti activist Andre Callus said it was easy to become ""numb, disengaged... Even horrific videos lose their meaning. But we cannot afford to ignore what's happening in Palestine.""
 Millions around the world were expressing their rage and solidarity, he said, adding the Freedom Flotilla Coalition had been running missions for 10 years at ""great personal risk.""
 The coalition is an international organisation of NGOs attempting to break the Israeli blockade of Gaza.
  While other vessels could join the Handala, coalition organisers said on Wednesday that none had applied at the time of publication.
 The organisation aims to deliver 5,000 tonnes of humanitarian aid to Gaza in its current mission but says it will not allow Israeli forces to inspect its vessels or participants, according to its website.
 In comments to Times of Malta, Palestinian ambassador to Malta Fadi Hanania said the boat was carrying ""a message of hope, of humanity... That there are still people who care"".
 He said that while the Palestinian cause had ""lost momentum recently,"" and the Handala ""gives our people more hope and resilience.""
  Israel's offensive in Gaza was sparked in October when Palestinian Hamas militants launched a surprise attack on the country, killing more than 1,200 people, mostly civilians.
 More than 39,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, have been killed since the start of the war, according to Palestinian health authorities.

Malta 'will not allow' ship carrying explosive material into port,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/ship-carrying-explosive-material-not-heading-malta.1098468,24-09-2024,001763.png,"A Malta-registered ship carrying a massive load of explosive ammonium nitrate will not be allowed into Maltese ports unless it disposes of its cargo beforehand, Transport Malta has said.
 A spokesperson for the transport regulator said the MV  Ruby - which has marked its destination as Marsaxlokk - was looking for a port to enter for repairs. 
 Maltese authorities have made it clear that the vessel will only be allowed into Malta if it disposes of its cargo first. 
 The Transport Ministry later also confirmed that the vessel would only be allowed to dock if it discharges its cargo and subject to available space the the dry dock. 
 It said that Transport Malta is currently in contact with the vessel's designated person ashore - the person responsible for the vessel's shore-based management - to ensure compliance with international regulations. 
 They said that the vessel may appear to be heading towards Malta because of data inputted by the crew on the Automatic Identification System. 
 This is a short-range coastal tracking system used on ships to enhance the ship’s positional awareness, they said. 
 ""Following damage survey, damage stability and hull strength calculations and assessments, temporary repairs and various mitigation measures have been enacted prior to allowing the vessel to proceed to her sailing outwards to discharge her cargo and then head directly in ballast to ship repair yard,"" a ministry spokesperson said.
 ""Tug assistance for the full duration of the voyage is one of the primary conditions that has been implemented.""
 According to the reports, the Malta-registered MV Ruby, currently in the North Sea, is carrying 20,000 tons of ammonium nitrate, seven times the amount which devasted large parts of Beirut in an accidental explosion four years ago.
 The ship is reportedly owned by Syrian interests and chartered to a UAE company.
 It departed from Russia's Kola Peninsula in August, with the destination originally indicated on the global ship tracker Marinetraffic as being the Canary Islands.
 The ship was damaged in a storm last week and has subsequently been refused entry by Norway, Sweden, Lithuania and Denmark.
 On Monday, the vessel set its destination as Marsaxlokk, Malta. On Monday night, a Transport Malta spokesperson said they had not received a request for the vessel to enter Malta. 
 ""There is no request for the ship to enter Maltese ports,"" a spokesperson for Transport Malta said.  
 On Tuesday, a spokesperson said the ship has now requested permission to enter Malta. 
 Sources told Times of Malta that the vessel's owners were exploring various options, one of them being the transfer of the cargo to other, smaller ships. 
 According to ship tracking service Marine Traffic, the Ruby is due to reach Malta by October 8.

'Disaster beyond belief': Maltese artist's home destroyed in Valencia floods,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/disaster-beyond-belief-maltese-artist-home-destroyed-valencia-floods.1100447,11-02-2024,002188.png,"A Maltese artist living in Spain has had half of his house destroyed and has lost his car in the devastating flooding that has hit the Valencia region. 
 Steven Scicluna, an illustrator and graphic designer, said he, his partner and their young child have been forced to live solely on the top floor of their house after the catastrophic flooding washed into the lower part of their house. 
 ""The ground floor was inundated with 1.6m of water in the space of 2 hrs and everything there was damaged beyond repair or washed away. My car is also gone,"" Scicluna said. 
 Flash floods tore through southern Valencia this week, sweeping up people and mountains of debris and wreaking havoc on the city's infrastructure. 
 On Friday rescuers upped the death toll to 205 as they continue to search for survivors, saying that the floods are the region's deadliest ""in a generation"". 
 While Scicluna and his family are unharmed, they have been left reeling from the sudden loss of their new home, having only moved to the area four months ago. 
 Almost all of their belongings, including the family car, have been destroyed by the flooding. They said that, as the area has been declared a disaster zone, insurance will not be covering their expenses. 
  Scicluna has been documenting some of their recovery efforts on his social media accounts and is making a public appeal for donations to help the family get back on their feet. 
 ""We’ve been extremely lucky to have friends help out with cleaning up the house and we’re slowly making good progress. It has also been incredibly heartening to see the Valencian public come out in solidarity to help clean the streets and households,"" he said. 
 ""Still, with every passing day, it becomes apparent just how difficult the recovery process is going to be both for us and the community. The immensity of the disaster is beyond belief.""
 Scicluna and his partner Sara have set up a GoFundMe to help with the expense of rebuilding their home and repurchasing their necessities. 
 ""Our intention is to only use what we need and any surplus amount will be donated to the community effort,"" Scicluna said.

Activists gather near US embassy to demand action on Palestine,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/activists-gather-near-us-embassy-demand-action-palestine.1101132,16-11-2024,"002238.png,002239.png","Activists of all ages gathered close to the US Embassy in Ta’ Qali on Saturday in solidarity with the people of Palestine and Lebanon.
 The vigil, organised by Ġustizzja għall-Palestina, Youth for Palestine, and Moviment Graffitti, sought to highlight the enabling role the US and other western governments were playing in enabling what they described as “Israeli war crimes”.
 Yana Mintoff from Ġustizzja għall-Palestina read out a letter sent by 13 local organisations to newly elected US President Donald Trump and current President Joe Biden.
 The letter strongly criticised Western diplomacy, stating: “The failure to prevent repeated Israeli state war crimes is a horrifying failure of global and Western diplomacy and will go down in history as one of humanity’s most shameful chapters since the Second World War.” However, it expressed a glimmer of hope, adding: “Further deterioration may still be avoided.”
 The letter follows the expiration of a 30-day ultimatum issued by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to Israel. On October 13, Blinken had demanded that Israel ensure a minimum of 350 aid trucks reached Gaza daily. Vigil organisers said this promise has not been fulfilled.
 In the letter, the organisations urged the US to halt its funding of weapons and military hardware to Israel, saying the US was “still in time to stand on the right side of history.”
 Saturday’s vigil attracted a crowd of about 75 people of various ages. Many participants held placards with messages such as “Hands off Lebanon” and “Stop genocide in Gaza,” while some raised red-painted hands to symbolise bloodshed.
  Seven speakers addressed the gathering, with Sammy Meilaq, a veteran Labour Party activist and representative of Front Maltin Inqumu, delivering one of the most impassioned speeches.
 Meilaq accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of being a war criminal and labelled US President Joe Biden and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer as his “godfathers and enablers.” He described all three as “Nazis” for their complicity in the events in Gaza.
 However, he also conveyed a message of hope, asserting, “Politically, Palestine is winning.” Using metaphors, he added, “All of Europe’s squares are now Palestine, and the Ivy Leagues are now also Palestinian territories,” alluding to widespread protests, in Europe and on US college campuses, in solidarity with Palestine.
 Amy Mallia from Moviment Graffitti highlighted the vigil’s timeliness, coming just days after President Trump’s re-election.
 “Gaza doesn’t care about Trump, Biden, or Harris; it’s all the same,” she said, saying Gazans were more concerned about fundamental needs such as “food, water, and protecting the community.”
 Rueben Grima from Ġustizzja għall-Palestina warned of the psychological toll of the ongoing violence. He described it as “brutal and brutalising,” and said there was a risk that hearing about the ever-growing list of victims risks is becoming normalised.
 Grima also criticised Malta’s politicians on the issue, pointing out that other European countries, such as Spain and Ireland, have openly addressed the situation Malta has yet to have a plenary debate on the matter. Sarcastically, he added, “They seem to have more important things on their mind.”
 Speakers Joanna Jebaili from Lebanese Advocates and Dannia al-Haddad from Ġustizzja għall-Palestina also took to the stage, delivering poignant remarks on the ongoing struggles in the region.
 The vigil concluded with a poetry reading by John J. Portelli from his book The Shadow: Poems for the Children of Gaza, co-authored with Palestinian poet Ahmed Miqdad.

Five wounded Gaza children to receive treatment in Malta,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/five-wounded-gaza-children-receive-treatment-malta.1092059,05-07-2024,002307.png,"Five children who were wounded in Gaza will be receiving medical treatment in Malta in the coming days.  
 Aged between 2 and 17 years, the children will be treated at Mater Dei Hospital, Health Minister Jo Etienne Abela said.  
 Two will undergo plastic surgery after severe burns, and one will be operated on because of intestinal and kidney injuries. Two will receive treatment after having their legs amputated.
 The children suffered their injuries as a result of the continued fighting between Israeli and Hamas forces. The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said Tuesday that at least 34,789 people had been killed in the past eight months.
 The war began when Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israeli villages, killing 1,170 people, mostly civilians. Several hundred Israelis have since also died in the fighting.  
 ""It is our duty as the government and medical professionals to assist innocent people in dire need of essential care and dignity,"" the minister said.  
 Malta over the past weeks also hosted two other wounded children from Gaza. 
 Selah, 3, who was brought to Malta in February, was injured in an Israeli air strike in November, suffering severe leg injuries when her house in Southern Gaza was hit. She lost her mother and brother in the attack.   
 10-year-old Lara Abu Alkas was hurt in an air strike on Al-Shifa hospital in December, according to the Palestinian Embassy. The girl was blinded in one eye.

Watch: Birżebbuġa to Berlin - a cyclist’s journey to mark end of Cold War,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/watch-birzebbuga-berlin-cyclist-journey-mark-end-cold-war.1097456,09-02-2024,"002514.png,002515.png,002516.png,002517.png,002518.png","A cyclist has made Malta the starting point for a monumental bicycle journey along the former Iron Curtain in a symbolic act to commemorate his family’s escape from communist Poland.
 Adam Koniuszewski, 53, landed in Malta last month and started his bicycle trail from Birżebbuġa’s Cold War memorial – a 10,500-kilometre, months-long journey that will end in November in Berlin, which will host special celebrations commemorating 35 years since the fall of the Berlin wall.
 Koniuszewski said he wanted to start in Malta as he deems the island significant due to its historical ties to the end of the Cold War.
 “I’m here because this is a symbolic place, and the importance Malta played in ending the Cold War is probably underestimated,” he said.
  Malta hosted the 1989 ‘Malta Summit’, a landmark meeting between US President George H.W. Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev that marked a significant step towards the end of the Cold War.
 The leaders of the West and East met in Malta just days after the fall of the Berlin wall, on a ship that was anchored in Marsaxlokk. During the summit, Bush and Gorbachev declared an end to the Cold War and agreed to work together on issues such as nuclear disarmament, arms control and regional conflicts.
  But there is another angle to Koniuszewski’s adventure – his personal story, which provides a poignant backdrop to his journey.
 In the early 1970s his father, a civil engineer, was arrested and imprisoned by the communist regime after an accident on one of his projects.
 “Overnight in prison, representatives from the Communist Party visited him, telling him this was a big misunderstanding and that if he formed part of the party he would not be in prison,” Koniuszewski recalled.
 On his release and aced with the prospect of raising his child in a totalitarian state, his father made the difficult decision to flee Poland with his family, and they settled in Canada, where the young Koniuszewski grew up.
 His journey today serves as a tribute to his father’s courage and sacrifice. But it also serves as a reminder of the importance of freedom and the need to cherish it, he added.
 As he pedals along the Iron Curtain trail, he hopes to inspire younger generations to appreciate the hard-won freedoms they enjoy today.
  “I want the younger generation to understand what it’s like to have to fight for freedom, because we take freedom for granted,” he said.
 “We must cherish freedom, celebrate it and fight for it.”
 Koniuszewski’s journey, spanning over 10,550 kilometres, will take him from the tip of Norway to the borders of Turkey, retracing the path of the once-impenetrable barrier that divided Europe for decades.
 He will also fly to Geneva, where US President Ronald Reagan and Gorbachev met for the first time in 1985.
 Koniuszewski thanked the Ambassador of Malta in Warsaw, Marisa Farrugia, who through the embassy and other organisations helped him plan the start of his journey in Malta.

Minister leads business and real estate delegation to Saudi Arabia,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/business-real-estate-delegation-accompanies-minister-saudi-arabia.1101147,17-11-2024,003064.png,"A group of 42 entrepreneurs, including property developers, estate agents, financial consultants, and other real estate professionals spent time in Saudi Arabia recently as part of a business delegation led by Minister Jonathan Attard.
 The event was organised by the Property Malta Foundation and intended to provide networking opportunities for local businesspeople with Saudi counterparts.
 Minister Attard, whose portfolio includes Reform of the Construction Sector, held high-level meetings with representatives from the Saudi Green Building Forum, the Minister of Municipality and Rural Affairs (Housing and Urban Development), and the Deputy Minister of Justice at the Ministry of Justice.
 Those meetings were organised and facilitated by Malta’s ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Clive Aquilina Spagnol.
 During the visit, delegates participated in Cityscape Global, the largest international real estate investment and development event in the Gulf region, with more than 400 exhibitors and 500 speakers in seven conferences.
 The minister said the visit “has opened new doors for further collaboration. The connections made here, particularly with key figures in the Saudi government, will undoubtedly benefit both Maltese businesses and the wider society.”
 Property Malta Foundation chair Sandro Chetcuti said Maltese construction and real estate stakeholders were keen to learn from other countries.
 “Saudis are addressing challenges with lifestyle developments that offer excellent green credentials and a unique living experience for residents,” he said. “This delegation marks an important step in strengthening international ties while enhancing business opportunities.”

Watch: Malta-based NGO evacuates Ukraine base after Russian attack,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/watch-maltabased-ngo-evacuates-ukraine-base-russian-attack.1097466,31-08-2024,003344.png,"Malta-based NGO Migrant Offshore Aid Station (MOAS) has evacuated one of its bases in Ukraine after it was struck by Russian weapons in the early hours of Saturday morning.
 The attack left some of its staff with minor injuries and two of its ambulances damaged, the organisation said in a statement on Saturday afternoon.
 The blast, which the NGO said could have been caused by a rocket or drone attack, detonated “just three metres away from the building,” smashing windows and causing a large fire in several of the rooms.
 Expensive medical equipment and medical supplies were destroyed in the fire, it said.
 The NGO said it was not yet clear whether its base had been targeted intentionally or come under fire by mistake but noted that another four targets also came under fire in the same town during the attack.
 It said the 19 medical staff and other personnel in the building at the time moved to the building’s bomb shelter, with “minor injuries sustained from flying debris.” Eight other staff members of the NGO were out on call at the time, it said.
  MOAS stressed it was just the latest in a series of incidents affecting its medical staff, who it said were “facing more injuries from the frontline” as Russia’s offensive in eastern Ukraine continued.
 However, it said it was the first time the NGO had been directly hit after around two and a half years operating on the frontlines, where it undertakes evacuations of wounded soldiers and transports them to hospital.
 MOAS founder Christopher Catrambone called the incident an “unfortunate setback” for the organisation, but said it “strengthens our resolve” to continue operating in the conflict.
 “Our thoughts are with our brave medics and personnel - and their families - who have risked their lives daily, for the past two and a half years, to help give a fighting chance to some of the most seriously wounded victims of this war”, he said.
 The organisation has assisted more than 45,000 seriously wounded soldiers in Ukraine and more than 200,000 worldwide since its inception in 2014, it said.
 Saturday’s attack comes just days after Russia launched a “massive"" attack on Ukraine's power grid.
 On Monday, Russia fired hundreds of drones and missiles at the embattled country, killing at least four people and causing widespread blackouts, officials said.

Maltese peacekeepers committed to line of duty in southern Lebanon,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/maltese-peacekeepers-committed-line-duty-southern-lebanon.1098615,27-09-2024,"003352.png,003353.png","Despite growing tensions and increasing fears of a full-scale war, the Maltese peacekeepers in Lebanon remain steadfast in their commitment to completing their tour of duty, Lieutenant Katrin Abela told Times of Malta.
 Speaking from inside Camp Shamrock, an Irish camp base located about seven kilometres from the Israeli border, Abela, who has eight Maltese soldiers under her command, emphasised that, while she and her colleagues are fully aware of the dangers they face, they remain steadfast in their duties.
 The presence of the Maltese soldiers is part of a broader international effort aimed at maintaining stability in a region marked by conflict.
 The UN peacekeeping mission has been in operation since the 2007 conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.
 Maltese troops are embedded within the 124th Infantry Battalion of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) which has around 10,500 peacekeepers from 50 contributing countries.
 Despite the volatility of the situation, the nine Maltese soldiers remain resolute to complete their six-month tour of duty.
 “Although the situation is unpredictable, all Maltese soldiers are safe,” a spokesperson for the Armed Forces of Malta (AFM) said.
 “The role of our personnel is strictly related to peacekeeping operations and does not involve combat or participation in any battlefield,” the AFM spokesperson clarified.
 While the sound of airstrikes is frequently heard, the UN compound has not been a target and the soldiers are not in direct danger.
 However, Abela highlighted that, despite the relative safety of their compound, the soldiers must still take necessary precautions.
 “We hear the explosions from the numerous airstrikes, and while the UN compound itself is not a target, we still take shelter in bunkers whenever missiles fly overhead,” she explained.
 In recent days, Israel has increased its military actions in southern Lebanon, targeting suspected Hezbollah strong­holds as the conflict in Gaza spreads northward.
 Monday saw the deadliest airstrike on Lebanon in nearly a decade, with 492 casualties, including 35 children.
 Despite the escalating violence and the proximity of danger, none of the Maltese soldiers have requested to return home.
  “We are all professional soldiers and volunteered for this tour of duty, fully aware of what it would entail,” said the lieutenant.
 “Rather than feeling afraid, we view this as an opportunity to contribute on a humanitarian level.”
 Since their arrival in May, the Maltese soldiers have adapted to the tension that defines their posting in southern Lebanon.
 While patrols – intended to maintain the UN’s presence – have been suspended due to ongoing airstrikes, the Maltese contingent continues its work within the compound.
 As watchkeeper, Abela oversees the monitoring of personnel entering and exiting the base, while the rest of her team typically patrols the streets.
 Before deployment, the Maltese soldiers underwent two months of intensive training in Ireland, alongside Irish, Polish and Hungarian troops, who now serve with them at the same camp.
 Abela also received specialised training in Bosnia and Herzegovina as well as Austria to prepare for her leadership role in the mission.
 The AFM is closely monitoring the situation and remains in regular contact with the Irish Defence Forces.
 The soldiers’ families are also provided with regular updates for reassurance.

"Watch: ‘Take works about Malta to London, New York,’ says Hollywood composer",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/stephen-schwartz-works-malta-london-new-york-says-hollywood-composer.1098211,24-09-2024,003524.png,"A top Broadway and Hollywood composer and lyricist has recommended aspiring Maltese creatives focus on creating works about Malta before heading to cultural hubs like London and New York.
 In an exclusive interview with Times of Malta, Grammy, Academy and Tony award-winning composer and lyricist Stephen Schwartz said talented songwriters and playwrights should “use their unique personality, but also the culture of Malta”.
 Encouraging creatives to draw on their insights about Maltese society and the country’s history, Schwartz said if the resulting works had “universal interest, they’ll [creatives] have a piece of work that they can take to London, New York or Los Angeles.”
 Pointing to his own experiences, he said his first hit show Pippin began life away from Broadway.
 “I began that [Pippin] in college, not in New York. It started as a college show and had some promise. When I graduated and came to New York I continued to develop it, but the point was I came with a project that was already underway.”
 And while other Hollywood voices have suggested Maltese performers focus on building careers back home, Schwartz disagrees, acknowledging the importance of cities like London and Los Angeles.
 “Ultimately, one needs to go where the work is being done,” he said.
  Schwartz was speaking ahead of Sunday's Defying Gravity concerts at the Mediterranean Conference Centre, which will feature a selection of his music performed by some of Malta’s biggest stars.
 Describing Joseph Calleja, Ira Losco and Destiny as “amazing”, the composer said he would join the Maltese singers for some duets and some ensemble numbers in addition to their – and his – solo performances.
  “There’ll mostly be songs that the audience is likely to be familiar with – the better-known move and show stuff from my work – but there will be new things. And we also are doing some new arrangements of songs they may be familiar with,” he said.
 “We’re trying to strike a balance between new and interesting stuff, but also enough that the audience will feel comfortable and familiar with.”
 In addition to his more than five decades of work on Broadway productions, Schwartz has also penned music and lyrics for animated movies The Prince of Egypt, Enchanted, The Hunchback of Notre Dame and  Pocahontas.
 And November will see the release of the first part of his upcoming Hollywood blockbuster Wicked, based on his musical of the same name.
 “I just saw the final cut of the movie last week [and] I feel really good about it,” he said, explaining that the music team had been treated to a special advance screening while the finishing touches were being done to the soundtrack.
 Schwartz said that he and his collaborator Winnie Holzman, a screenwriter and playwright, had been “surprised” when they found out the movie would be split into two parts.
 But they “always knew” that if the Broadway show was a success, “it would ultimately be a movie,” he said.
 “We’ve really been thinking about it and talking about it for quite a while. And many of the ideas that Winnie and I had from the beginning of how to make it into a movie have found their way into the film, which is very exciting.”
 Describing Malta as “looking so beautiful in pictures,” Schwartz said he was looking forward to visiting the country he said had been visited by many of his friends.
 “It’s always been a place I wanted to visit, and this [concert] provides a really good excuse to do it... Malta has been on my bucket list for many years.”
 The Hollywood composer said the upcoming performance, which takes place at the end of the month, was a rarity, with him only having done “a handful” of concerts with symphony orchestra throughout his career.
 “I’ve never done one outside of the United States except for being part of something a few years ago in Australia. But other than that, this is the first time,” he said.
 “Usually, when I have done concerts with singers and friends it’s basically been me at the piano or quite a small group. So, it’s a lot of fun to have a big symphonic orchestra behind you. It’s fun to play with them,” said Schwartz.
 “There’ll be some chorus singers as well so it’s going to be a big sound... it’s very exhilarating.”
 'Defying Gravity' starring Stephen Schwartz, will take place on September 29 at the Mediterranean Conference Centre. For tickets, visit showshappening.com.

Valletta mayor is ‘excited’ by Portsmouth twinning proposal,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/valletta-mayor-excited-portsmouth-twinning-proposal.1096598,16-08-2024,003566.png,"Valletta’s mayor has said he was surprised to learn about a proposal to twin Valletta with Portsmouth but is nevertheless “excited” about the prospect.
 “I was initially surprised when I read the news item on the BBC,” Olaf McKay said. However, after reading the article, he said he became “intrigued and excited to learn more about this proposal”.
 McKay said the twinning could be an enriching experience for both cities but emphasised that discussions are still in the early stages and much work remains to be done before an agreement is reached. 
 “There is still a long way to go and several procedures to follow before achieving twinning status,” he said.
 The twinning proposal came from Charlotte Gerada, leader of the Labour group on the Portsmouth city council. 
 
 Gerada, whose parents migrated from Malta to Portsmouth in the 1970s, told Times of Malta she did not expect the proposal to attract such significant media attention.
 “I didn’t expect this reaction; it feels like it exploded,” she said. Following the BBC article, Gerada and McKay have been in contact and have started preliminary discussions about twinning the two cities. 
 Gerada also emphasised that the proposal is still in its early stages and has only been discussed with Portsmouth council’s twinning advisory group. She said she was waiting to be contacted by the Maltese government about the matter.
 Gerada believes the two cities would be a good match as both Valletta and Portsmouth are historically fortified cities with ports. She added: “There is also scope to work together from an economic perspective, especially considering that we are developing a port for cruise liners in Portsmouth.” She said there is much to learn from Valletta in this respect. 
 Valletta is already twinned with several cities, including Rhodes in Greece, Piran in Slovenia, and the Italian towns of Cortona, Pisa, and Palermo.

  It was her eldest brother Pat who divulged the secret he had been keeping all along: “If there’s an invasion, or we have to surrender, dad’s going to use it to shoot us all. If he’s not here mum has to do it. And if neither of them is here, it’s my job.”
 Margaret and Pat survived the war in Malta with the whole Staples family and went on to have their own families away from the island.
 But the Staples left parts of them behind – literally and figuratively – and Margaret’s daughter Linda Peek has documented the family’s posting in Malta at the height of World War II.
 “Although my mother’s parents were not Maltese, they were very much in touch with the Maltese and grew a strong bond to the island, so much so that when my grandfather tried to persuade my grandmother to leave with the children as several others had done, on a ship to Egypt or South Africa, she refused,” Linda Peek told Times of Malta.
 “She said, ‘If the Maltese can take it, so can we.’
  The ship that my family would have been on was sunk by the enemy soon after it left the island.
 ""Had my grandmother made a different decision that day, none of us would be here.”
  Sam Staples was posted in Malta with the Royal Engineers in 1939, accompanied by his wife Hilda Mary and their five children, aged between seven and 11.
 When the Staples went back to England six years later, Margaret was aged 15. She returned to Malta several times.
 Margaret died in 2018 aged 89, and that is when her daughter Linda, who lived in Australia, stepped in to write the book her mother never got to write.
 She based the book – called Malta. A Childhood Under Siege – on oral and written accounts by her mother and notes from her grandfather’s diary.
 Next month, Linda will return to Malta to meet with the descendants of some of the people who crossed paths with the Staples family and to speak about her book at the Lascaris War Rooms, where her grandfather once overlooked construction works.
  Linda told Times of Malta her grandfather Sam, as Garrison Engineer, designed the complex of tunnels that would later serve as a command centre for the Allies during the invasion of Sicily.
 It was during such works that Sam met Emvin Cremona, recognised among the foremost Maltese painters of the 20th century. At the war rooms, however, Emvin was painting the doors of a toilet block to help feed his family.
 In her book, Linda notes when Emvin told Sam he could not even afford canvas, he arranged for him to get a job at the Manoel Theatre. In expressing his gratitude, Emvin offered to paint a portrait of someone in the family.
 Sam chose Margaret to pose for the portrait, and it so happened that one day, while posing for the painting, a sculptor dropped by.
 The sculptor – Marco Montebello – had been commissioned to make a statue of St Theresa for the Attard parish church.
 “He immediately noticed my mother’s hands and asked whether he could use them as a model for the statue, explaining he had been searching for some time for someone whose fingers were shaped like hers...
 ""So, whenever my mum visited the island long after the war, she would always go say hello to St Theresa,” Linda said.
  Linda noted that surviving the war in such a heavily bombed place left a lifetime impact on her mother.
 “I remember that thunderstorms would remind her of the bombing. She was also a terrible hoarder of food and whenever we questioned her reasoning, she’d tell us ‘you don’t know what it’s like to go to bed hungry’.
 ""Some of us might have experienced a similar fear during COVID… but my mother carried that fear with her through life.
 “Like other Maltese families, my family also depended on rations and my mother would go to the Victory Kitchen with a pan to collect soup.
 ""She used to say it was a generous portion for two but not what you’d normally serve seven people.”
  Margaret would also often recall how one day somebody knocked on the door to tell the maid Carrie her auntie had died. Margaret accompanied Carrie to the morgue to identify the corpse.
 Till the day she died, Margaret could describe every corpse she saw there.
 Despite the topic of the war, Linda insists her book is a positive one about Malta, with those who read it having put the island on their bucket list.
 “It is about the day-to-day things of surviving as part of a community that suffered as one… but it’s also about family and friendships, about going to school and being in the boy scouts and putting on shows to entertain the troops.”

"Lavrov was ‘posturing’ amid Russian unease, but Malta meeting 'positive'",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/lavrov-posturing-amid-russian-unease-malta-meeting-positive.1102154,12-08-2024,"004522.png,004523.png","The Russian foreign minister’s controversial speech at a meeting in Malta last Thursday was described by diplomatic sources as “posturing” against a backdrop of unease among the Russian delegation.
 Sergey Lavrov made international headlines when he used his appearance at the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) Ministerial Council in Ta’ Qali to launch into a tirade of anti-West rhetoric, as he faced condemnation and walkouts because of the Ukraine war.
 
 Warning of a reincarnated Cold War – but one with the potential to turn “hot” – Russia’s top diplomat accused Western countries of wanting to “keep Russia down” as part of an attempt to “drive neo-colonial hegemony at any cost”.
 But according to diplomatic sources present for the event, Lavrov’s speech could have been more for the sake of appearances, with one insider describing his speech as “posturing” despite its “unacceptable” content.
 “There was a lot of posturing there; they do have the upper hand militarily but when you speak to their diplomats, you can feel they are not comfortable with the situation,” the source said.
 Last month, Ukraine faced its worst results on the battlefield, losing an area of land equivalent to New York City, according to the  Guardian citing  Institute for the Study of War (ISW) figures.
 In Donetsk – a major industrial city – alone, Ukraine lost more than 1,000 square kilometres, equivalent to an area almost three times the size of Malta.
 And with the impending presidency of Donald Trump, who has signalled his intention to rein in US aid for Ukraine, the tides of war appear to be swinging in Russia’s favour.
 “They have made some territorial gains, but they [the Russians] still want talks to start as soon as possible; they want peace too,” the source said – while acknowledging the Russians had a “different outlook” on what peace might look like, however.
  Asked why the Russians might feel uncomfortable despite being in a strong position, the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, indicated there was a realisation they will not achieve all of their aims.
 “They know this war will not be won totally, and they do feel isolated – even personally; people simply will not speak to them,” the source said.
 They explained the Russian delegation also seemed uncomfortable with losing their leadership position at the OSCE, an organisation they see as their “brainchild” with its inception taking place amid the tensions of the Cold War.
 The OSCE – originally the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe – was formed in 1970 as a multilateral forum between East and West as tensions with the former Soviet Union began to ease.
  Asked about Lavrov’s hasty departure from the council meeting on Thursday, the source indicated health reasons could have been partly to blame, noting members of his delegation had said the diplomat was “feverish”.
 “He came because he attaches a lot of importance to the OSCE,” the source said, describing him more of a career diplomat than a Putin fanatic: “I don’t think he totally agrees with his leader.”
  Another source told Times of Malta that while most EU foreign leaders eschewed meetings with Russia in Malta, some had found “creative ways” to open discussions.
 This week, only Hungary and Slovakia – both with governments seen as sympathetic to Russia – held side discussions with the Russian delegation.
 The insider said that while Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg held no official meetings with Russia’s top diplomat, it was an “open secret” in diplomatic circles that the two find an opportunity to smoke a cigarette near each other at such conferences.
 “One can always find creative ways to talk,” the source said, indicating unofficial discussions were held during such encounters.
 The source recalled that with Ukraine on the agenda at the informal dinner on Thursday evening, the delegations from neither Russia nor Belarus were in attendance.
 With the war not on the agenda at the formal lunch earlier that day, however, it was Ukraine that did not attend.
 Nonetheless, discussions had invariably turned to Russia’s invasion of the country, the source said, noting Lavrov had been forced to “listen to some very strong remarks” on the topic.
 Asked for the Russian diplomat’s reaction to the comments, the source said Lavrov had not responded, with his thoughts on the matter difficult to gauge: “It’s difficult to read him.”
 Ultimately, another diplomatic source pointed out, “It’s a game of wait and see. The new Trump administration is widely expected to stop giving major support to Ukraine, which would possibly mean the warring sides will have no choice but to meet around a table. It’s anyone’s guess what will happen next, but the Malta meeting was productive.”

Malta waits for EU position on global arrest warrant for Israel's Netanyahu,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/malta-waits-eu-position-icc-global-arrest-warrant-israel-netanyahu.1101410,22-11-2024,004597.png,"Malta is in “close contact” with EU member states to come up with a common response to an international arrest warrant issued against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a government spokesperson said on Friday.
 The International Criminal Court on Thursday issued arrest warrants for the Israeli Prime Minister, former Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant and Hamas' military chief Mohammed Deif.
 The Hague-based court issued the warrants ""for crimes against humanity and war crimes committed from at least 8 October 2023 until at least 20 May 2024.""
 Asked for a reaction, a foreign affairs ministry spokesperson said Malta respects the ICC’s mandate and “unique role in all their respects.”
 “We note that it has issued arrest warrants in connection with 7 October and what has occurred since,” they said.
 “At this time, we are in close contact with our EU partners to determine a common response to this development,” the spokesperson said.
 The ministry spokesperson said Malta is committed to supporting the independence and impartiality of the ICC.
 They said Malta is committed “to the primary goals of releasing all hostages and achieving a ceasefire in Gaza and Lebanon, as we demonstrated earlier this week by supporting the resolution proposed at the UN Security Council.”
 Malta is a member of the ICC, having ratified the Rome Statute which established it back in 2002. 
 The ICC investigates and tries individuals charged with the most serious crimes in international law: genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and the crime of aggression. 
 Israel is not a member of the ICC and says the court has no jurisdiction over its citizens.  
 While Malta is hoping for common EU position, member states appear divided on the ICC decision to push for the arrest of Netanyahu. 
 Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said the move was ""outrageously brazen and cynical"" and accused the ICC of trying to intervene in an ongoing conflict for political purposes. 
 He said he intended to invite Netanyahu to Hungary, as a show of support.
 But other EU member states have backed the ICC action. 
 Irish Prime Minister Simon Harris said Netanyahu would be detained if he arrived in Ireland. So too did Italian Defence Minister Guido Crosetto, who however added that he believed the ICC was ""wrong"" to put Netanyahu on the same level as Hamas. 
 Dutch Foreign Affairs Minister Caspar Veldkamp told his country's national parliament that the Netherlands would detain Netanyahu and would also not engage in any ""non-essential contacts"" with the Israeli leader. 
 France said it had “taken note” of the arrest warrants, and Germany's Foreign Minister said the country is ""examining"" how to respond to the International Criminal Court's decision.
 The EU’s outgoing foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, who has been very critical of Israel and its actions in Gaza, said he did not see the ICC move as political.
 ""It is a decision of a court, of a court of justice, of an international court of justice. And the decision of the court has to be respected and implemented,"" he said.

 Executive chef Clint Grech, from Mdina restaurant De Mondion, will tomorrow take part in an exclusive “four-hands dinner” at the Bellefeuille restaurant, located in the luxurious Saint James Hotel.
 A four-hands dinner is a collaboration where two renowned chefs join forces to create a set menu. In this event, Grech will be teaming up with Grégory Garimbay, the head chef at Bellefeuille restaurant.
 The 39-year-old chef will prepare two of his signature dishes: Maltese ‘nocciola’ snails, cooked with garlic and thyme and served with whipped potatoes and brioche, and a classic stuffat tal-qarnit (octopus stew) made with Gozitan octopus, basil and leeks.
  “The event will be one of the proudest moments of my life and a great opportunity to represent my country and shine a spotlight on our Maltese home-grown products,” said Grech, who started his career at De Mondion as a kitchen helper at 16, shortly after graduating from the Institute of Tourism Studies.
  All the ingredients for his two dishes will be Maltese home-grown products.
 The chef explained the ‘nocciola’ snails are perfect for the dish as they are bigger than the usual ones but have the same flavour profile. Around 20 kilos of ‘nocciola’ snails, from Bebbuxellu Snail Farm, and 24 kilos of Gozitan octopus will be sealed tight and transported to Paris.
 Chef Garimbay will be preparing a pithiviers pie with duck and spider crab dish with caviar.
 Alongside the six-course meal, diners will also be treated to Maltese wines produced by Markus divinus, Ta’ Betta and Marsovin.
 The event is a collaboration between MTA France and Visit Malta.

Watch: ‘It’s a blessing’ - Cospicua church delivers mass in Malayalam,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/watch-it-blessing-cospicua-church-delivers-mass-malayalam.1091692,21-06-2024,"004618.png,004619.png,004620.png,004621.png","A church in Cospicua opened its doors to the Indian community on Sunday morning, delivering Mass in Malayalam for the first time in its history.
 Around 30 people attended the Mass at St Theresa church delivered by Fr Jaison Puthumadasser, a priest from the Indian state of Kerala where Malayalam is the official language.
  Fr Puthumadasser arrived in Malta around two weeks ago and will live here for some two to three years to deliver mass weekly at the Cospicua church.
 Speaking to Times of Malta, the priest called the occasion a “blessing” and said he was “thrilled” to deliver mass in Malayalam.
 “There are many [Keralan] people here... They all came here for work opportunities but... they need to have their spiritual needs met as well. I am here to look after their spiritual needs,” he said.
  Paola resident and storekeeper Milton Chirakkaparambil Borgian said it was a “special moment” to attend mass in Malayalam in Cospicua, while his flatmate Akhil Varghese explained they normally had to travel further to attend mass in their language.
 “We usually go to Msida, but it’s far away... here it is interesting and much closer to us,” said Varghese.
 Mass in Malayalam is new to Cospicua but is already being offered elsewhere across Malta including in Birkirkara, Birżebbuġa and St Paul’s Bay, members of the congregation explained.
 Student Anu Anna Abraham said she normally attended mass delivered in English in Floriana, but that it was “very good” to be able to hear the service delivered in her mother tongue close to her home in Senglea. 
  And while much of the service would have been familiar to Maltese audiences, such as the delivery of the Eucharist, the word “amen” and, of course, the surroundings, not only was the language of the mass different but so was its music.
 Pharmaceuticals worker Jidho David Simon prepared and performed the music which, while containing elements familiar to Western audiences such as organ playing, was largely based on traditional Indian music and sung in Malayalam.
 “It’s traditional Christian Indian music - different from Indian music but similar in a way,” he said, adding that while he was used to taking part in church music back in Kerala, he spent three days preparing for Sunday’s mass.
  Speaking to Times of Malta after the mass, Fr Juan De Bono, a fellow priest at the church and monastery said he was pleased to welcome Fr Puthumadasser. “He’s part of our community now,” he said.
 Kerala has the largest Christian community in India, accounting for around six million people or one-fifth of the country’s entire Christian population, according to the Pew Research Centre.
 According to census data, in 2021 there were more than 7,000 Indian nationals living in Malta.

Malta waiting for 'right circumstances' to recognise Palestine,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/malta-waiting-circumstances-right-recognise-palestine.1092853,27-05-2024,004922.png,"Malta is still waiting for the ""optimal timeframe"" to recognise the state of Palestine, as three European countries announced on Wednesday they were going ahead with recognising the Palestinian state themselves.
 Malta persists in seeking a two-state solution ""that meets the aspirations of the people of Israel and Palestine, with Jerusalem as the capital of two states living side-by-side in peace and security,"" a foreign affairs ministry spokesperson said in a reply to Times of Malta questions.
 ""In this regard, Malta has recently affirmed its readiness to recognise Palestine, when such recognition can make a positive contribution, and when the circumstances are right,"" he said.
 ""In this regard, the Government is monitoring developments in the Middle East, to determine the optimal timeframes for this important development as soon as possible.""
 Norway, Ireland and Spain announced on Wednesday they will recognise a Palestinian state, prompting Israel to immediately recall its ambassadors in Dublin and Oslo to discuss the issue in Jerusalem.
 Irish Prime Minister Simon Harris described the decision to recognise the Palestinian state as ""a historic and important day for Ireland and for Palestine"".
 The Israeli foreign minister, on the other hand, said the decision risks turning these states ""into a pawn in the hands of Iran and Hamas"" and that the move would ""only fuel extremism and instability"".
 Israel had also dubbed the recognition of the Palestinian state a ""prize for terrorism"".
 Malta was originally among the countries that had, a few months ago, agreed to move towards recognising the Palestinian state.
 In March, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said that Spain and Ireland, along with Slovenia and Malta, had agreed to take their first steps towards recognition of a Palestinian state, seeing a two-state solution as essential for lasting peace.
 It seems the Maltese government, however, is not ready to take that step yet, insisting it will do so when the time is right.
 Although Malta does not yet formally recognise the Palestinian state, it has supported the two-state solution since 1988 and has an ambassador in the Palestinian territories, in Ramallah.
 For decades, the formal recognition of a Palestinian state has been seen as the endgame of a peace process between Palestinians and their Israeli neighbours.
 The United States and most Western European nations have said they are willing to one day recognise Palestinian statehood, but not before agreement is reached on thorny issues like final borders and the status of Jerusalem.
 But after Hamas's October 7 attacks and Israel's retaliatory campaign in Gaza, diplomats are reconsidering once-contentious ideas.

Archbishop slams 'insulting' Last Supper parody at Paris Olympics ceremony,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/archbishop-slams-insulting-last-supper-parody-paris-olympics-ceremony.1095977,27-07-2024,005085.png,"Archbishop Charles Scicluna has joined a growing number of protesters who have taken offence to a parody of Da Vinci's 'Last Supper' used during a part of the Paris Olympics' opening ceremony.
 The Catholic Church and conservative politicians deemed the recreation of the biblical scene as offensive while supporters praised Paris's message of tolerance.
 Paris inaugurated the Olympic Games in style with several manifestations to portray the beauty and culture of the city. But its decision to reinterpret Da Vinci's Last Supper scene, but with a group of drag queens, a transgender model and a naked singer made up as the Greek god of wine Dionysus, has sparked controversy.
  In a social media post, Archbishop Scicluna said he had sent two messages to the French ambassador to Malta expressing his distress and disappointment of many Christians at the ""gratuitous insult to the Eucharist"" during the opening ceremony.
 The archbishop has urged others to follow his lead and relay their objection to the ambassador. 
 The Catholic church in France also criticised the segment.
 ""This ceremony has unfortunately included scenes of derision and mockery of Christianity, which we very deeply deplore,"" the Conference of French bishops said in a statement.
 Italian far-right leader Matteo Salvini said: ""Opening the Olympics by insulting billions of Christians in the world was really a very bad start, dear French. Sleazy.""
 France, while proud of its rich Catholic heritage, also has a long tradition of secularism and anti-clericalism. Blasphemy is not only legal, but also considered by many as an essential pillar of freedom of speech in a democratic society.

 Increasing sea levels were a real threat to the Mediterranean region, Abela told a summit in New York, urging everyone's cooperation on the challenge that he said ultimately threatened all of humanity. 
 The summit was also addressed by UN chief Antonio Guterres who warned that surging sea levels were creating ""a rising tide of misery"".
 At the summit, a coalition of small island nations declared that their sovereignty must be respected even if their lands are subsumed.
 Nearly a billion people worldwide live in low-lying coastal areas, increasingly vulnerable to storm surges, coastal erosion and flooding - while Pacific islands face growing threats to their economic viability and even existence.
 According to Abela, the challenge of rising sea levels had widespread economic implications with small states like Malta being at the frontline.

  It is, for me, shameful and degrading that the brainwashed leftovers of imperialism still bemoan the good old days when we were under, yes, under, our blonde owners, when we were servants in our own home. Not a shred of pride or self-dignity, to depend on nanny in adulthood.
 Did independence herald perfection in governance? Far from it. Still, I would not dream of exchanging home-grown autocracy, incompetence and worse for alien servitude, however benevolent the mask.

 The European Parliament president and the Ukrainian president were reaching the end of a joint press conference in Kyiv to mark Europe Day.
 ""This is what the Nazis do in Europe. This is the reality of Europe Day for us Ukrainians,"" a visibly angry Zelensky told reporters.
 He asked the Maltese president if she was OK before being shuffled away to a bomb shelter.
  Metsola and the Maltese press reporters were taken to another shelter and shown real time visuals of Russian missiles and drones entering Ukranian airspace.
 An interview that the Ukrainian president had scheduled with Times of Malta was cancelled. 
 Air raid sirens are a regular occurrence in Ukraine as the Russian invasion continues 27 months on.
 During the news conference, Zelensky heaped praise on Metsola and the European Parliament for protecting lives and fighting for peace before rewarding her with the Order of Merit first class. 
   ""When Russia Nazis stood at our gates, you added leadership, you added clarity to ensure Putin doesn't rewrite our history,"" he said. 
 Asked for his views on politically neutral countries, the Ukrainian president said he would always respect their constitution but warned there's no neutrality where it comes to peace.
 ` ""Such countries often have poor armies to defend themselves against aggressors like Putin,"" he said.
 The Russian president will not stop the aggression and his next step is to wage a disinformation campaign for the upcoming European elections in an attempt to split the west, he added.
 Metsola agreed with Zelensky, adding however, that all politicians should also steer away from being the sources of misinformation.
  During her third visit to the country since war broke out, the European Parliament president said she wanted to send a ""strong message"" on a day that celebrate European cooperation and integration. 
 ""We stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes. Since the unprovoked attack, Ukrainians have been fighting for our freedom,"" she said.

  Due to Malta’s location in the Mediterranean, it is particularly vulnerable to maritime incidents and it is imperative that its beaches, ports and desalination plants are safeguarded. 
 “Malta has diligently worked over the past decade to bolster its capabilities in responding to pollution incidents, including robust legislative measures and investment in training and equipment,” Transport Malta said in a statement. 
 “Despite these efforts, the reality remains that no single country can effectively manage a major pollution incident alone. Hence, Malta's decision to partake in the BARRACUDA 2024 Exercise was a natural one, given Italy's proximity and shared interests in maritime safety.”

 Passengers who had previously been booked on these flights have been automatically transferred to alternative flights set to travel between Malta and the Charles De Gaulle airport in Paris instead. 
 Affected passengers will rebooked on KM3466 operating between Malta and Paris Charles De Gaulle Airport departing at 5.10 pm and flight KM3467 operating between Paris Charles De Gaulle Airport departing at 8.55 pm. 
 Customers who prefer a monetary refund and booked their flights directly with KM Malta may apply through an online form. Those who have booked through a travel agent are requested to contact their respective agents to request a refund.
 The French civil aviation authority said Friday it had ordered airlines operating at Paris Orly airport to cancel 70% of flights ahead of a weekend air traffic controller strike.
 The cancellations will affect commercial flights scheduled between 0400 GMT and 2130 GMT on Saturday, it said in a statement.
 Flights between Orly and French overseas territories would be allowed to operate normally, it said.
 The stoppage comes only a month after a massive air traffic controller strike affecting several French airports that ended with a deal between the civil aviation authority and the biggest air traffic controller union, the SNCTA.
 But the second-biggest union, UNSA-ICNA, said staffing levels were still inadequate.
 ""The managers at Orly continue their penny-pinching and shopkeeper accounts which will quickly lead to our teams being understaffed"" by 2027, it said in a statement.
 UNSA-ICNA and the third-biggest sector union, USAC-CGT, have both rejected the deal signed late last month, which also included concessions on salaries.
 The April strike led to the cancellations of thousands of flights in France and across Europe.
 Orly, located to the south of Paris, is the second-biggest airport serving the French capital after Roissy Charles-de-Gaulle.
 It is a secondary hub for national carrier Air France and the home base for its low-cost subsidiary Transavia. 
 More than 20 other airlines, including easyJet, Iberia and TAP, fly out of Orly, which processed more than 32 million passengers last year, according to airport association UAF.

 The former prime minister appears in a video advertising the Billionaire Porto Cervo, which describes itself as a ""multi-dimensional playground for the elite"" offering luxury dining and live performances.
 In the footage, Muscat can be seen dining with Jacob Arabo, a wealthy US jeweller who in 2008 was sent to prison in a plea deal as part of an investigation into money laundering.
 Responding to questions on Monday afternoon, Muscat described Arabo as a “top entrepreneur” but said he had been placed next to him by chance at a business event at the club last year.
  Nestled away in the countryside outside of Porto Cervo, a luxury resort on Sardinia's north-east coast, the club restaurant offers luxury dining, live performers and a ""billionaire experience"", according to its website.
 The establishment is owned by Italian businessman Flavio Briatore, a flamboyant restauranteur and former Formula 1 manager known for his playboy lifestyle and drawn-out court battle fighting charges of tax fraud, of which he was later acquitted.
 The club is part of a chain of similar offerings in Dubai and Monaco.
 But on Monday, it became the focus of attention in Malta after eagle-eyed internet users spotted the former prime minister in a video advertising the establishment's grand opening next month.
 Muscat appears briefly in the video which features a variety of performers and shots of guests partying, dining and drinking champagne.
 In the footage, Muscat can be seen dining and apparently conversing with Arabo, a Soviet-born New York jeweller and celebrity watchmaker known as 'Jacob the Jeweler' in hip-hop circles.
 In 2008, Arabo was sent to prison for two-and-a-half years for lying to federal prosecutors in a plea deal as part of a multi-state investigation into a conspiracy to launder €270 million of drug profits, according to CBS.
 The video comes at an awkward time for the former PM, who stands accused of corruption in relation to the 2017 hospitals privatisation deal branded “fraudulent” by a court last year, and whose private wealth has been subject to intense media scrutiny in recent years.
 In a highly publicised court arraignment last month, Muscat pleaded not guilty to charges of bribery, trading in influence, money laundering and various other crimes.
 He is due to appear in court again on Thursday.
 The former PM said he and Arabo were “guests together with several scores of people at a private business-related event last year and happened to be seated next to each other at the same table”, adding he had ""no further relation with him.”

  The semi-final qualifiers - held on Tuesday and Thursday - were determined entirely through a public vote.
 A combination of jury and public voting will determine the final outcome for the 68th final of the Eurovision song contest on Saturday.
 For weeks now, bookmakers have said the chances of the 25-year-old securing a spot in Saturday's showpiece were low. 
 But ahead of the semi-final on Thursday, the singer told  Times of Malta she was ready for battle. 
 ""Despite it being very challenging and the reality of the odds, I am very happy to face this with great courage, as I have been working so hard. We (the team) have prepared for this for so long, and we are ready to give a great performance... the rest is not in our control.""
  During the semi-final performance, Bonnici's odds improved slightly.
 The last time Malta made it to the Eurovision final was in 2021 when Destiny Chukunyere sailed through the semi-final with her song Je Me Casse.
 Since then, both Emma Muscat and The Busker failed to make it through. 
  The other countries to qualify for the final were Latvia, Austria, Netherlands, Norway, Israel, Greece, Estonia, Switzerland, Georgia and Armenia.
 They will be joined in the finals on Saturday by Croatia, Cyprus, Finland, Ireland, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Portugal, Serbia, Slovenia, Ukraine and the “big five”- Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom- as well as last year’s winner Sweden.
 Most participants hail from European countries, however, Australia joined the contest in 2015 and has been participating ever since. However, Australia cannot host if it ever wins.
 Israel is another non-European contestant that however participates because it is a member of the EBU.
 On Thursday, Israel - currently at war with Palestine - was represented in Sweden by Eden Golan.
 AFP reported on Thursday that while inside the  Malmö Arena it was all neon lights, bright costumes and upbeat melodies, outside the mood was more sombre as heavily armed police patrolled the city.
 Up to 30,000 demonstrators were expected to protest Israel's participation in the competition over its offensive in Gaza,
 Israel's retaliation to Hamas' attack on October 7 that has killed at least 34,844 people in Gaza.

Fuel tankers heading to Israel make no official request to refuel in Malta,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/fuel-tankers-heading-israel-make-no-official-request-refuel-malta.1096274,08-03-2024,006101.png,"Updated 8pm with transport ministry statement
 Two fuel tankers believed to be delivering jet fuel to Israel on behalf of the US government have not made an official request to dock in Malta for refuelling.
 Transport Minister Chris Bonett confirmed that no such request had been made in response to questions from Times of Malta on Saturday morning. 
 It is believed the two tankers are on route to Israel to deliver fuel for its ongoing offensive in Gaza, which began in October after Hamas militants launched a surprise attack on the country, killing more than 1,200 people. 
 Moviment Graffitti said they were still waiting for a response to their demand that both tankers be prohibited from entering, passing through, bunkering, receiving services, and docking in Malta.
 They argued that delivering the cargo would contribute to further violence against Palestinians.
 According to Palestinian health authorities, more than 39,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed in Gaza since the start of Israel's offensive in the region.
 Moviment Graffitti's statement came a day after it urged the government to deny passage and refuelling services to the tankers Overseas Santorini and  Overseas Suncoast as part of the group's 'No Harbour for Genocide' campaign.
 Meanwhile, Italian activists in Sicily have alerted port authorities across the Mediterranean about the Overseas Santorini deactivating its Automatic Identification System (AIS), which allows the location of the vessel to be monitored.
 Palestina Libera and  In Palestina warned that deactivating the tracking system poses a significant danger to navigation, particularly in the busy waters of southern Sicily.
 ""Since the vessel is carrying military fuel, transiting without AIS conceals its movement from officials through various countries' waters,"" they said.
 The last known position of Overseas Santorini on July 31 was beyond Gibraltar, heading eastwards.
 On Saturday morning, Overseas Suncoast was in the Balearic Sea, moving in a north-easterly direction, according to maritime tracking website marinevesseltracking.com.
 Ministry confirms no request
 On Saturday evening, citing information provided by Transport Malta, the transport ministry said in a statement it ""reaffirms that no requests have been made by the ships mentioned to enter Maltese ports.""

Maltese playwright's debut production named Best Play at the Fringe,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/maltese-playwright-debut-production-named-best-play-fringe.1097173,23-08-2024,"006199.png,006200.png,006201.png","A Maltese playwright's first full-length play has been awarded Best Play by Theatre Weekly in their roundup of the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, 
 Theatre Weekly, a UK-based theatre publication, ultimately selected the Maltese production  Sisyphean Quick Fix by Bettina Paris as the standout play from the staggering 3,317 shows at the Fringe.
 The publication described the play as having a “thought-provoking narrative” and “delivered with high production values and compelling performances”.
 The accolade is a monumental achievement for Paris, who debuted as a writer and producer at the festival.
 “It feels amazing and incredibly gratifying,” Paris told Times of Malta.
 “After all these years of hard work, to be recognised by such a reputable publication is massive.”
  Sisyphean Quick Fix is a drama-comedy that deftly explores the tangled web of addiction, migration, and family dynamics.
 The play offers a fresh perspective on the emotional toll of caring for someone with an addiction and the additional challenges faced by migrants dealing with pressing issues back home.
 Paris, an actor and artist based in the UK, began working on the play four years ago. The piece debuted in Malta in June at Theatre Next Door, with the primary goal of raising funds for the Edinburgh run.
 She reflected on her ongoing Fringe experience, saying, “Being here is amazing. We are immersed in the world of theatre here. There is a lot to be inspired by and learn from, ”.
 The Fringe is running until August 26.
 Despite the hectic schedule of flyering and promoting on Edinburgh’s streets, the success of Sisyphean Quick Fix has opened doors for further opportunities. Paris is discussing staging the play with theatres in London and the UK and said she would love to stage it again in Malta and is just looking for the right opportunity.  
  The play has also garnered positive reviews from The Sunday Times, The Guardian, and The Scotsman.
 In addition to its critical success, Paris hopes the play’s momentum will lead to more collaborations with charities focused on addiction.
 During its run in Malta, Paris collaborated with Aġenzija Sedqa, Malta’s leading substance abuse prevention and care agency. While at the Edinburgh Fringe, she worked with the charity Scottish Families Affected by Alcohol and Drugs.
 The play is supported by Arts Council Malta and the Keep it Fringe Fund.

Juliana Scerri Ferrante first Maltese elected to UN's children' rights committee,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/juliana-scerri-ferrante-first-maltese-elected-rights-committee.1092999,24-05-2024,006322.png,"Juliana Scerri Ferrante was elected to the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child, becoming the first Maltese national to serve on this prestigious body. 
 The election was held on Thursday during the 20th meeting of the States parties to the Convention on the Rights of the Child at the United Nations (UN) Headquarters in New York.
 Minister for Foreign and European Affairs and Trade Ian Borg congratulated Scerri Ferrante for this important appointment.
 “In a historic year in which Malta is sitting on the UN Security Council and chairing the OSCE, we continued to strengthen Malta’s reputation as a trusted contributor to effective multilateral initiatives,"" he said in a press statement. 
 ""Scerri Ferrante’s dedication and expertise will undoubtedly make a significant positive impact on this important committee. Her contribution will help this UN body continue its crucial mission to safeguard the rights of the most precious, yet most vulnerable, of all our communities – our children.""
 The press statement read how Scerri Ferrante brings extensive professional experience in child protection law, both through direct involvement in legal defence proceedings and the adjudication of numerous cases related to the welfare of minors.
 ""As an expert on children’s rights, she has contributed to the drafting of important legislation related to child protection, family law, domestic violence, and other related social issues,"" the statement added.
 The four-year term for Scerri Ferrante and another eight newly elected members will commence on March 1 2025. The other new committee members are from Mauritania, Kenya, Zambia, Belgium, Bhutan, Ethiopia, Georgia, and Moldova. 
 They will join nine other independent international experts who were elected to the 18-member committee two years ago. 
 The Committee on the Rights of the Child (CRC) is tasked with monitoring the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child by its state parties. 
 It also oversees the implementation of the Optional Protocols to the Convention, specifically regarding the involvement of children in armed conflict and issues related to the sale of children, child prostitution, and child pornography. 
 Last year, Malta also assumed the chairmanship of the working group on children and armed conflict at the United Nations Security Council.
 Over the years, the Council has addressed the links between child protection and conflict prevention, emphasising the importance of conflict prevention in the prevention of violations against children.

Maltese climber witnesses fatal fall on Europe’s highest peak,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/maltese-climber-witnesses-fatal-fall-elbrus-summit.1097192,09-01-2024,"006529.png,006530.png,006531.png","Rita Saliba stood close to the summit of Mount Elbrus, Europe’s highest peak, when she was confronted with an experience that would shake even the most seasoned climber.
 As the 30-year-old neared the end of her ascent earlier this month, a scream cut through the cold mountain air. Just metres away, she saw a fellow climber tumble headfirst down the steep incline – a “deeply shocking experience” that left Saliba paralysed with fear.
 Despite being only a few steps from the summit, the sight left her rooted to the spot, overcome with terror.
 “I was too scared to move my carabiners [climbing clips]… it was a torrent of emotions,” she added.
 The victim had just achieved her goal, reaching the 5,642m summit in Russia’s Caucasus mountains. But on her descent, as she navigated a 45-degree incline – considered to be the most dangerous part of the trek – she lost her footing.
 Saliba was at the front of her own group at the time and fully focused on the task at hand when the tragedy unfolded.
 “The line was moving slowly, likely due to the recent bad weather; it felt like everyone was trying to summit that day,” she recalled. 
 As she approached the end of the fixed-ropes section, a pair of climbers caught her eye.
 “They were descending a few metres below the fixed ropes, walking unattached,” she noted. Moments later, the fatal fall occurred.
 In the face of such a traumatic event, the climbers on the fixed ropes halted, unsure how to respond. Lacking the expertise to help, they could do little but continue their climb, haunted by what they had witnessed.
 “Later, we learned it was a girl who had just summited. She did not want to wait in line for the fixed ropes on the way down.” 
 “The only way down was up. We had no choice but to cautiously continue our climb,” she said, describing the rest of the expedition as “very emotionally difficult”. 
 “I could feel my body shaking, my heart throbbing and my stomach churning. I was completely disorientated. I wanted to go down.” 
 Her partner, who was behind her, kept urging her to focus on the next step and keep moving forward.  
 Once the fixed ropes ended, Saliba knew only 100m of elevation was left. In that moment, she realised she could reach the summit and achieve the goal she had worked towards. The victory was bittersweet, overshadowed by the tragic event.
  The woman who lost her life on August 17 was not in Saliba’s group, but the experience has deeply affected her. While the ascent is not considered as technically difficult as other mountains, dozens of climbers die yearly during summit attempts.
 However, it has not diminished Saliba’s resolve to conquer the Seven Summits – a challenge to climb the highest peak on each continent. With two summits under her belt, she now has five to go. 
 She was the youngest of her group of eight climbers and two guides, with six making it to the top. One reached 4,700m but turned back due to altitude sickness; and another stopped at 5,400m with a severe headache.
 Low on food and water
 Climbing Mount Elbrus typically takes eight to 12 days, allowing time for acclimatisation and multiple summit attempts. But bad weather delayed Saliba’s group by two days, leaving them low on food and water.
 When conditions finally cleared, they made their summit push, starting at 10pm on August 16 and reaching the peak around 12 hours later. Within another three hours, they were back down. 
 Saliba is not the only Maltese woman to have summited Mount Elbrus, but as the only female member of her group, she sees her achievement as testament to the growing participation of Maltese women in extreme sports.
 She hopes her journey will inspire others to challenge themselves and enter traditionally male-dominated arenas.
 Choosing to travel to Russia amid its ongoing war with Ukraine added another layer of complexity to the expedition. The sanctions against Russia meant it was hard to get in, and that if anything went wrong, she could not rely on help from outside.
  The group had to rely entirely on cash, as card payments were not accepted, and they were under pressure to complete the expedition before August 18. 
 “We needed to carefully manage our schedule to ensure we did the climb before our visas expired. This meant reaching the summit by August 17 to avoid overstaying. 
 “We had heard troubling stories about potential arrest rather than deportation. Such fears can be heavy when undertaking a challenge like this,” Saliba admitted.  
 Despite these challenges, she remains undeterred in her quest to climb the Seven Summits. Having already conquered Kilimanjaro in 2023 she sees Mount Elbrus as a crucial step in preparing her for her next challenge: Aconcagua, South America’s highest peak.
 “Each peak has pushed me physically and mentally, becoming a milestone of personal growth and self-discovery.”
 Yet, the tragedy on Mount Elbrus will remain with her, a stark reminder of the risks inherent in pursuing such lofty goals.

Robert Abela says UN must reform to increase its effectiveness,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/watch-live-robert-abela-addresses-un-security-council-peace-security.1098555,25-09-2024,006652.png,"Updated 6.10pm
 Prime Minister Robert Abela told a UN security council meeting on Wednesday the United Nations must reform to increase its effectiveness. 
 The meeting in New York discussed international peace and security.
 Malta's two-year term as a non-permanent member of the security council comes to an end in December.
 Abela told his colleagues that as a committed multilateralist, Malta would continue to stand firm in its support for the UN.
 “We are not naive – we know – just as the Secretary General outlined - that the UN can and must reform to increase its effectiveness.
 “But you don’t walk away when you notice imperfections. You redouble your efforts fix them.
 “At a moment in history where everyone is excited about the potential of artificial intelligence … let us not forget that – alongside intelligence - there are two other core human competences - humanity and compassion,” he said, adding that the UN was an expression of all three.
 The meeting - the council's 9732nd - was called Leadership for peace: united in respect of the UN Charter, in search of a secure future and was presided over by Slovenia's Prime Minister Robert Golob.
 
 In his address Abela said as Malta’s term came to an end, it was time to reflect: statistics, he said, could never tell the whole story and only human stories provided the true picture.
 “Behind every grim statistic is a grim human reality. It is to the shame of our world, that 2024 has brought far too many heartbreaking statistics and far too many stories of heartbreaking human misery.
 “We must never lose sight of those stories. As leaders, we must never hide behind statistics.
 “We must not forget the mothers in Gaza, whose sons and daughters were taken from them, or those who are living in constant fear of losing their child in the next strike.
 “We must not forget the families and friends of hostages being held by Hamas, who do not know if, or when, they will ever see their loved ones again.
 “We must not forget the orphans and widows in Ukraine who lost everything when their city was bombed and razed to the ground,"" he said.
 Abela said those who were suffering had been let down by leaders whose actions had shown contempt for the principles upon which the UN was founded.
 He urged his colleagues to never lose sight of the plight of Sudanese struggling to secure food amidst a devastating conflict and women and girls in Afghanistan who were being erased from society through the enactment of repressive and oppressive edicts.
 He also referred to children in Syria and Yemen who had to endure over a decade of conflict, and Venezuelans whom he said were deprived of their freedom because of their steadfast commitment to democracy.
 “We must never lose sight of the plight of… teenagers in Haiti who are being deprived of an education and recruited by ruthless gangs instead.
 “Of the Palestinians in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, including those killed as collateral damage in frequent military raids and settler violence, as well as those who lose their homes and suffer displacement.
 “And even when conflict comes to an end we must never lose sight of its ramifications, the suffering left behind,” he said, referring to the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Iraq, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Somalia - who continue to suffer the horrific consequences of landmines, long after the fighting has ceased, leaving many with life-altering injuries.
 The horrific experiences of these people must motivate world leaders to strive harder to fulfil the aims set out in the United Nations Charter, he added.

‘I’m scared I’ll be jailed or killed if I’m sent back’ – Ethiopian detainee,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/i-m-scared-i-ll-jailed-killed-i-m-sent-back-ethiopian-detainee.1101250,20-11-2024,006659.png,"An immigrant who has been living and working in Malta for 13 years is claiming he is to be deported to a region plagued by conflict, and he fears he could end up dead or in jail.
 Yosuf Ahmed Adam, 38, was among several Ethiopian migrants who were arrested and detained in August and told they would be deported to their home country as they cannot be granted refugee status in Malta.
 But Adam says he has been in Malta for so long that he feels it is his home now. He has worked legally since he arrived here and has never got into any trouble with locals or the police.
 “You can look it up for yourself – look up ‘Amhara region’ on the internet – and you’ll see there is fighting over there,” he told Times of Malta.
 “I live a good life in Malta, but if they’re going to send me back where there’s conflict, I’m going to die. I’m going to die for sure. They will kill me or send me to jail. I am very scared.”
 Speaking in relatively clear and fluent Maltese, Adam, who has been held at the Safi detention centre for over 100 days, expressed his concern for the future, saying that before his arrest, he was living a stable and productive life.
 In a reply to questions the Home Affairs Ministry would not comment on the specific Ethiopian region where Adam is to be sent, but said it has checks, balances and safeguards to ensure repatriations are fair, efficient, humane and sustainable.
 Times of Malta first reported the issue in August, describing how the Ethiopian community is “in shock” and “living in fear” as a number of people who have been living and working legally in Malta for up to 17 years were being arrested at their place of work.
 At least five were arrested and detained and then told they would be sent back to Ethiopia. Adam is one of them.
 They were informed that their application for refugee status had been rejected, even though some even had their own businesses in Malta.
 Adam said that when he made the crossing from Libya by boat in 2011, he was 25 and was fleeing war, but since then has lived and worked in Malta and now feels like a child of this country.
 “I love Malta, you could say I grew up here. I have grown accustomed to life here and I learnt Maltese,” he said.
 “And I get on really well with the Maltese people, I have nothing to complain about. As long as you treat them well, the Maltese people will treat you well.”
 He said that up until he was detained last summer, he was working legally and had no trouble with his employer, his clients, or the police.
 “You can go check my criminal record – it’s clean,” he said.
 A spokesperson for the Home Affairs Ministry said, “decisions on international protection are not made by the ministry or the minister”.
 “In recent years, the ministry has significantly invested in the International Protection Agency to ensure it has the necessary resources to carry out its mandate effectively and guarantee a fair and efficient asylum process,” they said.
 “The International Protection Agency has introduced measures to improve Malta’s asylum system, including streamlining procedures, updating templates to ensure decisions are legally and factually sound, and establishing a Quality Control Unit.
 Additionally, a Returns Unit was set up in 2021 to support voluntary returns and ensure humane, sustainable repatriations with reintegration assistance.”
 The government has previously defended the deportations as part of an EU initiative to increase readmission efforts with Ethiopia and has often said that allowing irregular migrants to keep living in Malta will only encourage more of them to make the dangerous crossing from Africa, essentially putting more lives in danger.
 Deporting migrants who do not have refugee status sends the message that Malta is open to those who want to come over and work above board, but not for human traffickers, the government argues.
 But activists, critics, migrants and the Church disagree, and the issue has recently been the subject of protests and demonstrations.
 They argue that this is a harsh and inhumane treatment of people who have become integrated into Maltese society.
 Lawyers and activists have raised concerns about the lack of due process and the potential violation of human rights. They argue that the government should consider a more compassionate approach, especially for those who have been living in Malta for many years.
 The government has defended its actions, stating that those who do not qualify for international protection are offered voluntary return packages. However, many Ethiopians have refused these offers, preferring to remain in Malta where they have built their lives, it said.
 But civil society organisations, the Church, and the PN have joined in condemning the government’s actions and urging it to reconsider its stance.

 The meeting is being held in New York as part of the General Assembly.
 He insisted for action within the newly signed Pact for the Future for a more sustainable future as well as peace and security.
 He also called for greater involvement in decision-making by women and young people, scientific innovation and international cooperation in digitalisation.
 The ""Pact for the Future,"" adopted on Sunday, is aimed at addressing sprawling 21st-century challenges ranging from conflict to climate change and human rights, despite last-minute objections from a group of countries led by Russia.
 UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who organized the ""Summit of the Future,"" had billed it as a ""once-in-a-generation opportunity"" to reshape human history by rekindling international cooperation.
 Leaders pledged to bolster the multilateral system to ""keep pace with a changing world"" and to ""protect the needs and interests of current and future generations"" facing ""persistent crisis."" 
 The pact outlines 56 ""actions,"" including commitments to multilateralism, upholding the UN Charter and peacekeeping.
 It also calls for reforms to international financial institutions and the UN Security Council, along with renewed efforts to combat climate change, promote disarmament, and guide the development of artificial intelligence.
 The adoption of the text faced a brief delay when Russia's deputy minister of foreign affairs, Sergey Vershinin, introduced an amendment emphasizing the ""principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of states"" and urging the UN to avoid duplicating efforts.
 Russia's objections were backed by allies Belarus, North Korea, Iran, Nicaragua and Syria, but its amendment was overwhelmingly dismissed in a motion to take no action.

 The princess and the Californian 'spiritual healer' were married at a hotel in Geiranger, the picturesque UNESCO-listed village, with a backdrop of Norway’s breathtaking natural scenery. 
 Charles & Ron were also commissioned to design the suits of the eight groomsmen.
 Ron van Maarschalkerweerd described the process as an “intense operation"" lasting three months.
 They dispatched the custom-made suits and the groom’s tuxedo ten days before the grand royal wedding.
  “The groomsmen were from all around the world, so we had to arrange everything over video calls, and we had no fittings,” van Maarschalkerweerd told Times of Malta. 
 “We sent the suits 10 days before the wedding. Everything was perfect, and the couple loved them.”
 The three-day wedding festivities kicked off on Thursday, and the fashionable duo were among the 350 guests, including Norwegian royals, family and friends. 
 “It was three days of celebrations, and it was a beautiful and special wedding,” Ron said.
 “The wedding was a celebration of true love, and the royal family were so loving towards the couple.”
 Van Maarschalkerweerd said they met Verrett a few years back at one of their fashion shows in Los Angeles. 
 “He became a fan of our work, and even bought a few pieces in the past,” he recalled. 
 Earlier this year, he phoned the duo asking them to design his wedding suit. 
 “We were very excited, and after a few calls with Durek and the Princess discussing their ideas, they left us with a lot of creative freedom to design the suits.”
  The groom’s tuxedo and trousers were made from black silk jacquard, keeping a classical design for the royal wedding. 
 The tuxedo was lined with gold and included a gold cummerbund and tie knot, with the idea of bringing out some of Verrett's “lovable” characteristics in the design.
 The couple’s monograms were embroidered in gold on the tuxedo jacket, Van Maarschalkerweerd explained it was the couple’s design and idea. 
  “We simply came up with the idea of embroidering the monogram on the sleeve, and they loved it,” he said.
 The groomsmen’s three-piece suits were also black and made from light wool with finishing touches of pink.
 ""Everybody was full of praise for the wedding outfits,"" he said.
 He described Verrett as a ""special and lovable character, who always has a sense of calmness, even during the most stressful moments.""
  The relationship between the Norwegian princess and the shaman has raised eyebrows in the past.
 The princess, a 52-year-old divorcee, claims to be a clairvoyant who can speak with angels, a gift she has shared and profited from in books and courses.
 Verrett, 49, calls himself a ""sixth-generation shaman"" and sells pricey gold medallions that he says save lives.
 The couple announced their engagement in June 2022 and the couple’s eccentricity has ruffled feathers in Norway, as has their disregard for science and their use of their royalties for commercial gain. 
 Shortly after announcing their engagement, the princess relinquished her royal duties. While she kept her title, she agreed not to use it in her commercial endeavours.
 The couple has also angered Norwegian media by signing deals with Hello! magazine and Netflix for exclusive coverage of the wedding.
 The princess is fourth in line to the Norwegian throne.

Maltese peacekeepers escape injury after Lebanon base struck by rocket,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/maltese-peacekeepers-escape-injury-lebanon-base-struck-rocket.1100366,31-10-2024,007344.png,"A military camp in southern Lebanon where Maltese peacekeeping soldiers are based has been struck by a rocket.
 The seven AFM soldiers stationed at Camp Shamrock are safe and unharmed, a spokesperson told Times of Malta. 
 “Yesterday, at around 1610 hrs, a misfire from north of the blue line led to an unexploded ordnance landing within the Irish compound,” she said.
 “This ordnance was immediately detonated. Another unexploded ordnance, located 20 metres outside the compound, has also been safely detonated. The area is now secure.”
 The UNIFIL (United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon) base is an Irish camp located a short distance from the Israeli border and also has soldiers from other countries, including Malta and Poland. 
 No one was injured in the incident. The Irish Defence Forces said the rocket was of a make associated with Hezbollah. 
 The soldiers, led by Lieutenant Katrin Abela, have been stationed in Camp Shamrock since May. 
 The strike was confirmed on Thursday morning by Defence Forces Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Seán Clancy, who said an initial investigation indicated the device was a Katyusha rocket, which is developed in Russia and commonly used by Hezbollah. 
 Clancy also said the rocket appeared to be fired from the north towards Israel and that there is an ongoing investigation to determine whether the explosive had been intercepted and shot down by the Israeli air defence system before landing in the camp. 
 Israel’s ambassador to Malta Ze’ev Boker has said that Israeli troops are trying their best to guarantee the safety of Maltese soldiers and others at the peacekeeping mission. 
 “Our message to our Maltese high-level counterparts [was] Israel will do its best to assure the safety of Maltese soldiers in southern Lebanon,” he said in a Times of Malta interview.
 “We are trying our best not to target the Maltese, Irish or other nations that are there; we are friends of them, and we are not looking at them as our challengers... We are doing our best to see there will be no damage, no injury, to the UN soldiers in Lebanon.”
 There are around 350 soldiers currently deployed with Unifil carrying out peacekeeping duties.

 It is the European Parliament president’s third visit to the country which has suffered a bloody siege from neighbouring Russia in 27 months of war. 
 “I came here because I wanted to send a strong message,” Metsola told Times of Malta, which is among media organisations covering the president’s trip. 
  ""We stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes. Since the unprovoked attack, Ukrainians have been fighting for our freedom.""
 Metsola said she hoped the European Parliament would play a major role in an upcoming peace summit. 
 ""We never give up hope. There will be nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine on the table.""
 She is expected to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv on Thursday.
 The European Parliament president was welcomed by Russian Stefanchuk, the  chair of Ukraine's parliament. 
  Metsola’s visit coincides with Russia’s Victory Day, a holiday that marks the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany in 1945. 
 She was immediately given a tour of two sites - a power plant and a school - that were recently bombed. 
 Ukrainian officials told the president the two targets were deliberate and intended to continue instilling fear in the capital.

‘Why I left claustrophobic Malta to become a farmer in Slovakia’,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/why-i-left-claustrophobic-malta-farmer-slovakia.1098733,30-09-2024,"007770.png,007771.png","Elle Bonello Azzopardi Ibbotson has spoken of her contentment after she traded Malta’s urban sprawl and her hectic job at Mater Dei Hospital for the tranquillity of life on a Slovakian farm.
 At 49, she now runs a permaculture farm in a rural town with her partner, Zara. Together, the couple grow a variety of vegetables and raise livestock, including sheep, rabbits, and pigs.
 “Being in touch with nature has given me a deep connection not only with the earth but also with my inner self. I wouldn’t trade it for anything,” she says.
 The decision to make such a dramatic life change came after a period of reflection, as Elle realised that Malta was no longer the country she had grown up in.
 Her turning point arrived during the COVID-19 pandemic. After years of working as a paramedic, Elle began managing logistics for the A&E department at Mater Dei in March 2020. Working at Malta’s general hospital, combined with Malta’s growing population density and rapidly changing landscape, she started to feel trapped on the island.
 “Life in Malta is far too claustrophobic,” she explained. To make matters worse, there was a plan to build apartments on top of her maisonette in Paola.
 By 2021, Elle no longer felt connected to the island where she had spent her childhood.
 “Life was much simpler when I was younger,” she reflects.
 A visit to Zara’s hometown in Slovakia sparked the idea of leaving Malta for good. When the couple compared property prices, the decision became clear.
  “We sold our two-bedroom maisonette in Paola for around €220,000 and bought a 1,000-square-metre farm in Bina, Slovakia for just €35,000,” Elle says.
 Their new lifestyle centres around permaculture, a sustainable farming method that prioritises efficient use of natural resources and minimising waste.
 “It’s not just about creating a circular economy; it’s about fostering circular biodiversity,” Elle explains, emphasising that their goal is to work with nature rather than against it.
 The pair were largely welcomed by the Slovakian community. “For two trans women to leave Malta and start a farm in Slovakia is pretty bold,” Elle admits.
 While most of their neighbours were kind from the start, one neighbour was not as accepting.
 Despite his initial hostility, Elle and Zara remained polite and friendly. About nine months later, when his wife was diagnosed with cancer, Ibbotson approached him offering help, given her background as a paramedic.
 Slowly he began to accept her support, and today, their neighbour even helps care for their animals when the pair travel abroad.
 Community is another key element of their new life. This was particularly true last June, when a storm devastated their town and farm.
 Despite the challenges, the couple was not left to face the aftermath alone. Their neighbours rallied together to help one another.
 “We all came together as one,” Elle recalls. “At this point, I’m closer to my Slovak neighbours than I am to some family members.”
 This sense of community reminds Elle of the Malta she knew in the 1980s, a time she fondly remembers for its simplicity and neighbourly spirit. Despite this nostalgia, she insists she has no desire to return to the island permanently. “We moved in April 2022 and haven’t looked back,” she says.
 “I’ll never live in Malta again. Even when I visit, I only stay for 36 hours.”
  For Elle, the decision to leave Malta was not just about escaping the hectic pace or overdevelopment. It was about finding a place where she and Zara could build a life rooted in peace, sustainability, and community.
 “I want a quiet life more than anything,” she says, “and that no longer exists in Malta, or from what I hear, even in Gozo.”
 But in Slovakia, they’ve found exactly what they were searching for: a slower, quieter way of living, surrounded by nature and a supportive community.

'People burst into tears': Maltese eatery in Melbourne reminds diners of home,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/people-burst-tears-maltese-eatery-melbourne-reminds-diners-home.1097542,09-09-2024,"007562.png,007563.png","Mark Mizzi, a Maltese-Australian chef with four decades of experience in international cuisine, has recently returned to his roots by opening Nanna’s Place, the only Maltese restaurant in Victoria, Australia.
 Mizzi, whose parents emigrated from Malta to Australia in the 1960s, grew up in both Australia and Kalkara. His grandmother, Jesse, played a significant role in his upbringing, teaching him the intricacies of Maltese cuisine.
 Inspired by her, Nanna’s Place, in Melbourne, aims to recreate the experience of dining at his grandmother’s house, focusing on the flavours of traditional dishes and the communal, family-sharing concept that defines Maltese hospitality.
 “We wanted to give people a taste of what it was like in the old days when you’d visit nanna, and she’d bring out a big beautiful dish for everyone to share,” Mizzi explained.
 Since opening Nanna’s Place with his life and business partner Susan Busuttil two weeks ago, the restaurant has quickly gained popularity, with about 80 per cent of its customers of Maltese descent. Victoria is home to Australia’s largest Maltese community, with 81,542 residents of Maltese ancestry, including 16,844 who were born in Malta.
  Mizzi is especially moved by the emotional reactions of Maltese Australians who dine at his restaurant. “We’ve had people take one bite and burst into tears, saying it’s the closest they’ve come to tasting their nanna’s cooking. That’s the best compliment for me,” he said.
 In addition to serving the Maltese community, Nanna’s Place has attracted a diverse clientele, including many from the Asian community, particularly those from China and Japan, who appreciate the restaurant’s specialities of rabbit and octopus.
 This is not Mizzi’s first foray into the Maltese restaurant business. Six years ago, he opened the Maltese Pastizzi Bar and Restaurant in Melbourne’s suburbs. “We outgrew that location and were ready to take it to the next level,” he said.
 The new Nanna’s Place is six times larger than its predecessor and offers an expanded Mediterranean menu that includes Italian, Greek, and Spanish dishes, although the popular pastizzi remain a staple.
 Mizzi feels fortunate to have received strong support from the Maltese community, especially given the challenges others have faced in maintaining Maltese restaurants in Australia. He hopes Nanna’s Place will serve as a cultural bridge, introducing Maltese cuisine to a broader audience.

What is it like onboard a turboprop plane?,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/what-like-onboard-turboprop-plane.1092663,30-05-2024,007675.png,"There are many reasons why someone might wish to visit the Hungarian city of Pécs: unique ceramics, wine and world-famous gloves, to name a few. 
 Unfortunately, until recently, nobody really knew about the place. That is, until aviation newcomer Universal Air decided to fly there. 
 The airline announced its debut into Malta’s crowded aviation scene in March, promising to carry passengers to new destinations ‒ including Pécs ‒ in its fleet of Dash 4-800 turboprop planes. 
  And recently, the company announced its summer schedule which opened this month, adding direct flights between Malta and Cagliari (Sardinia), Perugia (Italy), Nice (France) and Prague (Czechia).
 Universal Air CEO Simon Cook said the airline’s turboprop planes were versatile, nimble and able to load and take off quicker than their larger counterparts, making up for any lack of speed compared to aircraft such as Boeing’s 737. 
 He also said they were quieter than previous models flown by the airline and more comfortable. 
 And he promised that because of their smaller size carrying just 78 people, they would open new routes to smaller airports not able to accommodate larger aircraft. 
 So, when Times of Malta was offered the chance to get a first-hand look at one of them, we dutifully hopped onboard. 
 While the take-off was a little bumpier than usual, this could have been more the fault of the weather than the plane’s engines – though one might have expected a smoother ascent in a regular jet under the same conditions.
 Passenger Gabor Nagy said he was “enjoying the turbulence” and as an aviation enthusiast was just excited to be onboard the airline’s first trip to Pécs. 
 “It’s a pleasure for me,” he said.
 Once the plane reached cruising altitude of around 25,000 feet – a height around 10,000 feet less than a regular passenger plane – the experience was much the same as any other flight, however.
 In fact, the plane was arguably more comfortable, with more leg room and only two seats each side of the aisle, albeit a bit louder than a conventional jet. 
 Cabin crew member Damian Galea said that while the plane’s smaller size – and therefore smaller crew complement – made the job more demanding, having fewer passengers onboard allowed for a more “intimate” atmosphere.
 During the flight, Times of Malta caught up with Universal Air chairperson Andrew Walker, who said getting the airline to this point had been a “long journey”. 
 Admitting it was “very hard to compete with the likes of Ryanair,” Walker stressed the company’s business model would be the secret to its success.
 “We’re pitching a low-cost carrier, but with premium-economy frills. It’s always nice to delight your customers and that’s what we’re trying to do,” he said.
 Why Pécs?
 “We were contacted by the people in Pécs asking if we would consider the city as a route, which is quite unusual,” he explained. 
 Describing local officials as “unbelievably supportive”, Walker stressed routes between Pécs and Malta were “incredibly in demand”, with Hungarian locals also keen to visit Malta.
 And he thinks this is a sign the company’s business model is going to pay off. 
 “Some people said we were crazy, and ‘how are you going to survive?’ [but] we’re not just going to survive; we’re going to thrive.”

Government set to announce new law banning breeding and owning of non-pedigree bully dogs,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/national/130600/government_set_to_announce_new_law_banning_breeding_and_owning_of_nonpedigree_bully_dogs_,05-08-2024,000081.png,"Government on Tuesday will be announcing the prohibition of breeding and keeping of non-pedigree bully breed dogs.
 The new law will also make the breeding, purchasing, advertising and owning of mixed bully breed dogs illegal.
 Owners of mixed breed or non-pedigree bully canines will not have their pet confiscated by the authorities, or be in breach of the law, if they were in possession of the dog before the legislation came into force.
  The law will also clearly define bully breeds, and specifies which crosses will not be permitted. Owners looking to adopt or buy bully breed dogs can only do so from a recognised kennel club.
 The debate around bully breeds in Malta is a longstanding one, and is sent into overdrive once an incident makes the rounds on social media and newspapers.
 Earlier this year 27 bully breed dogs were rescued from a Ħaż-Żebbuġ residence in April.
 The rescue saw a number of NGOs and the Animal Welfare Commissioner Alison Bezzina calling for a temporary ban on the breeding of these dogs to curb their high rate of abandonment.
 In her 2021 end of year report, Bezzina had called for a nation-wide ban on the importation and breeding of bully breeds. She argued that bull breeds account for many dogs which are abandoned by their owners and thrown out into the streets.
 This year, government also launched free neutering of bully breeds in a pilot project, which Parliamentary Secretary for Animal Rights Alicia Buegja Said said is expected to be extended to include all breeds.
 ""Our aim is to continue to protect animal rights. In addition to renewing the neutering campaign for stray cats, we are also looking after the reproduction of certain dog breeds as most of them, unfortunately, end up abandoned,"" she had said.

When 118 died as a fierce fire engulfed a ship off Malta's coast,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/sardinia-tragedy-when-118-died-fire-engulfed-ship-malta-coast.1101539,25-11-2024,"000110.png,000111.png","One of Malta's worst peacetime maritime disasters occurred 116 years ago today, when at least 118 people died as a fierce fire engulfed a ship just off the coast.
 Flames broke out on the SS Sardinia on November 25, 1908 as it was leaving the Grand Harbour. It was carrying 32 crew, 12 first-class passengers and 142 steerage passengers, mainly Muslims travelling from Morocco on their way to Mecca.
 The ship had started its voyage in Liverpool and stopped at various harbours on the way to Malta. It was then due to head for Alexandria.
 The ship also carried a cargo that included flammable nitrate and naphtha.
 Investigations concluded that the fire originated in the No. 2 hold, and it was probably caused by pilgrims cooking on an open flame on deck, Kevin Aquilina, who has followed the tragedy said in comments to Times of Malta and  on Facebook. 
  An inquiry also established that there were no precautions to prevent fire on board the vessel.
 The flames spread quickly before assistance could reach the vessel. Many died trapped below decks.
 An unsuccessful attempt was made to return to port, but the bridge was soon engulfed in flames. The wheel was abandoned and the vessel went around in circles until it grounded between Fort Ricasoli and Fort Rinella.
 Judge Giovanni Bonello wrote about the tragedy in further detail in 2003.

Slovakian businessman acquitted of murdering journalist in court ‘debacle’,theshiftnews,https://theshiftnews.com/2023/05/20/slovakian-businessman-acquitted-of-murdering-journalist-in-court-debacle/,20-05-2023,000311.png,"Slovak business tycoon Marian Kočner has been acquitted in a court retrial for the murder of Aktuality.sk investigative journalist Ján Kuciak and his fiancé Martina Kušnírová, in what international press freedom organisations have called a “debacle of the judicial procedure”.
 While the court argued that there was not enough evidence for his guilty verdict, Kočner’s close associate Alena Zsuzsova, whose relationship with the businessman was described as her “lifeline” by the court, was found guilty of ordering the assassination, which took place on 21 February 2018.
 The acquittal came after the Slovak Supreme Court mandated retrial of a September 2020 trial, as the original Pezinok Court did not properly assess available evidence when it cleared Kočner and Zsuzsova. Despite the retrial, the court chose to ignore expert opinions indicating hidden messages between the two within encrypted chats on the app Threema.
 Besides Kuciak and Kušnírová’s assassination, Zsuzsova was found guilty of ordering two other murders and is serving 25 years in prison. Kočner was also found guilty in a separate forgery case and is serving 19 years.
 The court stated that its verdict was not an assessment of Kočner’s innocence but rather based on a lack of evidence, rubbishing expert linguistic analysis indicating communication between Kočner and Zsuzsova through cyphers.
 Media freedom organisation Reporters Without Borders (RSF) has called the acquittal a “debacle of the judicial procedure”, saying “RSF deplores the failed judicial proceedings against Marian Kocner. We continue seeking full justice for this crime, which has undermined press freedom in Europe.”
 
 The International Press Institute has described the acquittal as a “shock” and vowed to continue the fight for full justice for the slain journalist and his fiancé. IPI Deputy Director Scott Griffen said the acquittal was “a devastating reminder that the battle against impunity is an uphill one”, with former IPI board member and editor-in-chief of the daily Slovak newspaper SME Beata Balogova saying “The verdict has still left the story of the murder of Jan Kuciak unfinished”.
 In a joint statement, ARTICLE 19 Europe, Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), European Federation of Journalists (EFJ), Free Press Unlimited (FPU), International Press Institute (IPI), OBC Transeuropa (OBCT), Reporters Without Borders (RSF), and the European Centre for Press and Media Freedom (ECPMF) expressed their “profound disappointment” at the acquittal.
 In their statement, they said it “represents another devastating blow to the fight for full justice for Ján and Martina’s killing”, adding that the case “case follows an all-too-common pattern in which the hitmen and facilitators involved in such crimes are put behind bars while the suspected masterminds who ordered the murder evade justice.”
 Kuciak and Kušnírová’s parents left the Pezinok courtroom before the sentence was read out completely, with Kuciak’s father, Jozef saying “There’s no logic to it, I don’t get it at all”, according to a report by The Guardian.
 The family will now be filing an appeal to the sentence, which will be heard in front of the Slovak Supreme Court.
 According to a report by Aktuality.sk, the news portal which Kuciak worked for, Peter Kubina, the family’s lawyer said that “this battle must be fought only by the prosecutors and legal representatives of the a at the Supreme Court. They can afford to question today’s verdict… the only social order that the judiciary has to fulfil is independence.”

 During the meeting Borg expressed solidarity with the MOAS members injured during the attack, as he reiterated Malta’s call for increased international protection to humanitarian aid workers and volunteers in conflict zones.
  He also commended this organisation, as it marks its 10th anniversary.
 Since its inception in 2014, MOAS has aided many communities in conflict zones and disaster-stricken areas.
 Initially focused on saving lives in the Mediterranean during the migration crisis, this organisation continued to expand its mission to a wide range of humanitarian operations globally, including in Southeast Asia, Bangladesh, and Sudan, Somalia and Yemen.
  Since the beginning of the Russian war of aggression in Ukraine in 2022, MOAS intensified its operations in this country, supporting local authorities and the World Health Organisation in providing emergency medical care on the frontlines.
 With a team of 150 Ukrainian medics, doctors and ambulance drivers, the Maltese organisation has treated over 50,000 frontline patients without a single fatality.
 Borg praised MOAS for its “relentless dedication”.
 “The 10th anniversary of MOAS is an opportunity to reflect on the vital role humanitarian organisations play in our world. MOAS’s efforts remind us of our shared commitment to protect human dignity, especially in times of crisis. Malta will continue to support those who work tirelessly to provide relief to those most in need. Indeed, humanitarian action is not a choice, but a shared responsibility,” he said. “As members of the United Nations Security Council, through our OSCE chairpersonship and our engagement at other international platforms, we will continue advocating for the protection of humanitarian workers.”
 Albert Delia, MOAS’s Fundraising and Development Officer, said that “our operations in Ukraine require a lot of funds and other resources. We are working to continue providing this humanitarian assistance. During the past ten years we have received the support of the Maltese Government, and we wish to continue in this direction. We also call for more donations from the public, so that we can keep helping communities in need in Ukraine and other countries.”
 Borg echoed this appeal, encouraging Maltese people, including business organisations, to actively support MOAS and other humanitarian organisations.  ",Karl Azzopardi ,Malta Abroad
