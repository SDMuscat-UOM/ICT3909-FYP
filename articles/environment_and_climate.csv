"At United Nations, Malta keeps sea-rise threat and climate crisis on agenda",maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/national/131402/at_united_nations_malta_keeps_searise_threat_and_climate_crisis_on_agenda,26-09-2024,"000007.png,000008.png","Prime Minister Robert Abela told a United Nations General Assembly session discussing the threat of sea-level rise and the climate crisis that the major challenge was staring the face of countries even should tey remain in line with climate action plans.
 “Everyone’s efforts are important, because this is a challenge that threatens humanity as a whole,” Abela told the meeting, which was addressed by UNGA president Dennis Francis and UN Secretary-General António Guterres.
  “We cannot reverse our agreed-upon obligations, and we must remain focused on clean economic actions that should lead to the goal of a reduction of 1.5 degrees as laid down by the Paris Agreement,” Abela said.
 The Maltese premier said the threat of sea-level rise affected everyone economically, saying small state-islands like Malta were at the forefront of this challenge.
 In its two-year term as a Non-Permanent Member of the United Nations Security Council, Malta used its presidency to place the climate crisis on the agenda, more specifically with the phenomenon of rising sea levels.
 “Malta will continue to support the discussion on seriously addressing sea-level rise. We must act together today before tomorrow,” Abela said. “As an international community we must have a strong legal framework that also addresses this phenomenon in a bid to create an international order when so many different interests are at stake.”
  Also in New York, deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ian Borg joined the President of Cabo Verde José Maria Neves and the Prime Ministers of Tuvalu and Belize Feleti Teo and John Briceño to co-host a high-level event on climate mobility.
 The meeting, which included the participation of key leaders from another 17 UN member states, was held on Wednesday as part of the 79th United Nations General Assembly (UNGA 79), which is taking place in New York this week. Borg highlighted the serious consequences of climate mobility on small island developing states (SIDS) at risk of disappearing due to sea level rise and called for global solutions for their survival.
 “The impending disappearance of a nation carries more than just legal and physical consequences – it also concerns the identity of entire populations. Our identity is what defines us. We are tied to our homeland by family and friends, livelihoods, traditions, and the memories of loved ones who have passed.”
 As a threat multiplier, climate change magnifies the impact of other factors, such as poverty, loss of livelihoods and tensions relating to dwindling resources. Such chain reactions ultimately lead to conflict and displacement of people.
 “This is why we need comprehensive actions and solutions,” Borg said. “Addressing climate change as a root cause of displacement is crucial to breaking this cycle and finding lasting solutions. We cannot afford to lose any more time.” 
 Deputy Prime Minister Ian Borg also held several meetings in his role as the 2024 Chair-in-Office of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), including a meeting of the OSCE Troika, and meetings with the foreign ministers of three OSCE participating states, including Kyrgyzstan, Russia and Serbia.

Consultation on new height limitation policy closes 12 hours before deadline,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/consultation-new-height-limitation-policy-closes-12-hours-deadline.1094071,17-06-2024,"000230.png,000231.png,000232.png","Public consultation over a controversial proposal to amend height limitations closed abruptly on Monday, despite a Planning Ministry spokesperson telling  Times of Malta feedback about the policy is welcome until the end of the day.
 On Monday, those who referred to the public consultation website for guidance on how to submit their feedback about the proposal found that the consultation had closed at least 12 hours before the official deadline. 
 The Planning Authority launched a consultation to amend a policy in Development Control Design Policy, Guidance and Standards - a controversial document commonly known as the DC15.
 Previously, height limitations were set by the number of floors that could be built in any given area, as set out by the local plans. However, an annexe included in DC15, Annexe 2, laid out a table in which the maximum allowable heights of buildings previously indicated as floors, had now been converted into metres. 
 Should the amendments to policy 35 of DC15, which regulates allowable building height, be accepted, it will formalise this interpretation of the guidelines. 
  Public consultation was set to close at midnight - at the end of Monday.
 Astrid Vella, from Flimkien għal Ambjent Aħjar was on an RTK103 radio programme on Monday morning, urging people to contribute to the public consultation when a listener informed her the consultation had closed.
 She claimed ""the sudden and unannounced closure of the consultation at 10am reveals the sham nature of the consultation process and the motivations behind it"".
 When asked to clarify whether consultation had closed, a Planning Ministry spokesperson told Times of Malta “The PA can confirm that the public consultation will close at midnight tonight”.
 As of 5pm, the website is still showing the consultation as closed.
 However, NGOs are encouraging people to continue emailing their concern to consultation_dc15@pa.org.mt. 
 Din l-Art Ħelwa’s President, Patrick Calleja meanwhile said that if consultation was still open, the authorities should update the public consultation website so as to avoid confusion among people who wanted to submit feedback.
 Din l-Art Ħelwa, Flimkien għal Ambjent Aħjar, Għawdix and Moviment Graffiti have all spoken out against the proposed policy amendment.
  Calleja warned the proposal would undermine recent court decisions.
 Additionally, ""adopting this amendment could change the whole aspect of current streetscapes with just two or three floors, especially if the area happens to be on the border of a UCA"". 
  In a statement, Għawdix said that by ""potentially expanding the allowable number of building levels for various facade heights, the revision of P35 risks encouraging developers to maximize building heights, further straining local services and diminishing the quality of life for residents.""
 ""This approach undermines the original intent of DC15, which was to promote a context-driven approach to development rather than a one-size-fits-all height allowance.”

 The exhibition, an international initiative organised as part of the Global Network of Water Museums, was hosted by the Għajn Centre, a community space in the Nigret area of Rabat that aims to raise awareness about the challenges facing the water sector.
 Under the guidance of renowned artist Joanne Mizzi, students created 34 artworks inspired by their educational experiences at the Chadwick Lakes trail, using visual art to express their understanding of local biodiversity and freshwater ecosystems.
 Four of the artworks were selected for inclusion in the AQUAPLAY section of the WAMU-NET website. This global digital platform, supported by UNESCO, aims to raise awareness about water heritage, pollution, and sustainability by engaging children worldwide.
  Environment minister Miriam Dalli, who attended the exhibition, said that educating children on sustainability was one of the most impactful investments that could be made.
 ""By introducing these concepts through creative and engaging activities, we empower students to explore vital themes like biodiversity and water conservation in ways that resonate deeply with them. These initiatives educate and inspire young people to become future ambassadors for sustainability,” Dalli said.
 Amanda Zahra, professional officer at the Energy and Water Agency, highlighted the Centre’s ongoing efforts.
 “The Għajn Centre welcomes students every day to learn about responsible water management and sustainability. While we work tirelessly to promote these values, events like this give us the opportunity to showcase our initiatives on an international stage. It is a proud moment for us and reflects our commitment to educating future generations,” she said.

 The Public Works Department said it had inspected the site and there was a high probability that more rocks and clay would fall off the cliff face.
 The area was therefore being closed off as a precaution. 
 A year ago Times of Malta quoted architect Alex Torpiano warning that the unstable nature of the Fomm ir-Riħ area could see people getting injured due to frequent collapses.
 Torpiano had warned that people who use the public path that leads to the beach, as well as swimmers who approach the shore by boat, could be at risk as the area has been prone to frequent collapses. Two significant collapses were recorded in March and November of 2021.
  Last month a 22-year-old woman, Mirabelle Falzon died after being crushed under a rockfall in Marsascala. She had been swimming in an area known as Munxar, within the limits of St Thomas Bay, when the tragedy happened.
 In July last year people on a boat reported a lucky escape when rocks fell into the sea at the area known as Tlett Ħofriet, Delimara.
 The area is frequented by adventurous visitors who reach it by kayak or boat, or by those willing to trek down to the beach. Marsaxlokk council subsequently warned visitors to be cautious. 
 Also last year, in February, a large boulder crashed onto Popeye Village, damaging one of the small structures of the popular tourist attraction.
 Last year the authorities warned people to stay clear of the cliff face at Għar Lapsi, limits of Siġġiewi, which is in danger of collapsing. Parts of the cliff face were closed off by a steel net some years ago but several people sneaked through gaps to lounge right under the crumbling cliff face.

Calls grow for Prime Minister to expropriate Mellieħa Heights land,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/calls-grow-prime-minister-revoke-mellieha-heights-development.1101800,30-11-2024,000365.png,"Updated 4.35pm
 Calls for the Prime Minister to revoke a controversial agreement for a 109-unit apartment complex in Mellieħa Heights have intensified following his recent comments.
 Robert Abela acknowledged the Mellieħa Heights controversy and told Times of Malta that publicly owned green spaces should not be tendered for development unless they serve a social purpose.
 “I had said that where there is this type of land, unless it is needed for social reasons, issuing a tender [to develop] should be avoided,” Abela said, following revelations that T&S Property Holdings had obtained planning permission for the project.
 The government had sold the 4,000-square-metre plot to T&S Property Holdings on a 50-year perpetual lease with an annual payment of €380,000. The deal allows the lease to be redeemed.
 Mellieħa mayor Gabriel Micallef, a vocal critic of the project, has sent a letter to Abela urging him to “put his words into action”. Micallef called for the agreement to be revoked and the land repurposed as a community project.
 “As Prime Minister, you hold the power and the moral responsibility to rectify this injustice by using the law to expropriate this unspoiled land and return it to the public,” Micallef wrote in his letter.
 Speaking to Times of Malta, Micallef said Mellieħa lacks untouched green spaces and proposed turning the site into a park or garden with a reading area for residents. The Mellieħa council will be ready to take this land under its care,” he said.
 Opposition to the project came to a head in October, when residents and council members joined a protest against it. Critics argue that the project contradicts the government’s stated goals of preserving green spaces.
 T&S Property Holdings has defended the project, citing its designation as a development site since 1965. However, Micallef dismissed the 2006 local plans that reaffirmed the zoning as “outdated.”
 Meanwhile, the NGO Il-Kollettiv insisted the government already has the power to revoke the Mellieħa Heights agreement. Calling for accountability within the Planning Authority, the activist group questioned how T&S Property Holdings secured planning permission “in record time” of just two months.
 Il-Kollettiv has also highlighted another development in Mellieħa involving a 26-room guesthouse and 28 apartments. The land for that project was sold for €151,000 under an emphyteusis agreement, which allows the lease to be redeemed within 15 years. The NGO noted that the architect is Gilbert Bartolo, brother of former tourism minister Clayton Bartolo.
 Il-Kollettiv said it has urged the National Audit Office to expand its investigation to include both developments in light of these concerns.
 PN MPs Robert Cutajar and Ivan Castillo, as well as then-PL MEP Cyrus Engerer, have all previously backed the Mellieħa Heights residents’ calls not to give away the land.
 A spokesperson at the Office of the Prime Minister told Times of Malta that Abela stood by what he said last week outside parliament.

ADPD committed to foster green EU policies to mitigate effects of climate change,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/adpd-committed-foster-green-eu-policies-climate-change.1093022,25-05-2024,000430.png,"If Malta is serious about its fight against the effects of climate change, the people should support the Green Party, which is committed to pushing for effective measures and policies to mitigate the effects of climate change, it said on Saturday. 
 During a press conference at Birżebbuġa, ADPD chairperson and MEP candidate Sandra Gauchi said recent polls have shown that voters are concerned with the effects of climate change. 
 “We want an economy of well-being, not an economy that fattens the pockets of those who are polluting the air, water, land, and environment,” she said. 
 “It is obvious that the country is affected by the impacts of climate change, and now we have no other choice but to act now. We are already late.”
 The ADPD members noted how different localities have been impacted by pollution and climate change, and focused on the seaside town of Birżebbuġa. 
 Melissa Bagley, ADPD deputy chairperson and Birżebbuġa local council candidate said residents have been impacted by the industrial development of the locality in recent years. 
 On Friday, NGOs reiterated their call to withdraw the planning application to change the local plan for Qajjenza in Birżebbuġa.
  The application seeks to change the local plan so that it allows six blocks of apartments and offices, going up to eight storeys, on the former Enemalta gas storage facility. 
 Bagley said the party is also against this application, and said the land should be provided back to the community. 
 ""Instead of giving the residents the much-needed open space they need for recreational purposes, they are now faced with the prospect of having hundreds of flats added to the area, which is bound to affect their quality of life.  So here we see that the government is keen on putting profit before people.""
 Closing the press conference, Gauci said it is in the interest of the voter to vote for a European Union that provides a better quality of life and fights the effects of climate change. 
 ""Whatever is said during the election campaign, the reality remains that if we do not respect the limits that nature itself imposes on us, we will end up badly,"" she said. 
 ""The protection of nature, the environment, and the land and sea of our country means the protection and the well-being of all of us today and tomorrow.""

Joseph Portelli applies to replace Xlendi hotel with 13-floor residence block,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/joseph-portelli-replace-xlendi-hotel-13floor-residence-block.1093702,06-11-2024,000581.png,"Gozitan construction mogul Joseph Portelli has abandoned plans to rebuild the Xlendi Hotel but instead applied to develop a 13-floor residential complex with 46 units, a shop, and underlying garages and car spaces overlooking the scenic bay.
 The plans have attracted a considerable number of objections from nearby residents who are fearing for their safety as well as environment NGOs who are pleading with the Planning Authority to stop the “piecemeal destruction of Xlendi”.
 Through PA1633/24, Excel Investments, jointly owned by Portelli, Daniel Refalo and business partner Mark Agius, replaced a previous application to build a new four-star hotel instead of the former Xlendi Hotel Resort and Spa for which they already obtained a demolition permit.
 Instead, the latest application ditches the touristic aspect of the development and proposes a seafront residential complex with a mix of one-, two- and three-bedroomed apartments. Some of the units will have a jacuzzi on their terraces which the plans make it a point to point out will have “non-slip tiles”.
 The plans for the project on Triq San Xmun and Triq il-Puniċi in Xlendi in Munxar were prepared by architect Alexander Bigeni.
 In its 2020 application to redevelop the hotel, Excel Investment had said that the demolition was the first phase of the project.
 The application had drawn concerns from dozens of objectors, but the PA had given its green light since it was considered as an application to demolish a building that was not worthy of preservation.
 Excel’s original application for phase 2 proposed the development of an 88-room, four-star hotel over 14 floors.
 These plans had attracted hundreds of objections, only for the company to withdraw the plans and go back to the drawing board. The developer came back with a proposal to build a residential complex with 51 apartments and two shops, but this application was mysteriously withdrawn before it was even considered by the PA.
 Instead, a fresh application was submitted in March proposing one shop instead of two and five fewer apartments. The PA’s target date is to complete the screening process by July 5.
 Independent MEP candidate Arnold Cassola tersely described the plans as an “obscenity” (moqżiżata) by Portelli.
 The Munxar council did not object to the application but simply asked to be kept informed throughout the process.
 Gozitan NGOs Għawdix, Wirt Għawdex and Din l-Art Ħelwa all objected to the proposal, insisting that it breached planning policies. They said the development will severely disrupt the surrounding area, residents’ quality of life, natural environments, and the touristic appeal of Xlendi.
 They said the proposed development ran counter to the Gozo and Comino Local Plan in at least four ways, particularly concerning the height which was not in line with the height
 limitations. The local plan states that the impact of any development should “be contained so that the scenic qualities and the tourist experience of the area are not compromised”.
 They also pointed out that the Gozo and Comino Local Plan considers Xlendi valley as “one of the more important
 valley systems on Gozo” and scheduled as a Level 1 area of ecological importance and a site of scientific importance given its ecological, geological, geomorphological and scientific properties.
 “Approval of this development would signify a deliberate intention to continue ruining Xlendi,” the Wirt Għawdex committee added in its objection.

"Local plans review should not mean more development, groups insist",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/local-plans-review-mean-development-groups-insist.1101263,20-11-2024,000628.png,"Any review of the local plans must not lead to further development, a number of residents' groups and NGO Il-Kollettiv insisted on Wednesday.
 Noting statements made by the prime minister and the  leader of the opposition, the groups said that a review of the local plans without a suspension of development in rationalisation zones would effectively lead to more construction. The rationalisation zones are areas where development was given the go-ahead some 15 years ago after having initially been outside development zones. 
 The groups said the government should also introduce measures to eliminate various loopholes in secondary policies which have led to a spate of applications for tall buildings on the limits of urban conservation areas. 
 In July the groups called for a moratorium on the rationalisation zones, suspension of large projects, the enforcement of buffer zones around UCAs, and the refusal of applications for new roads opening virgin land for development. 
 “The Prime Minister and his Cabinet had been insisting that local plans could not change, now the tune is starting to change. We wonder if this is a way to justify the shambolic way in which the change in the St Julians Local Plan is being carried out, or a ploy to further weaken the protection afforded to our towns by the local plans,” said Wayne Flask, Secretary of il-Kollettiv.
 “It’s worrying to hear the prime minister implying that rationalisation zones are here to stay. These are the main source of anger for many residents, especially in towns where the borders are no longer recognisable, and whose identity is being rapidly lost to development. In Zurrieq and the surrounding region, the plan is to create one huge agglomeration of built-up land, which will result in the destruction of the green belt, lead to more congestion, and generate overpopulation.”
 Back in July, the resident groups held a press conference in Zurrieq where they highlighted the issues in their towns. They then wrote to the Prime Minister and Planning Minister, in a letter signed by the Għaqda Residenti taż-Żurrieq, Għaqda Storja u Kultura Birżebbuġa, Għaqda Storja u Kulturali Marsa, Inħarsu Santa Luċija, Residenti tal-Imqabba, Residenti tal-Qrendi, Residenti ta’ Ħal Safi, Residenti tas-Swatar, Siġġiwin Nieħdu Azzjoni, Sliema Residents Association, Marsaskala Residents Network, Marsaxlokk Heritage, Wirt iż-Żejtun and il-Kollettiv.
 No reply has been received yet.
 The groups called on the prime minister and the leader of the opposition for a serious discussion on their points for a planning reform, also noting how both major parties have publicly admitted their availability to meet big developers.

 The target is one of 22 included in the National Biodiversity and Action Plan (NBSAP) for 2030, which was published on Thursday. 
 According to the document, by 2025 a plan will be developed to ensure the target will be reached by 2030.
 “By 2027, a standard system for the evaluation of management effectiveness of Natura 2000 sites is developed and assessments are carried out periodically,” the document reads. 
 Back in March, Ħondoq ir-Rummien, near Qala in Gozo was formally designated as a Special Area of Conservation by the Environment Resources Authority.
 The designation means that Ħondoq ir-Rummien has been given top environmental protection and the government officially recognises the natural importance of the area. 
 Special Areas of Conservation usually include natural habitats and species of flora and fauna and offer a high biodiversity value. 
 The document is Malta’s second National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan, the first launched back in 2012, covering the period till 2020.
 The plan includes 22 targets and 78 actions and NBSAP aims to protect Malta’s biodiversity by “providing strategic direction, addressing local challenges, and aligning with international agreements.”
 The document includes five key policy areas, which delve into the restoration of nature and biodiversity loss, using biodiversity sustainably, awareness raising, and enhancing implementation and cooperation.
 A number of the targets in the document have previously been announced, including Target 6, which promises that by 2030, 50% of the most harmful invasive alien species affecting protected areas will be duly managed. 
 This will be done through the recommendations of the National Strategy for Preventing and Mitigating the Impact of Invasive Alien Species (IAS), which was launched back in 2020.
 Target 8 reads: 
 “By 2030, pollution from all sources, inter alia, excess nutrients, pesticides, chemicals, plastics, noise and light is prevented, controlled or minimised to levels that are not harmful to biodiversity in line with EU and international commitments.”
  One of the actions for this target is that by 2027, ‘quiet areas’ will be outlined on land while taking into consideration the harmful effect of noise on wildlife. 
 A Noise Action Planning in Malta document, dated June 2011, includes identifying and protecting quiet areas in Malta. 
 Certain action points are policies or measures already set up and implemented. 
 The biodiversity plan was launched at Xrobb l-Għaġin, another site soon to be declared a Special Conservation Area, by Environment Minister Miriam Dalli. 
 Speaking during the launch, Dalli said 95% of the goals of the previous strategy were addressed and more than half of them were obtained. 
 She said currently, 28.5% of Maltese land is protected. She said 35.5% of Malta’s Fisheries Management Zones are designated as Marine Protected Areas. 
 “The results of these positive achievements are paying off, that is why we are seeing more frequent sightings of sea species such as dolphins and turtles,” she said. 
 ""This plan is our commitment to safeguarding Malta's natural heritage for future generations. Together, we can ensure a sustainable and biodiverse country.""

 The NGO Malta Rangers Unit members were patrolling the area last Saturday at 9pm when they spotted a group of 25 people. While most were on land, five were spearfishing with lights in the open sea, an illegal activity under Maltese and European law.
 Spearguns were spotted on land that appeared planned for later use.
  Given the large number of people, the rangers contacted the Fisheries Department, which promptly arrived on site with the police and the Rapid Intervention Unit. The authorities blocked the vehicles of the accused.
 As a result, the fishermen switched off their lights, leading to an hour-long search along the coast. They started climbing the cliffside to escape, but a ranger - watching from the cliff edge above them - urged them to stop climbing because of the dangers caused by the uneven surface.
 “Our first concern was their safety. The second concern was why they would go to such lengths to avoid being caught for a smaller crime,” said a spokesperson for the rangers.
 The fishermen had no choice but to be guided by the rangers to find their way back up since they had walked too deep into the bouldered area without any knowledge of the topography.
 The accused eventually gave up trying to escape. The police elevated the spearguns and fish.
  The rangers said they have recently seen a lot of undersized and illegal catch during night-time.
 Last month, two men were caught in the exact location trying to spearfish at night. The Malta Rangers Unit and the Fishing Department also apprehended them.

 The public swim forms part of Agius’ training programme as he gears up to attempt a world record open water sea challenge next month.
 The nine-hour training session that is being opened to the public will be held at the National Pool Complex in Tal-Qroqq on August 31 from 3pm to midnight. 
 The event, organised in collaboration with SportMalta,  aims to foster a sense of community among swimmers of all levels. 
 “This community swim is more than just a training session,” Agius said. “It's about inspiring people to get active, embrace the power of the ocean, and contribute to a cleaner, healthier environment for future generations.
 ”The event will feature timed swim lanes catering to all levels, allowing participants to enjoy a structured workout and gain unique insights into the world of ultra-endurance sports while Agius prepares for his greatest challenge yet,"" SportMalta said in a statement on Wednesday.
 “We view this event as a valuable opportunity to advance our mission of promoting sport and physical activity, bringing us closer to our goal of creating a healthier, more inclusive and successful Malta"".
 The event is open to swimmers of all ages and abilities, with entry fees set at €10 for children and €15 for adults. Places are limited, and early registration is encouraged.
 Funds raised during the public training session will help finance a series of community clean-ups that will take place while Agius attempts his upcoming world record swim in September. 
 That challenge will see Agius swim the open-sea route along the coastal waters of the entire Maltese archipelago, covering approximately 160km. 
 The challenge is expected to take three days and will require an estimated 175,000 strokes. If successful, Agius will break the current world record for the longest non-stop, unassisted, current neutral sea swim, which he himself holds.  
 It will be Agius’ first attempt at breaking the record after he was forced to abandon a similar swim in Spain last year. 
 In September 2023, Agius required medical attention after he swam into a swarm of jellyfish spanning several kilometres off the coast of Mallorca. 
 Agius is using this year’s swim to raise awareness about the state of Malta’s marine habitat with the aim of inspiring collective commitment to protecting the Mediterranean Sea.
 NGO Wave of Change, which Agius founded, is teaming up with marine clean-up experts Żibel for a series of initiatives tied to the swim.  
 Żibel will be coordinating three coastal clean-ups around the island, which the public is invited to join.  
 The NGO will also be facilitating individual and smaller community clean ups through the use of designated  Żibel Tribe bins, with all marine litter to be collected and managed by the NGO with the aim of making new sustainable products.
 With over 149,500kgs of waste collected by Żibel to date, the problem is far from solved. 
 “As an island nation we depend on the Mediterranean sea for almost everything, it is arguably our most important asset. As Maltese, it is in our heritage and our duty to care for the Mediterranean,” Żibel founder Andrew Schembri said.
 To book your spot in the public swim, send an email on neil@neilagius.com with the number of people who plan to join and any preferred timings.
  Agius has been training intensively for months to prepare for the challenge. 
 This is the first time Agius will be attempting a swim at the end of summer. 
 His training is more intense than ever before, swimming for 10 hours approximately four times a week in the height of the Maltese summer heat, while still maintaining a full-time job. 
 He is swimming for longer periods under higher tension and pushing himself to reach his maximum capacity more often. 
 Agius is supported by a team of around 25 volunteers and professionals made up of medics, swim observers, navigators, skippers and crew, motivators, media, and a nutritionist, who will ensure that he remains safe and healthy throughout the swim.
 In anticipation of the swim he has worked with leading sleep deprivation experts, developed a specialised breathing technique, and prepared mentally for the challenges that such a lengthy challenge poses.  
 The athlete has developed The Ocean Mindset, a mindfulness technique which has fuelled his current swim and these tools are being adopted and used by many of his current partners including GO, the lead partner powering this swim and all Neil’s endeavours for the next three years. 
 The Small Island, Big Swim is also supported by VisitMalta, Atlas Insurance, Cisk 0.0, Kia, Garmin and Maypole.

Second turtle nest for the season discovered at Għajn Tuffieħa,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/second-turtle-nest-season-discovered-ghajn-tuffieha.1094733,07-01-2024,"000936.png,000937.png","Another turtle nest - the second one this summer - was discovered at Għajn Tuffieħa.
 But the nest was too close to the surface and the shore, so Environment and Resources Authority (ERA) and Nature Trust Malta (NTM) officials moved the nesting to Golden Bay (Ir-Ramla tal-Mixquqa).
 Volunteers discovered another turtle nest at this same bay last month.
  The nest was found during a routine morning patrol by NTM volunteers. But its proximity to the surface and the shore made the nest vulnerable if weather conditions became unfavourable.
 To maximise its chances of survival, ERA and NTM coordinated an emergency operation to transfer the eggs to a safer location at Golden Bay. The new site has also been cordoned off to ensure no direct trampling on the nest.
 Beachgoers are being urged to act responsibly as excessive noise, trampling and light close to the nesting area might pose a threat to eggs and any hatchlings.
 People who notice any turtle activity should immediately report it to ERA on 2292 3500 9999 9505.
 Volunteers are needed to help with monitoring and other tasks related to this turtle nest. Those who wish to volunteer can get in touch on turtle.naturetrust@gmail.com

Watch: Local hedgehogs are inbreeding because of a lack of green spaces,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/watch-local-hedgehogs-inbreeding-lack-green-spaces.1096891,24-08-2024,001230.png,"The spread of construction and new buildings in green areas is causing Malta’s hedgehog population to become inbred, according to Nature Trust Malta.
 Vince Attard, the CEO of the organisation that cares for injured wildlife, said they had noticed this worrying trend which is leading to increased health problems among the hedgehogs that come to their treatment centre.
 “Before, when there were less buildings, there were what we call natural corridors, which would allow hedgehogs to move between villages, for example from Marsaxlokk they would go to Marsascala or Żejtun,” Attard said.
 “Now we are cutting off the connections between green areas, which causes a lot of interbreeding because the community continues to mate with the same individuals in the area.”
  Attard added that aside from the genetic problems that could lead to hedgehog population collapse, the closing of these natural green corridors for wildlife has led to greater incidence of diseases such as ringworm.
 “It is a huge battle that we are helpless to fight,” he said. “We have hundreds of hedgehogs that come in to be treated for ringworm every year and it’s a long process because it takes them between 12 to 16 weeks to heal.”
 This is why, Attard continued, it was more critical than ever for Malta to protect its countryside.
 “We appeal to the authorities to consider that, aside from having green open spaces for people to enjoy, we need to take care of our natural open spaces because they are home to our biodiversity.
 “The more it shrinks, the more footprint of our natural areas that we lose, the more we risk losing this species.” Attard also thinks the same could happen to other endemic animals in Malta, such as the native species of shrew. Due to its insular nature, if Malta does not increase efforts to protect its countryside, these species could be lost for ever, he said.
 The volunteers who work with the rescued hedgehogs at the Xrobb l-Għaġin Wildlife Rehabilitation Centre are currently studying the ringworm problem among the Maltese hedgehog population.
 If left untreated, the fungus can be deadly as it causes their skin to dry up and lose all their spikes, weakening them.
 But with treatment, the hedgehogs eventually are able to regrow their spikes and are released back into the wild once they test negative for ringworm. “These cases are increasing. Roughly 500 of the 1,200 calls for rescues we receive are about hedgehogs,” Attard said.
 “We do see a mix of babies needing to be rescued after the mother has died or hedgehogs who have been attacked by dogs or cats, but half of the patients we have right now need to be treated for ringworm.”

Cassola calls for investigation into PA's sanctioning of Sannat penthouses,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/cassola-calls-investigation-pa-sanctioning-sannat-penthouses.1097054,22-08-2024,001285.png,"Arnold Cassola on Thursday asked the Ombudsman to investigate the planning authority’s sanctioning of penthouses in a Sannat development linked to construction mogul Joseph Portelli. 
 The sanctioning is linked to the development of apartment blocks with pools in rural Gozo which was proposed in two different applications in 2020 and 2021.
 Activists had insisted the applications could not be judged singularly and in a vacuum, as they formed part of an attempt to fragment a mega-development to avoid the scrutiny such a large project would require. 
 In one of the applications (PA2035/21), Mark Agius, a developer and business partner of Portelli, applied to excavate a site and construct 29 apartments, 20 basement garages and a pool. The proposal was approved in 2021.
 Heritage NGO Din L-Art Ħelwa had filed an appeal against the PA’s approval. When the  Environment and Planning Tribunal also approved the development, it took the issue to the law courts.
 In March, Chief Justice Mark Chetcuti noted that the EPRT had incorrectly applied policies when it approved the development.
 The court noted that the approved pool and penthouse floor level should not have been approved, and the permit for this part was revoked.
 However, by then both the pool and the penthouses had been constructed and an application (PA/03869/24) to sanction two of the illegal penthouses was filed by Tarlochan Singh.
 In the application, Singh declared he is not an owner of the entire site, but is authorised to carry out the proposed development through an agreement with the owner.
 Flimkien għal Ambjent Aħjar and DLĦ protested the sanctioning with the latter applying for the revocation of the sanctioning permit.
 Cassola meanwhile asked the Commissioner for Environment and Planning within the Office of the Ombudsman to look into the matter.
 ""The sanctioning of these illegal structures raises serious questions about the integrity and responsibility of the PA.
 ""It is worrying how a court decision - which clearly declared that the development is illegal - has been ignored,"" Cassola said, adding that the move created a dangerous precedent that could potentially negatively impact the public's trust in the planning system. 
 He urged the commissioner to look into whether the court ruling was taken into consideration during the sanctioning process, and whether there was any outside influence or irregularities that could have led to the sanctioning of the illegal structures.
 Meanwhile, DLĦ has appealed the sanctioning decision, saying it believed the process had been ""carried out in a secretive and opaque manner by means of an expedited summary process"".
 The NGO said the application contained no reference to the previous permission which had been revoked by the court and even though a summary application cannot be processed if the application does not comply with plans and policies, the PA went ahead and approved the application.
 ""The PA has acted with complete disregard for the rule of law, making itself complicit in rule-breaking and abusive practices. DLĦ will not turn a blind eye to this flagrant disregard of the law,"" it added.
 ""The PA must be reined in and the individuals responsible for this shameful episode must bear responsibility for their actions.""
 Similarly, FAA said the PA had set itself above the courts, meaning rule of law no longer existed in Malta.
 ""The implications of this are extremely serious. The ordinary citizen is being denied the basic elements of justice, as this annuls citizens' efforts, funds and basic rights to seek legal redress against abuse, shaking the very foundations of our democracy.""
 FAA said the PA has ""sunk to new lows of conspiring to encourage unlawful acts"".
 By 'legalising' the two penthouses the PA had defied the highest court:
 ""The PA and the EPRT, along with the Superintendence of Cultural Heritage, are persisting in sinking this country into a mire of illegalities.
 ""This latest violation of a court decision issued by the Chief Justice endorses the perception that we are living in a country where Joseph Portelli and his fellow developers have ultimate power over laws and court, like a Mafia state.""
 In an open letter to Planning Minister Clint Camilleri, a group of NGOs expressed deep concern for the sanctioning of the development and called for a “thorough review of current practices and urgent action” to remedy the situation. 
 The letter, sent by the group Għawdix, said it is unacceptable that Malta’s planning system allows developers to continue building throughout the appeals process with no restrictions. 
 Such a situation is creating a lose-lose situation for both appellants, who are left with a hollow victory as the development would already have been completed, and the applicants, whose buildings end up in legal limbo. 
 They recalled Prime Minister Robert Abela’s promise to reform this system but noted that, despite a public consultation on the matter having closed last November, there has been no change. 
 “Allowing a development to proceed while an appeal is pending, only to retroactively sanction it after a court has ruled against it, effectively nullifies the authority of the judiciary. It creates a scenario where developers can flagrantly ignore legal rulings, secure in the knowledge that they can simply apply for retroactive approval. This practice is an affront to justice, erodes public confidence in the planning process, and sends a clear message that the Planning Authority’s decisions are beyond the reach of judicial oversight,” they said. 
 “Minister Camilleri, it is your duty, as well as that of your Ministry, and the Government that represents the people, to uphold and protect the public interest, safeguard our rights as citizens, and ensure the rule of law in this country. We trust that you will treat this matter with the urgency and seriousness it demands, and take the necessary steps to restore justice and fairness to Malta's planning processes.”

MDA: Graffitti broke law by vandalising Joseph Portelli's illegally built pool,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/mda-activists-took-law-hands-vandalised-illegal-pool.1094723,07-01-2024,001472.png,"Activists who defaced a pool that was built illegally in Qala by developer Joseph Portelli were slammed by the Malta Development Association on Monday for ""taking the law into their hands"".
 The protest was held on Saturday when the activists lit flares and sprayed paint on the walls as they chanted “ Mill Qala sas-Sannat, il-liġi għal Allat [From Qala to Sannat, laws are for the Gods] and  Tiżfnu għad-daqqa tal-iżviluppaturi [You dance to the tune of developers].
 Portelli excavated the pool site without a permit. Despite having breached the law, the Planning Authority and its appeals tribunal, the EPRT, both approved the ODZ development.
 Objectors persisted and in March, a court revoked the permit the PA had granted Portelli. But by then Portelli had already built the swimming pool, as planning laws allow developers to proceed with works while appeals processes are ongoing.
 In its statement on Monday, the MDA said that while it acknowledged the right to protest, this did not mean that one could take the law into his own hands with actions that breached public order, such as when property was infiltrated and vandalised.
 Saturday's actions reflected serious inconsistency by the lobby group, which alleged illegality of the site while breaching the law itself, the MDA said.
 ""It is unacceptable for individuals to take the law into their own hands and it should be the authorities who act and penalise such acts.""
 The association said it acknowledged shortcomings in the planning system and it continued to hold that reforms should be carried out to stop abuse, not least by developers who gave the industry a bad name.
 Discussion on change should be held within the parameters of the law through constructive dialogue, the MDA said, adding that it was ready to take an active part in the process.

'Everywhere will be covered in apartments': Alarm over new building proposal,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/everywhere-covered-apartments-alarm-new-building-proposal.1093911,13-06-2024,"001508.png,001509.png","Proposed revisions to the way that building heights are interpreted could give rise to additional floors being allowed to be built, sparking concern from conservation groups. 
 The Planning Authority is currently running a public consultation to amend a policy in Development Control Design Policy, Guidance and Standards, a controversial document commonly known as the  DC15.
 Previously, height limitations for buildings were set by the number of floors that could be built in any given area, as set out by the local plans. 
 However, an annexe included in DC15, Annexe 2, laid out a table in which the maximum allowable heights of buildings previously indicated as floors, had now been converted into metres. 
 Should the amendments to policy 35 of DC15, which regulates allowable building height, be accepted, it will formalise this interpretation of the guidelines. 
 Speaking to Times of Malta, architect and Din l-Art Ħelwa president Patrick Calleja said that when it comes to urban conservation areas, the door has been left wide open to interpretation. 
 According to the revision document published by the PA on the consultation, building heights in the UCA that do not exceed the height of their street facade will be determined by a “streetscape analysis”, while any additional height above this will be assessed based on the policy that regulates setback floors. 
 It also says that when UCA buildings face open areas, such as piazzas, the countryside or a seafront, a setback of at least 4.25 metres will be required. 
 “If height limitation in the UCA will depend on the streetscape then it means it is open to interpretation,” Calleja said. 
 “The impact will be felt all over Malta, even in the UCA. Buildings at the border of the UCA could be built up to five floors, obstructing views of UCA buildings. We’re going to see everywhere covered in apartments.” 
  Calleja and DLĦ are urging people to object to this policy because they say it will allow developers to squeeze in an extra floor into their developments thus creating denser buildings that will increase crowding and further strain the public infrastructure that supports them. 
 Calleja also pointed out that the 2007 local plan interpretation document makes it very clear that considering the number of floors is a key point in assessing whether a development is suitable. 
 “Floors are also centres of activity generation. This is a very important concept and not giving it the due consideration will result in increasing the development intensity in an area over and above that which is statutorily indicated in a local plan. Therefore, unless the local plan’s policy or its interpretation indicates otherwise, development proposals should strictly adhere to the number of floors stipulated in an approved local plan,” the interpretation document reads. 
  DLĦ are not the only ones raising concerns about this, with Wayne Flask of il-Kollettiv calling the move “another planning disaster”. 
 Flask said that this reform would see several areas in Malta opened up to developments of up to five storeys, running the risk of “ruining” villages and which “guarantee years of prolonged construction”. He claimed that the policy will also lead to the sanctioning of several illegal buildings. 
 “In an attempt to satisfy a building lobby that doesn’t have anywhere else to build, this change in policy will assure more floors for developers and less quality of life for the general public,” he said. 
  Flimkien għal-Ambjent Aħjar is also urging its members to object to the policy change, highlighting that the policy is unclear on precedence in the UCA. 
 “With this consultation, we are unable to determine if the policy will be changed for building height limitations for Urban Conservation Areas, as we are given a small part of the policy, with some changes and some others staying the same,” they said. 
 “This blanket increase of one floor on traditional townhouse areas designated as one, two or three floors and will further undermine these areas, allowing five-storey apartment blocks in Malta’s towns and villages with no consideration for existing streetscapes.”
 Objections can be sent via email to consultation_dc15@pa.org.mt until Monday, June 17.

NGOs decry and appeal 'outrageous' development permit in Xagħra,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/ngos-decry-appeal-outrageous-development-permit-in-xaghra.1096008,29-07-2024,001576.png,"A coalition of environmental NGOs in Gozo has hit out at the approval by the Planning Commission of a development application which will see a six-unit ridge-edge development in Xagħra, overlooking Marsalforn valley. 
 Din l-Art Ħelwa, Wirt Għawdex and Għawdix said strong objections had been raised over several issues, including breaches of development control design policies and standards.
 Among others, Policy P33 states that such a number of units forming part of an internal residential development is not allowed, and  all new residential units are required to have direct frontage onto a public road. Yet none of the units within the proposed development fronts a public road, the only access to the site being through a narrow alley in a small street.
 Objections were also voiced during a meeting of the Planning Commission. But Commission chairperson Martin Camilleri contended that although the proposed units do not front a public road, they front a valley, the NGOs said.
 The coalition said it was shameful that NGOs had to continue assuming the role of authority officials, whose job it is to properly scrutinise development applications 'but instead seem intent on bypassing policies and proper screening'.
 The NGOs said they were also concerned that the zone had long been known to feature caves, and archaeological finds were made in the area in the past. The first was made by Rev. Francesco Mercieca in December, 1938.
 Yet in its submitted representation, the Superintendence of Cultural Heritage simply remarked that the proposed development is “a relatively moderate proposal not exceeding commitments” and that it “does not challenge the lie of the land along the ridge”, and therefore it did not object. It noted that the applicant was to inform of any accidental discoveries, but, did not impose any archaeological monitoring despite the context of the site in question, the NGOs said.
 The Environment and Resources Authority was likewise nonchalant about the application and did not object to the felling of trees, simply requesting that they be transplanted to a site in Qala, where they are to be maintained for three years.

"Dangerous Rabat 'rubble mountain' to be reduced, authorities promise",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/it-matter-life-death-dangerous-rabat-rubble-mountain-reduced.1097580,09-04-2024,001605.png,"Updated 8am
 A quarry that was illegally backfilled to become a “rubble mountain” in rural Rabat will begin to shrink following fresh enforcement action, the authorities have pledged.
 The site in the Lunzjata area has grown several storeys high despite previous Planning Authority (PA) enforcement notices against Tlata Ltd, owned by Paul Falzon. 
 But, now, the authorities say their latest action will reduce the construction rubble that neighbours fear has become dangerous.
 “The Planning Authority took the initiative so that no new material is allowed on the site,” a spokesperson for the Environment and Resources Authority told Times of Malta.
 
 “Meanwhile, material in the area will be taken out, meaning that stockpiles will be reduced.”
 Last week, a neighbouring farmer spoke of his fears for his safety and property due to falling boulders or a landslide.
 Angelo Giordmaina said the quarry was backfilled to ground level about four years ago but continued to grow afterwards.
  “The danger here is a matter of life and death,” the 63-year-old warned. “A boulder could roll down and hit me, or the entire mass of rubble could come crashing down in a landslide.”
 Architect Godwin Abela, who surveyed the quarry, which is visible from kilometres away, had advised all activities stop immediately “to avoid potential tragedy”.
 There are already two active enforcement notices from the PA dating to 2005 and 2009.
 In April 2019, Tlata Ltd applied for a PA permit to “backfill the existing quarry, construct a concrete batching plant and establish a concrete block manufacturing plant”.
 The application was refused, but the backfilling continued regardless. In the same month, the Environmental and Resources Authority issued a stop-work order against Tlata Ltd.
 
 ERA said that Tlata Ltd is being fined daily because of the infringement.
 Replying to questions, a PA spokesperson said their initiative to reduce stockpiles at the site is being enforced by “regularly monitoring the site”.
 Meanwhile, last week Arnold Cassola said he had asked the Ombudsman to investigate government inaction over the illegal backfilling. 
 On Wednesday morning, the independent candidate said in a statement the Commissioner for the Environment had started an investigation into the workings of the PA.   
 Cassola's complaint was about the illegal dumping of rubble for the last 15 years and the lack of any enforcement on the part of various government authorities including the PA.

 “This species has previously been sighted in southern Italy, but this is the first time it has been recorded in Maltese waters,” Deidun said.
 He attributed the fish’s presence to the warming of the Mediterranean Sea and shipping traffic from the Suez Canal.
 The sighting was made possible through the Spot the Alien citizen science campaign, launched in 2019 to encourage the reporting of non-indigenous species (NIS) in Maltese waters.
 “It’s not uncommon to see new species nowadays; we are recording around ten new species a year,” Deidun added.

 Organised by the Environment and Resources Authority (ERA) under the patronage of President Myriam Spiteri Debono, the awards celebrate individuals driving meaningful environmental change.
 The Minister for the Environment Miriam Dalli was also present for the ceremony.
 Professor Alan Deidun received the Buonamico Award for his groundbreaking scientific research and unwavering dedication to environmental awareness. As Malta’s first Ocean Ambassador and a leading academic, Professor Deidun’s work bridges science and impactful conservation efforts.
 The award is named after Malta’s first naturalist, who also wrote the first Flora of the Maltese Islands.
 Zammit Lupi received a Special Recognition Award for his activism and community engagement.
 Zammit Lupi, an advocate for sustainable transport and green initiatives, gained prominence by cycling from Malta to Sweden to raise environmental awareness and promote local eco-friendly projects in Żebbuġ.
 He ran as an independent candidate in last spring’s local council elections and obtained the most votes, becoming Żebbuġ mayor.
 During his speech, ERA Chairman Vincent Cassar said Deidun and Zammit Lupi’s achievements inspired others to strive for increased environmental stewardship.
 “Their actions attest their contribution in protecting the national environment through active participation in conservation efforts. I hope that this will instigate future generations to follow the steps of Professor Deidun and Mr Zammit Lupi, in safeguarding Malta’s environment,” he said.
 In her speech, President Spiteri Debono emphasised the need for the protection and preservation of the urban and rural environment. She stressed that it is imperative that natural resources are not strained, but a balance has to be struck between the needs of a growing population and economy, and other considerations including the people’s physical and mental health.

 It turns out that this was a new watering system. Instead of having the trees watered by hose, the local council is using the sacks for drip irrigation.
 The sack is made of heavy-duty PVC holding over 70 litres of water that slowly drips into the soil over a span of eight to 10 hours.
 The project, sponsored by the Alfred Mizzi Foundation, was launched in May as the local council’s last environmental project for that legislature.
  Councillor Steve Zammit Lupi, now the new mayor following the June 8 election, introduced the initiative to the locality after spotting sacks used for watering on a trip abroad.
 “I thought this could easily be replicated at home,” he said. “They are the standard in Europe because they are such an efficient system.”
 The method reduces the amount of water lost from heat and evaporation, retains humidity and gives the roots a much better chance of absorbing water.
 Over the last few weeks the new watering system has generated interested from other councils, farmers and tree enthusiasts.
 Zammit Lupi said: “As a local council we have limited financial resources so we are grateful for the Alfred Mizzi Foundation’s impact.”
 The foundation bought 200 sacks for the council at a cost of €2,500. It will be spending a further €7,500 on future green projects that have yet to be announced.
 A spokesperson for the Alfred Mizzi foundation said they had collaborated with the local council on this project because they believe that Zammit Lupi’s vision melds well with its commitment to promote the environment and heritage.
 “By partnering with the council, we are empowering green projects to improve the quality of air we breathe and create a sustainable future for our community,” a foundation spokes­person said.

 Upgrading and extending the Xewkija heliport would allow nine-seater aeroplanes to land on the island.
 It is now up to the Planning Commission to decide on PA/07333/22 on October 10.
 If the commission gives the green light, the government plans to launch scheduled and chartered flights from the airfield. According to the case officer's report, helicopters - including the air ambulance - will also operate from the Xewkija strip.
 According to the Gozo Regional Development Authority (GRDA), there will be fewer than 15 daily aircraft movements.
 Should the application be approved, the existing airstrip will extend from 174 metres to 445 metres.
 The case officer noted that the majority of the works fell within the designated aviation site in the Gozo and Comino Local Plan. They added that no new buildings will be constructed while the existing passenger terminal will be refurbished.
 Gozo minister Clint Camilleri told Times of Malta on Friday the project will be economically beneficial for the island.
 In addition to creating a new way to access Gozo, the airfield can open up the island to new economic opportunities, he said.
 ""Flying schools are looking to relocate to Gozo, and there is also interest in skydiving,"" he said.
 The Environment and Resources Authority (ERA) did not object to the application: ""The proposal is not expected to significantly affect the integrity of the protected Natura 2000 sites.
 ""No significant adverse noise effects on the Natural Ta' Ċenċ and Mġarr ix-Xini areas are envisaged.""
 ERA added an environmental impact assessment (EIA) was not needed.
 BirdLife Malta meanwhile objected to the project, saying an EIA was needed before the project was even considered.
 ""The studies didn't delve enough into the impact on seabird colonies at Ta' Ċenċ in particular,"" BirdLife's head of conservation Nicholas Barbara said.
 ERA relied on information provided by the GRDA, rather than the findings of consultants it would normally approve, he added,
 ""We read GRDA's assessment and disagree with its findings as it minimises the impact on seabirds while misquoting studies and assessments carried out by BirdLife Malta itself,"" Barbara said.

Lessons from four years of pedestrianising a village square in Gozo,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/lessons-four-years-pedestrianising-village-square-gozo.1096866,23-08-2024,"001905.png,001906.png,001907.png,001908.png,001909.png,001910.png,001911.png","Pedestrianising village cores is a great idea, but unless the empty squares and streets are given life with attractions, simply closing them off to traffic will be counterproductive, according to a Gozo mayor who has been doing it for four years.
 Għajnsielem mayor Kevin Cauchi, who has just kicked off the Pjazza Pedonali (Pedestrianised Square) weekends initiative for the fourth year, told  Times of Malta that pedestrianising the village core was successful on most weekends, but only because the council complemented it with a myriad of open-air dinners, concerts, street games, barbecues, disco nights, and other family attractions.
  Times of Malta contacted Cauchi to find out whether the initiative has paid off in Għajnsielem, after the mayor of  Mosta announced plans to halt the partial pedestrianisation of the town square.
 People are not used to simply going out to an empty village square, he explained. Maybe that will grow on them in the future, but until then, simply closing off a village core without providing alternative attractions would lead to ghost streets, frustrated residents who take longer to get home, furious motorists who are faced with diversions, and struggling businesses that see fewer customers.
 And that will only dissuade everyone from pursuing the much-needed slow-streets concept, he said.
 “I’ve learned this from experience because we have been doing it for four years now,” he said, adding he understands where the Mosta local council was coming from when it reconsidered pedestrianisation.
 On Saturdays and Sundays throughout summer, the Għajnsielem local council closes two streets that lead to the main square between 7pm and midnight, essentially closing off the village core to cars and diverting traffic through other routes.
  It also opens a football pitch within the same area to allow children to have a larger space to play. The council says, in total, it frees up over 25,000 square metres of car-free space for all to enjoy.
 But that is not enough, Cauchi insists. The two catering establishments housed at the football and band clubs help to attract people, and the local council has been topping that up with a summer-long schedule of cultural and musical events.
 Dubbed Iljieli Sajfin (Summer Nights), the initiative offers food, music, tombolas, traditional games, an open cinema and child-friendly drama, and sports events from July through September.
  “That’s why pedestrianisation works in Valletta and Sliema, because there are places to go and things to do,” he said, adding that he fears that villages will have a tougher time making it work if they do not have more to offer.
 “That’s also why people don’t complain when village cores are closed off during feast week each year, because feasts are filled with attractions.”
 Cauchi, who was re-elected mayor for a second term last June, said it is understandable that people fall in love with the idea of closing a village core to traffic, as it takes them to a more tranquil time, when island life was quieter and families would entertain themselves simply by congregating in village squares to discuss life as their children played and ran around the safe, inviting streets.
 But as dreamy as that nostalgic image might be, that tradition is not as popular today, and families now entertain themselves differently, he said. Most of them will not just go to an empty village square to sit on a bench.
  “And even if you do go sit on a bench with your family, for how long are you going to do that?” he said.
 “We still haven’t succeeded in persuading enough residents to come to the square on foot or by bicycle, even though we have been encouraging them to do so.”
 During the pedestrianised hours, many families still opt to get to the village core by car and park in a car park close to the church, he said.
 “Unlike other villages, we’re lucky to have that car park, but ideally people don’t use their cars. As a nation, we have no problem walking everywhere when we go abroad but it seems we still can’t tolerate walking short distances when we’re at home.”
  Several localities have recently taken up pedestrianisation measures or have opted to start implementing the ‘slow streets’ initiative.
 The idea is to close off the village core and streets leading to it for traffic to reclaim urban spaces from cars and prioritise pedestrians and cyclists.
 It has been given fresh impetus in recent years by architect firm Studjurban, which is currently collaborating with the Local Councils’ Association on its nationwide Slow Streets Project, a programme designed to limit traffic on certain residential streets.
  But, for some localities, it has been a bumpy ride. Others have hit a financial roadblock, expressing frustration over a lack of funding for the initiative.
  The latest controversy erupted in Mosta, when the new, PN-led local council announced it was reconsidering the partial pedestrianisation of the square – which was implemented earlier this year – due to a string of complaints from residents and businesses in the area.
 Residents complained of heavy traffic along the alternative routes, and businesses said customers were staying away.
 Cauchi – himself a PN mayor – said he could understand why such a seemingly good initiative could turn counterproductive and urged for more funding to be made available for local councils to invest in the idea.

Rising temperatures to have lethal impact on Malta – study,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/rising-temperatures-lethal-impact-malta-study.1097095,23-08-2024,001972.png,"Rising temperatures would have deadlier consequences in Malta than in any other European country, as climate warming wreaks havoc on cities across Europe in the coming decades, a landmark study has projected.
 The study, published on Wednesday in the medical journal Lancet, predicts changes in mortality rates across 1,300 regions and 854 cities in Europe between now and 2100, as temperatures rise and populations age.
 
 It found that with temperatures getting 3°C warmer, Malta would suffer 95 more yearly heat-related deaths per 100,000 people than it currently does - more than any other European country and roughly six times the European average of 15 more heat-related deaths.
 The study presents scenarios in which temperatures increase in line with Paris climate targets (by 1.5°C and 2°C) and others where temperatures rise in line with current climate policy predictions (by up to as much as 3°C) or where no climate policies are enacted (with temperatures soaring by as much as 4°C).
 It also factors in other demographic issues like population ageing, longer life expectancy and dropping fertility rates to calculate how the rising temperatures would impact each European country.
 The study’s authors estimate that 78 deaths per year in Malta were attributable to heat between 1991 and 2020.
 But this would triple to 258 deaths yearly with temperatures rising by just 1.5°C and shoot up to over 600 if temperatures get 3°C warmer.
 
 A 4°C increase would be even more catastrophic, with the sizzling heat killing over 1,000 people per year in Malta alone.
 Meanwhile, cold-related deaths would also rise, albeit at a slower rate, from the current 315 per year to 440.
 This means that while almost 400 deaths can be attributed to either hot or cold temperatures under current climactic conditions, this would soar to over 1,400 in total with a 4°C rise in temperature by 2100.
 If, on the other hand, temperatures were to rise by 3°C, which the authors believe is entirely plausible under current climate policies, the death toll would top 1,100 per year.
 Hot and cold temperatures are believed to have killed some 407,000 people per year across Europe since 1991, the vast majority of them (roughly 367,000 deaths per year) caused by the cold.
 This is set to change by 2100, as temperatures rise, with heat-related deaths rising drastically while deaths caused by cold weather dip slightly.
 But hot and cold weather combined could kill more than half a million people each year across Europe if temperatures get 4°C warmer.
 These deaths, the authors say, could be driven by both higher average temperatures and “the proliferation of longer, more intense and more frequent extreme heat episodes”, conditions which bring about “unprecedented challenges to public health systems”.
 Unsurprisingly, the authors find that rising temperatures will disproportionately impact older adults over the age of 85, many of whom are more susceptible to illness caused by excessive heat or cold.
 Meanwhile, southern European countries, including Spain, Italy, Greece and Malta, will bear the brunt of the rising temperatures, with death tolls in these countries expected to be multiple times higher than those in cooler northern states.
 The study comes as climate scientists predict that 2024 could go down as the hottest year on record, with last month being the second-hottest July ever recorded, just short of temperatures recorded in July 2023.
 The summer of 2023 will evoke bad memories for many across Europe, including in Malta, where intense heatwaves and lengthy power outages led to 80 excess deaths, many of them linked to heat exhaustion and dehydration, in the 10 days after July 24 alone, according to health superintendent Charmaine Gauci.
 Meanwhile, wildfires raged across much of southern Europe, destroying villages and rural land across Greece, Croatia and Sicily.

 Nadur Nadif, which has been keeping a close eye on Comino for the past years, said it had revisited the island to assess its readiness for the upcoming influx of visitors.
 ""Unfortunately, our observations revealed a recurring pattern. Despite assurances of heightened enforcement and environmental stewardship, tangible progress remains elusive,"" it said. 
 ""As of 10 am (1/05/2024), sections of the island surrounding the Blue Lagoon were still littered, a situation deemed intolerable for a designated Natura 2000 site. Although bins were emptied and replenished with new bags, mirroring our previous visit on April 4, 2024 at 8am, this behaviour prompts further questions. The spectrum of litter ranges from common items like cups and bottles to more egregious examples such as discarded pineapples. Additionally, bins lack proper labelling, exacerbating waste management challenges.
 ""Furthermore, the constant hum of generators disrupts the island's tranquillity, drowning out the natural sounds of waves and avian life. During our visit, it was noticed that a significant amount of waste had accumulated at the campsite. Although the bins outside were cleaned and put back in place by Friday (3/05/2024) the campsite remained by Sunday (5/05/2024) raising questions about whether the Ministry of Gozo is solely employing garbage collectors or cleaners,"" the group said. 
 Nadur Nadif last year led extensive cleanup efforts on Comino resulting in the removal of over 200 garbage bags. It also engaged in talks with the ministries for Gozo and Tourism, and the Environment Resources Authority (ERA)  to explore actionable solutions for bolstering environmental protection measures. 
 The group called for better cleaning and environmental protection and stiffer littering fines.

 The winds will result in rough seas along exposed, popular sandy beaches that include Golden Bay.
 “A strong wind warning will be issued early tomorrow [Tuesday] morning advising that strong winds will affect the Maltese islands. More wind warnings are likely to follow in the coming days,” the Met Office said.
 The wind is expected to start picking up overnight on Monday reaching northwest force five to six, and on Tuesday morning it will become west-northwest force six to seven.
 On Wednesday, west-northwest winds force five to six winds are forecast to hit the island, while on Thursday the wind speed is expected to drop to force five.
 The rest of the week will have light winds.
  “Although it may not appear to be that sunny, the UV Index will be as high as 10 today and tomorrow. For the rest of the week, it will be at level nine,” the Met Office warned.
 Throughout the week, days will be mainly sunny and windy.
 Monday’s temperature peaked at 34°C, while the remaining days vary from 28°C to 30°C.
 “This is caused by an area of low pressure that will cover Italy and the central Mediterranean… It is quite normal to have windy days in July, usually from the northwestern direction,” the Met Office said as it noted that the forecast may change throughout the week.
 July last year was the hottest month ever recorded by the Met Office, whose records go back to 1922.
 The month had a mean air temperature of 29.6°C. The previous record was set in August 1999, when the temperature had averaged 29.2°C.
 July 2023 saw the maximum temperature peak at 42.7°C as a heatwave affected the Maltese islands. August 1999 still holds the record for the highest temperature of 43.8°C.

How a local plan review could pave the way for pools like Ian Borg’s,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/how-local-plan-review-pave-way-pools-like-ian-borg.1100159,30-10-2024,002191.png,"Ian Borg’s illegal swimming pool could be sanctioned under proposed changes to planning policies for rural settlements, according to a heritage architect.
 The foreign minister’s Rabat countryside pool was approved by the Planning Authority in a decision that a court last year declared illegal because the local plan only allows for the rehabilitation of existing buildings.
 But in a vaguely worded proposal issued last week, the PA said it had started the process of reviewing local plans that affect rural settlements to “clearly define” acceptable types of development and fresh take-up of land.
 The issue revolves around policies that cover Category 2 and 3 rural settlements, which are small clusters of residential developments located outside the development zone (ODZ). 
 Borg’s pool is in the grounds of his countryside villa in the hamlet of Santa Katerina, which is a Category 3 settlement.
 The current policy only allows the rehabilitation and re-development of existing buildings – not the addition of swimming pools. It also specifically forbids the take-up of fresh land for new development, irrespective of its location or proximity to existing buildings.
 In its objective, the PA said that the policy review seeks to “clearly define” what acceptable types of development can be considered as ancillary to a dwelling in Category 2 and 3 settlements and to set up guidelines for the fresh take-up of land in Category 3 settlements for development that is considered ancillary to a dwelling.
  The appeals judgment that definitively declared Borg’s pool to be illegal hinged on the interpretation of two policy points (NWRS 3 and 4).
 While the PA doesn’t specifically say in its statement which policies it seeks to amend nor how it intends to review them, it says it wants to “bring clarity and update the policies to ensure that the management and development of these areas align with contemporary planning standards while respecting their rural character”.
 If NWRS 3 and 4 are amended to widen the acceptable types of ancillary development to a dwelling in a Category 3 settlement or allow for the take-up of fresh land, this could pave the way for certain structures to find grounds for sanctioning.
 Architect Tara Cassar, speaking on behalf of preservation NGO Din l-Art Ħelwa, said these amendments will remove safeguards that prevent development in small and traditional rural settlements.
 “While the Planning Authority has yet to specify which new uses will be included, if pools are listed, it is clear that the changes would enable the sanctioning of the pool that the courts have already deemed illegal,” she said.
 “The PA claims that the amendments are aimed at providing clarity and aligning policies with contemporary planning standards. However, the existing policies are already clear, leaving no room for conflicting interpretation.” Expanding land take-up in these settlements, she continued, is “completely unjustified” particularly as agricultural land is increasingly under threat.
 “Instead of safeguarding rural land, the PA is opening the floodgates for the development of tracts of rural land surrounding these settlements by introducing piecemeal changes to the local plans. The focus should be on restricting allowable uses in rural areas, not enabling further encroachment,” Cassar said.
 The saga of the Borg family swimming pool has been ongoing for years.
 He was first accused of acquiring the property about twice the area of a tennis court in the scenic Santa Katerina valley for just €10,000.
 After transforming an abandoned ODZ building into a modern dwelling, Borg successfully applied to build the swimming pool in an adjacent field.
 When objector Noel Ciantar’s appeal before the planning tribunal was dismissed, he pursued the matter in court, which ruled that the permit should be revoked.
 Borg filed a new application for the pool in 2019 which was again approved by the PA and endorsed by the EPRT. Undeterred, Ciantar again pursued the matter in court and once again managed to get the permit overturned. However, by this stage, the pool had been completed.

Six months on and no action against garden on protected Armier land – rangers,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/six-months-no-action-garden-protected-armier-land-rangers.1102363,13-12-2024,,"Six months since rangers sounded the alarm over an ""illegal"" garden on protected Armier land, the authorities are yet to act, the Malta Ranger Unit (MRU) complained on Thursday.
 The garden - which is connected to a sanctioned boathouse on Natura 2000 land in Armier - made headlines in June after authorities were called to the site to halt illegal building works.
 Despite the construction illegality being removed by August, the garden and its fence were left in place, the rangers said in a Facebook statement.
 While the Environment and Resources Authority (ERA) - responsible for Natura 2000 sites – told the rangers the case had been referred to the Lands Authority, the latter had “ignored"" repeated calls for updates despite several reminders, the MRU said.
 “The occupants are still blocking the land with a fence and expanding their garden – land that doesn't belong to the occupants but to the public,” the unit said while urging ERA to put pressure on the Lands Authority.
 ""Our public Natura 2000 sites are not to be used as private gardens, hijacked by individuals.""
 According to the PA enforcement notice for the site, the contravener Naser Alshalsh’s “unauthorised development” comprises a boathouse complete with a front parapet and a courtyard marked by a separating wall.
 Alshalsh also built a wooden structure and a retaining wall, and installed a wooden fence and gate, with daily fines payable for the contraventions.
 When contacted, a spokesperson for the MRU said Alshalsh had also installed floodlights and planted flora at the site.
 Natura 2000 is a network of nature protection areas across the EU where development is strictly controlled, and wild plants and animals are also protected.
 The spokesperson said that while the plot of land might seem like a small infraction, “nobody should just put up a fence on public land”.  They questioned why ERA did not appear to be pressuring the Lands Authority to act.
 Stressing that taking up public land without approval was “illegal”, the MRU reiterated its call for the two authorities to work together to combat such illegalities.
 This is not the first time the rangers have called for greater cooperation between government authorities: in June the unit called for ERA and the PA to work together more closely to remove illegal buildings immediately.
 Explaining the extent of the problem at the time, a spokesperson for the unit said offenders should be blocked from accessing their illegal property as soon as it is detected, adding such crimes were happening “a lot” in Natura 2000 sites, with contraveners often able to enjoy illegalities “for some years” before action was taken.
 The MRU has become a key part of the country’s frontline defence against environmental crime, tackling everything from illegal hunting and unsanctioned construction to out-of-control bonfires.
 While not having the power to enforce regulations, they advise, educate and inform the public about how to enjoy and protect outdoor spaces.
 Most rangers are volunteers.
 Questions were sent to the Lands Authority and ERA.

Airport unveils 'ambitious' carbon neutral plan,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/airport-unveils-ambitious-carbon-neutral-plan.1096234,08-02-2024,"002427.png,002428.png","Malta International Airport has unveiled plans to reduce its emissions by two-thirds by the end of the decade and achieve net zero emissions by 2050.
 The airport plans to achieve these ""ambitious"" aims by increasing its reliance on solar panels and upgrading airport infrastructure to be more efficient, the company’s head of sustainability and analytics Justine Baldacchino said.
 “The largest contributor will be investments in renewable energy. This will be followed by ensuring that we have more efficient buildings,"" she told a press conference on Friday. 
 ""Next year, our emissions will be offset by investing in activities that will either reduce or absorb co2 [carbon dioxide] emissions,” she said.
 The airport also plans to replace airfield floodlights and ground lighting and upgrade water pump systems and building efficiency, Baldacchino explained, adding the airport had already reduced emissions by almost a third last year.
 Around four-fifths of the airport’s carbon footprint was due to electricity use she said, noting that emissions from airlines operating at the airport were not within the control of MIA.
 At the same press conference, airport CEO Alan Borg reiterated airport figures released last month showing that almost 4.1 million passengers had passed through MIA in the first half of the year – an increase of one-fifth over the same period the year before.
 More than 27,000 aircraft landed or took off from the airport, an increase of a sixth compared to the year before, he said.
 Describing the first half of the year as “excellent”, Borg said the airport’s seat load factor – which measures the filled percentage of available seating capacity – had been consistently high, with almost nine out of 10 (87%) of seats filled in March and June.
  Italy remained the most popular market, followed by the UK, Germany, France and Poland, respectively. And London Gatwick was the most popular airport destination, increasing its share by a quarter to reach more than 225,000 passengers.
 Ryanair was by far the most popular airline, increasing its share by more than a quarter to carry more than two million passengers to and from MIA, with the country's new national carrier KM Malta Airlines accounting for just under 900,000.
 Meanwhile, out of just over 13,000 departures, almost one in 10 (8%) were delayed by more than an hour, with four-fifths of those being due to aircraft delays travelling from other destinations. He said that just four per cent of delays were attributable to air traffic control.
 Last month, EU data showed the Maltese were twice as likely to face long flight delays as travellers in other EU countries, with almost a third saying their flights had been delayed by more than two hours.
 Borg said expansion works to the west of the terminal building and the installation of the remaining new airport scanners were on track to be delivered by the end of the year.
 Commenting on tourism trends on Friday, Malta Tourism Authority (MTA) CEO Carlo Micallef said, “We’re not the cheapest of destinations, but the experience makes up for that.""
 According to airport financial figures released on Thursday, MIA generated €66.4 million in revenue over the first half of the year, netting €22.1 million in profits.

Why your drinks bottles now have caps that stay attached,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/why-drinks-bottles-now-caps-stay-attached.1091775,05-04-2024,002509.png,"Have you noticed it’s become much more difficult to remove the plastic lids from water and soft drink bottles?
 Malta’s two major beverage companies General Soft Drinks (GSD) and Farsons have introduced lids that are tethered to bottles to make it easier for consumers to recycle drinks packaging in its entirety.
 Plastic bottle caps are often lost, ending up as litter, particularly on beaches, where they are among the single-use plastics that are most found there and the new design aims to reduce that.
 The hinged lids began to be rolled out on bottles of Kristal water in November and on soft drinks like Coca-Cola and Sprite last month, GSD said.
 Tethered caps have also been introduced across all beverage products in the Farsons portfolio, which includes Kinnie as well as international products like Pepsi. 
 The move pre-empts a European Union directive that comes into effect in July after being approved in 2019.
 It requires all beverage producers to design the products in a way that “significantly reduce(s) the dispersal into the environment of beverage container caps and lids made of plastic”.
 In a statement, GSD said it had undertaken “a significant capital investment” to make the change and had received no government or EU funding to do so.
 “A greater collection of caps contributes to less litter in our environment and a step closer towards a circular system for caps in the long term,” it said.
 Farsons deputy chief executive Michael Farrugia said the company embraced and endorsed the EU directive.
 And a spokesperson for GSD said the directive is a move that will contribute to better collection of package waste and recycling within the beverage industry.

Slow Streets initiative runs into financial roadblock,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/slow-streets-initiative-runs-financial-roadblock.1096287,08-10-2024,"002735.png,002736.png","Updated on 10 August at 6:30pm
 An initiative to ‘slow down’ traffic has hit a brick wall, with the Local Councils Association expressing frustration over a lack of funding for the initiative.
 Association president Mario Fava said that due to a lack of a centralised system for funding, he has been left to solicit money from various sources to keep the so-called Slow Streets project alive. But despite his best efforts and praise from stakeholders, he has not even received a fraction of the initiative's estimated cost.
 “I feel a bit frustrated because the money never came... Once I managed to come up with a feasible project, I should have been able to access funds more easily instead of having to apply for different schemes. It would be easier to have something more centralised,” said Fava.
 The Slow Streets Initiative, part of the Residents First project, aims to prioritise pedestrians over cars. It emphasises temporary traffic-calming measures in town centres and redirecting traffic to the peripheries, ensuring mobility within localities is safe, sustainable, healthy and efficient. The initiative also promotes pedestrianisation and public open spaces.
 The Local Councils Association estimates that €8.3 million are needed for the project to get going. But only €200,000 have been allocated to the project in four years.
 The €200,000 allocation was made by former Transport Minister Aaron Farrugia.
 The initiative initially garnered interest from 46 localities, but only Żejtun, Safi and Swieqi received partial support.
 According to Fava, between €150,000 and €200,000 is needed for each of the localities interested. This amount would cover architectural and other professional fees, planters, road-marking signs and paint, branded bollards and barriers, and project management fees.
 Fava said Żejtun has a bill of quantities for the whole project and traffic signs ready. Safi began working on the initiative but, due to budgetary constraints, had to focus just on the square and not the surrounding traffic management. In Swieqi, discussions about the initiative paused due to the recent elections but are expected to resume.
 “We started consulting with the people of the different localities, they agreed to proceed, we began working on it, and then we had to say there were no funds,” said Fava.
  The Slow Streets Initiative resurfaced in public discourse after the new Mosta mayor announced plans to halt the partial pedestrianisation of the town square, following complaints from residents and business owners.
 To Fava, the positive aspect of the Mosta debate is that it has sparked a debate. However, he finds it difficult to understand the business owners’ opposition, pointing out that more open space could mean more people enjoying meals ‘al fresco’. Additionally, there are more opportunities for events to draw people to the square.
 Antoine Zammit, founder of Studjurban, the architecture firm that designed many of the plans for the Slow Streets Initiative, said that despite the project's financing issues, he still saw some signs of progress. 
 The whole point of the initiative was to experiment with ideas and try them out gradually to see if they could work, while actively listening to residents and eventually implementing something more permanently, he said. 
 
 Some local councils have independently adopted elements of the initiative, and Gozo is leading in this respect.
 Xagħra, Sannat, and Xewkija have temporarily converted streets into safe social spaces for children to play, residents to mingle, and community activities to take place. In Xewkija, the village square is closed to traffic every Saturday and Sunday, allowing the community to enjoy the space without cars.
 Simona Refalo, the mayor of Xewkija, reminisced about playing in the village square as a child and expressed her desire to “keep Xewkija in Xewkija” by creating weekend events that encourage residents to gather in the square.
 “Life is too fast-paced, and we are all so cut off from one another, but the square is what brings us all together,” Refalo said.
 Update: According to Fava, since the interview was conducted he met with the new CEO of Infrastructure Malta, Steve Ellul. As a result of the meeting, Infrastructure Malta said it will now be dedicating some funds to the Slow Streets initiative.

Public urged to use see-through black bags from next week,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/seethrough-black-bags-mixed-waste-mandatory-next-week.1094646,28-06-2024,"002808.png,002809.png","As of Tuesday, mixed waste will have to be disposed of in transparent black bags to make it easier for enforcement officials to check the content of bags without opening them.
 Regulations that came into force last year ensure households and businesses separate waste in three different coloured bags: white for organic waste, grey or green for recyclable waste and black for other, mixed, waste.
 Businesses caught disposing of waste inadequately are fined €75, while households €25. These fines double to €150 and €50 respectively if the individual is caught repeatedly disposing of waste inappropriately.
 According to subsidiary legislation 549.40, mixed waste - which is collected on Tuesdays and Saturdays - will, as of July 1, have to be placed outdoors ready for collection in transparent black bags.
 In a statement on Friday, the Environment and Resources Authority ""encouraged"" people to use see-through black bags when disposing of waste intended for black bags.
 Black bags are intended for items that are not organic, recyclable, reusable, hazardous or medicinal. 
 ERA said it would allow a ""transitional period"" to help people get used to the mandatory use of see-through black bags, however, it did not specify when this grace period will be over.
 People will still be able to buy regular black bags, however, they cannot be used to dispose of mixed waste.
 The authority said that since the introduction of new regulations in 2023, including a waste collection schedule coordinated by regional councils and the mandatory waste separation enforced by ERA - there has been a 23% drop in mixed waste and a 35% increase in organic waste.

 A man who is thought to have deposited at least 1,000 baggies of human poo and other litter in the Marsaxlokk countryside has been stopped after being caught in the act by the Malta Ranger Unit. 
 In a Facebook post on Monday, the Rangers said that for four years they have every single day found human faeces wrapped in a milk carton and then placed in a plastic bag with other litter dumped in the same spot in a rural area in Marsaxlokk. 
 ""It's anticipated that this individual has deposited over 1000 packages (!) throughout the years (the offences trace back to 2020), with nearly one package being thrown every day. The packages were thrown in the exact same spot,"" they said. 
 But thanks to a sting operation, Rangers who observed the site for a week were able to gather enough evidence to file a police report once the man was identified.
  The Malta Ranger Unit, which was established in 2023, is mostly made up of volunteers. Rangers patrol the countryside to report illegalities, advise and educate the public about caring for nature.
 The Rangers hailed the event as a victory, saying that years of defacing a public space have finally come to an end. 
 They said that man is expected to be charged for the accumulation of litter that he is thought to have dumped over the years, as well as the sanitary issue. With these two elements considered, he could face a fine of up to €6,000 if convicted in Court.
 ""Marsaxlokk will now be a cleaner place and the offender will be held accountable for his bad habit,"" they said.

 Excavation and pathway formation are currently underway at what is planned to become the William Harding Pembroke Community Garden. The garden will feature 100 trees, an underground reservoir and a restored rubble wall to provide a recreational space for Pembroke residents. 
 The works were announced by Project Green on Saturday, and the agency aims to complete the works on the garden in 2025. 
  The garden will also have play areas and designated picnic spots. The number of parking spaces of site will remain the same and will be surrounded by greenery to provide shade. 
 Cheryl Camilleri, an architect at Project Green, explained that works are at the initial phase. 
 “We are excavating approximately one metre below the existing ground level to provide newly planted trees with sufficient soil depth to ensure healthy growth,"" she said.
 ""We have also begun marking out a pathway, which will be constructed from permeable materials that allow rainwater to filter through slowly.”
 This accessible pathway will connect the garden from one end to the other, and retaining walls separating the higher and lower areas will be stabilised or rebuilt in certain sections to prevent erosion and soil loss during heavy rainfall.
 “For irrigation, we will improve and utilise an existing connection under the road, leading from the garden to three large, historic British-era reservoirs located across from Burma Road,” Camilleri said.
  Project Green currently manages a portfolio of 118 projects across Malta and Gozo. Other projects where work is currently underway include the Independence Garden in Birżebbuġa, Villa Portelli Gardens in Kalkara, the St Michael’s Hospice garden and the Serenity Garden in Santa Lucija.

Mosta trees show signs of ‘potential recovery’,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/mosta-trees-show-signs-potential-recovery.1096043,08-03-2024,002956.png,"Trees in Mosta show signs of new growth and “potential recovery”, months after holes were drilled into their trunks and an unspecified liquid was poured around them, the Environment and Resources Authority (ERA) said.
 In March, the ERA and the Mosta local council filed police reports after NGO Moviment Graffitti flagged concerns that the trees were potentially poisoned.
 An ERA spokesperson said specialists had since cleaned and drained the substance from the affected tree holes and sealed them with healing materials to prevent additional damage.
 “Initial assessments indicated that the trees had sustained harm, however, most have shown signs of new growth, suggesting potential recovery,” the spokesperson told Times of Malta.
 The ERA has coordinated with Ambjent Malta and the Mosta local council to ensure regular irrigation for the trees, especially during dry weather conditions.
 The 12 mature ficus trees along Constitution Street, by the Mosta Dome, were at the centre of national attention in November when activists successfully stopped plans to uproot and transplant them while the Mosta square was being revamped.
 No details were provided on what the liquid is, but the spokesperson said: “Laboratory analysis commissioned by the ERA has confirmed that the substance used was harmful.”

Ħondoq ir-Rummien developer wants to rebuild rural room,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/hondoq-irrummien-developer-wants-rebuild-rural-room.1093819,15-06-2024,"003100.png,003101.png","The developers behind the unsuccessful repeated attempts to build a destination port comprising a hotel, a yacht marina and a tourist village in the iconic Ħondoq ir-Rummien have applied to reconstruct a dilapidated rural room overlooking the bay.
 Gozo Prestige Hotels applied to reconstruct the room, replacing its ceiling and rebuilding the parts that collapsed over the years.
 Through architect Deborah Busuttil, Gozo Prestige Holidays director Joe Cassar is seeking permission to demolish the rural room, built before 1967, and reconstruct collapsed walls, ceiling and parapet walls “as it is”. According to plans filed with the Planning Authority, the present room is 2.6 metres high while the proposed room will measure 3.08 metres.
 Qala mayor Paul Buttigieg, who put on a 20-year fight to save Ħondoq, told Times of Malta he was against the development if the room will grow more than it is at present or if it becomes an eyesore.
 The local council, through their lawyer, Claire Bonello, asked the PA to keep it informed throughout the stages of the application.
  Gozo Prestige Hotels acquired the land from the Dominican Order for just €23,000 back in 1988.
 Nearly 15 years later, in July 2002, an application was filed to develop “a destination port”, which was to include a hotel, yacht marina and a tourist village. The entire project would have eaten up 103,000 square metres of land, with a building footprint of more than 13,000 square metres. The developers applied to build private roads, a marina promenade and a public wharf.
 Some 15,000 square metres of agricultural land and another 23,000 square metres of protected garigue were to be dug up.
 Buttigieg began his two-decade campaign against the development and organised a referendum in 2012 when an overwhelming 84.5 per cent of residents voted against what was at the time referred to as “the Qala Creek project”.
 In August 2011, the Directorate of Environment Protection recommended that the Ħondoq project be shot down and, in June 2016, the PA unanimously voted to refuse the application in what was viewed as a victory for residents and activists opposed to the privatisation of the coastal area.
 But that victory was short-lived: barely four months later, in October, the applicant appealed the decision. Gozo Prestige Hotels insisted their right to a fair hearing had been denied as they had only been given 15 days to prepare for the final hearing.
 The developers also called for the project to be sent back to assessment for new plans to be considered – replacement of the proposed marina with a lagoon and a significantly reduced built-up area.
 But, in October 2022, a final decision was handed down when the Environment Planning Review Tribunal decided against the developer’s appeal. And, again, last August, this decision was confirmed on appeal. The Court of Appeal declared that the Planning Authority was right to reject the new plans submitted by the developer after the environmental impact assessment had been finalised.
 Prime Minister Robert Abela earlier this month said that the government was currently going through a process to ensure that Ħondoq ir-Rummien would not be developed once and for all.

"‘Rotten’ planning appeals system must change, NGOs say to PM",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/rotten-planning-appeals-system-change-ngos-say-pm.1094250,21-06-2024,003146.png,"A group of NGOs has called on the Prime Minister to urgently reform the “rotten” planning appeals system, which allows developers to start working even while permits are being challenged. 
 The 14 NGOs said in a statement that they denounced Robert Abela’s failure to introduce reform in this area, despite promising to do so in May last year. 
 Presently, applicants are allowed to start construction work that is covered by a permit that is under appeal. This, the groups said, has led to a situation where planning permits for already completed buildings are being revoked and no action is taken by authorities to remove these illegalities. 
 “The law allowing works during appeal proceedings is a blatant breach of the fundamental right to legally challenge the decision of the Planning Authority (PA),” they said in a statement.
 “Communities and organisations not only have to carry the financial burden of contesting irregular PA decisions, but they also risk doing so in vain since developers are allowed to build anyway.”
 In recent months Court decisions have seen revoked permits for swimming pools in Qala’s ODZ, parts of a Sannat development, a Xewkija development, and a  Mellieħa hotel, the groups pointed out, all of which had already been built by the time of the permit’s revocation and remain intact to this day. 
 Other large-scale development such as Villa Rosa in St. Julian’s and Mistra Village in Xemxija have already started despite ongoing appeals challenging the legality of the permits. 
 The groups criticised Abela for promising to make changes to the law that would make development permit non-executable until appeals are put to bed, but having for far failed to deliver on this promise. 
 They also raised concern that public consultation issued by the government was in fact seeking to limit the right to appeal rather than introduce these changes. 
 “The organisations note with indignation that while this promised reform - needed to safeguard the very basic right of appellants - has stalled, at the same time Government rushed into proposing amendments to DC15,” they said.
 “These amendments aim at allowing developers to build an extra floor, thus increasing crowding, congestion and construction activity across Malta and Gozo. Moreover, developers who had permits revoked for not respecting rules on the allowable number of floors – but had completed their buildings anyway by the end of the appeal proceedings – would now be able to regularise their illegal buildings.”
 This state of affairs is pointing towards a “deeply rotten planning regime” where decisions are made to favour developers and not to empower people, they said, resulting in a country “ravaged by greed and run by bullies”. 
 “We call on the Prime Minister to immediately usher in the promised reform on suspending the execution of permits whilst appeal proceedings are underway before the Tribunal (EPRT) and the Court of Appeal,” they said.
 “This will be one first small, but essential, step in introducing a modicum of decency within our planning system.”

 In a statement on Friday, eNGO Friends of the Earth Malta said that EU member states have an obligation to draw up these plans which detail how they intend to address issues such as decarbonisation, energy efficiency, energy security, the internal energy market as well as research, innovation and competitiveness in the energy secretary in order to meet EU climate targets. 
 But despite the deadline for national governments to submit these plans in nine days' time on June 30, the Maltese government has yet to communicate its plans publicly.
 FOEM said that no formal public consultation process has taken place and neither a draft nor the final NECP document has been made publicly available, despite the NGO attempting to access information about the document and the princess since May 2023. 
 The group also said that it sent a letter to Energy Minister Miriam Dalli and Prime Minister Robert Abela highlighting these facts. Dalli, they said, replied that a consultation process was “about to start in the coming days” but to date, no open consultation has taken place. 
 According to the rules that guide the formation of the NECP, member states must make sure that the public and civil society are given the opportunity to participate in the drafting of these plans well before the document is finalised. 
 FOEM said that it fears that these obligations have not been met, even after the European Commission made explicit instructions to do so in its recommendations to Malta. 
 “Public participation is essential for effective climate action and energy policy. Failing to implement obligatory public participation processes is a failure of democratic decision-making,” Suzanne Maas, FOEM’s Climate Campaign Coordinator, said.
 “The government of Malta has thus far not enabled the public to participate in the preparation of the NECP and has failed to establish a multilevel climate and energy dialogue to discuss different scenarios for energy and climate policies,” the statement continues.

"Energy demand could exceed supply by 2035, experts warn",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/energy-demand-exceed-supply-2035-experts-warn.1096286,08-04-2024,003632.png,"Malta could run out of energy by 2035 if electric vehicle targets are met and offshore plans fail to materialise, experts warn, with a  second interconnector not enough to meet the predicted higher demand.
 The data, issued by audit firm EY in an analysis, indicates that Malta’s plans to introduce 65,000 electric vehicles on its roads, as outlined in its low-carbon development strategy, will tip the scales beyond its ability to meet energy demands.
 Things could escalate even quicker if the second Sicily-Malta interconnector, set to be completed next year, does not come to fruition, with Malta’s energy supply being stretched beyond breaking point by 2030.
 At the height of last summer’s power outages, then-Enemalta CEO Jonathan Cardona revealed that peak demand had topped 600 megawatts for the first time on record but remained well below the 830 megawatts that can be generated.
 Reacting to EY’s analysis, former Enemalta chair Robert Ghirlando said Malta urgently needs to up its ability to generate energy to meet the “already critical” peak demand.
 Ghirlando, who chaired Enemalta in the late 1990s and throughout the turn of the century, argued that the solution to ensure energy security “lies in a little bit of everything”.
 This includes greater investment in renewable sources, as well as upgrading Enemalta’s decades-old power plants to be more efficient.
 But, in the meantime, more efforts should be made to encourage people to cut down on consumption and educate them to be more energy efficient, he said.
 “How many people know that it’s useless to have photovoltaic panels if you don’t keep them clean? Or that it’s pointless to set your AC below a certain point?
 “Ultimately, no politician from either side is going to encourage people to cut down on consumption,” he said.
 Ghirlando also recommends removing blanket energy subsidies to minimise excessive consumption, with subsidies directed towards businesses and households that need help.
  Luciano Mulé Stagno, who heads the University of Malta’s Institute for Sustainable Energy, sees renewable energy, combined with technological advancements, as the road towards energy security.
 “We need to be aggressive in investing in PVs,” he said, adding there is still ample scope for Malta to up its game in terms of onshore renewables.
 But it is the plans for offshore farms (“both a big unknown and a big opportunity”) that Mulé Stagno places most hope in.
 “If Malta builds an offshore wind farm it will most likely build a large one, capable of generating some 400 or 500 megawatts,” he says.
 Combine this with battery banks and storage facilities and “you can either store the excess energy to meet peak demand, or sell the extra energy abroad,” he argues.
 Mulé Stagno admits the cost of batteries remains exorbitant but says their price is dropping rapidly by some 10% each year, “so it could be economically viable by 2030 or so”.
 When it comes to electric vehicles, he says the authorities should look to incentivise off-peak charging by providing variable tariffs with cheaper rates throughout the night.
 Emerging technology could make this even more profitable for households, he says, pointing to how some countries are introducing measures to allow people to power their household through their car’s battery.
 “So, you could charge your car at night, when energy demand on the grid is low and tariffs are cheaper, then use excess energy in the battery to power your house during the day.”
 Should we be worried about the provision of energy? Yes, but within reason, Mulé Stagno says.
 “The path forward is clear. How quickly we get there depends on how well things are managed by the government and the private sector.
 We should always be worried about essential services like energy and water but I would be more worried if we didn’t know what the way forward is or if we didn’t have solutions.”

Watch: Is the Sliema promenade about to collapse?,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/watch-is-sliema-promenade-collapse.1091947,21-06-2024,"003703.png,003704.png,003705.png","A cave right under the Sliema promenade does not appear to be facing any “immediate” risk of collapse, according to two experts, allaying fears of a potential looming disaster in one of the most popular pedestrian spots.
 Concerns about the fissures in the rock eating into the rock under the promenade have been raised in the last years, with the Sliema mayor even saying the promenade could collapse if faced with a heavy storm from the northeast.
 Times of Malta visited the site with civil engineers and University of Malta lecturers Adrian Mifsud and Christian Schembri to take a closer look at the cave and others like it to determine just how much of a threat they pose.
 But according to Mifsud and Schembri, however, this worst-case scenario is not likely – at least, not anytime soon.
 “Even though there does not seem to be any imminent danger, the caves are clearly migrating further inland… There’s no imminent danger, [but] that doesn’t mean there won’t be with time,” engineering geologist Schembri said, upon inspection.
  Describing the caves’ expansion as an “ongoing process,” Mifsud stressed that while it did not seem to present an immediate threat, if left unchecked the process could eventually result in collapses like that which befell the Azure Window in 2017.
 He thinks that of all the caves, Għar il-Lembi closest to the concrete pier at Chalet merits the most attention because the rock is “very fractured” and the wall above is made from masonry and not concrete like the rest of the promenade.
 The pair stressed that while it was important that the caves be studied and taken care of on a regular basis, this was already being done by the Coastal and Storm Water Unit within the Public Works Department.
 Such study, they added, “doesn’t mean installing expensive instrumentation. It means taking an educated look at the way the rock is behaving and eroding.”
 Pointing to two large caves separated by a pillar-like section of rock under the car park close to Fortizza as an example – a formation called Għar id-Dud – Mifsud said, “although it’s well interlocked [and] I don’t think it will fail tomorrow, in the long term it definitely needs to be monitored”.
  While the Sliema caves extend under the promenade by several metres, according to the two scientists, they are just the tip of the iceberg, representing several large fissures that extend far into Sliema.
 Such fissures, or cracks in the rock, typically run northeast to southwest and occur in many parts of Malta, they explained.
 But with these fissures extending further into Sliema, could this pose a problem for some of the large tower blocks springing up further inland?
 “If you’ve got a cave 10 metres deep, then the load from buildings 60 metres away is unlikely to create a major problem,” said Mifsud, a geotechnical engineer.
 “But if for example, you have a situation like Fort Ricasoli [in Kalkara], where an entire fortification rests on the edge of the cliff, that’s a completely different story. It all depends on the proximity, the amount of load and the properties of the material – there is no clear and direct answer to that question.”
  The state of the caves gained attention again when Sliema mayor John Pillow took to Facebook to point to the absence of a concrete ledge he said had once stood above the sea near Chalet as evidence the front was eroding.
 In a video posted to the social media platform, Pillow warned “we can expect the promenade to collapse if there’s a storm from the northeast.”
 But according to the two scientists, while such fears may be premature, they are not completely unfounded.
 “Just because there’s no danger right now, it does not mean there’s no danger – it needs to be studied further,” said Schembri.
 Adrian Mifsud is a geotechnical engineer and University of Malta lecturer, and Christian Schembri is an engineering geologist and visiting lecturer.

 If the commission gives the green light, the government plans to launch scheduled and chartered flights from the airfield. According to the case officer's report, helicopters - including the air ambulance - will also operate from the Xewkija strip.
 Should the application be approved, the existing airstrip will extend from 174 metres to 445 metres.
 But the proposal did not go down well with the PL-led Xewkija council.
 In a statement on Facebook, the council said the councillors unanimously voted to object to the application.
 ""The council believes this project will be a nuisance for Xewkija residents and harmful to the environment including increased pollution and loud noises.
 ""The council demands that application PA 07333/22 be suspended in order to hold an open consultation with all local residents with the aim of addressing their concerns and safeguarding their interests.""

Watch: Tenor Joseph Calleja calls for protection of Maltese Honey Bee,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/watch-tenor-joseph-calleja-calls-protection-maltese-honey-bee.1092701,20-05-2024,"003982.png,003983.png,003984.png","World-renowned tenor Joseph Calleja has called for the Maltese honey bee to be provided the highest level of protection in a new educational video on the endemic species.
 “The Maltese honey bee should have the highest protection so it can continue to spread and be enjoyed for the years to come,” Calleja said.
 The island’s opera heavyweight is best known for his powerful voice but many are unaware that Calleja has a strong passion for beekeeping.
 “There is so little nature in Malta that what we have we should protect in any way that we can.”
 The video, ‘A Unique Insect: The Maltese Honey Bee’ is being launched on World Bee Day (today) by the Foundation for the Conservation of the Maltese Honey Bee.
  The foundation runs the National Insect Initiative, urging the Environmental Resources Authority (ERA) to name the Maltese Honey Bee, Apis mellifera ruttneri, as the official National Insect of Malta.
 The foundation also appeals for action to be taken to provide sustainable policies to protect the Maltese Bee equivalent to the protection of the local ecosystem.
 While endemic to the Maltese islands, the Maltese honey bee is a subspecies of the Western honey bee and has evolved to cope with the specific conditions of its geographical isolation in Malta, and to adapt to the hot summers.
  Currently, there are five national species, including Malta’s national bird, the Blue rock thrush (il-merill), and Malta’s national plant, the Maltese rock-centaury ( widnet il-baħar). Yet, there is no mention of a national insect.
 For years, numerous local beekeepers have called for the protection of the Maltese Honey Bee, saying imported foreign bees pose a threat to the species as they bring new illnesses and pests.
 The foundation also highlights how the species’ genetic purity is threatened due to cross-breeding with other foreign bee species, and calls for a ban on the importation of foreign bees to safeguard the endemic species.
 This point was further emphasised after research suggested the Maltese bee is at risk of “imminent extinction” unless foreign species are banned.
  The video explores various aspects of the special bee, including its historic connection to the Maltese islands, its unique biodiversity, the challenges it faces, and its prospects.
 The video featured other beekeepers, such as Arnold Grech, a veteran beekeeper who has been rearing honey bees since 1949 and was one of the Maltese investigators who, along with international researchers, classified the Maltese Honey Bee and gave it its scientific name.
 Michaelangelo Muscat, a third-generation beekeeper, who has been harvesting Maltese honey for over 50 years, and Jorge Spiteri, the national representative of the Maltese Young Beekeepers for the International Centre for Young Beekeepers, also spoke of the importance of protecting the Maltese Honey Bee.
 Others were David Chetcuti Dimech and Simone Borg, who both worked on numerous environment conservation projects and advocated for the conservation of the Maltese Honey Bee.
 The video was produced through funding acquired from the Small Initiative Support Scheme managed by the Malta Council for the Voluntary Sector, supported by the Ministry for Inclusion and the Voluntary Sector.

Kalkara residents petition as protected area risks being developed,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/kalkara-residents-petition-protected-area-risks-developed.1098712,28-09-2024,"003863.png,003864.png","Kalkara residents are petitioning against a zoning application that could see a field in the town’s rural conservation area developed and trees uprooted.
 The proposal, which would allow development in a currently protected area close to Triq it-Turretta and Triq Patri Mattew Sultana, has been met with opposition from residents, the local council, NGOs and the Environment and Resource Authority.
 Joseph Scicluna, 59, is leading a petition among Kalkara residents to oppose the application, which has already been signed by more than 150 residents.
 A rural conservation area (RCA) status gives an extra layer of protection to undeveloped sites that go beyond the protection granted to outside development zone sites.
 In a report, the Planning Authority’s case officer said the application cannot be considered through the regular Planning Control Alignment process because the site is within the RCA.
 “Both the architect and the applicant are aware of these facts but insisted on pursuing the application anyway to reserve their legible rights for an appeal in the event of a negative determination of this application,” the case officer said in his report that recommended the application be refused.
 The case officer also recommended the refusal of PC/0070/22 because the site lies in an area of high landscape value intended to protect the harbour fortifications, within the buffer zone intended to protect the discovery of cart ruts.
 The application, therefore, goes against Planning Authority policy (SPED) objectives that seek to identify, protect and enhance the character and amenity of distinct urban areas.
 The application, filed by Raymond Zammit, is the second of its kind. In 2019, a very similar zoning application was refused by the Planning Authority.
  The Environment and Resource Authority said the objectives it had raised with the old application applied to this attempt.
 That includes objections over interventions on mature trees present on site.
 The Kalkara council also “strongly objected” to the application, saying the “extension to the developable area would prejudice the protection status of the rural conservation area”.
 Wirt il-Kalkara,  il-Kollettiv,  Din l-Art Ħelwa and  Graffitti are among the NGOs opposing the application.

A million litres of water wasted in one hour after Tal-Barrani pipe burst,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/a-million-litres-water-wasted-one-hour-talbarrani-pipe-burst.1096442,08-08-2024,003865.png,"One million litres of water were wasted in an hour after a main pipe was hit during works on the Tal-Barrani link road on Monday, according to the Water Services Corporation (WSC).
 Commuters were seen driving through the flooded road soon after the incident.
 Tal-Barrani Road is a crucial connecting route for many localities in the south, including Tarxien, Fgura, Żabbar, Żejtun, Għaxaq, and the Bulebel industrial estate, as well as an important link to Marsaxlokk and Birżebbuġa. 
 The WSC spokesperson told Times of Malta it is estimated around 15,000 households in nearby localities were impacted by the incident, but the disruption was probably “minimal” because of water tanks in people’s homes.
 Homes and businesses in Tarxien, Paola, Luqa, Santa Luċija and the Marsa Industrial Estate received a text message on Monday warning that they could be left without water for the whole day, with services likely to be restored by the evening.
 Infrastructure Malta said works immediately began in cooperation with the WSC to repair the damage and restore services.
 The WSC spokesperson confirmed that the damaged pipe was repaired by Infrastructure Malta’s contractor, using materials and fittings supplied by the corporation.
 “Regarding the volume of water lost, it is estimated that approximately 1,000 cubic metres of water (1 million litres) were wasted between 10.15am and 11.15am,” the spokesperson said.
 The amount of water wasted could fill one-third of the Tal-Qroqq Olympic 50-metre pool, or almost 7,000 rectangular bathtubs (that hold around 150 litres).
 When asked if anyone would be fined for the damages, the spokesperson said an investigation was launched to determine if the contractor was at fault.
 He said that if the contractor is at fault, “penalties” would be imposed to cover costs of material, loss of water, and the hours of supervision and administration.

 The department carried out a test run for the service in March for the feast of St Joseph in Rabat, however, the service will be launched officially on May 26 following the Tarxien festa.
 On Monday, Parliamentary Secretary Glenn Beddingfield described the service as the cleansing department's ""social corporate responsibility towards localities”.
 In February, the department invested €1.3 million in 11 new vehicles to help clean the streets of Sliema and St Julian’s.
 The equipment included robot sweepers and scrubbers, a refuse collection vehicle, a street washer, a compact sweeper, four pedestrian sweepers, a city sweeper, and crew cab tipper vans.
 Ramon Deguara, Director General at the Cleansing and Maintenance Division, said that the department would be able to provide the service thanks to its experience of cleaning large-scale events in a short time.
 In March it took cleansing employees four hours to collect 15 tonnes of waste left behind by revellers who turned up for a massive street party in Paceville and St Julian's to celebrate Saint Patrick’s Day.

Plans for Mellieħa green lung to become 109-unit apartment complex,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/plans-mellieha-green-lung-109unit-apartment-complex.1097838,09-09-2024,"004373.png,004374.png","A 4,000 square metre Mellieħa green lung at the heart of a tug-of-war between the government and residents is being earmarked for a towering apartment complex.
 A planning application (PA/00371/24) filed by T&S Property Holdings last November shows how the stretch of land in an area known as Tal-Qortin could be developed into a large residential complex.
 The development, made up of three separate blocks, will contain 23 residential units on each of its ground, first, second and third floors, for a total of 92 apartments, together with 17 penthouses and 171 basement garages.
 The application is still at the vetting stage, but it has received the green light from the Environment and Resources Authority. 
  The land, which belonged to the government, had been transferred by tender to T&S Property Holdings on a 50-year perpetual revisable emphyteusis in 2023, against an annual payment of €380,000.
 The deal stipulated that the winning bidder could redeem the emphyteusis within the first 15 years after a revision according to the rate of inflation
 The land is believed to have a market value of over €12m.
 Although T&S Property Holdings were outbid in the tender process, the company are believed to have had a right of first refusal because they already owned an adjacent piece of land on the same plot, allowing them to match the highest bid received and take over the entire plot.
 T&S Property Holdings are familiar faces in Malta’s construction sector, with its two directors, Paul Attard and Paul Vella, also being directors of GAP Property and Ballut Blocks respectively.
 The land transfer had raised the ire of several residents when it was first proposed.
 In February 2023, at the beginning of the tender process, a group of residents filed a parliamentary petition, calling on the Lands Authority to stop the land transfer and maintain the land as a much-needed open space.
 The calls had been backed by PN MPs Ivan Castillo and Robert Cutajar, as well as then-PL MEP Cyrus Engerer.
 Later in the year, Mellieħa local councillor Gabriel Micallef, who would become the town’s mayor a few months later, called on the ombudsman to investigate the land transfer, arguing that the circumstances around the deal “raise serious questions about the transparency and fairness of the transaction”.

Cassola asks Ombudsman to investigate illegal quarry backfilling in Rabat,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/cassola-asks-ombudsman-investigate-illegal-quarry-backfilling-rabat.1097293,27-08-2024,004482.png,"Arnold Cassola asked the Ombudsman to investigate government inaction on an illegal backfilling of a quarry in Rabat.
 “Despite numerous complaints to the Environment and Resources Authority (ERA), the Planning Authority (PA), the Building and Construction Authority (BCA), and the police, no action has been taken to address this illegal activity,” the independent politician said in his letter to the Ombudsman.
 On Sunday, Times of Malta reported how a quarry that has been illegally backfilled to several storeys high is posing a “very dangerous situation” for a neighbouring farmer, who fears that falling boulders or a landslide could cause serious injury and damage to his property.
 The Rabat quarry is subject to two active enforcement notices from the Planning Authority (PA) dating back to 2005 and 2009.
 In April 2019, the Environment and Resources Authority (ERA) issued a stop-work order against the company that owns the quarry, Tlata Ltd. As a result, the quarry is subject to daily fines.
 However, the quarry backfilling has continued.
 In his letter to the Ombudsman, Cassola said that enforcement notices have been ignored and “authorities have failed to act promptly to mitigate the risks created in this situation.”
 This failure has raised questions about the effectiveness of regulatory entities responsible for implementing environmental and planning laws, he said.
 Cassola asked the Ombudsman to investigate why authorities, including the Planning Authority, ERA, the Building and Construction Authority (BCA), and police, did not take further enforcement action.
 He also asked the watchdog to identify which government entities or individuals are responsible for not enforcing the law.
 The independent politician also requests that the Ombudsman conduct an independent assessment of the current risks posed to neighbouring properties and the wider environment by the illegal dumping.
 The Ombudsman should also recommend immediate steps to rectify the situation to protect third-party property and the environment at large.

 The group will include representatives of the WSC, the Malta Tourism Authority, the police, the Environment and Resources Authority, the Public Works and the Local Councils’ Association. A representative of the Environment Health Directorate will chair.
 ""Its purpose is to avoid a repetition of what we saw this summer,"" Cilia told the media.
 Several popular beaches were closed for some time this summer owing to contamination, a situation blamed on blocked sewage systems or private drains. 
 Balluta Bay was closed for around two months due to  E.coil contamination, leaving tourists disappointed and residents  frustrated.
 St George’s Bay in Birżebbuġa was closed twice after being contaminated with sewage traced to a blockage in a nearby public toilet. 
 Beachgoers also saw St Paul’s Bay and  Bugibba closed for some days due to contamination.
 Cilia said the new group will monitor drain pipes of houses and businesses located in coastal areas to ensure they are in good condition, and any damages are repaired.
 He stressed that only a single beach closure this summer was linked to the WSC’s network. All other incidents were the result of abuse and faults in private establishments or residences.  
  Among them was the disposal of a baby nappy wrapped in a towel at a public toilet in Birżebbuġa, which led to the closure of St George Bay due to overflow and contamination.
 At Balluta Bay, Cilia explained that the foul water had streamed into the bay from a tunnel which was not part of the WSC sewage network.  WSC workers spent hours cleaning it, removing deckchairs, glass and plastic containers, bottles, planks of wood and other debris.
  St George’s Bay was closed in June due to a defective private drain. 
 At Bugibba, foul water had leaked into the bay from a rainwater culvert after somebody dumped contaminated water into the stormwater system. 
 Cilia also gave an overview of the WSC’s current projects and its plans for the next 10 years.
 He said 2023 was a record year for the corporation,  with a 72 per cent network efficiency rate and the recovery of €1 million in lost revenue.
 Revenue from water billing increased by 9% from the previous year thanks to the detection of abuse, detection of leaks, and more efficient billing systems.
 He said the corporation had found numerous cases of farmers abusing the system of 'new water' (treated water from sewage) and using more than they needed.  He explained that dispensers of new water only provide enough water for farmers' crops. 
 On the topic of Malta’s tap water, he said the water was safe and good to drink, while the taste was a “work in progress”. Improving the taste of tap water is one of the main measures for the national plan.

 A second loggerhead turtle nest successfully hatched on Tuesday night, with 35 hatchlings estimated to have emerged on the first night. 
 The nest started to show signs of readiness to hatch a few days ago, when volunteers noticed the sand at the surface of the nest began to shift in a promising way. 
  By Tuesday evening, a crater had begun to visibly emerge at the top of the nest, with the sands shifting as the night went on. 
 Shortly after 11 pm, rescuers spotted several heads peaking from the top of the crater and just before midnight, the hatchlings started to emerge. 
  Guided by volunteers using red lights, the hatchlings scrambled their way down to the sea, disappearing beneath the crashing waves under the moonlight. 
 At the time, volunteers on site estimated that between 30 to 34 turtles had hatched from the nest, with more likely to emerge as time goes on.

 Staff from QuickLets and Zanzi Homes were joined by a team of volunteers including around 60 divers, snorkellers and kayak users for the clean-up.
 From 8am to 1pm, they managed to fill three skips with rubbish including rusted metal grates, construction and household waste and even a suitcase.
 Saturday's action was the eight edition of the annual Ocean Bed Clean-Up organised by the QLZH Foundation, a social impact voluntary organisation from real estate companies QuickLets and Zanzi Homes.
  “It’s about raising awareness,” said QLZH Foundation co-founder Steve Mercieca. “You could do one every day and it still wouldn’t be enough; there’s so much rubbish in the sea.”
 Stressing the scale of the problem, the real estate entrepreneur said, “Even if you flick a cigarette or drop a cup out of your car in Rabat it will eventually end up in our seas.""
 Mercieca said that this was the foundation's 62nd clean-up and that their goal is as much about "" getting people"" together as it is about giving back. 
 He said the foundation had been inspired to return to the area after retrieving a Toyota Prius from the same spot in 2019 with the help of environmental NGO Żibel.
  “We found car jacks, railings and other items in the sea back then so we decided to return this year to do a clean-up,” said Mercieca, before thanking all the volunteers, sponsors and the Valletta local council.
 Valletta mayor Olaf McKay said he was “truly satisfied that the local council is assisting this important initiative to protect our marine environment.”
  Calling the annual clean-ups a “significant initiative aimed at raising awareness about the importance of environmental conservation”, McKay said he was ""grateful to the volunteers from various communities, all working together towards one goal.”
 ""This initiative is a testament to how working together can make a positive impact on environmental protection,"" he said.
 Saturday morning’s clean-up was supported by Parnis England Trucking, Dr Juice – which provided food and drink for the volunteers – Dive Systems Malta, EZ Creations print studio, Surf Malta Club, Man with a Van Malta, the Environment and Resources Authority (ERA), Transport Malta, Sensi Watersports and St John Rescue Corps.
  Last year, a 100-year-old clay gin bottle, walkie-talkies and coins dating back to the 1970s were just some of the rare finds collected from the seabed in Senglea during the foundation’s seventh annual ocean clean-up.

 BirdLife volunteers witnessed and filmed the incident during an annual Raptor Camp. The NGO said the incident happened after four Ospreys were seen roosting in the Buskett area on Sunday evening. 
 Following the incident, BirdLife Malta called 119 immediately and was informed the Environmental Protection Unit (EPU) were not available. Following a third call, an EPU unit was reached, and details were passed on. The NGO said that it believes neither the bird nor the hunter were located. 
  “The disregard towards the law by hunters that aim at protected birds is encouraged by the lack of enforcement on the islands of Malta and Gozo and is the reason why Malta is facing legal infringement procedures by the European Commission on the matter,” the statement read. 
 BirdLife Malta urged the Malta Police Force to take environmental protection, especially bird protection laws, seriously.

PA to withdraw the policy that allows Marsascala yacht marina,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/pa-withdraw-policy-allows-marsascala-yacht-marina.1091936,21-06-2024,"004928.png,004929.png","The Planning Authority has started the process of withdrawing the policy that allows for the construction of a yacht marina in Marsascala. 
 In a statement on Friday, the PA said that, with the government’s blessing, it will also be revising policies that support the former National Swimming Pool in the locality to be redeveloped for residential or commercial purposes. 
 If this policy change goes through successfully, it will decisively vindicate residents and activists who campaigned tooth and nail to prevent Marsascala Bay from being developed into a commercial marina. 
 In August 2021, Transport Malta published a call for tenders for the construction of a 700-berth marina in Marsascala, immediately triggering a  wave of backlash from residents, who lamented that some of the locality’s most popular bathing spots would be swept up by pontoons. 
 After months of protests and tireless campaigning to stop these plans, Prime Minister Robert Abela announced that the government would be dropping its plans for the marina, on the eve of the 2022 general election. 
 Since then, little has been heard on the state of the marina plans, although residents have previously written to the prime minister asking for local plans to be revised so that the site would no longer be identified as one appropriate for a marina, and solidify the government’s promise to permanently drop the project. 
  The PA explained that currently, the existing policy approved by the 2006 local plan states that the inner part of the Marsascala Bay could “positively consider” proposals for a yacht marina. 
 The policy required there to be several studies carried out before a project could be considered and must be proven to be financially feasible. 
 “With the withdrawal of this policy, the policy commitment towards the yacht marina will be eliminated and the ex-National Swimming Pool will remain a community facility with sports being the primary land use,” the PA said. 
 Those who wish to send comments or feedback on the proposed policy changed are encouraged to do so by sending an email to smlp_consultation@pa.org.mt by June 17, 2024.

 On Saturday, ADPD party chairperson Sandra Gauci said that one of the things Abela claimed he wanted to work on was achieving a balance between tables and chairs for outdoor use and government-owned public spaces.
 “Abela's bluff is clear from the fact that after he said these very words, not only were certain recent illegalities sanctioned, but the platforms for the tables have also increased, and we have continued to witness our public spaces being eaten up,” Gauci said.
 She called for a policy that protects the interests of citizens over those of businesses.
 The party’s public relations officer, Brian Decelis, said any take-up of public land should be done following thorough consultation with residents.
 “In recent months, we have joined residents in various localities, from Valletta to Rabat, Gozo, where we protested the appropriation of space by tables and chairs, which is slowly stifling our public spaces,” he said.
 “We have tried to walk from the Gżira coast to Tignè, and one can barely manage to do so. This problem is also spreading to other locations such as Marsaskala, where the pavements are becoming congested with an increasing number of tables and chairs,” he said.
 The same problem is happening on beaches, where umbrellas and sunbeds are taking over large areas.
 “Even where there are existing permits, businesses are allowed to extend beyond what is authorised, with the approval of the authorities, who turn a blind eye to this blatant misuse,” he said.
 The Green Party also criticised the PN-led Mosta local council’s decision to stop the town’s square from being pedestrianised during the weekend.

PN calls for inquiry into Magħtab incinerator contract process,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/pn-asks-inquiry-maghtab-incinerator-contract-process.1096065,30-07-2024,005235.png,"The Auditor-General has been asked to investigate the process for the granting of a €600 million contract for the waste-to-energy (incinerator) plant in Magħtab.
 A French consortium working in partnership with local firm Bonnici Bros was selected for the Wasteserv contract in October last year, but a court struck down the process in June after finding conflicts of interest by adjudicating boards.
 The PN said it had formally asked the Auditor-General to investigate the process. It said residents of the area were concerned about the goings on in Magħtab and wanted to be sure that proper studies were made before decisions were taken, and that such decisions were not detrimental to them.
 The request for an investigation was made by Darren Carabott, chairman of the House Public Accounts Committee, accompanied by committee members  Graham Bencini and Claudette Buttigieg. The shadow minister for the environment, Rebekah Borg and shadow minister for climate change and public cleanliness,  Eve Borg Bonello, also signed the request. 
 In reaction to the request, WasteServ said on Tuesday that it welcomed the Opposition's calls for an NAO investigation as it will serve as another opportunity to showcase the entity's work on the project. 
 WastesServ said that it adhered to best practices by engaging a leading global engineering firm that, further to that, even engaged a UK-based consultancy firm to independently audit the procurement procedure, including the evaluation of the submitted bids. 
 ""Frith’s report confirmed that the recommended award, and the procurement process, were conducted in a fair, equitable and just manner,"" they said. 
 ""In fact, the Court of Appeal’s judgment did not take issue with the procedure adopted by WasteServ to rank bidders or the scoring issued therein — which was green-lighted by the best international players in the field — but concentrated solely on what it deemed as perceived conflicts of interest related to the Public Contracts Review Board.""
 The entity said that it will now await direction from the NAo and it ready to deliver the full procurement file as soon as it it requested. 
 ""The file, containing 47 individual box files, is still sealed under signatures since the day it was deposited in Court on March 27, 2024,"" they said, adding that it intends to cooperate fully with the NAO.

First colony of invasive Red dwarf honeybee in Europe has been recorded in Malta,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/first-colony-invasive-red-dwarf-honeybee-europe-recorded-malta.1097047,22-08-2024,005380.png,"A conservation NGO has alerted the authorities about an invasive bee - native to southern and southeast Asia - that set up a colony in Malta.
 The discovery spells bad news for the native bee species and the authorities are being urged to prepare effective eradication measures. 
 According to a paper that has just been published in the Journal of Apicultural Research, the first established colony of the Red dwarf honeybee ( Apis florea) to be recorded in Europe was found in Malta.  
 Local beekeeper and administrator of Breeds of Origin Conservancy Thomas Galea made the discovery about 2.5 km off the Birżebbuġa Freeport. 
 Although the colony he found was removed, the researchers believe the species could survive on the island because of its climatic and environmental conditions.
 Therefore, if the colony identified by Galea had already swarmed before being removed, or if there were other unidentified colonies, it is likely that the species will become established in the Maltese Islands.
 The researchers fear its establishment here poses a serious risk to the local natural biodiversity due to competition for resources and habitats, in a territory that harbours numerous endemic species.
 Additionally, the invasive Apis florea is a host to many harmful germs including viruses and parasitic mites.
 As some of these germs are known to switch hosts, the introduction of the species could pose a real threat to the health of Western honey bees (Apis mellifera) and wild bees, the researchers note.
 The researchers have alerted the authorities and the beekeeping community about the threat posed by this alien invasive species and urged them to undertake effective eradication measures.
 A beekeeper told Times of Malta the community was especially worried about the discovery of the alien species, fearing a repetition of the importation of an Italian subspecies from New Zealand that had resulted in ""the  decimation of local populations by disease"".
 The Red dwarf honeybee is usually found in the Asian continent - stretching from the Indomalayan realm on the east to the Persian Gulf on the west.
 However, it is reportedly colonising new territories mainly due to anthropogenic activities such as naval commerce. 
 Among others, it has now also been recorded in Taiwan, Jordan, the Arabian peninsula and north-eastern Africa.

Relaunch of double glazing scheme for Birżebbuġa residents,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/relaunch-double-glazing-scheme-birzebbuga-residents.1092867,22-05-2024,005385.png,"The government has re-launched the double-glazing scheme for residents to replace their old windows with double-glazed ones for better protection from the surrounding noise pollution.
 Funded by the Malta Freeport Corporation as a Corporate Social Responsibility contribution with a value of €300,000, will be administered by the Regulator for Energy and Water Services (REWS).
 Through the scheme, Birżebbuġa residents will have 90% of their material and installation costs, up to a maximum of €2,000 reimbursed by the government. Eligible costs include VAT.
 The re-launch of the scheme was announced on Wednesday by Energy Minister Miriam Dalli and Economy Minister Silvio Schembri.
 This scheme applies to residents of private and residential properties in Birżebbuġa who wish to retrofit their existing apertures with double glazing.
 By participating in this scheme, residents will not only reduce the noise from Freeport's operations but also enhance the sustainability of their homes by improving temperature control.
 Dalli said more than 400 families applied and benefitted from past schemes. 
 ""Initially, the scheme applied to a limited number of roads, but it has now been updated to be open to all areas in Birżebbuġa. This is the second time that the scheme is open to all residents of Birżebbuġa,” she said.
 A similar scheme was launched back in 2019, then Tourism Minister Konrad Mizzi had said Birżebbuġa residents are to be offered a grant of up to €2,000 for double glazing as part of a government drive to reduce the inconvenience of noise pollution from the nearby Freeport.
  She said the scheme will help residents to invest in sustainable solutions to better control building temperatures. 
 She noted that REWS operates additional schemes that support sustainable building investments, including assistance for well restoration, incentives for home reverse osmosis systems, and aid for the installation of photovoltaic panels, among others.
  On his part, Schembri said that in recent years several projects have been carried out to ensure that while the Freeport remains an important commercial port in the Mediterranean, its impact on the surrounding residents is minimised as much as possible.
 The mayor, Scott Camilleri was also present at the press conference.
 Applications will be accepted from Monday, 27 May 2024. The scheme is open until the end of the year 2024, or until the funds are absorbed.
 The guidelines are available on the REWS site: https://www.rews.org.mt/?ts=1716373613327#/en/sdgr/603-2024-double-glazing-scheme-for-bir-ebbu-residents-active.
 Prospective applicants can also call Servizz.Gov on freephone 153 for more information.

 The Environmental Health Directorate said on Saturday that bathing was not recommended off Bugibba square due to possible contamination which could present a risk to bathers’ health. 
 But video footage showed up to 30 people swimming just beyond the warning signs on Sunday.  
  Alex Teoli, who took the video, said he was shocked to see people, including a pregnant woman and a toddler, swimming in the possibly contaminated water. 
 The Directorate said its recommendation would apply until the water quality had been assured through repeat testing.
 The reason for the contamination has not yet been officially specified. 
 In May Balluta Bay was closed after being contaminated with Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Enterococci. The bay remains closed. 
 St George's Bay was briefly closed because of what the prime minister last week said was a fault in the waste system of a nearby hotel. 
 May also saw a section of St Paul's Bay near the government school closed because of a sewage overflow.

 Villa Portelli Gardens in Kalkara, a new space in Wied Inċita, Spencer Garden in Marsa, and Independence Garden in Birżebbuġa will all be opened by the end of 2024, she said.
 The minister was speaking at a press conference held at the Hospice garden alongside Parliamentary Secretary for Public Works Omar Farrugia. This garden, set to open in the coming weeks, will provide a peaceful environment where palliative care patients can meet their families.
 Project Green, the state agency tasked with urban greening projects and which Dalli is responsible for, says it has 118 such projects in the pipeline as part of a €350 million government commitment.
 Of those, 19 are expected to be completed in 2025.
 The Public Works Department also plans to set up 15 additional open spaces in 2025 against an investment of €22 million.
 ""Never before have we had a government that invested in such projects,” Dalli said. She cited examples in Marsascala, where the government intends to turn the former Sant Antnin recycling plant into a public open space, and Pembroke, where a concrete plot is to be turned into an urban garden.
 Farrugia said the Public Works Department would focus on creating spaces that can serve as hubs of activity and life for local communities and is partnering with the University of Malta to plan these spaces.
 “Here lies our responsibility, as a government, to invest in a country where open spaces serve much more than mere beautification; we want these to be socially valuable spaces for everyone’s benefit,” he said.

 The advert, published on Facebook Marketplace, described the room as ""near the sea and fantastic view"" and featured a photo of it, along with a caravan.
 Its listed price was €200, though it was unclear whether that price was per month. 
 The advert was taken down shortly after the Malta Rangers Unit (MRU) flagged it and asked Malta Tourism Authority (MTA) to investigate immediately.
 When Times of Malta contacted the advertiser, they claimed the post was “a joke”.
 But an MRU spokesperson told Times of Malta that they had previously filed a separate report about the caravan included in the advert.
 The caravan was reported to the police in July, after it was illegally placed by the coastline of the Pembroke Natura2000 site.
 An MRU spokesperson said that they feared the Natura2000 site was being exploited for short-let purposes and said they wanted the MTA to establish who owns the room and if they have the necessary permits to rent it out.
 ""We are simply urging the authorities to investigate,"" said an MRU spokesperson. “We are not saying [the room] is illegal, but the caravan they placed there indeed was.”
  As of last year, caravans are only allowed to overnight in permitted areas and require a permit to do so. These permits are issued by local councils for a minimum fee of €5 per day, increasing to €10 per day in designated areas with utility services. 
 The MRU spokesperson said that despite the new law, rangers were still seeing plenty of abuse by caravan owners setting up in places they are not allowed to, on public land.
 ""The greater concern is waste disposal and sewage disposal, since many of the caravans are placed along the coastline in non-permitted areas,"" said the spokesperson.

 In a press conference held on site, residents explained the proposed development breaches planning regulations on the development in UCAs.
 Development in transition zones must not pave the way for such areas to lose their characteristics, the residents argued.
 Plans would see the demolition of a one-storey building to be replaced by a five-floor building above ground and two underground levels.
 One family currently lives in the property where demolition is being proposed to make way for units that would house 22 families.
 “This is a narrow street in the village core that will be negatively impacted by the increased traffic to enter and exit the proposed building,” said resident Saviour Sammut.
 “The proposed development would ruin the entrance to our picturesque village, undermine the streetscape of our village core and destroy the existing traditional arched water reservoir found under the current one-storey building,"" he added.
 He urged the government to protect village cores, pushing for Safi's UCA to be extended until the end of Triq San Pawl, that serves as an entrance to the village.
 Houses built in this area should keep to the design and height of the other buildings and should be complemented with the use of Maltese stone, he said.
 The Planning Authority is set to hear the application on June 5.
  Sammut said this is only one of the changes facing Safi, with another application for 400 new apartments planned for a new area which is currently agricultural and natural land.

Judge revokes Għajnsielem sheep farm permit,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/judge-revokes-ghajnsielem-sheep-farm-permit.1091479,21-06-2024,005449.png,"The Court of Appeal has revoked a permit for a sheep farm in Għajnsielem, upholding the council’s objections that it was within the 200-metre buffer zone from groundwater extraction sources.
 Chief Justice Mark Chetcuti ruled that the Agriculture Advisory Committee had not given its clearance and that the objections of the Environment and Resources Authority had been ignored.
 He was ruling on an appeal filed by the Għajnsielem local council against a decision by the Environment and Planning Review Tribunal to overturn the PA’s refusal for a sheep farm proposed on pristine agricultural land in an area known as Tat-Torri.
 John Vella originally filed the application in June 2019 for structures to be built in the middle of countryside that lies outside the development zone between Triq Qigħan and Triq Qala.
 He was seeking permission to build a new sheep farm with a cheese-making area, underlying tank and cesspits and landscaping to screen the structures.
 In his report, the case officer noted that the proposed development ran counter to planning policies. It also ran counter to Rural Policy and Design Guidelines in terms of distance from a groundwater source, the proposed layout of the farm and the planned waste management.
 The application was refused in July 2022 but this decision was granted on appeal. The same owner had already been granted permits to demolish and rebuild a nearby agricultural room and to add basement storage back in 2018.
 The Għajnsielem council, led by Mayor Kevin Cauchi, appealed this decision, expressing its grave concerns about the proposed development.
 Through lawyer Claire Bonello, the council complained that the original reasons for refusal were because there were breaches of the Rural Policy as the farm lay within 200 metres of groundwater extraction sources and because the Agricultural Advisory Committee had not given its clearance for the said farm.
 The tribunal overturned this refusal, stating that there were similar “commitments” in the vicinity and that only part of the farm lay within the 200-metre groundwater extraction zone.
 The Court of Appeal ruled that the commitments cited by the tribunal were not of the same type or locality and had not been issued under the same legal regime. Moreover, the Rural Policy requirement to maintain the 200-metre buffer zone was an obligatory one and could not be waived at the tribunal’s discretion.
 
 The chief justice also observed how the tribunal had not ordered the applicant to file new plans, which would then be considered by the Planning Authority again but had reversed the decision with a proviso that fresh plans be filed.
 He also noted that the tribunal did not even mention ERA’s objections to the project. The permit was therefore revoked, confirming the PA’s original refusal of the application.

 The Scopoli’s Shearwater seabird died on Wednesday despite the efforts of a conservation volunteer who abseiled down the cliffside to rescue the bird last month. 
 It became entangled in the fishing line, which stretched down around half the height of the cliffs at Miġra l-Ferħa, the Malta Ranger Unit (MRU) said. 
 Footage shows the bird hanging from one wing in midair, rotating slowly and unable to free itself from the fishing line.
  The bird was eventually freed after a member of LIFE PanPuffinus! - part of BirdLife Malta – abseiled down the cliff to retrieve it with guidance from the rangers.  
 Unfortunately, it died on Wednesday after succumbing to an infection brought on by injuries, dehydration and malnutrition, the NGO said. 
 The rangers said it highlighted how important it is for fishers to dispose of fishing lines properly. 
 They were asked to assist finding the Scopoli’s Shearwater after a report was lodged with BirdLife Malta about its plight.
 A two-person team from LIFE PanPuffinus! attended the scene shortly afterwards, with one of the team abseiling down the cliffs to cut the bird free and retrieve it.  
 The BirdLife-led NGO said the bird had been found in “bad shape”, noting it was the third such incident the organisation had encountered recently.  
  Speaking to Times of Malta, a spokesperson for the rangers said the fishing line used for longline fishing had most likely become caught halfway down the cliff after being cut from the top when not needed.  
 “There are loads of similar fishing lines in that area of the cliffs,” the spokesperson said, noting the area was one favoured by longline fishers.  
 “Not all cliffs are a problem, but these are used as a nesting area for Scopoli’s Shearwaters – but for some reason, this has not been acknowledged by authorities,” she said. 
 The spokesperson said that while the ranger unit was not against longline fishing per se, in areas home to the birds such as Miġra l-Ferħa such activities should be regulated to lessen their impact.  
 “At the very least, the lines left there should be cleaned up,” she said.  
 This is not the first time birds have been caught in fishing gear; in 2021, four scopoli’s shearwaters died off the coast of Comino after becoming caught on a fishing line. 
 In 2022, a senior curator at the Natural History Museum said the prospects for the species were “not bright at all,” warning that due to human activities such as killing and urbanisation, it could become extinct from the Maltese islands in less than 50 years. 
 Malta is considered one of the more important sites in the Mediterranean for the Scopoli’s Shearwater.
 Its breeding sites are protected as Natura 2000 sites – a network of protected sites across Europe identified as “core breeding and resting sites for rare and threatened species and some rare natural habitat types"".
 According to the Environment and Resources Authority, the species can be spotted between March and October. It only comes ashore at night during the breeding season, after which it flies out into the Atlantic Ocean along West Africa.

 “I remember when Sliema used to be a place for people to enjoy the seaside in peace,” St Gregory’s parish priest Etienne Sciberras told a meeting on Wednesday. 
 “I am sad to say Sliema has become the opposite of what it used to be. The residents are victims of overdevelopment and over-tourism.""
 Sciberras was addressing residents and the media at a meeting organised by the Flimkien għal Ambjent Aħjar and the Sliema Residents Association about overdevelopment in Gżira, Sliema and St Julian's. 
 He was present alongside Fr Paul Mizzi, the St Julian’s Parish priest. Several priests from parishes in the three localities could not make it to the meeting because they were either ill or had to funerals to attend to.
  Sciberras said Sliema had become an eyesore, as streets are filled with garbage while noisy and indecently dressed tourists walk along the seafront.
 He claimed that when he raised the issue of indecent clothing with the police, he was told that the criminal offence could not be enforced so as not to impact tourism.
 “Sliema needs community police,” he added. 
 Residents have been calling for community policing for years.
 The call was strengthened following violent incidents on the Sliema front, including the murder of  Paulina Dembksa in 2022. 
 That year, the Home Affairs Ministry told Times of Malta that community policing in Sliema would be “envisioned” in 2023. 
 A year on, the promise remains unfulfilled. 
 Speaking to Times of Malta, Sliema mayor John Pillow said he has called for a meeting with the Police Commissioner to discuss the introduction of community policing.
  The meeting touched on numerous topics - from the growing trash problem to noise pollution and overdevelopment.
 Mayors and  residents of the three localities have often voiced concern about heaps of  uncollected garbage in the streets, and how  overdevelopment and traffic issues have impacted them negatively. 
 Both priests said overdevelopment has killed the sense of community and has negative effects on the ageing population.
 “I am all for progress, but I think the brakes (on development) should have been fastened quite a while ago,” Mizzi said. 
 “It’s good to live in a diverse and inclusive country, but aren’t the elderly part of this diversity,” he asked, pointing out how elderly residents struggle to walk outside because of the disastrous quality of the pavements. 
 Mizzi said several parishioners spoke to him about how they were “buried in their own homes” and had no access to light in their homes because of high rises. 
 He also spoke about young children exposed to cannabis smoke, and how people could smell cannabis in public places such as beaches. 
 “It has become difficult to build a community because many people who moved to Sliema are foreigners who come to work and have fun and then leave for another country,” he said. 
 He ended his speech by referring to the Book of Genesis, when God created man as “stewards” on this earth. 
 “We do not own the land, we are here to leave it for the next generation. My question is: what are we leaving for the next generation?”
  Addressing the same meeting, Flimkien Ghal Ambjent Ahjar Astrid Vella said that all politicians and developers cared about was money. 
 “GDP is their God - all they care about is money, not the electorate,” she said.
 She said Malta did not only need high-quality tourists but should generate more intrinsic community values. 
 “Our communities are suffering because of overdevelopment and overtourism,” she said.
 She added that between 2013 and 2024, over 300 permits were issued for hotels in the St Julian's, Sliema and Gżira.

€47m project to develop massive PV power batteries opened to bidders,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/47m-project-develop-massive-pv-power-batteries-opened-bidders.1101717,29-11-2024,005705.png,"A project to build two massive battery storage systems that can capture electricity generated from renewable energy sources is now open to bidders.
 The battery energy storage systems (BESS) will be located in Marsa and Delimara, on Enemalta grounds in both localities.
 First announced in June 2023, the project is being led by Interconnect Malta, an Energy Ministry agency responsible for energy infrastructure projects.
 Batteries will be charged using power fed into the national grid by photovoltaic panels during daytime hours and will then discharge power at nighttime.
 According to the tender document, the Delimara plant must provide a minimum of 64 MWh of power while the Marsa BESS must provide a minimum of 20MWh. The batteries must be Lithium Iron Phosphate ones.
 The Marsa station – which will be located in tunnels of the now-decommissioned power station - will be 100% funded through the EU’s Recovery and Resilience Fund (RRF) with a budget allocation of around €12 million, while that in Delimara is seeking funding under the EU’s ERDF Multi-Annual Financial Framework (MFF) 2021-2027 Programme. The Delimara BESS, located at the power station in the area, is expected to cost €35 million and if its funding bid is successful, up to a maximum of 60% of that cost will be covered.
 Bidders have until February 4, 2025 to submit their offers.
 In a statement announcing the tender, Interconnect Malta said the BESS project would help ensure a more stable and reliable energy supply while making it possible to ramp up the share of renewables in the national energy system.
 “This initiative, alongside developing a second cable interconnection project, will be pivotal in advancing Malta’s energy transition to more RES thus ensuring a more sustainable, resilient energy future,” it said.
 Energy Minister Miriam Dalli described the project as a “pioneering” one that would tackle the intermittency of renewable energy generation.
 “Initiatives such as these are pivotal to allow Malta to progress towards larger-scale renewable energy projects, such as offshore wind,"" the minister said. The government has said it has shortlisted two sites for offshore wind projects, which it would like the private sector to operate.
 Interconnect Malta divisional manager Joseph Vassallo said the BESS project was an important milestone for Malta as it would contribute to modernise its distribution network with the installation of large power-electronic converters connected to Malta’s 33kV system for energy conversion and flexibility services.

Government failing to adequately invest in the future - ADPD,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/government-failing-adequately-invest-future-adpd.1100484,11-02-2024,005791.png,"The government is failing to adequately invest in the future and is wasting taxpayer money on ongoing subsidies, ADPD chair Sandra Gauci said on Saturday. 
 She was reacting to the government's announcement that it would continue funding energy subsidies during the reading of the budget, which were introduced to stave off pressure from the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021. 
 During a press conference in Valletta, Gauci said that the government is failing to provide financial security for future generations if it continues to subsidise energy as national debt continues to mount. 
 ""Borrowing for recurrent expenses and borrowing to spend money to purchase foreign-sourced resources is simply an economic loss for the country,"" Gauci said. 
 ""The Finance Minister has told us that our national debt has gone up another €1 billion, and by the end of 2025 it will be close to €12 billion.""
 This, she said, is more egregious in light of the fact that Malta makes seldom investment in renewable energy.
 ""We have wasted hundreds of millions of euros on roads and flyovers which have not solved any traffic problems.  We have not seen investment in public transport, such as our proposal for a Bus Rapid Transit system, that reserves whole routes on roads for the exclusive passage of public transport.  And in spite of this huge debt, we remain a country heavily dependent on fossil fuels,"" she said. 
 She said that while amendments to income tax brackets may be helpful to low-income earners, the most ideal reform would be to establish a living wage through which all can live in dignity. 
 Given the current levels of debt, Gauci said she expected the government to increase its efforts at collecting unpaid tax and tax reform in other sectors, particularly those who received subsidies during the pandemic and still turned a healthy profit. 
 In light of the ever-growing devastating effects of climate change, Gauci said the government should look to polluting activities to generate more revenue, including closing capital gains tax loopholes and taxing the use of private jets and yachts.  
 ADPD secretary general Ralph Cassar said that while it is positive that the government has slashed energy subsidies, there has been no real leap in quality in the energy sector. 
 ""These massive amounts of blanket subsidies – for sectors which are wasteful, for those who use energy efficiently and those who don’t care alike – means that resources were diverted from the necessary investment in important sectors and from investment in the future,"" Cassar said. 
 ""In spite of the massive debt we have remained one of the laggards in renewable energy in the EU. The truth is that the government has no other choice and must find the money to invest hundreds of millions in renewable sources of energy. We cannot afford to be left behind. We cannot afford to literally burn away money and export money out of the country.”
 Expressing solidarity for the victims of flooding in Spain, Cassar said cataclysmic events such as these are a stark reminder of the importance of moving away from fossil fuels. 
 ""We too have to be prepared for these eventualities, even by investing in the future, to mitigate the effects of climate change. We are already seeing a prolonged period of drought in Malta, other extreme events are a possibility,"" he continued.
 ""Token measures are not enough. This is why we insist that public debt must be reined in. We need sustainable borrowing for investment in the economy of the future, a zero-carbon economy.""

 The health ministry has attributed the Balluta contamination to a stormwater tunnel exiting into the sea in the area. 
 May also saw a section of St Paul's Bay near the government school closed because of a sewage overflow.
 Meanwhile, St George’s Bay in Birżebbuġa was closed for a second time last month after the water became contaminated with sewage following a blockage in a nearby public toilet.

Turtle nest found at Golden Bay,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/turtle-nest-found-golden-bay.1093995,15-06-2024,005980.png,"A turtle nest has been discovered at Golden Bay, Majjistral Park administrators said on Saturday.
 It is the first such nest discovered in 2024 so far.
 The nest was discovered by Nature Trust volunteers during a routine morning patrol. It is not known how many eggs are believed to be in it.
 Volunteers from Nature Trust and the Wildlife Rescue Team will now coordinate to cordon off the area and keep watch of the nest until the eggs hatch. In a statement, the Environment and Resources Authority said it would issue an Emergency Conservation Order for the area. 
 It urged members of the public to act responsibility and avoid excessive noise, trampling and light close to the area. 
 Anyone interested in volunteering to help monitor the nest can contact Nature Trust at turtle.naturetrust@gmail.com. 
 Any observations of turtle activity can be reported to ERA by calling 22923500, Nature Trust on 21313150 or by contacting ERA through its customer care system.
 Golden Bay – a popular sandy beach - falls within the confines of Majjistral Nature Park, a state-protected nature reserve in Malta’s northwest.
  Turtle eggs tend to incubate for up to 70 days before hatching and eggs generally hatch at the same time. Hatchlings then work together to dig out of the nest before making their way to sea.
 They make their way to the sea guided by natural light, using cues such as the reflection of moonlight or the stars in the sea. Artificial light sources can disorient hatchlings and send them in the wrong direction. Once in the sea, they must quickly swim to deeper waters, where they are safer than in shallow seas where predators abound.

"There are no dangerous snakes in Malta, Rangers remind campers",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/there-no-dangerous-snakes-malta-rangers-remind-campers.1096927,19-08-2024,005991.png,"There are no dangerous snakes in Malta, but that did not stop a group of campers in Mellieħa from lighting a fire to ""keep dangerous snakes away"".
 The Malta Ranger Unit (MRU) shared the anecdote as it reminded the public that all snakes in Malta are harmless to humans and that it is illegal to harm them in any way. 
 On Friday, rangers spotted a group camping in Aħrax, Mellieħa. The unit said that while the campers “had done most things correctly, such as keeping the site clean, and litter contained,” they noticed the group had lit a fire close by.
 When asked about the fire, the group said it was to keep ""dangerous snakes away"", the unit said in a post on Facebook.
 After asking the group to put out the fire, the rangers explained there were “no dangerous snakes in Malta,” however, and stressed that indigenous species of snakes in Malta were “strictly protected by law.”
 The MRU said snakes were “very beneficial” for the country’s biodiversity and provided guidance for campers making a fire outside, including checking the legality of a location, elevating the fire and keeping it away from tree canopies.
 Stressing the importance of education in its fight against environmental crimes, the unit said it was focused on discussing such incidents with the public: “Many times, just like in this case, it's a habit or misunderstanding which can easily be solved immediately.""
  The presence – or rather, absence – of venomous snakes in Malta is said to be thanks to Saint Paul, who shipwrecked off the coast of Malta in around 60 AD.
 According to Christian teachings, the saint was bitten by a viper but, to the amazement of locals who witnessed the incident, was not poisoned. 
 After that incident, other serpents on the island are said to have lost their venom and ceased to be a threat to humans – a story which, by the sounds of it, the group of campers in Mellieħa had not heard.
 There are four species of snake native to Malta: the Western Whip Snake, Algerian Whip Snake, Leopard Snake and Cat Snake. All four species are protected by law.
 While the cat snake is venemous, its venom only affects small animals and the species is therefore not dangerous to humans, according to the Environment and Resources Authority.

 The new initiative by environmental NGO BirdLife Malta (BLM) aims to empower citizens to ""counter the government's ongoing finch trapping under the guise of research"". 
 Malta has long come under fire for allowing the trapping of protected finches and in September the European Court of Justice  ruled that the practice is illegal. 
 BLM said the aim of the campaign is to be able to equip the public with the right tools to report the activity, as the government has continued to ""disregard"" the European ruling. 
 The group said it estimates that trappers caught over 51,400 finches last year and they believe that those bird were kept illegally and were not released as they are supposed to under the terms of the supposed research. 
 “Most people are appalled by the idea of a wild bird trapped in a small cage in the name of tradition, let alone under a research pretext that has been declared illegal. True citizen engagement should protect these birds from illegal capture,” BLM CEO Mark Sultana said.
 BLM has mapped all the sites that are authorised for trapping according to the Wild Birds Regulation Unit and made them accessible on Google Maps. 
  With the map and GPS enabled, check if a trapping site is legal.
 If you see nets at a site not marked on the map, it’s likely operating illegally for bird trapping. Take a photo and note the coordinates.
  Only finches with a closed, seamless ring, fitted on a bird during its first days of life, can legally be kept on trapping sites.
 Birds without rings are considered of wild origin and are illegal to keep. If you see nets catching birds, observe if they are released or being pocketed away to a room or a vehicle.
 When possible, capture photos, videos, and coordinates.
  Trappers must disable or cover nets when not present.
 If you see exposed, unattended nets, they may endanger other wildlife such as snakes, hedgehogs and other birds.
 If you see a registered trapping site with nets left exposed and unattended, take a photo and note the location.
  Report any of the above with photos, videos and coordinates to:

 The survey, conducted by the European Investment Bank, found that almost all of the respondents in Malta recognised the need to adapt their lifestyle due to the effects of climate change. Almost all believed that investing in adaptation now would prevent higher costs in the future.
 “Investing in climate adaptation should be a top priority for all countries, especially island nations. I’m encouraged to see that the Maltese people clearly understand the urgency of climate change. We at the EIB Group are dedicated to supporting Malta by offering both funding and expertise to help adapt its infrastructure and economy. By acting now, we can safeguard communities, create jobs and ensure a more resilient and prosperous future for all,” said EIB Vice-President Kyriacos Kakouris.
 24,000 respondents from across the European Union and the United States took part in the survey, including 500 in Malta. 
 Maltese respondents ranked climate change second on the list of challenges that their country is facing.
 The bank said Maltese respondents recognised the economic opportunities that climate change adaptation measures present, while first-hand experiences of extreme weather events add to the sense that urgent action is required:
 ""The respondents from Malta stand out from those in other EU Member States for their strong awareness of the need to adapt to climate change,"" the report says.
  The vast majority of Maltese respondents – 91%, 21 points above the EU average – felt they were informed about what they can do to adapt their homes and lifestyles effectively. Most of them – 82%, 42 points above the EU average of 40% – were also aware of existing public subsidies or financial incentives to support adaptation efforts.
 Maltese respondents identified the following key priorities for local climate adaptation:
 When asked who should pay for climate change adaptations:
 38% felt that the companies and industries that contribute most to climate change should bear the costs. 30% felt everyone should pay equally. 15% – 7 points above the EU average – said that insurance companies should contribute.
 When asked who should benefit first from adaptation spending:
 Concerns about who should benefit from adaptation aid went beyond national priorities. Most Maltese respondents – 90%, 33 points above the EU average of 57% – recognised the need to support global adaptation efforts and believed that their country should do more to help the most vulnerable developing nations adapt to the growing impact of climate change.

Watch: A farmer’s fight to preserve century-old legacy in Marsa,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/watch-a-farmer-fight-preserve-centuryold-legacy-marsa.1096284,08-10-2024,"006113.png,006114.png,006115.png","Joanne Micallef traded her long sales career for a return to her roots, taking up the mantle of farmer in her family’s century-old agricultural tradition.
 And despite the onslaught of industrial development in Marsa, she has no plans to abandon the farm that has been in her family since 1908.
 Joanne of Ta’ Lazzru Farms fondly remembers growing up on the land that she now tends to.
 “Some of my earliest memories involve helping my dad work on our little spot of heaven,” she reminisces, as she surveys her blooming fruit trees and rows of kale and tomatoes.
 But just a few metres from the richly packed fields, imposing buildings tower over her, with factories mushrooming throughout the years.
  
 The two closest factories to the farm are located less than 200 metres away and the busy Marsa Road is just 100 metres or so away. Still, Micallef maintains that her land is still fertile and productive.
 Micallef and her daughter, Rhiannon, run the business by themselves, and Ta’ Lazzru has created a solid social media presence, and thanks to that, as well as word of mouth, they have managed to generate a solid customer base.
 “People come back repeatedly, and they recommend us to their friends as well. Which goes to show how good the land is,” Micallef said.
 Micallef’s passion for farming began at a very young age but she only started professional farming after the pandemic and the death of her father.
 Before taking on the farm, she worked in sales and marketing for decades and is now applying those skills to her new career.
 While Micallef works in the fields and handles sales, her daughter manages the marketing and business operations. Her daughter also hopes to take over the farm when, and if, her mother ever retires.
 With her daughter’s encouragement, Micallef has begun diversifying her business approach. Apart from selling her fruit and vegetables, the farm also created its own products like olive oil, peanut butter and olives.
 Determined to see these traditions live on beyond their farm, Ta’ Lazzru has started organising workshops, called ‘HerHarvest’, teaching women on site how to grow their produce using traditional techniques.
 But like any other farm in Malta, the produce cannot be classified as organic.
 “People are obsessed with food being organic, but local produce cannot be organic as you need to have a certain amount of distance from cars, which is impossible to implement in Malta given our size,” Micallef said.
 Given the farm’s central location, for generations her family had to fight to prevent their land being taken away from them, even landing in a court dispute in the 1990s.
  As a result, Micallef has become more determined than ever to safeguard her family’s land, produce and legacy.
 “My forefathers had to fight for our land and now it is my turn,” Micallef said.
 And even though the work is gruelling and she has almost no help, the thought of selling the land does not cross her mind because she is too busy living her childhood dream.
 “When I was a little girl, I was always told to help my mother in the house. But I would find a way to sneak out and help my father in the fields instead.”
 
 As she walks from her peach trees to her fig trees, Micallef says she has no plans of quitting, but nonetheless understands why others might give up on farming or not attempt it at all.
 “It is not easy having to work in the blistering sun for long hours at a time with the possibility of little return. People don’t understand the effort required for this job. You invest so much time, and we don’t get paid for it,” she said.
 Micallef says the biggest competition is the foreign suppliers who sell in supermarkets, not fellow local farmers.
 Earlier this year, a number of local farmers gathered with their tractors to protest EU rules they say created an unfair playing field for local products as they face competition from imported foods.
 
 Micallef did not participate in the protest as she sees herself as a lone wolf in the farming community, so much so that she does not even rely on the farmers’ wholesale vegetable market (il-Pitkalija) for her sales. 
 “I am not a normal farmer, I’m a modern farmer. My daughter and I are trying to keep our traditions alive but we are doing it just a little differently.”

 With a population of over 14,000, San Ġwann was slapped with 523 fines, Msida had 502 fines, and Sliema received 364 fines. 
 The figures are for the period January 2023, when a new national garbage collection schedule was introduced, and April 19, 2024.
 In total, over 5,787 people were fined during this period, according to information provided by Home Affairs Minister Byron Camilleri in reply to a parliamentary question by Nationalist MP Albert Buttigieg.
 
 Camilleri said the contraventions were issued by the police and Local Enforcement System Agency (LESA) officials and through the use of camera footage.
 To tackle Malta’s garbage crisis, a new national waste collection schedule came into force last year along with the introduction of fines for not separating waste correctly.
 Anyone caught depositing waste in the wrong waste bags is liable to fines of up to €150 and people caught taking out waste bags on the wrong day can be slapped with a separate fine of €150.
 For years, residents across the islands have complained about smelly and uncollected garbage bags strewn in their streets, a problem worsened with the arrival of tourists in the summer months.
 While different local councils have raised their concerns that a ‘one size fits all’ mentality for garbage collection does not work, earlier this year Wasteserv recorded the “best year in Malta’s waste management” with fewer bags collected than ever and a record 20,000 tonnes of recyclable material collected.
 Last year, Sliema residents even took to the streets to protest and demand action for their hometown which they said has become a “filthy, buzzing, concrete metropolitan”.
 Another locality which had a high number of fines was Marsascala, where a total of 314 fines were issued. Two other large localities Ħamrun (302) and Mellieħa (245) also saw a high number of littering fines.
 In comparison, Ta’ Xbiex only had 28 fines and Iklin had six, Vittoriosa, seven, and Mdina, eight. The capital city, Valletta, had 46 fines.
 According to the figures, the locality in Gozo with the highest number of fines is Żebbuġ, 146, followed by Xagħra with 23 reported fines. Munxar comes in third, with just 20 fines.
 Gozo’s capital, Victoria, has just nine fines. Two people were fined in Għajnsielem and three in Xewkija.
 Organic waste bags are collected on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays while black bags are collected on Tuesdays and Saturdays. Grey or green bags for recyclable materials are collected every Thursday.
 Glass is collected on the first and third Friday of the month.

 The smoke, generated by fires sweeping through the vast wilderness of western Canada reached Malta after travelling more than 7,500 km.
 The Met Office captured satellite images of the smoke over Malta in recent days, “with the clearest instances of smoke appearing yesterday [Monday],” it said.
 The popular Maltese Islands Weather Facebook page first brought the smoke to public attention, saying Tuesday it had been carried from Canada by ""several storm systems across the Atlantic, northern Europe and finally the Mediterranean.""
 The page said the presence of the smoke ""serves as a reminder that all that happens in any part of the world, no matter how isolated, eventually affects each and every one of us.”
  On Friday, thousands of residents who had been forced to evacuate Jasper, a tourist town in western Canada partly destroyed by a massive wildfire, were able to return home, authorities said.
 More than 25,000 residents and tourists had been forced to flee the area three weeks ago as fires intensified, outpacing firefighters' capabilities.
 The fire, sparked by lightning strikes in the drought-stricken area, destroyed more than 350 of the 1,100 buildings in the town, which is home to some 5,000 people.
 As of Thursday evening, the fire was estimated to be 54 square km in size, the biggest in a century to hit vast Jasper National Park, which attracts some 2.5 million tourists a year.
 The fire could burn for months more, authorities have warned, scorching a region known as one of Canada's natural gems, which is famed for its scenic mountains, lakes, waterfalls and glaciers.
 Returning has proven difficult for some residents, who came home to discover their town scarred and defaced.
  ""As you enter into the town and see the fire residue, and everything around it, that is when it becomes emotional,"" Clara Adriano, whose business was destroyed, told public broadcaster CBC.
 In total there are 104 active fires in the province of Alberta.
 Canada's western region has been hard-hit by wildfires this summer.
 Repeated heat waves and dry conditions, both likely linked to global climate change, are believed to be key factors, scientists say.
 The fires come almost exactly one year after similar infernos swept through western Canada, forcing continued evacuations in British Columbia.

Watch: Climate change poses ‘alarming’ challenges to winemakers,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/watch-climate-change-poses-alarming-challenges-winemakers.1097587,09-04-2024,"006359.png,006360.png","As Malta’s wine harvest comes to an early close, the island’s most awarded winemaker has raised concerns about the future of the industry, warning that climate change could lead to both reduced wine production and higher prices.
 The Delicata family, renowned for their contributions to Maltese viniculture since 1907, has observed alarming changes in the local climate.
 George Delicata, the company’s director, and his son, Matthew have noted a significant decline in rainfall, which is posing serious challenges for local winemakers.
 “This year, our production dropped by 40 per cent,” Delicata stated, “which means our wines will now be released as limited editions.”
  They warn that Malta’s lack of rainfall is pushing the country towards a desert-like climate. According to National Geographic, a place receiving less than 25 centimetres of rain annually is considered a desert. This year, Malta received below that amount, Delicata explained.
 The Malta Meteorological Office confirmed that the total rainfall from September 2023 to the end of August 2024 was 24.98 centimetres.
 A spokesperson for the Met Office said: “While a desert is officially described as ‘an area with annual precipitation less than 250mm’ this statement must be true for a long-term period for an area to be classified as a desert.”
 Climate change, however, is not the only issue threatening the industry. Delicata also highlighted the difficulties posed by land use in Malta. “One of the major problems is that those who want to work in viniculture often don’t have access to land while those who do own agricultural land aren’t using it,” he said.
 He said all arable land in Malta should be productive, emphasising that government-owned land designated for farming should be handed over to those willing to use it effectively.
 “Why should they keep it if there’s an industry crying out for it,” Delicata asked, underscoring the need for more proactive policies to support the sector. The family argues that viniculture could thrive locally, requiring an area equivalent to Valletta, and notes that vines not only contribute to soil stability but are also aesthetically pleasing.
 The Delicatas want the Maltese government to develop a comprehensive plan tailored to Malta’s unique conditions rather than adopting an EU-style one-size-fits-all approach.
 “We can’t have a one-size-fits-all policy,” Delicata emphasised, pointing out that the Irish market, with its 80 inches of rain annually, faces challenges that are vastly different from those in Malta.
 As the next generation prepares to take over the business, they approach the future with caution. “I want to leave the business in a better place than when I got it,” Delicata senior said, while Matthew Delicata expressed concern about the industry’s future without clear solutions in place.

 Agius waded into clear waters at Mellieħa’s Għadira Bay shortly after 9am, as a crowd of supporters and well-wishers looked on and cheered.
 He swam out of the bay accompanied by a squad of young swimmers and a team of support crew that included skippers, medical staff, and other volunteers.
 From there, he headed southeast. Agius intends to swim clockwise around Malta and Gozo. The route around the entire archipelago is around 100 km, but Agius plans to swim further 60km to cover a total distance of 160km.
 Agius expects the challenge, dubbed the 'Small Island, Big Swim', to take him three days to complete. He will eat and drink every 30 minutes while remaining in the water at all times. He is forbidden from making physical contact with any of the support boats that will follow him as he swims.
 Agius’ progress is being tracked and displayed online in real-time using a GPS tracker. As of 11.45am, he was approaching the coast of Qawra. 
 If successful, he will break the current world record for the longest non-stop, unassisted, current neutral sea swim.
 Agius set that record himself when he swam 125.7km from Linosa to Malta in 2021.
 This is Agius’ first attempt at breaking the record after he was forced to abandon a similar swim in Spain last year. 
 Inclement weather threatened to disrupt his plans this year too, but Agius' teams opted to go ahead with the swim after consulting weather analysts.
 Agius is using the swim to raise awareness about the state of Malta’s marine habitat aiming to raise awareness about critical environmental issues and inspire a collective commitment to protecting the Mediterranean Sea.
 To mark the event, three clean-up events are being held across the weekend in collaboration with NGO Wave of Change and marine clean-up specialists Żibel: a Saturday morning clean-up at Spinola Bay, a Sunday morning (10am) clean-up at St Thomas Bay, Marsascala and a Sunday afternoon (3pm) clean-up at Ġnejna Bay, Mġarr.
 Members of the public can register their interest  in attending the clean-ups  here and they will be informed by email once the location and times are confirmed.
 Spaces are limited to 50 people per clean-up, so the public are being encouraged to register their interest as soon as possible and join in.
 Harnessing ‘The Ocean Mindset’ 
 Central to Agius’ preparation has been his self-developed ‘Ocean Mindset’ technique — a mental framework that complements his intense physical training.
 Agius says that mindset helps him stay mentally sharp, navigate challenges, and confront the unexpected obstacles that come with this kind of world-first attempt. 
 GO, which is sponsoring Agius in his attempt to smash the record books, has said that it intends to offer 'Ocean Mindset' training to all its staff to help them manage stress, communicate more effectively and take care of their wellbeing.
 Agius' swim is also supported by VisitMalta, Atlas Insurance and Cisk 0.0, as well as Kia, Garmin and Maypole.

Climate change will hit Malta hard. Here is what we can do,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/climate-change-hit-malta-hard-here.1097500,09-07-2024,006510.png,"Malta should plant more trees and replace concrete with soil to help cool down the country, according to a senior lecturer at the University of Malta. 
 UoM Islands and Small States Institute director Stefano Moncada thinks that rather than immediately turning to “expensive engineering solutions,” Malta should first consider nature-based alternatives.
 “We can take solutions from nature: adding more trees can bring down the temperature... even one or two degrees [Celsius] can make a difference. This is often underestimated,” he said. 
 Moncada was speaking to Times of Malta alongside other experts just days after a landmark study suggested rising temperatures would have deadlier consequences in Malta than in any other European country.
 The study found that with temperature rises of 3˚C – in line with current climate predictions – Malta would suffer 95 more yearly heat-related deaths per 100,000 people than at present, the highest in the EU.
 Stressing the importance of “nature-based solutions,” Moncada said that for now, such answers appeared to be largely ignored however.
 “Excessive pruning of the country’s trees shows there is no awareness of green solutions to bring down temperatures... in urban areas we underestimate the importance of such measures.” 
 He said swapping concrete for soil could also prove effective, noting the “thermal exchange” – the absorption of heat into the soil – would help to cool the air temperature. “It’s a win-win; it’s cost-effective, and effective,” he said. 
 Calling small islands such as Malta “more vulnerable” to climate change, highlighting their heightened exposure to changing environmental conditions but with less economic clout to tackle them, Moncada stressed the urgency of tackling the issue head-on. 
 Pointing to improving building standards to better deal with sun exposure, for example, he said the country had studied but not implemented such changes: “We need to do this immediately.”
 Environmental changes were occurring already “and will only get more severe,” he warned.
 Moncada also thinks the country should consider “behavioural changes”, something climate change expert Simone Borg agrees with. 
 Both think the country should restrict outdoor work in higher temperatures, with Borg noting that Australia, for example, had already banned outdoor work in temperatures exceeding 28˚C.
 Calling workers operating in high temperatures “concerning”, she said there will “probably need to be a change in working hours outside” in Malta, too – a move Moncada stressed would need “the private and public sectors and social partners to be onboard” to achieve.
  On greenifying Malta’s urban spaces, Borg – a law expert on natural resources, climate change and ocean governance – agreed, describing it as becoming “more and more crucial... every tree is precious.”
 Asked if current measures were sufficient to tackle climate change, she said: “enough is never enough.”
 While rising temperatures pose a risk across the board, elderly residents face additional challenges and extra steps should be taken to help them, according to consultant geriatrician Peter Ferry. 
 “Ageing reduces the capacity of our body to adjust,” he said, likening ageing to reduced battery life over time. 
 And higher temperatures coupled with medication use also present challenges. 
 “Antidepressants can cause excessive sweating, leading to more fluid loss. And we know that older adults drink less water anyway because, as we age, we have less of a thirst mechanism,” said Ferry.
 Meanwhile, vasodilators – used to treat high blood pressure – could lower blood pressure more than intended, which coupled with low blood pressure due to higher temperatures, could cause patients to lose consciousness, he said. 
 “Many older people go to A&E with heat-related falls and often with more serious consequences... We need to prepare for the hot season and be aware that some drugs should be reduced during the summer.”
 And Ferry also believes we should “rethink our attitude to cooling.” 
 Stressing that many elderly people continue to see air conditioning as “a luxury”, choosing instead to rely on fans and open windows instead, he said elderly patients should not be averse to the technology. 
 “I had a patient recently doing very well in hospital but collapsed at home as he didn’t have air conditioning. That changed, and he’s been doing well since; often we overlook the environment that old people are in.”
 
 Meanwhile, museum consultant Sandro Debono thinks institutions have a role to play in educating the public on climate change. 
 “Knowledge is an important thing... it’s important to promote a culture of climate change awareness,” he said. 
 He said other institutions could learn from steps taken by museums, including charging visitors to offset carbon emissions from carbon-intensive activities such as, in the case of museums, moving exhibitions around the world.
 And he thinks that, because of the variety of buildings inhabited by museums, they have something to teach about energy efficiency and novel ways of cooling – including some from the past.
 “Some buildings in Valletta have passive control systems, such as chimneys built inside the walls to extract heat... we’ve become so reliant on modern technology, we forget there were other solutions in the past,” he said.
 “Otherwise, we rely on air conditioning, which further places strains on the grid – which is collapsing at the moment.”
 But Debono is optimistic: “There’s a sense of hope, that there is something we can do about it; it’s not all doom and gloom.”

Local council plans petition on quarry generating heaps of dust,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/local-council-plans-petition-quarry-generating-heaps-dust.1096355,08-07-2024,006534.png,"The Rabat local council will be discussing starting a petition to stop a quarry from bellowing out dust to the inconvenience of residents.
 Over the past years, the quarry, located in the Santa Katerina area, within the limits of Rabat, was used to store construction material. A giant mountain of this construction material formed over the years, visible from the surrounding areas.
 Residents have long been complaining that, apart from creating an eyesore, their homes get engulfed in dust on windy days, said Rabat mayor Sandro Craus.
 “We have reached the limit now. It seems to be expanding and, every time there is some wind, the dust gets blown into people’s homes. Residents have long been complaining about the air quality and about the constant trucks passing by,” he said.
 The local council is expected to discuss starting a petition at its next meeting scheduled for tomorrow. The petition will aim to pressure the authorities into stopping any irregularities and minimising dust and pollution.
 Craus said the local council is already in contact with the Planning Authority and the Environment and Resources Authority to try to solve the problem.
 Paul Falzon, owner of Tlata Limited that owns the quarry, said the quarry was used to recycle construction material. Stones and debris from demolished buildings were taken there and cut into smaller pieces or crushed to be reused.
 He said the mound of material will be “cut and removed”, adding that the company also made sure to wet the area daily to contain the dust. Furthermore, the company was working on restoring the quarry, Falzon noted.
 Questions sent to the Environment and Resources Authority asking what concrete action was being taken and whether there were illegalities remained unanswered.
 This was not the first quarry to cause this type of inconvenience to residents.
 Times of Malta reported last month how dust from a gigantic pile of construction sand stored at the Attard Wied Inċita quarry was being blown over neighbouring areas causing “great inconvenience” to residents of Attard and Żebbuġ.
 Quarry owner Michael Bugeja took action by removing the sand that had to be temporarily placed on higher ground.

Minister promises talks over Victoria St George's Square controversy,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/minister-promises-talks-victoria-st-george-square-controversy.1094137,19-06-2024,"006560.png,006561.png","The authorities will be holding talks with all parties involved ahead of updating the masterplan for Piazza San Ġorġ in Victoria, the minister responsible for lands, Stefan Zrinzo Azzopardi, told parliament.
 The square, opposite St George's basilica in the heart of Gozo's capital, has been in the headlines, with the archpriest and NGOs protesting that bar owners have 'buried' the church under huge sunshades, tables and chairs erected on the square.
 A public protest was held on Saturday, and the archpriest has complained that funerals are being hindered and young couples are opting not to hold marriages at the basilica, despite wishing to do so. 
 Zrinzo Azzopardi was speaking during a debate on the estimates of the Lands Authority.
 He said a balance needed to be struck between the public interest and operators in the square.
 Talks would be held with all interested parties under the auspices of the Malta Tourism Authroity to address the issue of tables and chairs so that everyone would understand the limitations that existed and what needed to be done to strike a balance, the minister said.
 The process will be coordinated with the Lands Authority and the police with a view to also resolving similar situations elsewhere in the country, the minister said.

Watch: Farmer fears landslide as illegal quarry backfill grows higher,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/watch-farmer-fears-landslide-illegal-quarry-backfill-grows-higher.1097200,25-08-2024,"006821.png,006822.png","A quarry that has been illegally backfilled to several storeys high is posing a “very dangerous situation” for a neighbouring farmer, who fears that falling boulders or a landslide could cause serious injury and damage to his property.
 Over recent years, Angelo Giordmaina’s farm in the Lunzjata area of Rabat has been increasingly encroached upon by the adjacent quarry.
 According to Giordmaina, 63, the backfilled quarry reached ground level about four years ago, but since then, it has continued to rise ever higher.
 In the past five months alone, the “rubble mountain” next to the farm’s boundary wall has doubled in size, heightening Giordmaina’s concerns.
  “The danger here is a matter of life and death. A boulder could roll down and hit me, or the entire mass of rubble could come crashing down in a landslide,” he warned.
 Architect Godwin Abela, who surveyed the area in July, prepared a report urging immediate action.
 “To avoid potential tragedy, all activities at the quarry site must be stopped without further delay, as they are creating a very dangerous situation to the underlying properties,” Abela stated in his report.
 He further recommended the immediate removal of the existing rubble mountain, noting that the situation could be exacerbated by heavy rains, potentially leading to a landslide.
  During a visit to the farm by the Times of Malta, Giordmaina highlighted another big problem: dust.
 “When there’s a south-westerly wind, dust blows all over the farm, turning even the trees white. I have to rinse them off with a water hose almost daily,” he said.
 Giordmaina’s farm suffered damage last year when a landslide, triggered by a storm, destroyed the boundary wall and buried several trees in the process. A retiree, Giordmaina has deep roots in the Rabat farm, having known it since he was a small boy.
 “I’ve been here almost since I was born. I remember being here with my mother and father,” he reminisced.
 Now retired, though he still cultivates vegetables on his farm, Giordmaina spends all his days on the farm.
 “I arrive here early in the morning and stay until it gets dark... I practically live here. I don’t go anywhere else.”
 He lodged complaints about the illegal works with the Environmental Resources Authority and also filed police reports.
  But the owner continues disregarding enforcement notices and stop-work orders issued by two authorities, he said.
 Two active enforcement notices from the Planning Authority (PA) date back to 2005 and 2009, respectively.
 In April 2019, Tlata Ltd, led by quarry owner Paul Falzon, applied for a PA permit to “backfill the existing quarry, construct a concrete batching plant, and establish a concrete block manufacturing plant.”
 The application was refused, but the backfilling continued regardless.
 In the same month, the Environmental and Resources Authority issued a stop-work order against Tlata Ltd.
 Replies to a parliamentary question last year revealed that the company had been subjected to daily fines as a result. Environment Minister Miriam Dalli informed opposition MP Ian Vassallo that in September 2019, the ERA had refused another request by the applicant to backfill the quarry.
 Contacted by the Times of Malta, Falzon defended his actions.
 “We are backfilling the quarry to restore the area to its original state,” he said.
 He claimed the company is providing a valuable service by offering a place for people to dispose of construction waste.
 “MEPA [the PA] and ERA should thank us because there are no other places to deposit waste. They should be paying us,” Falzon argued.
 Repeatedly questioned about the illegality of the operation, Falzon responded: “that’s what you say.”
 Times of Malta also contacted ERA to see whether the authority is taking any further action.

Msida roundabout floods as area hit by ‘atmospheric tsunami’,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/msida-roundabout-floods-area-hit-atmospheric-tsunami.1093919,14-06-2024,006827.png,"Flooding in Msida on Thursday was caused by a phenomenon known as an “atmospheric tsunami”, according to scientists.
 The roundabout surrounding the Workers’ Memorial monument was flooded with seawater yesterday, leading some social media users to question where the water had come from.
 Photos and videos posted online showed vehicles passing through the flooding at the busy intersection, with water rising several inches above the road by midday. One social media user called the sight “weird, like the sea went up to the streets”.
 
 But, according to scientists from the University of Malta, the water was the result of a phenomenon known as a “meteotsunami”, or “atmospheric tsunami”.
 The phenomenon occurs when changes in atmospheric pressure cause the sea level to rise or fall, with higher atmospheric pressure leading to lower sea levels, and vice versa.
  “Think of atmospheric pressure like a hand pressing down on the sea,” explained Dr Anthony Galea, a senior lecturer at the University of Malta’s geosciences department.
 “If the atmospheric pressure is greater, it pushes the water down more; when there is less pressure, the sea level rises,” he said.
 Pointing to readings collected by instruments measuring atmospheric pressure in Msida and Mgarr, in Gozo, Galea noted the country had been experiencing fluctuating pressure levels since Wednesday night. And this, he said, had led to rising and falling sea levels.
 Asked if the flooding was the result of a coastal seiche, or milgħuba - a similar phenomenon which has occurred in Msida and other areas of the country before – the lecturer said he did not think so.
 He explained that while seiches tend to be in response to large pressure changes elsewhere – for example, a storm elsewhere in the Mediterranean – and feature sea levels that either rise or fall before returning to their original state, meteotsunamis are more variable, fluctuating over time in response to constantly changing pressure levels.
 But Galea stressed that while the phenomenon might have the word “tsunami” in the title, it shouldn’t be confused with the towering walls of water favoured by Hollywood blockbusters.
 Commenting on the situation in Msida “and other localities”, the University of Malta Oceanography Malta Research Group – of which Galea is a member – said in a Facebook post it had detected the meteotsunami using “cutting-edge sea level radars and atmospheric sensors” along the coast.
 “You might not have felt it but you could definitely see it,” the group said of the phenomenon.
 And while the phenomenon might have provoked curiosity, residents could be grateful the flooding had not been more severe; last summer, at least two vehicles were dragged into the sea after seiche waves caused the sea level to rise in many coastal areas.

Mapped: Whatever happened to all Project Green’s plans?,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/mapped-whatever-happened-project-green-plans.1097535,09-04-2024,006889.png,"Project Green, set up to great fanfare a little over 18 months ago and armed with a €700 million kitty, promised to bring “green recreational spaces a short walk from home”.
 But it has since faced accusations of greenwashing, with several of its landmark projects stuck in the limbo of planning and procurement red tape, with other completed projects sometimes going under the radar, leading many to wonder when the promised green spaces will materialise.
 On Sunday, Times of Malta reported how plans to build underground tunnels to divert traffic away at Floriana are  ""not feasible"" while a similar plan for San Ġwann is being reassesed.  
 Project Green say that they have their hands full, with some 90 projects on the go, all “slated for implementation between 2025 and 2027”. This, the agency says, is in addition to the 14 projects it has already opened to the public.
 
 But these 14 completed projects include some that were inaugurated before Project Green even existed, such as Kalkara's Ġnien ir-Rnella, opened in October 2022, three months before the agency's launch.
 Others, such as Żabbar's San Klement Park and the Bengħajsa family park were inaugurated just weeks after Project Green's launch.
 A Project Green spokesperson told Times of Malta that the agency will be finishing works on seven projects between now and the end of the year, including works at Independence Gardens in Birżebbuġa, the gardens of Villa Portelli in Kalkara, and the St Michael Hospice garden in Santa Venera.
 Meanwhile, the agency says it plans to complete another 25 projects next year and will kick off complex procurement procedures for slower-burn projects like the long-touted Santa Venera roof garden.
 
 But let’s take a look at where some of the most widely touted projects announced by the agency are at.
 One of the first projects announced by the agency at its launch in January 2023, work on the project has yet to get off the ground, although plans have long since been drawn up.
 A planning application (PA/00199/24) for the first phase of the project, comprising a car park and open space at Misraħ Lewża, was submitted just over a year ago, in August 2023.
 The project’s architects suspended the application shortly afterwards, after public entities vetting the application required more detailed study on some aspects of the proposal, such as an electrical load breakdown.
 Project Green say that the requirements put forward by the PA “required further investigations that could not be completed within the short timeframes stipulated by the PA”, forcing them to put the application on hold while this work was carried out.
 Meanwhile, initial plans to dig a tunnel under the road appear to be hanging by a thread, with the agency having carried out a traffic impact assessment to find alternative solutions.
 A Project Green spokesperson said that the agency will be unfreezing the application and proceeding with the permit process “in the coming days”, with the first phase of the project completed by September 2026, and the full project done by the end of 2028.
 The plan to transform the former ELC nursery into a public park was announced this April, with Robert Abela promising that works would be completed “within a few months”.
 By that point, a planning application (PA/02228/24) for the site had already been submitted a month earlier.
 Project Green say that they expect the first stage of the project, roughly 20,000 square metres of open space, to be opened to the public by this November.
 This project, announced back in 2019 has faced several false dawns (and budget increases) over the years.
 Project Green now say that the project is being “enhanced further” and that a new proposal “that now also includes retail spaces underneath the green open space” is ready.
 But this is a particularly tricky project, with a tunnel which is unique in Malta and requires foreign expertise in tunnel engineering.
 The project’s permit application is being drawn up and should be submitted by the end of the year, with the project finally getting off the ground in 2026, Project Green say.
 
 A project to transform the Adelaide Cini Institute into a new hospice centre has been underway for several years, with plans first submitted in mid-2018 and approved a year later.
 Some 2,700 square metres of the site will be turned into a green space, funded through Project Green’s community greening grant.
 Project Green say that the project’s implementation is underway and will be completed by the end of this year.

Flamingo joins swimmers in Gozo's Ramla Bay,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/flamingo-joins-swimmers-gozo-ramla-bay.1096696,13-08-2024,"006895.png,006896.png,006897.png","Swimmers at a beach in Gozo have been joined by a greater flamingo, which ""happily paddled"" among them. 
 James Murray Curtis was one of the beachgoers who shared Ramla Bay with the protected bird when it flew into the shallow waters on Tuesday morning.  
 “I had seen flamingos before locally and abroad, but I was not expecting to see one at Ramla Bay in the middle of August,” he told Times of Malta. 
 Curtis said the juvenile bird first flew into the shallow waters at around 9.30 am, and people were initially unsure what bird it was due to its natural white and grey colour.
  “Once people realised it was a flamingo, they became excited and tried to get closer to it to take a picture, and it flew off,"" he said.
 But a few moments later the bird returned to the water and remained ""happily paddling"" in the shallow water. 
 “It remained there for another 10 minutes before eventually flying off again,” he said, adding that the bird flew in the direction of the Marsovin estate in the valley.
 A BirdLife Malta spokesperson said the bird was rescued from the sea off Comino by ERA members and Environment Protection Unit (EPU) police.
 “The bird is a juvenile one, only a few months old. We expect them at this time of year as flocks of flamingoes transit from one lagoon to another in the Mediterranean towards the end of their breeding season,” he told Times of Malta. 
 He said such juveniles are weak and struggle to keep up with their parent flock, so land to rest. 
 “In this case, vets check on the birds and then they are passed over to rehabilitation with us, where we ensure they gather enough strength to be eventually released and join a flock of flamingoes in due time.”
  Flamingoes are no strangers to the island and are often spotted migrating throughout the summer months. 
 But it is not always good news for flamingos who make an easy target for shooters. 
 Last year, a young greater flamingo was shot in front of tourists at Xwejni in Gozo. The shooter was seen getting into a car and taking the flamingo with him.
 A poacher who shot down four flamingoes in 2021 was spared jail by a court of appeal last year. It ruled that the protected species was not endangered. 
 In June, the Malta Ranger Unit spent the night guarding a flamingo spotted in Gozo.
 In April, an adult Greater Flamingo spent several days resting at the Salina Nature Reserve and was being observed by NGO Birdlife Malta. The bird was carrying a colour ring, helping BirdLife Malta trace the flamingo back to Spain. It also discovered that the bird was likely to be almost 26 years old. 
  Back in 2019, BirdLife released two Greater Flamingoes into its Għadira Nature Reserve. One of the birds was rescued after it landed at  Għadira Bay.

Electric vehicle subsidies not guaranteed next year,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/electric-vehicle-subsidies-guaranteed-next-year.1098131,16-09-2024,007103.png,"The Association of Car Importers Malta (ACIM) has not been given any guarantees that the grants scheme for the purchase of new electric vehicles will continue into 2025, its secretary general has told Times of Malta.
 For quite some time, car importers and their salespeople have been warning potential buyers that the current subsidies on electric vehicles may not be given beyond the end of this year.
 Deborah Schembri, ACIM secretary general, said that government entities, including Transport Malta, would only give them an assurance of subsidies for owners of EVs registered until the end of 2024.
 This is regardless of whether the EU-allocated funding would have been utilised in full or not.
 “Given the government’s commitment, November and December purchases for cars that manage to be registered by the end of the year should be covered,” she said.
 Finance Minister Clyde Caruana confirmed that EU funds allocated for the purchase of new electric vehicles “have already been fully taken up and the government has had to finance the scheme, through the rest of the year, by utilising national funds.”
 However, Caruana stopped short of providing clarity on whether the government would continue offering incentives from its own budget into next year, saying only that the 2025 budget is “still in the works”.
 A kitty worth almost €50 million of EU funds, made available through the Recovery and Resilience Plan and issued in tranches of €15 million annually, was consumed over a period of three years between 2022 and 2024.
 Schembri said ACIM has asked the government to retain incentives for EV purchases that are “as close as possible to the current incentive structure”.
 Additionally, she believes that hybrid vehicles “should also benefit from some sort of incentives because they too help in the reduction of emissions”.
 Malta has been offering EV subsidy schemes for almost a decade.
 Originally, plug-in-hybrid cars were eligible for subsidies as well. These were removed fairly recently while the grants on fully electric vehicles increased significantly.
 Aided by the EU’s RRP, subsidies for fully electric vehicles were increased from €9,000 to €12,000 in 2022.
 Incentives have been provided equally to private individuals, registered companies and partnerships, local councils, registered NGOs, self-employed individuals and cooperatives.
 Additionally, electric vehicles are exempt from the payment of registration tax and annual licence fees for the first five years. 
 Motorists deregistering older vehicles running on conventional fuel benefit from an additional €1,000.
 According to NSO figures, by the end of June 2024, there were 14,924 fully electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles in Malta and Gozo. This equates to just 3.4 per cent of the total motor vehicle stock on Maltese roads.
 The number of licensed electric vehicles decreased by 14.2% in the second quarter of this year.
 Petrol-powered engines remain by far the most popular, with 257,483 on the roads, while diesel-powered vehicles amount to 156,347.
 Between April and June this year, the number of plug-in hybrid (diesel) vehicles increased by 22.2%; mild hybrid (diesel) vehicles increased by 8%; and mild-hybrid (petrol) increased by 5.8%.

 While works on the 20-metre stretch of road running through Wied il-Qlejgħa were meant to be completed last July, the Energy and Water Authority, one of the entities tasked with the regeneration of the area, said repairs have been hampered by continuous structural issues caused by erosion.
 “We would repair one thing, and another issue would pop up. We’re dealing with a site containing up to 35,000 cubic metres of water,” CEO Manuel Sapiano said.
 “However, the major repair work has now been completed, and workers are adding the finishing touches such as the road surface.”
 Sapiano said the structure of the new road factored in the constant erosion, with piles anchoring the road’s surface to its foundations, which had previously consisted only of loose stones. The valley’s embankments have also been reinforced.
 The road is also designed to withstand all types of traffic, including heavy vehicles like the water bowsers used by farmers to irrigate their fields.
  Meanwhile, Nature Trust Malta, which manages the site, said that once the area is reopened to the public, more enforcement will be needed to prevent abuse, specifically vandalism, trampling of sensitive areas, off-roading and the dumping of rubbish and unwanted pets such as terrapin turtles.
 “We don’t like restricting the site too much, so we will be working with stakeholders and landowners to strike a balance,” said CEO Vince Attard, adding that a visitor-flow management plan would be put in place to encourage visitors to keep to designated paths.
 The persistent issue of crayfish infestation has also not gone away, despite 4,500 of the invasive crustaceans having been removed over the past two years.
 
 “The problem is that they reproduce very prolifically, so while we can eradicate them all from the public part of the valley, all it takes is one crayfish in a privately owned area for the infestation to start all over again,” he said.
 A study to determine whether nitrate levels in the crayfish are low enough that they can be caught and safely eaten is yet to be concluded.

 The PA has issued a draft policy review for the site.
 
 It said in a statement the primary purpose of this policy review was to keep harmful industrial development as distant as possible from the area, which is ""of high environmental value"".
 However, the authority is also proposing that a small area be designated for low-impact sports.
 The site lies adjacent to the western coastal cliffs of the Maltese Islands near Wied Żnuber. These cliffs, including Wied Żnuber, are part of a larger Natura 2000 site, which area is protected for its ecological Importance and high landscape value.
 In February 2022, Times of Malta reported on plans to turn a stretch of land off Wied Żnuber into an airstrip for model aircraft.
 In the following weeks, Għaqda Storja u Kultura Birżebbuġa,  Moviment  Graffitti, the  Birżebbuġa local council, farmers, a group of  Birżebbuġa residents and  14 other NGOs, including  BirdLife Malta and  Din l-Art Ħelwa voiced concern over the development. 
 An agreement, signed between the authorities and the Ħal Far Model Flying Association, made public by  Times of Malta, for the relocation of a model plane airstrip to the site acknowledged the new area’s “close proximity to the Natura 2000 site”.
 Following the public outcry, Robert Abela claimed “there will be no development in Wied Żnuber”.
 
 On Thursday the PA said that through the partial review of the South Malta Local Plan, it was proposing that the area of the site which lies adjacent to the Natura 2000 site, and which overlaps the scheduled archaeological buffer zone, be rezoned from an industrial area to an ‘Area to be Conserved and Restored’.
 Meanwhile, the remaining portion of the site adjacent to the existing committed industrial facilities, away from the coastal cliffs, is being rezoned from industrial to an ‘Area for Low Impact Sports with Green Open Space’.
  The PA is urging people and organisations to send their representations on this policy review via halfar.review@pa.org.mt

 Crowds had shown up to greet the 38-year-old swimmer. But Agius was oblivious to it all.
 “I could not hear or see anyone, all I was seeing were pallets made up of rubber, all over the place,” he said. 
 The sound of the crashing waves drowned out the noise of the crowd apart from the voice of two crew members who, using glow sticks, guided Agius towards a ladder.
  Agius completed his world record 142.3km swim in 60 hours and 35 minutes on Monday evening. The World Open Water Swimming Association has now ratified it as a new world record for the longest, unassisted, current-neutral ocean swim ever recorded.
 The swimmer recalled the last moments of his world-record swim at a press conference at the Royal Malta Yacht Club on Saturday morning. He was accompanied by his 25 crew members who were gave him support, food and guidance during his three-day swim.
  They included his partner, Lara Vella, logistic director Gordon Bugeja and David Brookes, who kept tabs on the weather, Neil’s nutrition during the swim and ratifying it for the record books.
 Planning for the swim began last year, when the Olympian attempted to cross 160 km from Mallorca to Ibiza. He was forced to abandon that swim after being stung repeatedly by swarms of jellyfish. 
 “That failure was very important for this year’s success,” he said. 
 “I changed everything. This is the seventh year I’ve been doing these swims, and I’m always tweaking and finding new ways to improve,” he recalled. 
 “You can Google ‘how to boil an egg’ but I cannot Google ‘how to swim 160km’ and get a blueprint of what to do. I am trying to create new ideas and new systems to do so. Open-water swimming has become my passion and I want to put Malta on the map for this.”
 After months of training, Neil’s team gave him the go-ahead to start his swim last Saturday. Minutes before he walked into the water at Għadira Bay, he took a moment to close his eyes and feel the sand beneath his feet.
 “You can’t believe the day has finally come after a lifetime of preparation,” he said. 
 “So many days of sacrifice, of grinding and doing things I didn’t want to do. I didn’t want to wake up every day to do all that training.  I closed my eyes and I knew, it was go time.”
  For his swim to be ratified as a world record one, he could not touch the rib or any of his crew members at any point.
 Every 30 minutes, he would take a 90 second break.
 “I need to eat, I need to drink, and rinse my mouth with mouthwash to reduce the inflammation,” he recalled of those pauses. 
 “I also have to try and pee and any communication with the team has to be done during this time. People cannot all talk to me at once, as I need to keep a high level of concentration and this could distort me.”
 Neil shot down suggestions that swimming around the Maltese islands was easier than swimming across countries. 
 “It’s actually much worse, swimming closer to the land the sea is shallower and at night you begin to see the stones underneath form different shadows,” he said. “Then you start to think that’s not a stone, but something else!”
 
 Neil and his crew tried to prepare for every scenario. But they were caught by surprise when he started feeling cold at 9.30pm on the first night. He still had an entire night ahead of him.
  “He was chattering his teeth, and I was surprised to see this,” his partner, Lara Vella, said.
 Agius’ swims usually take place in June. He shifted this year’s event to September to minimise the risk of jellyfish disrupting it.
  “But this meant colder nights, of course,” Vella said.
 By the second night, the crew were more prepared. 
 “We doubled up on motivators on the boat to make sure the energy throughout the evening was high and we kept Neil in good spirits,” Lara recalled. 
 Neil also was taken aback by how cold the evenings were. There were moments he was worried his doctor would make him stop the swim because he was hypothermic.
 “I was breathing in cold air, and I could feel the cold go down to my stomach. I was cold inside and out.”
 He began to worry about how the cold would impact him on the second night, when he would be up for over 30 hours swimming.
  His concerns were that the cold would worsen his hallucinations. 
 “During all this time in the water, my mind is focused on the position of my shoulder and stroke, how my hips are moving, making sure my mouth doesn’t open so much so I don’t swallow so much water.”
 Yet, the night also brought beautiful moments. 
 ""It’s pitch black, but the moon was so bright and it gave me so much strength, energy and power to move forward.”
 While Neil was battling the waves, his crew faced their own challenge: an incoming storm.
 As the storm approached, Agius’ logistics director suggested modifying his route to avoid the worst of it. He wanted Agius to swim around Gozo twice and finish in Sliema instead.
 “I put my head back in the water and cried,” Agius recalled when his team raised the idea.
 The route was approved two months before, and Neil was set to not change anything.
 “If we changed the route we would give the message out there that we took the easy way out, and we didn’t want to do that. We worked too hard for too long to not get what we deserved,” he said.
 Agius and his crew discussed the oncoming storm during one of his short breaks. They decided to go ahead with the route as originally planned.
 When the storm came, it brought significant challenges with it.
 “The waves were as large as a door frame,” Melaine Vella, one of the land team members, said.
 But Agius, under the watchful eye of his crew, battled through it.
 There were also concerns about where Agius would end his swim.
 The topography of Malta’s southern coast meant that if he did not stop at Għar Lapsi, he would have to swim another 16km to Golden Bay.
  There was another concern.
 “I was told that if we kept swimming, I would not have any more warm food and drinks,” Agius said. “So I decided it would be best to end the swim at Għar Lapsi.”
 Agius does not plan on calling it quits just yet. There are other big challenges he wants to tackle, he said. But in the short term, his focus will now switch to opening a yoga and Kaizen hub with his partner, Lara. The hub will provide yoga sessions and breathing workshops where Agius will share all he has learnt to hit peak performance.
 Kaizen is a Japanese concept focused on continuous improvement.
 “To navigate through rough seas, I had to train and learn what it meant to experience rough times, and that is what we want to provide at our hub,” he said.

Neil Agius to lead round-Gozo swim to promote open water swimming,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/round-gozo-swim-promote-open-water-swimming.1094684,30-06-2024,007400.png,"Renowned ultra-distance swimmer Neil Agius has launched the Ocean Festival - a round Gozo swim to promote open water swimming.
 The event will see participants swimming around Gozo on Monday, covering a total distance of 37 kilometers. They will set off from Ħondoq ir-Rummien at 4am, swimming clockwise around Gozo.
 The event has two categories - A solo swim, where athletes will tackle the entire distance individually, and a team swim, which allows participants to share the effort across the course.
 The solo swim is a significant test of endurance, requiring competitors to complete the 37 kilometers within a 15-hour time limit. This category has drawn 11 solo swimmers.
 In the team swim category, participants will work together to cover the distance, providing a slightly less intensive but still formidable challenge. One group of three swimmers, and two groups of four and five swimmers each, will take on the course in a relay format, emphasizing teamwork and cooperation.
 To ensure the safety of all participants, each swimmer or group will be accompanied by an escort boat. Additionally, three support boats from the Ocean Festival crew will patrol the route. St John Ambulance will be present with a sea ambulance and a land team on standby, with the Emergency Response and Rescue Corps (ERRC) joining later in the day with their support boat.
 Preparatory meetings with Transport Malta and Gozo Channel personnel were held to ensure clear communication and established safety protocols.
 Over the past six months, swimmers have undergone a rigorous training regimen, including specific swim training, diet and nutrition advice, mindset training, and professional insights provided by Neil himself.
 The Ocean Festival is aimed at promoting open water swimming and fostering a sense of community among swimmers of all levels.
 ""By pushing boundaries and embracing the beauty of the Maltese waters, Ocean Festival aims to create memorable experiences that inspire and challenge participants to achieve new goals,"" the organisers said.

 In a statement on Friday, the Environment and Resources Authority said that the loggerhead turtle was found on the bay in the early hours of the morning. 
 Once the turtle safely laid its eggs, officials found from the turtle's microchip that it is the same turtle which laid nest six this year. 
 ERA officers were on site immediately to ensure that the nest was protected.
  ""The public is reminded that if a turtle is spotted during a nesting attempt, no interactions with the turtle are to be made, as noise and light may scare the turtle away and a potential nest may be lost as a result,"" the statement said. 
 ""One should also immediately report the sighting.""

Swimming 'not recommended' at Balluta Bay due to E.coli contamination,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/swimming-not-recommended-balluta-bay-due-ecoli-contamination.1092788,21-05-2024,007427.png,"The Environmental Health Directorate has warned bathers not to swim in Balluta Bay due to contamination that may pose a risk to human health. 
 The authorities said that the right side of the St Julian's bay was found to contain microbiological contamination of E.coli and I.enterococci, which has affected the water quality and may pose a risk to bather's health. 
 This is the second such contamination to be identified in the area after authorities warned that St George's Bay had also been contaminated and that swimming is not advised there. 
 Signs warning bathers of the situation have been affixed in the area and they will be removed once the water is once again fit for bathing, the authority said. They added that the duration of the contamination cannot be predicted at this stage.

Swieqi residents say db Group's building site trucks are keeping them awake,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/swieqi-residents-say-db-group-building-site-trucks-keeping-awake.1094570,29-06-2024,007535.png,"Residents of a Swieqi road have complained of noisy lorries driving past their homes late into the night to access the building site at db Group’s City Centre project.
 One woman living on Triq tal-Ibraġ said she saw “15 trucks pass by” on Tuesday evening while others said they had been on the road from 6am until after midnight.
 Residents also say some trucks were not covered and the white dust they left behind made it hard to breathe.
 A spokesperson from db Group, which is responsible for the building site, said it was an “extraordinary measure”.
 Work started on the massive City Centre project last year at the site of the old Institute for Tourism Studies straddling St George’s Bay and Pembroke.
 Residents, NGOs and local councils, including of Swieqi, had objected to the massive project.
 Mayor Noel Muscat told Times of Malta he was inundated with messages from residents who felt disrespected by the decision to allow trucks to pass by the street late into the night.
 “We have been totally against this project from the beginning, and, if works must go on, they should not cause detriment to our residents,” he said.
  “During the planning stage, the council had requested that no massive vehicles pass through this road.
 “Whether the request was accepted or not, we don’t know but it wouldn’t make a difference because residents are disrespected continuously.”
 “After midnight and, still, these heavily loaded trucks coming and going nonstop,” said one resident.
 “It has been (like this) since 6.15am yesterday (Monday), non-stop till late evening,” another commented.
 The trucks were carrying material for the works and another resident said they left debris behind.
 “And most (if not all) trucks were not even covered; go and see the condition of the road. It is all covered with tiny stones and this causes the white dust. I went out a bit to get something  and couldn’t breathe properly…”
 Residents noted the presence of Transport Malta officials who were at the site to divert the flow of traffic to allow the trucks and concrete mixers to pass.
 The mayor said he is consulting the council’s lawyer and architect to see what measures can be taken.
 A db Group spokesperson told Times of Malta that the road was used for two days for foundation works at the site, which required “uninterrupted operations”.
 “These works were limited to the casting of the rough foundations which took place in the last two days,” he said, adding that those works are now complete.
 “Such extraordinary events are also liaised and coordinated with Transport Malta. As explained, this was an extraordinary measure due to particular works which had to be carried out uninterruptedly.”
 He said Transport Malta officials were directing traffic accordingly and that the officials’ time was at the company’s expense.
 The spokesperson could not rule out if the road will be used again in the future but said such measures will be kept as a last resort.
 Muscat said he had not been informed about the company’s movements.
 “We are extremely disappointed with the way that we have been treated and I sincerely hope that it will not repeat itself,” he said.
 “Where does the local council feature in this scenario? Aren’t we responsible for the administration of the locality? This is an enormous project that will require many other ‘one-offs’.
 The project includes the construction of three towers rising at 17, 16 and 12 floors. It also includes high-end apartments, retail, commercial space and a hotel.

"Environment, governance declined as the economy boomed – study",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/environment-governance-declined-economy-boomed-study.1097223,31-08-2024,"007731.png,007732.png","Malta’s strong economic performance over the recent decade contrasted with lacklustre social development and poor environmental and political progress, according to a recent study.
 From 2012 to 2021, Malta’s economy grew “rapidly”, with gross domestic product (GDP) growth the second-highest in the EU and unemployment the second-lowest in the bloc.
 But around a third of the adult population – more than double the EU average – persistently said they face environmental issues such as smoke, dust, unpleasant smells or polluted water.
 Meanwhile, construction continued unabated, leading to “major negative social and environmental impacts”, the study’s author, economics professor Lino Briguglio, argues.
 And between poorly functioning regulators and the political dominance enjoyed by the Labour Party over the last decade, while there had been some signs of improvement, “the situation did not seem to improve, and may be worsening”, Briguglio says.
 The University of Malta professor develops his arguments in a study on ‘The sustainable development implications of major economic changes in Malta between 2012 and 2021’, published in Malta Chamber of Scientists journal Xjenza.
 Drawing on existing publicly available data, Briguglio discusses Malta’s economic performance over the decade, comparing it to other EU states with a view to sustainable development.
 “Malta has done very well economically, less well in terms of social development and not well at all in terms of environmental and political governance,” he writes.
 “The indicators presented beg the question as to whether Malta was following the path of sustainable development... Malta’s economic success, during the decade under study, was accompanied by weak political and environmental governance.”
 Briguglio notes that GDP – which measures the monetary value of all goods and services produced by a country and is often seen as a marker of economic success – grew by around six per cent per year during the decade covered by the study.
 And the country continued to attract “considerable” foreign investment despite its small market and lack of natural resources, benefitting from its EU membership, location, favourable tax regime, and English-speaking workforce.
 Meanwhile, the rate of poverty remained lower than the EU average and life expectancy was the highest in the EU, averaging 83 years. But the data also reveals quality-of-life issues, Briguglio suggests.
 While life expectancy remained high, there was also a “worrying tendency” towards obesity, with the Maltese the most obese in Europe.
  “Other worrying tendencies in Malta in this regard are the relatively high prevalence of diabetes and high blood pressure, associated with eating habits and the loss of the Mediterranean diet.”
 The university professor also warns of “major challenges” in education, citing a high rate of early school-leavers.
 But the environment is where Briguglio thinks the country needs to see the most improvement.
 Calling the Environment and Resources Authority (ERA) “practically toothless” and charging the Planning Authority with “doing exactly the opposite” of its mission to make the country a more “pleasant and desirable place to live”, Briguglio thinks Malta has not performed well at all in terms of the environment.
 Describing the country’s environmental performance as “dismal”, he suggests “weak environmental governance” is to blame, pointing to a lack of importance assigned to recycling, for example.
 And he attributes much of the environmental degradation to the construction industry, which he describes as “clashing with the quest for sustainable development”.
 Calling the industry “very weakly regulated” and charged with creating air and noise pollution and “destabilising whole neighbourhoods”, the professor says the “mushrooming building activity has led to depletion of environmental assets, which will be lost forever”.
  But construction is not the only industry in the firing line. Tourism – despite its strong economic performance – is attributed to “social discomfort in high tourist-density localities” and further environmental issues.
 Meanwhile, political governance – important for the regulation of such industries – remains precarious although showing signs of improvement, evidenced by Malta’s removal from the FATF grey list, for example, Briguglio thinks.
 “There seems to be better checks and balances relating to corruption, but... the large parliamentary majority enjoyed by one political party would enable the government, if it wants to, to appoint accommodating persons in charge of the regulatory institutions.
 “Optimistically, Malta’s membership in the European Union... should dissuade maladministration excesses and restrain the country from being an ‘elective dictatorship’.”
 When contacted, Briguglio told Times of Malta that more recent data showed the country continued to score badly on governance indicators, which he said were deteriorating, despite Malta scoring in the top quarter of countries worldwide.

It’s wildfire season – here’s how to avoid starting one,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/it-wildfire-season-avoid-starting-one.1094358,24-06-2024,007769.png,"As people fight the summer heat, members of the Civil Protection Department have another battle on their hands.
 The summer season is also the season for wildfires. And climate change has only made the situation worse as vegetation dries faster, making it more susceptible to burning, says CPD director Peter Paul Coleiro.
 “Grass fires or wildfires are very seasonal and usually start in about May and reach their peak in June, continuing until September or the first rains,” he said.
 Firefighters respond to over a thousand wildfires a year and most of them take place in summer, he added.
 The Civil Protection Department were busy on Friday evening dealing with two major fires that blazed into the night and early hours of Saturday.   
 One fire erupted on a ship in Marsa. The other was a grass fire in  Wied Fulija, which burnt two football pitches worth of grass. 
 But most wildfires worldwide start because of human activity, even if not intentionally, Coleiro said.
  Here are the department’s tips to avoid starting a fire:
 • Do not throw cigarette butts in the countryside, especially when driving;
 • Don’t drive over vegetation;
 • Do not leave glass bottles behind as they can magnify the sun’s rays and start a fire;
 • Do not cook on or near vegetation when barbecuing;
 • Do not start fires in the countryside.
 If you have a country house, a workplace or a field in the countryside, some measures can be taken to stop wildfires from spreading to your property, Coleiro said.
 • Keep the boundary of your property free of vegetation to stop fire from moving from a rural area into a home or industrial site;
 • Keep combustible material like pallets away from the edges of your property;
 • If you have a field or garden, keep the ground wet by irrigating it often.

First stage in floating solar farm plan attracts 13 different proposals,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/first-stage-floating-solar-farm-plan-attracts-13-different-proposals.1093015,25-05-2024,007790.png,"Preliminary plans to develop a floating solar farm at sea have attracted 13 different proposals, the Regulator for Energy and Water Services said on Saturday. 
 The submissions were made as part of the preliminary market consultation to assess the market’s readiness for the potential development of offshore solar farms. Authorities intend to develop an area four nautical miles off the coast of Delimara into a floating, grid-connected solar farm with a 50 megawatt capacity. 
 The preliminary market consultation precedes a competitive tendering process and is intended to gauge private sector interest in the plans. 
 As the regulator, REWS will now assess the submissions received, through a committee of technical experts. Applicants may be asked for further information to substantiate their proposals. 
 REWS CEO Marjohn Abela said the process would pave the way for an eventual competitive call for offers. 
 In a statement on Saturday, the Energy Ministry said it was pleased to see the “substantial” interest to the idea shown by both local and international operators.  “The strong interest shown by investors reflects the credibility that Malta is garnering in its energy sector, including renewable energy,” Energy Minister Miriam Dalli said.

FKNK and Birdlife go to war over bird ringer's request,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/fknk-birdlife-go-war-bird-ringer-request.1101240,19-11-2024,"000014.png,000015.png","A government decision to allow finch trapping to proceed despite a European Court of Justice ruling has led to open warfare between bird trappers and animal activists.
 Malta’s leading hunting lobby, the FKNK, said on Tuesday that Birdlife Malta was “obstructing” efforts to run trapping programmes for the sake of science.
 They accused the NGO of refusing to give a qualified Irish trapper bird rings needed to trap finches.
 But Birdlife quickly hit back, saying that was a lie and accusing the hunting lobby of using the controversy to greenwash illegal finch trapping under the guise of research.
 Scientific bird ringing is a process of marking wild birds, often by using a metal ring around their legs, for re-identification.
 Back in October, the government allowed the trapping of seven species of songbirds under what it said were “strictly monitored” conditions for a study on migration movements.  
 The decision came after the EU Court of Justice described Malta’s finch trapping for “research” as illegal.
 The government said trapping would be permitted for a “study season” stretching to December 20. Trappers would be required to log information about ringed birds and then release them.
 In a long Facebook post on Tuesday, FKNK said BirdLife Malta was acting above the law and refusing to fulfil its obligations as the official representative of an EU-wide bird ringing project, EURING.
 The hunting lobby said an Irish bird ringer, Declan Coney, had requested 600 bird rings from Birdlife but been denied.
 Coney, the FKNK said, was appointed by the government via a public tender to carry out bird ringing services.
 According to the government’s public tendering website, that tender has not yet been awarded and was listed as “awaiting tender opening” as of the time of publication.
  “Despite Mr Coney’s official license and clear instructions from the government to provide him with scientific rings, BirdLife Malta refused to cooperate. Their negative response is an obstructionist tactic that undermines a nationally sanctioned research effort,” FKNK said.
 “The Ornis Committee meeting minutes show that BirdLife Malta agreed to supply the uniquely coded scientific rings needed for the programme. However, their boycott and subsequent threats have created a hostile environment that discourages genuine scientific collaboration.” 
  BirdLife Malta rejected those claims in a press statement issued on Tuesday afternoon.
 The NGO said it had replied to Coney’s request for bird rings by asking him for more information, as part of an established verification process. Coney never replied, Birdlife said.
 “Unlike what FKNK is trying to insinuate, BirdLife Malta never reached the point to accept or reject Mr Coney’s request,” the statement read. 
 “FKNK’s amateur approach to science does not allow them to comprehend that prior to giving rings that bear BirdLife Malta’s details we need to make sure the person is genuine and skilled, and the project is scientifically sound,"" BirdLife CEO Mark Sultanta said.
 ""BirdLife Malta’s ringing scheme within EURING is a credible scientific operation and FKNK was hoping it could use the scheme to try and smokescreen the scam of the finch trapping derogation further,” Sultana said.
 The government’s sole intention was to create a smokescreen to allow illegal fincnhing to occur, Birdlife said as it called on the EU Commission to “take immediate action” against the government for defying the ECJ ruling.

PN concerned over Żonqor Point 'exclusion' from Inwadar plan; government denies 'misinformation' - The Malta Independent ,independent,https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2024-10-29/local-news/PN-concerned-over-Zonqor-Point-exclusion-from-Inwadar-Park-Management-Plan-6736265314,29-10-2024,000023.png,"
                
        

         The Nationalist Party said Tuesday it is seriously concerned about the exclusion of Żonqor Point from the recently published Inwadar National Park Management Plan. This is the same area which the Government had changed its position about, after pressure from the Opposition and a public outcry, whereby it was first given to the American University of Malta (AUM) and then taken back.
 The PN said it has always maintained that Żonqor Point should be fully integrated into Inwadar National Park. Its inclusion is essential to safeguard this unique and ecologically important coastal area for the benefit of future generations. Given that local plans and regulations already include Żonqor Point as part of the park's boundaries, its absence from the management plan raises important questions.  It urged the Government to take immediate action to ensure that the park's management plan reflects this reality and formally includes Żonqor Point, as anticipated in both planning frameworks and previous commitments.
 This area is too important to be left out of any plan aimed at preserving Malta's natural heritage. The Maltese public, who voiced their strong opposition to the AUM development, deserve nothing less than full transparency and follow-through from the Government on this issue.
 The PN insisted that the government should clarify its position and ensure that Żonqor Point is treated as an integral part of Inwadar National Park. This land is a vital part of Malta's environmental and cultural fabric, and its protection must be guaranteed.
 It is clear that, for the government, the protection of such environmental areas is not a priority, as evidenced by yesterday's Budget, where this sector, so crucial for the quality of life of the Maltese and Gozitans, was completely overlooked, the statement said.
 Government says PN statement 'based on misinformation'
 In response, the Environment Ministry said that the PN's statement is based on misinformation.
 ""The Government is upholding its commitment that Żonqor Point remains protected as an integral part of the Inwadar National Park. Last August, regulatory changes were already published and approved, taking steps to strengthen the management and protection of this valuable natural area.""
 ""Included with the law as published in the Government Gazette is an attached plan that clearly shows that the AUM area has been added to the Inwadar Park. This ongoing commitment by the Government to environmental protection confirms clear priorities to sustainably safeguard Malta's natural sites.""
 PL reacts
 The Labour Party also reacted to the PN's statement, saying that Bernard Grech and the Nationalist Party ""are opting for falsehoods, not even bothering to examine what is outlined in the law.""
 ""The Labour Government acted without delay to ensure that Żonqor Point was included in the Management Plan of the Inwadar National Park. This indeed occurred, and anyone can easily verify it publicly. But for Bernard Grech, what matters is sowing confusion in every area, regardless of facts and truth. If the Nationalist Party had bothered to check the facts before making public statements, they would have realized that even the legal notice clearly indicates that Żonqor Point is part of the Inwadar Park,"" the PL said.

Koperattiva Produtturi taz-Zebbug Ltd unites olive growers - The Malta Independent ,independent,https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2024-10-08/local-news/Koperattiva-Produtturi-taz-Zebbug-Limited-Genetic-Resources-Project-6736264747,08-10-2024,000040.png,"
                
        

         The idea to set up an organisation to unite the olive growers was launched by a Facebook post on 4th October, 2022 by Mr. Jimmy Magro. Several persons wrote in support of this idea. Mr. Magro then proceeded to call a meeting on the 18th November, 2022 to discuss the formation of an entity to unite the olive growers. During this meeting a resolution was approved to set up a Provisional Committee that was composed of six members.  At a later online meeting, held on the 9th December, 2022, and after seeking legal advice, the decision was taken to set up a cooperative, and the name was decided as Koperattiva Produtturi taz-Zebbug Limited.
 Following intensive work, with the support of Koperattivi Malta, the Provisional Committee delivered the full documentation required to register the cooperative with the Cooperatives Board on 26th January, 2023.
 The Koperattiva Produtturi taz-Zebbug Limited was registered on the 27th February, 2023.
 Since then, the Cooperative has been involved in numerous initiatives in order to ensure the valorisation of the olive and olive oil sector in Malta and Gozo.  The Cooperative has already gained local, national and international recognition for its active role in creating awareness about the holistic value of olive groves and extra virgin olive oil.
 The number of members in the Cooperative has surpassed all expectations and now the Cooperative has a membership base of 114, representing a cross section of olive growers, including about 15 members that are classified as young farmers under the EU definition.
 One of the projects that the Cooperative has embarked on is called Genetic Resources Project under Measure 10.2. of the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD).  The budget of the project exceeds €289,000 and is fully funded by the European Union.  The budget has three main deliverables:
 1.   The grafting of about 1250 rootstock into the Bidni cultivar;
 2.   A programme of scientific research promoting the ex situ and in situ conservation, characterisation, collection and utilisation of genetic resources in agriculture, including web-based inventories of genetic resources currently conserved in situ, including in situ/on-farm conservation, and of ex situ collections (gene banks) and databases.
 3.   An educational and awareness campaign about the Bidni cultivar and the olive and olive oil sector.
 Although researchers have identified olive trees dating back in thousands of years, the olive sector has been revived by Mr. Sam Cremona, who in the Seventies carried out what is known as the PRIMO Project.  The project was supported by Bank of Valletta plc.  Through the PRIMO project thousands of olive trees were distributed to farmers and from then the olive sector was revived again.  The project had also envisaged applications to the EU to obtain the PDO and the PGI for extra virgin olive oil produced in Malta;  and the Government had also planned to register the germplasm of the local cultivars and set up a gene bank.
 The Cooperative has taken the initiative to submit the application for the registration of the PDO and PGI for extra virgin olive oil produced in Malta.  This work is being carried out together with the Confederation of Farmers and Fisherman of Gozo, and the Malta Food Agency.  Discussions are now ongoing with the Malta Competition and Consumers Affairs Authority, the competent authority for these matters.
 The establishment of the National Gene Bank for the conservation of indigenous and endemic plants has been financially supported through the EAFRD and the implementation of Sub-Measure 10.2 of the Rural Development Programme for Malta for the programming period 2014-2020.  Malta has its first National Gene Bank, which will serve as a national repository for plant genetic diversity. The national gene bank will serve to conserve and facilitate access to local plant varieties, landraces, heirloom varieties, crop wild relatives and other wild plant genetic diversity for use in agriculture, research and conservation activities. The facility will store seeds, as well as plant tissues for in vitro storage and cryo-preservation and complement the existing infrastructure at the Plant Protection Directorate as the Competent Authority for Genetic Resources to produce and store artificial seeds. The gene bank will have the role to generate and analyse genetic diversity for the germplasm stored within its chambers, therefore filling large gaps in the knowledge of national plant genetic heritage. The availability of germplasm and a genetic database will contribute to the efforts being carried out worldwide that contribute to food security as well as to develop new varieties which are resilient to common problems such as drought, high soil salinity, changing climates, disease outbreaks, and nutritional efficiency, amongst others.
 The Genetic Resources Project being carried out by the Cooperative will be an additional contribution to the efforts being carried out by the Plant Protection Department of the Ministry of Agriculture.  The Cooperative will also cooperate with other countries who have experience in the registration of olive tree germplasm, as well as the International Olive Council.  The Cooperative has been approved as a member of the Advisory Committee of the International Olive Council, and this shall lead to greater international cooperation for the benefit of the olive sector in Malta.
 With regards to the educational and awareness campaign, the Cooperative has launched an advertising campaign on print and social media, adverts on route public buses, and will continue to use other public relations tools to deliver its message to the public in Malta and Gozo.  The campaign has been very effective and has enabled the Cooperative to increase its membership base by more then 35 members.  Anyone interested in joining the Cooperative may send an email to [email protected]

  A total of 75 eggs were found, 47 turtles were hatched and 28 were unfertilised
 Three days after the first hatchings were noticed following strong wind and rain, the nest was inspected by a qualified vet.
  “Each nest is a crucial step in the conservation efforts to protect these magnificent creatures and ensure their survival. Through dedicated efforts and monitoring, we strive to secure a brighter future for sea turtles and their habitats,” ERA said in a facebook post.
 This is the fifth turtle nesting site of this season, after more than 40 turtles hatched from the fourth turtle nest of the season at Golden Bay last week.
 ERA also thanked the public for their support and cooperation.
 The loggerhead, scientifically known as Caretta caretta, is a long living, slowly maturing marine species that inhabits tropical to warm temperate areas.
 This species is classified as globally endangered by the World Conservation Area (IUCN) and is also protected by various national and international legislation. Capturing, killing, taking, and trading these turtles, as well as the deliberate disturbance of these species, particularly during the period of breeding, rearing and migration, is prohibited and subject to legal action.

Mellieħa residents raise alarm over fresh sale of public land for development,newsbook,https://newsbook.com.mt/en/mellieha-residents-raise-alarm-over-fresh-sale-of-public-land-for-development/,18-11-2024,000069.png,"Tista' taqra bil-
 Residents of Mellieħa have expressed renewed concern over an application proposing the development of a 26-room guesthouse and a block of 28 apartments on green land situated between Triq Salvu Camilleri and Triq tas-Salib. The application, PA/07710/24, seeks permission for the construction of the guesthouse, complete with a spa, bar, and gym, alongside 12 underground garages and 21 outdoor parking spaces. The project is spearheaded by Roderick Conti of 121 Property Services Ltd, with Gilbert Bartolo, brother of tourism minister Clayton Bartolo, serving as the architect. The land was acquired through a Lands Authority tender process for the sum of €151,000. Residents argue that the proposed development would irreparably harm the area’s character, increase pollution, and exacerbate traffic congestion. Concerns over the narrow roads, noise, and light pollution further fuel opposition. Public backing has been sought to reject the proposal, echoing recent protests against another contentious development in Mellieħa Heights. In that case, 109 apartments and 117 garages were proposed for pristine land sold for €400,000 to T&S Property Holdings Limited. A National Audit Office inquiry has since been requested to investigate the sale, with a hearing on the Mellieħa Heights development scheduled for 20 November. Civil society organisation il-Kollettiv has accused the Lands Authority of undervaluing public land, highlighting similarities between the Mellieħa Heights and Triq tas-Salib transactions. It also criticised Mellieħa-based tourism minister Clayton Bartolo for his silence, citing his brother’s role as the architect for the Triq tas-Salib project. Further, Mellieħa mayor Gabriel Micallef condemned the sale of green land as “ridiculous and detrimental” to residents. He urged the government to buy back the land and convert it into a public garden. Independent deputy mayor Matthew Borg Cuschieri and Nationalist MP Ivan Castillo also opposed the development, with Castillo proposing a parliamentary petition to safeguard public spaces.",Jurgen Balzan,Environment
Persons of trust: employers want full disclosure and performance audits,theshiftnews,https://theshiftnews.com/2023/07/10/persons-of-trust-employers-want-full-disclosure-and-performance-audits/,10-07-2023,000077.png,"Malta’s employers are demanding full disclosure when it comes to the persons of trust employed by the government including the publication of their contracts, remuneration and full packages.
 The Malta Employers Association is also proposing periodic independent audits of persons of trust to assess the amount of time actually spent at work, their work activities and the results they have achieved.
 The employers’ representative body is also calling for a capping on the number of people in positions of trust.
 The MEA was reacting to the results of last week’s EU Eurobarometer survey on corruption, which showed that 92% of Maltese feel that corruption has become widespread.
 An additional survey reported by The Shift on Saturday focussed specifically on the business community, which raised its own set of concerns.
 It showed how 84% of Malta’s businesses see favouritism and corruption as hampering competition, 64% see bribery and the leveraging of connections as the easiest way to obtain public services, and 35% feel the only way to succeed in business is to have political connections.
 It also showed how 31% of Maltese businesses felt that corruption had prevented them from winning a public tender over the last three years.
 Conflicts of interest when it comes to the evaluation of public procurement bids were listed by 68% of respondents as the major problem with public tenders.
 That was followed by the involvement of bidders in the design of specifications (63%), collusive bidding (61%), the abuse of emergency grounds to justify the use of noncompetitive or fast track procedures (56%), the use of negotiated procedures – i.e. direct orders – (48%) and amendments being made to the terms of contracts after they are awarded (47%).
 “Parameters for public procurement through direct orders should be respected and enforced,” the MEA stressed in a statement this morning.
 Along such lines, the MEA proposed that all contracts signed by the government with third parties should be made public within three months from the date of signing and that binding agreements with entities whose ultimate beneficiaries are unknown should be precluded from the public procurement sphere.
 “Although these proposals are fundamental, there is nothing controversial about them,” the MEA said. It explained that although these issues have been raised at the Malta Council for Economic and Social Development in the past, “they need constant re-enforcement by the social partners to bring our politicians to their senses.”
 The survey’s findings, according to the MEA “are shocking, but not surprising”.
 “For years, the Association has been saying that the situation has been deteriorating, but there is an unwillingness to tackle the issues concretely. We are now living in an environment where 87% of Maltese believe that corruption is part of the country’s business culture, and 79% see bribery and abuse of power as being rampant.
 “It does not take Eurobarometer to conclude that many businesses believe that they can only succeed
 if they have the right political connections, with a majority stating that we have an issue with nepotism and patronage.”
 The survey’s findings, according to the MEA, reveal there is no level playing field between businesses and that, rather, “we are sliding down a dangerous path that leads to equating entrepreneurship with opportunism, and that the concept of business success is more dependent on political contacts than it is on creative vision and risk-taking.
 “This does not bode well for both domestic and foreign direct investment, as more honest businesses will have to choose between either riding with the flow or seeking business opportunities elsewhere.”
 When it comes to politics, the MEA said it is advocating for a leaner parliament with full-time and better-paid members, as well as making political parties will be exclusively state-funded and banning all private donations and door-to-door collections.
 “Although these proposals are fundamental, there is nothing controversial about them,” the MEA said. “They should appeal to anyone who believes that sustainable businesses and the well-being of society
 is dependent on a sound moral and ethical infrastructure to ensure that success and achievement are based on merit and hard work, rather than on political connections.”

Opinion: Clint’s cover is blown,theshiftnews,https://theshiftnews.com/2024/09/23/opinion-clints-cover-up-is-blown/,23-09-2024,000155.png,"The EU Court of Justice has delivered its judgement, ruling that Malta’s government was simply duping the EU Commission when it claimed that finch trapping was being allowed only for “research” purposes.
 The EU’s highest court ruled there was no real research going on. Labour exploited a loophole in the Birds EU directive that allows the trapping of small numbers of birds for research purposes to turn Malta into what the Committee Against Bird Slaughter (CABS) called “one giant bird trap.”
 Well, the game is over. Clint Camilleri’s cover is blown.
 After years of taking the EU Commission for a ride, Labour’s government has been condemned by the EU’s highest court for failing to fulfil its obligations.
 The finch trapping that’s been going on in Malta under the pretext of research is illegal, and it must stop. The court’s decision is final.
 Labour thought it could keep fooling the EU Commission forever with its pathetic “research” excuse. Trappers were allowed to keep practising their hobby under the guise of scientific research.  They were meant to trap seven species of finches, check whether those birds were ringed, and release them.
 But in 2023 alone, Birdlife estimated that 51,400 finches were taken from the wild.  It was a free-for-all for trappers.
 In three weeks, 51 cases of illegal trapping were identified.  Police, with the very limited resources available, confiscated 238 finches in just a few days.
 One man was caught trapping illegally just 24 hours after he’d been convicted of the same offence.  CABS identified a massive trapping complex in Mizieb, an area managed by the trappers’ and hunters’ association FKNK.  It was surrounded by razor wire and protected by guard dogs.
 Yet FKNK didn’t notice it – and certainly didn’t report it.
 After years of foot-dragging, the EU Commission started infringement procedures against Malta over finch trapping.  Now, the Court has ruled that the EU Commission was right all along.  Malta’s Labour government had been conning the Commission.  No research had been done.
 There are no publications in any peer-reviewed journals about migratory finches in Malta.  A literature search did not find a single scientific publication about the subject when the keywords ‘Malta’ and ‘finches’ were searched.
 The only two hits were one publication of a €740,000 contract for scientific studies to be carried out on migratory finches in autumn/winter 2023-2025 and another documenting the award of the contract to Ecoserv Ltd.
 Not only were there no publications from Labour’s so-called “research”, but the court commented that no reference was made to any recognised ornithological research methods. The Court ruled that Labour’s “research” project had “no genuine research purpose”.
 Even the most inexperienced researcher knows that research involves confirming or refuting a hypothesis – but the “research” didn’t even have a genuine hyothesis. It was all a front.
 Labour was hoodwinking the EU Commission to secure the votes of the sizeable and influential hunters’ and trappers’ lobby.
 That Court decision is final.  Finch trapping must stop. Malta is expected to carry the burden of its own costs as well as the costs of the EU commission.
 In addition, Malta has been paying a top Spanish lawyer who’d previously worked at the European Court of Justice hundreds of thousands of euros to fight the case.
 Professor Daniel Sarmiento received at least €110,000 in direct orders to be part of the legal team fighting the lost battle.  Permanent Secretary John Borg refused to divulge the total sum paid to Sarmiento out of taxpayers’ money.
 But if you thought that was the end of the story, you would be seriously mistaken. Present at that judgement was our very own hunter and trapper, Gozo Minister Clint Camilleri, who was given the hunting and trapping portfolio.
 Camilleri insisted we did not understand the ruling.  He argued that there was nothing wrong with Malta’s case.  Malta was right all along.  There were only just “minor breaches”, he told the Times of Malta.
 Malta just needed to put in a few “more details”, and everything would be sorted. Trapping will go on to the trappers’ delight, Labour will remain in power and he’ll win thousands more votes.
 Minister Camilleri wants us to believe that after paying Daniel Sarmiento hundreds of thousands of euro, Malta will have to pay hundreds of thousands more in penalties, because Sarmiento forgot to includethose few “more details”.  He simply overlooked correcting those “minor breaches”.
 Camilleri is trying to pull the wool over the trappers’ eyes.  Everything will be sorted, he’s telling them.  It’s just those “minor breaches”, those “fine details” that need to be sorted.
 He came up with ridiculous excuses for why Malta lost.  He argued that the court, in its judgement,  hadn’t even brought up the issues raised by the Commission – the use of clap nets to trap birds, the use of the term “citizen science”, the use of electronic and live decoys and the lack of enforcement.
 The Court didn’t have to because it saw right through Labour’s ruse – there was no research.  “Research” was just a smokescreen to unleash trappers all over the islands. And without “research”, Labour’s justification for permitting trapping is gone.
 The Minister came up with even more nonsense. He claimed the court ruled against Malta because the judges were not familiar with Malta’s legal notices, based on the British system not the European one.
 Those stupid judges just don’t understand our systems – that’s the problem – not that Labour has been conning the Commission for years.
 Ominously, Camilleri warned: “In the coming days, we will study the judgement in detail and decide the way forward in Cabinet”. That means they’ll find another loophole allowing trappers to catch finches.  And if Malta has to pay millions in EU fines for non-compliance, so be it.
 It will just be another buy-more-votes scheme funded by that perennial sucker – the taxpayer.

Flamingo shot down in Gozo – BirdLife Malta - The Malta Independent ,independent,https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2023-08-31/local-news/Flamingo-shot-down-in-Gozo-BirdLife-Malta-6736254490,31-08-2023,000164.png,"

 A flamingo was shot down in Gozo, BirdLife Malta said.
 ""Earlier this afternoon, a young Greater Flamingo (Fjamingu) alighted on the rocks in Xwejni Gozo, probably to rest from the bad weather out at sea. While people were enjoying this beautiful sight, a person was seen shooting it down and carrying the Flamingo into a vehicle before leaving the site.""
 ""The driver is understood to have aided the hunter to escape from the area. Information that was reported to BirdLife Malta was handed over to the Gozo Police who are investigating this incident. It is understood that the police are undergoing searches on identified persons. ""
 The incident took place just a day before the opening of the Autumn hunting season.
 BirdLife Malta CEO Mark Sultana stated: ""Gozo has become a mecca of illegalities as bad as Miżieb and l-Aħrax and our hope is that the enforcement authorities take the situation seriously. We are also hoping that the public gives a hand in reporting similar incidents by sending all the information in a timely manner to us and the police. Such incidents in Gozo give us a clear indication that we need to start being more present on this island"".
 BirdLife Malta Head of Conservation Nicholas Barbara added: ""The bird migration season has started and as has happened every year, a number of protected birds - even during closed season - end up being targeted by hunters who disregard the law, and are a far cry from the conservationists or scientists they try to portray themselves to be.""
 ""The 2023 autumn hunting season kicks off tomorrow and will run for five whole months until 31st January 2024. We reiterate our call to the general public to report any illegalities immediately to the police on 119, asking to be transferred through to the Environmental Protection Unit (EPU). BirdLife Malta can also be reached on 2134 7645 or on the emergency (out of office hours) number 7925 5697.""

Malta’s derogation allowing live capture of finches breaches Birds Directive – EU Court of Justice - The Malta Independent ,independent,https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2024-09-19/local-news/Malta-s-derogation-allowing-live-capture-of-finches-breaches-Birds-Directive-EU-court-of-justice-6736264218,19-09-2024,000209.png,"

 The European Court of Justice ruled that the by adopting a derogation allowing the live capture of individuals of 7 species of wild finches, Malta is in breach of the Birds Directive.
 Malta has failed to fulfil its obligations under Articles 5, 8(1) 9(1) of Directive 2009/147 on the conservation of wild birds, the ruling, published Thursday, said.
 The Finches Project does not establish a genuine research purpose and cannot be considered as being justified under the derogation of Article 9(1)(b) of the Directive.
 Malta has also failed to establish that its derogating regime pursues a research objective, because that regime is: a) not based on scientific methods, b) gives rise to defective application, c) pursues an objective unconnected with wild finches conservation and, in any event, d) is inappropriate for attaining the declared objective.
 Malta has also failed to state reasons for the absence of any other satisfactory solution, and has failed to demonstrate the absence of any other satisfactory solution, the judgment says.
 In a statement, the Government of Malta said it acknowledged the Court's ruling, which declared that one element of the research derogation applied by Malta in the years 2020, 2021, and 2022 was not in compliance with the Birds Directive. A detailed analysis of the judgment is currently underway to assess the implications and the way forward.
 The government said it remained resolute in defending the lawful practices of hunters and trappers and will continue to engage with all relevant stakeholders to ensure their concerns are appropriately addressed, in full respect of EU law and this judgment.
 Minister for Gozo and Planning Clint Camilleri was present at the Court of Justice in Luxembourg to personally witness the delivery of the ruling, the statement said.
 The Federation for Hunting and Conservation - Malta (FKNK), for its part, thanked the Maltese Government, in particular Minister Camilleri, for its determination and commitment to continue to defend the legal practices of hunters and trappers in order to adequately address their concerns.
 The FKNK said it will continue to offer its expertise and resources to the government in order to find a satisfactory solution for a way forward.
 In its ruling, the Court also deliberated that the amendments to Malta's legal framework and new systems to uphold the research derogation fail to demonstrate the regulatory framework adopted in 2021 constituting a new regime in relation to the subject-matter of the present action.
 It also ruled that the the Commission's application clearly states that the contested derogation regime for research includes the 2020 framework rules, the 2020 declaration, the 2021 framework rules and the 2021 and 2022 declarations, as well as any future measures of the same type constituting the same conduct during the 'research periods' of 2020, 2021 and 2022 do not comply with Article 9 of Directive 2009/147.
 The Court elaborated that no such precise and adequate reasoning as to why there is no such solution was given and neither any mention of other scientific research methods currently used in the ornithological field, either to confirm or to reject them.
 The infringement procedure was initiated against Malta by the European Commission alleging that the country failed to fulfil the conditions required for the research derogation within the Birds Directive and furthermore failed to ""demonstrate the absence of another satisfactory solution"".
 Wild finches are protected by the Birds Directive which aims to preserve all bird species diversity. The EU forbids the deliberate killing or capture of birds and the use of ""large scale or non-selective methods"" to capture the birds, however the Directive also gives certain circumstances in which this general prohibition may be derogated.
 When Malta joined the EU, the Accession Treaty gave a transition period in which it committed itself to phase out the prohibited bird trapping activities. Though Malta banned finch trapping, in 2014 it adopted a the recreational derogation regime which allowed the trapping of 7 species of wild finches as a recreational activity.
 However, in 2018 the European Court declared the regime to have failed to meet the required derogation conditions, particularly the small number/'knowledge gap' criterion which allowed Malta to repeal it. In 2020, Malta adopted the Finches Project under Framework Regulations which allowed the live capture of 7 wild finches once again but under the derogation for the purposes of research as stipulated by the Directive.
 That said, the European Commission saw it as a 'cover up' to enable to continuation of recreational finch trapping which, amongst other reasons, prompted the Commission to initiate a novel infringement action. On 3 December 2020, the Commission had issued Malta a letter of formal notice indicating that the Finches Project is inconsistent with the provisions of the Directive and that the derogation cited was unjustified.
 The Commission sent Malta a letter of formal notice indicating that the Finches Project is inconsistent with the provisions of the Directive and not justified by the derogation provided, that of serving research purposes and answering the research question, ""Where do finches that migrate over Malta during post-nuptial (autumn) migration come from?"".
 The Commission then gave its reasoned opinion of the grievances on 9 June 2021 through a formal notice. In response, following discussions between the two parties, Malta repealed Framework Regulations 2020 and adopted Framework Regulations 2021 on 19 October, 2021.
 On 20 December 2023, the Commission proceeded to lodge its application to the Courts requesting them to declare that Malta failed to uphold its obligations by the Directive. In response, Malta filed its defence on 21 April 2023 calling on the Court to dismiss the action on the basis of inadmissibility or, alternatively, as unfounded with an oral hearing being held at Luxembourg in March.
 Malta's defence reasoned that the action was inadmissible due to the change in national legislation between the issuing of the Commission's opinion and the filing of the application. However, the Commission's opinion referred to Malta's Finches Project as regulated by Framework Regulations 2020, whilst its application also challenged Framework Regulations 2021, which were a result of Malta's national amendments. Therefore, the Commission views both Framework Regulations as constituting the same conduct and therefore treats them collectively as one measure.
 The European Court found that by adopting a derogation allowing the live capture of individuals of 7 species of wild finches, Malta failed to fulfil its obligations under Articles 5, 8(1) 9(1) of Directive 2009/147 on the conservation of wild birds. Furthermore, it also found that The Finches Project does not establish a genuine research purpose and hence cannot be considered as being justified under the derogation of Article 9(1)(b) of the Directive.

[WATCH] A record of turtle nests,maltatoday,https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/130781/watch_a_record_of_turtle_nests,22-08-2024,"000252.png,000253.png","At least eight turtles have made Malta and Gozo’s beaches their nesting grounds this summer in what has turned out to be a record year.
 The most recent nesting observed at Ramla l-Ħamra in Gozo eclipsed the record established in 2020 when seven turtle nests were recorded.
 So far, 44 baby turtles have hatched from one of the nesting sites at Golden Bay with other nests expected to hatch in the coming weeks.
  Turtles started to nest more frequently on Maltese beaches over the past 12 years, a phenomenon that leaves bathers astonished and environmentalists happy.
 To understand this phenomenon, MaltaToday spoke with Stanley Gatt from the Nature Team within the Environment and Resources Authority (ERA). He explained that there are two primary hypotheses for the increase in turtle nesting in Malta.
  The nesting phenomenon could be linked to global warming, Gatt said. Temperature influences the sex of turtle hatchlings, with warmer conditions favouring females.
 “An increase in temperature leads to an increase of the female development rather than male development,” he stated.
 Another hypothesis is premised on the improvement in conservation measures like the increase in protection for turtle nests that improved the survivability of hatchlings. The exact viability of the nests cannot be determined until hatching occurs.
 Gatt said the hatching period has just begun. “We’re going to at least have another three weeks of hatching,” he said.
 In an average turtle nest, loggerhead turtles typically lay between 60 to 100 eggs, with a hatching success rate of about 75%. However, the survival rate of hatchlings reaching adulthood is lower, at around 6%.
 Gatt also noted that environmental NGOs also play an important role in the monitoring of nesting activities, with volunteers from Nature Trust and the Wildlife Rescue Team conducting surveillance on beaches during the night and early morning to identify nesting occurrences. There are currently over 200 volunteers monitoring the turtle nesting sites in Malta, with just above 100 volunteers in Gozo.
 The process to protect a nesting site is immediately done once a marking is confirmed. “The moment that these volunteers encounter either a nesting turtle or markings on the beach, it is checked and confirmed, and immediately it is physically cordoned off to ensure that there is no trampling on the nest,” Gatt said.
 Once a nest is confirmed, ERA issues an emergency conservation order to protect the sites from disturbance from activities occurring around the nesting sites.
 The public is encouraged to be mindful of activities that could negatively impact the nesting sites. This includes avoiding excessive noise and vibrations, refraining from camping in surrounding areas, and not placing umbrellas near nesting sites, as this can cast shadows on the nests. Additionally, it’s important to minimize light pollution, as excessive lighting can confuse hatchlings, leading them away from the sea.
 After the first baby turtles hatched, volunteers and environment officials will be on standby over the next few weeks for more hatchlings to emerge from beneath the sand as they start their brave journey to adulthood.  ",Juliana Zammit ,Environment
"Blooming Schools: How Malta’s youth and schools can lead the way for biodiversity

 Who is behind Blooming Schools? 
 BirdLife Malta coordinates the Blooming Schools project with support from Friends of the Earth Malta, St Nicholas College Dingli Secondary, and international partners like the Sociedade Portuguesa para o Estudo das Aves (SPEA, BirdLife Portugal), Agrupamento de Escolas de Portela e Moscavide in Portugal, Hellenic Ornithological Society (HOS, BirdLife Greece) and Station Europe in Romania. This collaborative network brought together educational and conservation expertise to make environmental learning a core part of school life. 
 When did it all begin? 
 Blooming Schools builds on BirdLife Malta's 30-year history of conservation education. Building on the success of their primary school program,  Dinja Waħda, BirdLife Malta sought to extend its impact to secondary schools, applying for Erasmus+ funding in 2021. With these resources, they began developing targeted materials for teens and teachers, inspiring them to continue their environmental journey from primary school through secondary school and beyond.

Environment Minister gets cold feet after seeing scale of Qajjenza development proposal,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/national/129964/environment_minister_gets_cold_feet_after_seeing_scale_of_qajjenza_development_proposal,28-06-2024,"000302.png,000303.png","Energy Minister Miriam Dalli whose portfolio includes the majority state owned Enemalta has distanced herself from a real estate project proposed on the decommissioned gas plant in Qajjenza.
 The residential development is being proposed by Paul Attard’s Plan Limited on land substantially owned by Enemalta.
 But although the plans for this development have been known since October last year, Dalli got cold feet today after MaltaToday published the visuals uploaded by the applicant on the Planning Authority’s website. The visuals show the massive scale of the project at Qajjenza.
 The minister said the government and Enemalta were not aware of this visual before it was uploaded by the developer and went on to describe the scale of the proposed development as “unacceptable” and called for it to be changed.
  “As soon as we have seen the visual we asked for its removal because Enemalta never issued its approval for it,” Dalli wrote on her Facebook.
 The visual itself presented by architect Stephan Vancell is based on plans earmarking the site for six blocks with a height of between 22m and 35.5m. The plans have been in public domain since October last year although the visuals were only published now.
 In her Facebook post Dalli insisted that Enemalta was never interested in “making land speculation on its own land and its sole interest is to give added value to the surrounding area and surely not to make things worse.”
 The minister’s comment suggests the government is now having misgivings on the type of project being proposed on the site.
 The visual presented by the developer also included a phantom block along the sea front which according to architect Stephan Vancell was only included to “merely show the potential height” of residential blocks which can be allowed in this area according to existing policies.
  Enemalta also issued a statement saying that it was never consulted on the visual representation and therefore it had never issued its approval.
 “Enemalta’s sole aim is to regenerate the land it owns in the best way possible,” the company said.
 When asked by MaltaToday about this project in November last year, Dalli defended Enemalta’s decision to give consent to a zoning application proposed by Attard on the Qajjenza site.

Autumn songbird trapping season opened today under ‘strictly monitored conditions’ - The Malta Independent ,independent,https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2024-10-20/local-news/Autumn-songbird-trapping-season-opened-today-under-strictly-monitored-conditions-6736265066,20-10-2024,000304.png,"
                
        

         The autumn songbird trapping season opened today under what the Gozo Ministry described as “strictly monitored conditions”, with seven species of birds able to be trapped.
 The Gozo Ministry, which is responsible for hunting, said that the Government's efforts to continue defending the Songbird Research Project yielded a positive result as, on September 19th, the European Court of Justice ruled on just one point from a list of alleged violations brought forward by the European Commission against Malta in Case C-23/23.  “The European Court of Justice based its decision on the content of the Legal Notices for 2020, 2021, and 2022, finding that these did not include a statement and justification regarding the lack of other satisfactory solutions. The European Court of Justice did not take a position on the other points raised by the European Commission, except to state that the Regulatory Framework (L.S. 549.145) is ‘clear and precise,’” the Ministry said.
 “After analysing the decision of the European Court of Justice, the Government committed to ensuring that the Legal Notice declaring the research period for autumn 2024 would include a statement and justification confirming that there is no other satisfactory solution to gather information about where the songbirds come from during the autumn migration, other than through the Research Project,” the Ministry continued
 It said that under this project, bird trappers capture songbirds using traps, check if they have a scientific ring, record the details on the ring form, release the birds from the same place, and report them using a toll-free phone system. The special license also encourages the trappers to send short videos showing the release of the migrating songbirds from the same place.
 The government said that the statement in the 2024 Legal Notice includes seven reasons that confirm and justify the lack of other satisfactory solutions to answer the Research Project's question: “Where do the songbirds that migrate over Malta in the autumn after the breeding season come from?”
 The reasons that were detailed by the Gozo Ministry in its statement are quoted below:
 “Therefore, the Government, after considering the recommendation of the Ornis Committee, is announcing the opening of the research period for the seven species of songbirds from today, October 20th, until December 20th, 2024, inclusive of both dates,” the Gozo Ministry said.
 It said that anyone participating in the songbird research project under the authorisation of a special license issued in their name will be obliged to release back into the wild any songbird they capture immediately after checking if it has a scientific ring and report it immediately (species and number) by calling the toll-free number 8000 2020 from a registered mobile number in their name or by using the mobile app Game Reporting MT. The systems will confirm the report by sending back an SMS as confirmation.
 They will also be obliged to record all the details on the ring form issued in their name, which is included with the special license, if they capture a songbird with a scientific ring; and report any bird that they capture with a scientific ring on the same day, as explained in the special license.
 They are encouraged to take a short video showing the release of the songbirds from the same location where they were captured, as explained in the special license, and also required to report their research effort every time they participate in the research project, even if no songbirds were captured, by calling the toll-free number 8000 2020 from a registered mobile number in their name or by using the mobile app Game Reporting MT, as explained in the special license.
 Anyone in possession of a special license for songbird research is legally obliged to observe all regulations related to this derogation, the ministry said.

ADPD presents proposals to tackle ongoing energy problems - The Malta Independent ,independent,https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2023-07-25/local-news/ADPD-presents-proposals-to-tackle-ongoing-energy-problems-6736253620,25-07-2023,000370.png,"

 In a press conference in front of the Ministry of Environment, Energy and Enterprise, ADPD-The Green Party presented its proposals on the ongoing energy problem, which led to a protest being called on 27 July at 7pm near Parliament.
 ADPD - The Green Party's Chairperson Sandra Gauci analysed the current issue at hand across Malta and Gozo. ""It is evident that the country is on its knees due to continuous power cuts. This means a huge burden on families and businesses. Everyone is affected, but the most affected are the vulnerable who are already crushed by inflation and wages that do not meet their basic needs.""
 ""Instead of costly massive projects and an economic policy based on overdevelopment and speculation, which led to an overburdened and inadequate infrastructure, we demand a wellbeing economy. Corruption in the energy sector has led to expenditure on a power station and abandonment of the electricity distribution network.""
 ""When it comes to the power cuts, the issue is that we use more energy when it's hot. There has been an increase of footprint in a plot, from one household to 20 flats due to laissez-faire planning rules. In simple terms, this means you might have twenty times more current being supplied from the same infrastructure - cables - that were used for much less before. In the wider picture, it is the addition of thousands of flats on land that has been available since the 2006 plans that is a contributing factor to the power cuts.""
 ""The government's economic policy currently seeks to gain as much as possible from the most vulnerable in society, including the added workers required to keep up with the demand for unbridled development. The government was happy to have cheap labour, but did not plan to adequately meet everyone's needs.""
 ""Finally, on a wider scale, we are feeling the effects of climate change. We are in a climate crisis. One government after another has failed to prepare for the effects of this crisis. There are no excuses, the Labour Government have had ten years to act, and instead they have simply ignored the crisis at hand to focus on their own economic gains.""
 ADPD - The Green Party PRO Brian Decelis laid out the concrete proposals of the party in the energy sector and related areas. He said that as a Green Party we ""recognise that everything is connected to each other, and impact on one another.""
 ""The actions he spoke about are: 1. Malta needs a smart grid, a stronger electricity distribution system will help to make the leap to renewable energy better; 2. A moratorium on big developments - the construction industry needs to be redimensioned to focus on the modernisation and renovation of buildings, not new builds; 3. Renovated buildings need to be zero-carbon, this means they generate all the energy that they need - in time all buildings in Malta need to be modernized to become zero-carbon buildings; 4. Make energy cooperatives a part of the energy plan - these cooperatives will provide for decentralised electricity sources from renewable energy; 5. Reverse the 2006 rationalisation plan - We need to hasten our pace towards zero-carbon communities and revise the local plans to meet sustainability and zero-carbon targets; 6. Make research on renewable energy and zero carbon a national priority - this is in view of the climate crisis; 7. Stop investing in fossil fuel infrastructure - this on both a national and EU level and includes stopping the gas pipeline project and investing in sustainable alternatives; 8. Oblige industries to move towards zero carbon operations; 9. Lead by example - Public buildings need to be modernised, zero-carbon, by generating all the electricity they need; 10 - Shift Malta to a wellbeing economy, one that is not based on the excessive use of natural resources, the exploitation of people, and dependence on imported energy,"" the party said.
 ADPD Deputy Chairperson Mina Jack Tolu encouraged the public and all those impacted by the power cuts to sign the a petition with ADPD's 10 concrete actions which will be delivered to Minister Miriam Dalli.
 Tolu said that ADPD expresses its solidarity with the Enemalta workers who have become the target and victims of a situation that has come about due to the carelessness of Ministers and the Government.
 Tolu concluded by appealing to everyone to join with ADPD - The Green Party in the protest against corruption, incompetence and carelessness on Thursday 27th July at 7pm in front of the Parliament in Valletta, and to sign the petition for action on energy, climate change and wellbeing economies.

"European Commission cannot intervene in Identita scandal, but Home Affairs Commissioner is concerned - The Malta Independent ",independent,https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2024-10-17/local-news/European-Commission-cannot-intervene-in-Identita-scandal-but-Home-Affairs-Commissioner-is-concerned-6736264983,17-10-2024,000420.png,"
                
        

         The European Commission does not have the ability to intervene in the criminal matters or the administration or the judiciary of any individual European Union member state, European Home Affairs Commissioner Ylva Johansson said to Nationalist Party MEP David Casa in a letter on Thursday.
 Johansson was replying to letters that Casa had previously sent in which he had expressed concerns about the allegations of ID card fraud and corruption within Identita. Johansson acknowledged that Casa was concerned that the alleged fraudulent scheme would allow the fraudulent access of third-country nationals to the EU, therefore posing security risks to the Schengen area, including Malta.  The Home Affairs Commissioner said that she shares Casa’s concerns regarding allegations of corruption, and continued that “the Commission takes the fight against corruption very seriously”. She spoke of how the Commission published the fifth EU Rule of Law report on 24th July 2024 which she said included the most recent developments regarding the fight against corruption and provided concrete recommendations to confront systemic weaknesses.
 On the matter of the alleged forgery of documentation in the issuing of residence permits, Johansson said that it is extremely important for the security of all EU member states that all necessary checks are carried out before a residence permit is issued to non-EU nationals. She continued that this is important “as a residence permit grants certain rights to third-country nationals to travel in the Schengen area”. She expressed that a robust identity management is fundamentally important for an effective and sustainable migration process.
 With that said, she continued that under the EU legal migration acquis, the fraudulent acquisition of residence permits is a ground of rejection and withdrawal of such permits, and added that member states are obligated to withdraw residence permits if it is discovered that documents presented as part of the application were fraudulently acquired, falsified, or tampered with.
 Johansson acknowledged that the Maltese authorities have initiated an investigation into the matter, including an ongoing magisterial inquiry. She said that the Commission will continue to monitor the situation.
 Peter Agius requests European evaluation on Identity Malta in meeting with European Commissioner Ilva Johansson
 Separately, PN MEP Peter Agius met with European Commissioner Ilva Johansson to discuss the ongoing scandal of fraudulent identity card documents by Identity Malta. 
 ""Up to 18,000 fraudulent identity cards were allegedly issued by Identity Malta over the past years in an organised 'documents for money' racket resulting in the erosion of public trust in Malta's identity card system which ultimately gives freedom of movement to the whole European Union Schengen area,"" a statement by the EPP read.
 In the meeting on Thursday at the Headquarters of the European Commission in Brussels, MEP Peter Agius said: ""To restore trust in our ID cards system we need concrete public action. Unfortunately, Government remains in denial. PN's calls for action fell on deaf ears. I am thus calling on the European Commission to assist with its technical tools to review current practices at Identity Malta through an evaluation as per the Schengen Regulation.'' 
 The Schengen Evaluation and Monitoring Mechanism in Regulation 2022/922 provides ]for general or thematic evaluations to assess current practices at local authorities in charge of administering the Schengen rules, the statement read.
 European Commissioner for Home Affairs Ilva Johansson enquired about the situation in Malta and stressed that local authorities are indeed on the frontline of ensuring that free movement rules are implemented, the EPP statement said.
 ""The European Commission can help us improve our enjoyment of European rights. We must not shy away from using EU tools to improve local practices where these are evidently failing us. This is why the Maltese joined the UE after all, to improve our quality of life including our security. Government's insistence to deny public action on the massive failure with Malta's ID card system amounts to obstinate arrogance. As an elected MEP from Malta and Gozo I will use all EU tools at hand to Malta's benefit,"" concluded Dr Peter Agius.
