Portelli bid to sanction illegal pools ‘mockery of justice’ - Graffitti,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/portelli-bid-sanction-illegal-pools-mockery-justice-graffitti.1096407,08-07-2024,000088.png,"Activists have slammed a bid by developer Joseph Portelli to sanction his illegal Qala pools as a “mockery of justice” facilitated by authorities who bend over backwards to please “greedy developers”. 
 A fresh sanctioning application has been filed for the controversial swimming pools, which were built outside the development zone in Qala, after a court  revoked its planning permission in March. 
 But Moviment Graffitti said on Wednesday that this fresh attempt to legitimise the pools is a sign of Malta’s planning system sinking to “new lows of indecency” and said that the courts were “unequivocal” in saying that the pools were not compatible with the rural area. 
 “Given that illegal structures can only be sanctioned if they conform to current planning policies, Portelli’s second application to sanction these pools, after such a categorical Court ruling, is a blatant mockery of our justice system,” they said. 
 “This affront to justice is facilitated by the Government and its authorities, who have consistently bent over backwards to satisfy the greed of developers.”
 In June, Graffiti hosted a flash protest at the site of the pools and spraypainted the word “illegal” in big red letters all over the bottom of one of them. 
 The point of this protest, they said, was to highlight how the government has failed to curb what they called Portelli’s “bullying tactics” and failed to reform the flawed planning appeals system, which allows developers to start working on a project despite having an appeal pending. 
 This has led to a situation like the one in Qala where projects end up being completed after the courts revoke their permits. 
 “As we stated during our direct action, and reiterate now, this planning system is intentionally rigged in favour of developers,” they said. 
 “The Government is effectively enforcing impunity for developers by allowing them to construct structures that are illegal or potentially illegal, and then failing to take meaningful action against these violations. In the case of Qala, the Planning Authority has not even restricted access to the pools, which remain fully operational despite their clear illegality.”
 They expressed disappointment that there is still no sign of reform in planning appeals as promised by Robert Abela. 
 They once again called for Portelli’s illegal pools in Qala to be demolished and reform enacted without delay. 
 “Moviment Graffitti is prepared to take further direct action if the people's call for basic decency in planning continues to fall on deaf ears.”

PA suspends decision on seven-floor Sa Maison block as protests mount,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/pa-suspends-decision-sevenfloor-sa-maison-block-protests-mount.1097278,27-08-2024,"000217.png,000218.png,000219.png","The planning authority has suspended a decision over an application to transform a former retirement home in Sa Maison into a seven-storey block of 48 seafront apartments.
 The application – PA 04281/23 – requested the demolition of the ex-Sa Maison residential home and a neighbouring dilapidated warehouse. Instead, two levels will be excavated underground for parking, one floor will be dedicated to retail establishments and another seven (that include the receded top floor) to residential apartments.
 The building will rise 26 metres above street level, replacing the abandoned retirement home for the elderly that is six storeys high. Dimitri Sturdza from Heritage Holdings Ltd applied for the proposed development that lies on Triq ix-Xatt, Pietà, corner with Sqaq Borton. The project architect is Michael Anastasi.
  Although the project was recommended for approval, the planning board suspended the decision after hearing several objections from residents. Board members also raised their concerns that centred around the scheduled buildings in the area as well as height limitations.
 One objector was Pieta resident Joseph Magro Conte who said that residents were not objecting to the redevelopment of the site. However, this proposed development was excessive. The dense proposal would impact the quality of life of residents as, apart from exceeding building heights, it would lead to overdevelopment, congestion and parking issues.
 He said it also ignored the cultural heritage element in the area. He noted that, according to the NSO, Pieta was the third area with the highest population density despite its small size. He said that planning ought to improve community and quality of life and this proposal would do nothing of the sort.
 Malcolm Mifsud, also a resident, agreed that the new project would pose as overdevelopment. The former retirement home was already a dominant development approved in 1988 - the new development proposed would make it even more dominant.
 This is “pure speculation”, he said.
  Fr David Cortis, from St Augustine College, said that the main objection was to the height – almost four or five storeys above the normal height in that area. There were two scheduled properties adjacent to the site so one had to keep the skyline in mind.
 The extra floors would tower over the playgrounds and classrooms used by classrooms.
 “The open areas of our college would be engulfed,” he said, adding “we should be working towards improving quality of life. There should be development but within certain parameters.”
 Project architect Michael Anastasi said there was a misconception about the volume of development. Most of the objectors, he said, spoke about the massive size, but the proposal was lower and less impactful than the existing building.
 He stressed that the parking provided was at a surplus to that required. The client would be excavating – beneath sea level which was very expensive – to provide parking.
 The project would be regenerating what is now a dilapidated area, he said. He added that project would not be overlooking the school as the volume was almost identical as the current building.
 The case was suspended to allow the architect to further consult with the Superintendence for Cultural Heritage and Enemalta and tweak designs accordingly.

Blank walls 'only temporary' says architect seeking Swieqi pencil development,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/blank-walls-temporary-architect-seeking-swieqi-pencil-development.1098058,13-09-2024,"000380.png,000381.png,000382.png","An architect seeking to build a pencil development among a row of Swieqi townhouses replied to residents' concerns about raising blank party walls by saying that they were ""only temporary"". 
 Architect Christian Spiteri said that just because a few houses along the street did not want to develop their property, it did not give them the right the prevent his client from doing so. 
 Spiteri, on behalf of applicant Christopher Stanley, was arguing in favour of a planning application that wants to demolish a terraced house in Triq il-Ħemel in Swieqi and build a block of five flats instead. 
 A group of residents as well as the local council have been vocal in their opposition to the project. 
 But during a sitting discussing the case on Friday, Spiteri said that their plans for the site must be evaluated in the correct context. 
 He said the application was to develop in the context of that scheme and would maintain consistency in the area - that was no longer a two-storey terraced house area.
 He insisted that the application observed the height limitations in the local plan.
 “Just because there are 10 owners that do not want to develop their house, it does not mean they have a supreme right to change the applications of others like my client,” he said adding that the houses were not of some architectural heritage that deserved some form of special protection.
 He also said that the blank party walls were temporary and would not remain there forever as adjacent buildings could be developed.
 This earned him a swift rebuke from Swieqi mayor Noel Muscat. 
 “The way you’re talking is the proper destruction of Malta: 'Let’s go ahead and keep destroying'. On the contrary, we are saying: 'Let’s save what we can',"" he said. 
 During the sitting, Timothy Bartolo and Tara Cassar, who represented residents, said this project exceeded the height limitation for the area by two storeys and would create blank party walls on both sides. This would ruin the streetscape. 
  They also argued that the project would be in breach of an agreement made with the Archbishop’s Curia.
 The terraced house in question was built on a plot of land known as Art Tal-Kbira originally granted by the Archbishop’s Curia to engaged couples to construct terraced houses.
 This was a contractual obligation which remained when Church properties were transferred to the Joint Office, they argued.
 The objectors also cited a landmark court decision in which, last year, the Court of Appeal overturned a decision to allow a terraced house, in a row of 20 terraced houses in Triq il-Ġibjun, Santa Luċija, to be demolished and turned into four apartments and a penthouse.
 The court ruled that just because the local plan’s height limitation permitted buildings of the height applied for, it did not mean that the permit ought to be granted. Any new building had to respect the context of the buildings it was located in.
 Mayor Noel Muscat said Swieqi had a big problem with overpopulation and new blocks were being rented out as short lets.
 “The planning authority does not get into it, but it should because short lets are of a commercial nature and they are disturbing the locality tremendously - there is vandalism, disturbance at night and problems with waste management,” he said adding: “We are not against all development, but there must be a balance between the locality and the short let population.”
 The case was deferred to October 25.

3pm is peak time when children get run over – police,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/3pm-peak-time-children-get-run-police.1093982,15-06-2024,000491.png,"Three o’clock in the afternoon is the peak time when children get run over, according to police data, which showed that over 300 children were hit by vehicles on Maltese roads in the past decade.
 A third of these children were under the age of seven, with the youngest victims being four one-year-olds.
 The data showed that most of the children – that ranged from the one-year-olds to 17-year-olds – were hit at 3pm (34 children), a time that coincides with the time when many schools end. This time was followed by 6pm (32) and 5pm (28) – times associated with the evening rush hour.
 Most accidents happened in Birkirkara (28) followed by St Paul’s Bay (19). The latter was the locality where the most recent accident occurred on Thursday when an eight-year-old boy was grievously injured after being hit by a car in Triq it-Tamar at around 6pm.
 This followed another two accidents on June 11 when two boys were seriously injured in separate traffic accidents: a 13-year-old boy was hit by a car in Santa Luċija and a 12-year-old in Pembroke.
 On April 29, an 11-year-old girl was seriously injured in Mġarr and, on April 22, a five-year-old boy was grievously injured when hit by a car in Naxxar.
  Police data showed that, since 2014, there were 334 accidents in which children under 17 were run over.
 Most of the cases resulted in light injuries but 110 cases – that is one in three cases – were classified as grievous injuries. There was one fatality in 2015 when a 13-year-old was hit by a car in Swieqi at 3.35pm.
 Data showed that boys are twice more likely to be hit by a car than girls, with 218 boys as opposed to 113 girls (in three cases, the gender was not registered).
 A look at the ages showed that 17-year-olds were the most accident prone as they were the age group with the highest number of total accidents (29) but also had the most grievous injuries (15). One hundred and twenty-nine child pedestrians between the ages of 13 and 17 were injured in traffic accidents since 2014.
 Data showed that 134 children under the age of 10 were injured.
 There were a significant number of accidents involving children under four.
 Over the past decade, four one-year-olds, nine two-year-olds and 16 three-year-olds were hit by cars. There were also 20 four-year-olds, 19 five-year-olds and 23 six-year-olds.
 The year 2019 saw the most accidents, with 38 children being run over, followed by 2022 and 2023, with 37 each year. This year, so far, there have been 16 accidents in which children were hit by cars. 2020 and 2021 had the least accidents, possibly due to the coronavirus pandemic that kept many indoors through online schooling.

Għadira watersport operators probed by transport regulator,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/tm-investigating-alleged-illegal-activities-watersport.1096796,16-08-2024,000505.png,"Transport Malta is investigating reports of alleged illegal activities by watersport facility operators at Għadira Bay. 
 Private boat owners who wish to anchor at the popular bay during the summer season have complained of harassment from these operators.
 Speaking anonymously to Times of Malta, one boat owner described how a company has “practically taken over the entire bay illegally by placing several unregistered and illegal moorings, charging boaters a daily fee for using them”. 
  He and others who refused to pay were allegedly driven out of the bay, with one operator “hurling expletives” and displaying “very aggressive behaviour for simply anchoring in a spot where he was planning to cram in more boats”.
 A spokesperson for Transport Malta said the Maritime Enforcement Unit is actively investigating several reports of irregularities at Għadira Bay. 
 “The investigation is still ongoing as more details and information are being gathered,” the spokesperson stated.
 One reader recounted how, on Sunday morning, he was told off by an operator because “we had not booked a mooring in advance”. 
 The boater said that later in the day, after finding an empty spot, the same operator returned, hurling abuse and obscenities. 
 “What irritated me most was the way he thinks he owns the sea,” he said.
 Concerns have also been raised about the safety of bathers and boaters due to the illegal moorings, which have been deployed so close to each other that they leave little space for other boaters to anchor freely. 
 Some moorings have even been installed within the ferry way in the swimmers’ zone, an area meant to remain unobstructed for safe passage.
 Transport Malta confirmed that watersport companies are not permitted to rent moorings in public bays, although they can apply for mooring permits for their commercial vessels. 
 While no standard distance between moorings is established, a safe operational space should be maintained between vessels, according to the agency. 
 The Moorings and Berthings Unit monitors the situation and reports illegal activities to the Maritime Enforcement Unit and the police, who then take enforcement action as necessary.

Demonstrators to Abela: Stop PA's backdoor approval of illegal developments,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/demonstrators-abela-stop-pa-backdoor-sanctioning-illegal-developments.1097457,31-08-2024,"000811.png,000812.png,000813.png","A coalition of NGOs and resident groups want Robert Abela to stop the Planning Authority from sanctioning illegal developments.
 In a press conference outside Castille on Saturday morning the groups said that the prime minister’s lack of action in this matter is overseeing a “power seizure” by developers over the country’s planning and justice system.
 The issue came to prominence recently after the PA sanctioned a development which had been declared illegal and stripped of its permit by a Court of Appeals just months prior.
 That decision sparked outrage and triggered an Ombudsman investigation, as well as a formal appeal into the sanctioning application.
 Moviment Graffitti activist Andre Callus said that Malta's already rotten planning system was being plunged to new depths by the Planning Authority. 
 He said that the developer behind the sanctioned development that made headlines, Gozo magnate Joseph Portelli, has three other illegal construction projects which currently have sanctioning applications before the PA. 
 “Sanctioning procedures are meant for cases where structures conform to existing policies. Yet, in these four instances, Court rulings have clearly stated that they do not,” Callus said.
 “The PA’s processing and approval of these applications undermines the entire planning and judicial process, turning it into a sham procedure where laws, regulations, and even Court rulings are disregarded to appease powerful developers.”
 This status quo, he added, gravely undermines the rule of law and threatens people’s ability to meaningfully challenge the PA’s decisions. 
 Callus said that this scandal is tied to the fact that this far the government has failed to meaningfully reform the planning appeals process, despite Abela promising several times that he would do so. 
  The law allows developers to begin construction on buildings which are still under appeal, thus creating a situation in which illegal structures are built and remain in place even after the court rules against them. 
 Din l-Art Ħelwa president Patrick Calleja explained that in the past four months, four sanctioning applications located in Gozo had been filed by entities connected to Joseph Portelli, and in every instance, they had already been built when the courts revoked their planning permits. 
 He said the court had primarily revoked these permits because they did not conform to planning policy. 
 However, in the case of the Sannat permit, this was granted through a summary procedure. 
 This means that rather than basing the sanctioning application on an assessment by the planning commission, the decision is based on the recommendation of the PA’s executive chairman, who must declare that the building does in fact confirm to existing planning policies. 
  When PA boss Oliver Magro made the recommendation for the Sannat application, it did not conform to planning policy as clearly stated by the court, Calleja said. 
 “The planning minister must explain why the PA accepted this summary application when it knew the penthouses didn’t conform to policy,” Calleja said. 
 Luke Said from the NGO Għawdix said it was beyond belief that normal citizens must fight tooth and nail for rights that should be obvious and simple, such as not allowing construction to go ahead while a building is under appeal and following the directions of a court judgement. 
 “This situation is incredulous and denies us the right to shape our own environment as we see fit. It is a shame that this has happened in a democratic country,” he said. 
 Astrid Vella of Flimkien Għal Ambjent Aħjar said that the PA’s decision to sanction the Sannat penthouses not only goes against its own mission statement and is in violation of a number of international treaties Malta is signatory to, but has far-reaching implications for the state of the rule of law in the country. 
 “Almost every day the Maltese people are forced to endure another insult to the planning system that further plunges it into crises,” she said. 
 “Not only is this eroding our legal rights as citizens, but its implications go beyond the environment. If an entity can simply ignore a decision handed down by the Chief Justice, then it sets a precedence that he can be ignored in other areas as well.""
 She added that the ongoing construction frenzy is having an impact on the public's physical and mental health. 
  “[PA Boss] Oliver Magro should open his eyes,” Callus said. 
 “We know that these people take their directions from others, but as we’ve seen in court proceedings related to the hospitals deal, people who put into motion the criminal actions of others are having to answer for their deeds as well.” 
 Prior to being appointed PA chair, Magro served as part of Prime Minister Robert Abela's legal team.
 Abela's government this week announced that it would be presenting a law that would prohibit construction projects from going ahead until the appeals process has been exhausted.
 The prime minister had made a similar pledge back in September 2023, saying at the time that his cabinet ""has approved"" such a law. Nothing more was heard about it until this week's statement.  
 Speaking on Saturday, Callus said he would reserve judgment until details concerning the law were divulged. 
 “We’re ready to participate in consultation, but we’ll believe it when we see it,” he said. 
 Callus said the NGOs are calling for the government to take the following steps immediately:

Self-employed cab drivers to protest over 'injustice' of saturated market,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/selfemployed-cab-drivers-protest-injustice-saturated-market.1093278,31-05-2024,000961.png,"Updated 6.25pm
 Self-employed cab drivers will again protest this Monday over what they say is ""injustice"" perpetuated against them by government authorities. 
 They will meet in front of Paul Boffa Hospital at 4 pm and march to the office of the Prime Minister at Castille. 
 Aron Gatt, who heads a lobby representing drivers, said the self-employed feel shortchanged as the ""y-plate"" market has become oversaturated.
 ""Competition did not grow organically but illegitimately. Transport Malta and other authorities flooded the market by allowing companies to expand their fleet to hundreds of cars even though they are not in line with regulations,"" Gatt, president of the Light Passenger Operators Association (LPOA), said.
 He said that some of Malta's largest fleets do not have off-street parking for their cabs but are still allowed to operate. 
 Fleets have not only abused the system but pushed up insurance premiums due to accidents caused by drivers not used to local roads, Gatt said. 
 ""In 2020, we were paying around 700 a year in insurance; now, people are paying around 2,000. One person I know pays almost 4,000 yearly,"" he said. 
 As a result, self-employed cab drivers are only scraping by and earning just over the minimum wage when accounting for costs, Gatt said. 
 In February, the Light Passenger Operators Association (LPOA) also organised a protest over low prices on cab platforms like Bolt, Uber and e-Cabs. 
 They drove in a slow car cade from Ta Qali to Marsa as a show of force. 
 They are organising another protest because the association feels it has been unheard by authorities. 
 ""We've had meetings with the government but nothing has changed,"" he said. 
 Companies with large fleets make up the vast majority of the Maltese cab market. 
 A Parliamentary Question from last November shows that over 60 employers have a fleet of over 10 cars. Three of those have more than a hundred Y-plated cars. 
 The largest fleet in Malta is WT Global with 269 cars. 
 In comments to Times of Malta late on Friday, a spokesperson for the Transport Ministry said it had met representatives of the Light Passenger Operators Association on various instances and communication with stakeholders remained ongoing.
 ""The minister reiterates that his doors remain open to operators and to entertain discussions in good faith to discuss solutions. 
 ""While drivers have every right to protest, the government urges operators to continue to assist the authority in bettering the situation.""

'I cannot recall a day like yesterday': Emergency doc on triple road fatalities,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/i-cannot-recall-day-like-yesterday-emergency-doc-triple.1097341,28-08-2024,000764.png,"Updated 5.30pm
 An emergency doctor who on Tuesday assisted in three fatal accidents said he could not recall the last time his team dealt with three fatalities from three separate accidents in one day.
 “There have been motor accidents with three fatalities, but we cannot recall a day like yesterday. It took a toll on us all,"" emergency doctor Michael Spiteri told Times of Malta. 
 On Tuesday, three people died on Maltese roads. Balu Ganesh Balakrisha, 40, died in a head-on collision in Żebbuġ in the morning. Hours later,  77-year-old Carmen Buttigieg was hit by a van in Qormi and in the evening  Cristi Robles died at around 11pm following a motorcycle crash in Rabat. 
 Her death was the eighth traffic fatality this year. The death toll is similar to last year's.
 Spiteri said that while what happened on Tuesday was not a trend, the three fatalities should be an important lesson for the public to prioritise their safety. 
 “We don’t have a safety culture in Malta. Safety is given the lowest ranking in priority in different sectors, not just driving,” Spiteri said. 
 “Wearing a seatbelt, reducing speed, wearing helmets, not consuming substances when driving and not driving when tired are all safety measures we should keep in mind,” he said. 
 When asked if emergency doctors have seen an increase in more fatal accidents caused by drunk driving or overspeeding, Spiteri said different factors play into what leads to a tragedy. 
 He said there are now more cars on the road, and he has noticed people are less mindful.
 ""We do see people driving under the influence, however, we also see people who are over-worked, over-tired and less patient. We are seeing a nation losing its mindfulness and peace and this impacts how we are on the road.""
 Speaking on behalf of his colleagues, Spiteri said a day like Tuesday impacts the emergency team psychologically and physically. 
 ""It's the middle of summer, and we are working against the clock to get to the victims. That can be very draining on a person,"" he said. 
 He explained that in between accidents, the team races back to the hospital to restock and be prepared for the next critical call.
 ""Our job is to save people, and on days like Tuesday, we start to ask what we did wrong. But we must understand that there are injuries which will be very bad and little can be done about them.""
 Spiteri added that the public should remember that behind every death, there is a family.
 ""We all have a social responsibility to be kinder with our words,"" he said, referring to the harsh comments posted online following a road fatality.
 In a statement on Wednesday afternoon, Doctors for Road Safety said the loss of life of three people within 24 hours was tragic but also ""potentially preventable"".
 ""The dynamics of these fatal crashes seem to be different and should ideally be investigated by the planned Transport Safety Investigative Commission, which to date has not yet been set up.
 ""Only then can we plan on the best interventions to optimise road safety and achieve our vision of zero deaths on our roads.""

Local plan change expected to 'multiply' Villa Rosa project size,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/local-plan-change-expected-multiply-villa-rosa-project-size.1099190,10-09-2024,"000865.png,000866.png,000867.png,000868.png","The floor ratio of plans to redevelop the Villa Rosa site in St Julian’s could multiply in size after the cabinet on Tuesday formally approved a partial review of the St George’s Bay local plans.
 Sources said the amendment would mean that the project submitted by Anthony Camilleri, known as Tal-Franċiż, will grow exponentially from the original 57,000 square metres proposed.
 It is now up to the Planning Authority to formally start the process to amend the local plans, which should include a public consultation process. The current local plans only allow smaller and lower developments.
  Camilleri originally obtained a planning permit back in 2018 to develop the prime St George's Bay site into a combination of low-rise offices, residences and shops.
 Before that development got under way, he submitted proposals to dramatically upsize the project, introducing a hotel and high-rise buildings. 
 An Environmental Impact Assessment last year had already concluded that the planned mega-development of a 34-storey tower and two 27-storey ones overlooking St George’s Bay in St Julian’s would have major impacts on the environment and air quality, both during construction and operation. It found that the likely impacts of the development were “high”.
 That proposal is still pending, with the Planning Authority yet to decide whether or not to issue a permit for it. 
  Details of the partial review of local plans approved by cabinet this week remain scarce. It is not known whether the review will allow the developer to introduce taller buildings into the area, or expand its built footprint. 
 One source said allowing the developer to increase the project's floor ratio could also mean more public squares being incorporated into the project.
 A government source said the issue was first raised in cabinet two months ago. Various MPs immediately raised concerns.
 “The proposal was dismissed at first, but it’s been presented again. This time it’s been decided that local plans will be tweaked to facilitate the project. Clearly, greed has no limits,” said the source.
 
 Another cabinet member said the review of the local plans would ""multiply"" the permitted size of the project and reduce, if not eradicate any legal challenges the project may face, should there be any.
 Yet another cabinet member said there was general discomfort among MPs about the proposed changes but “many of us were resigned it was a foregone conclusion”.
 Questioned about the proposed plans on Monday night, Prime Minister Robert Abela kept his cards to his chest.
 He said cabinet discussions are privileged and confidential.
 “Even if what you asked me is correct, we’d need another round of discussions before it is confirmed. I believe that the discussion would be wider than that,” Abela said when asked to confirm a change in local plans.
 Instead, the prime minister spoke about the need to diversify and elevate Malta's offering to tourists. 
  “We have reached the critical tourism mass the country needs. And I do not think we can continue with increasing the numbers… The discussions should be how to attract tourists of quality and we can do this by giving them a product that they can only get here and not in another country.
 “We need to invest in infrastructure in hotels, restaurants, and shops that sell brands, and we know how much competition we have with our neighbouring countries. The debate needs to be there.”
 The larger of the sites is currently occupied by Palazzo Villa Rosa together with a small hotel, a mix of retail and food & beverage outlets as well as Dolphin House, which used to be a language school and Moynihan House, which is currently unused.
 The other site is currently occupied by a beach club, Cresta Quay, and rocky terrain.
  The proposed development is being promoted by Anton Camilleri on behalf of Garnet Investments Limited which forms part of the AC Group of companies which is involved in property development, quarrying, and chainsaw cutting.
 Villa Rosa and its grounds were designed by one of Malta’s more prominent early 20th-century architects, Andrea Vassallo, who made a name for himself as the designer of the domes of the Saint Cajetan and Saint Nicholas parish churches in Ħamrun and Siġġiewi respectively, the Ta’ Pinu Sanctuary in Għarb.
 The site is located close to the massive db Group development, which will incorporate a five-star Hard Rock Hotel. The foundation stone of the project was laid last week.
 In a reaction to the Times of Malta revelations, independent election candidate Arnold Cassola said on Wednesday that this was a case where the private interests of developers were put before that of residents. 
 ""The lives of tens of thousands of residents in Pembroke, Swieqi, St.Julian's and Sliema are going to be negatively impacted forever,"" he said, calling for public protest.

Airport boss warns of queues amid ‘staggering’ passenger numbers,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/airport-boss-warns-queues-amid-staggering-passenger-numbers.1094014,17-06-2024,"000940.png,000941.png","The Malta International Airport CEO has warned people to expect queues this summer as the “staggering numbers” of passengers has pushed it to its “extreme limits”. 
 Alan Borg told Times of Malta that passenger projections had been “completely off”, with the airport seeing record passenger numbers every month this year.
 And staff have been working hard to ensure the busiest season of the year goes smoothly, with work to upgrade the airport racing to catch up with the numbers of holidaymakers. 
 “Admittedly, we were probably too cautious with our numbers. So, what is happening now is our development is not in line with our passenger numbers,” he said. 
 Last year, the airport handled 7.8 million passengers - a national record - and in January it said it expected to welcome 8 million in 2024. But it is set to smash past that target after several months of higher-than-expected passenger numbers. 
 Results from last month show passenger numbers at 800,000 – beating the same month last year by over 70,000 people.
 The airport is installing signage and assigning staff to help passengers have a reasonable experience. 
 “Queues are to be anticipated,” he said. “Passengers are therefore advised to check in online if possible and not to arrive more than two hours before departure.”
 Borg said the airport is at “full throttle” on planned upgrades, which will “effectively double the footprint” of the airport. 
 The work includes separating and expanding the area dedicated to arrivals from outside the Schengen Area – a borderless region covering 29 European countries – and expanding MIA’s standing aircraft capacity by a third by next year. 
 Borg stressed that while they were busily under way, most passengers would “hardly realise there is any development going on at all”, stressing the airport was “putting in a lot of effort” to ensure passengers were not impacted by noise or construction dust.     
 Asked about overcrowding in the departures area following the interview, the airport said it “acknowledges the challenges posed by overcrowding” during peak times which it admitted had led to a shortage of seating at times. 
 It said it was “devising a plan to reconfigure the seating layout” to increase capacity by next year.
 The MIA CEO said the higher passenger numbers reflected a strong post-COVID recovery. New airlines have started flying from Malta and existing operators are beefing up their presence, with flight numbers increasing dramatically. 
 “We have at least 14 new connections coming online, including to existing destinations,” he said, noting that flights to Poland and the UK, for example, were set to increase by 40% and 20% respectively.
  Stressing that while the airport used to see around 11 departures in the morning with another peak in the afternoon, he said it was now seeing up to 24 departures per hour on some days. With so many passengers passing through MIA and flights increasing, does Borg expect any issues with baggage handling? 
 “Honestly, we did have issues in the past. [But] I think overall, we’re seeing that our handlers are gearing up for the summer,” he said.
 “Although it’s hard for me to promise there will be no issues – because we are operating at our extreme limits – I feel we are well-equipped to face the summer operation.” 
 But with MIA already seeing rafts of new tourists while working to upgrade its capacity, how does Borg respond to concerns of over-tourism placing a strain on the country’s infrastructure? 
 “I don’t think that the sky’s the limit; Malta has to have sustainable growth. The last thing we want to do as an island is infringe on the quality of the guests that come here with the volumes coming here,” he said. 
 Emphasising the importance of attracting “higher value” tourism and increasing footfall in winter months, Borg said he thought it was wrong to measure the success of the sector by tourist numbers alone. 
 “It shouldn’t be double-digit growth year-on-year… we would rather grow organically than simply looking at this financial year and seeing record number of tourists without taking any notice of what’s going on around us,” he said, calling the approach “a mistake”.
 On airline expansion at MIA, Borg said Easyjet had almost doubled its routes this summer with aviation newcomer Universal Air flying to nine destinations and other airlines including Air Baltic, Ryanair, ITA and Jet2 also operating new routes. 
 Asked if he agreed with Ryanair boss Michael O’Leary’s assertion last year that his airline was “probably the unofficial airline of Malta”, Borg disagreed, saying while Ryanair was a “fundamental player”, accounting for almost half of the airport’s activity, he placed more importance on ownership than market share.
 “KM Malta Airlines has the government as the main shareholder. So, I still veer to the shareholding side rather than on who has the largest [market] share,” he said. 
 Asked about the transition from Air Malta to KM Malta Airlines, Borg said it had been “seamless”.
 The expansion works at MIA will also see it prepare to accommodate new EU border controls requiring airports to record biometric data, including fingerprints, of all arrivals from non-EU countries. 
 Earlier this week, fears were raised that Malta could be suspended from the Schengen Area if it fails to have the Entry/Exit System (EES) in place by the November deadline to implement it, after lawyer Jason Azzopardi warned the project had been “completely ignored” by the police. 
 Quizzed about the fears, the airport said the police were responsible for the new border system, but that it was “working closely” with the police to make sure the system was ready in time. 
 Responding to questions on Monday morning, a spokesperson for the Home Affairs Ministry said a tender for the system was pending and ""scheduled to be fully adjudicated in the coming days.""
 He said the project had encountered ""challenges"" after the provider for the current border controls told police ""at the eleventh hour"" that the system was not compatible with EES, leading the police to issue a call for a new system. 
 ""Following a first call in which no bids were received, a second procurement process is currently in its final stages,"" the spokesperson said, adding technical experts were ""all hands-on-deck"" to ensure the system was in place by the November deadline.
 With EU countries under pressure to reduce their emissions, Borg stresses that there are bigger pollutants than the airline industry, which he says accounts to 8% of total greenhouse pollution in the travel industry.
 “Having said that, it doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t do our best and we’re making sure that our pledge to be net zero by 2050 will be honoured,” he said, pointing to initiatives such as installing fields of solar panels at the airport.  
 
 But with occasional fears raised over possible risks to pilots encountering glare from solar panels, is it wise to install them so close to an area where planes are taking off and landing?
 “It’s more an air traffic control issue, that we need to make sure that there is no refraction with their equipment... [But] we do thorough studies on where these panels are installed to make sure that it has no impact whatsoever.”

Three years and counting: Manikata residents' roadworks hell,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/three-years-counting-manikata-residents-roadworks-hell.1092846,22-05-2024,"000963.png,000964.png","Roadworks in and around Manikata will be completed by the end of June, Infrastructure Malta has pledged, ending a three-year saga for residents of the hamlet.
 The €9 million project to upgrade the roads and the water network in the area has left residents “imprisoned” in their hamlet with the road from the St Paul’s Bay bypass leading to Għajn Tuffieħa “inaccessible 90% of the time”, residents said.
 An owner of a shop in the area, who preferred to be unnamed, claimed to have lost an average of €50,000 a month since January from passing trade. He said he simply could not afford more road closures.
 Residents criticised the lack of communication from authorities and described how roads would be closed off without any prior notification or warning.
 “We have had to make do with our own internal communication, advising each other on the updated road opening and closures,” one resident said.
 A residents’ association was formed in November to try to tackle the road closures linked to the project around Manikata, Għajn Tuffieħa, Mġarr and the Xemxija area.
 Families with young children often had to go through either Mġarr or Mellieħa to get to St Paul’s Bay, and the state of the roads damaged cars and tyres.
 The imminent completion time announced by IM will not mean all will be over for residents as a final phase at the junction of Triq Għajn Tuffieħa, part of the road heading towards Mġarr, is scheduled to follow in October.
  Residents have criticised an “insensitive” government, Infrastructure Malta, Transport Malta, the Water Services Corporation, ministers and MPs and the “incompetent” Mellieħa local council, which Manikata residents claim has ignored their continuous cries.
 The residents want a bypass created outside the hamlet to avoid all traffic going through its narrow roads and their dangerous blind spots.
 Mellieħa councillor Gabriel Micallef has, however, written to the ombudsman to investigate the unfinished works in the Miżieb, Imbordin, San Martin and Għajn Tuffieħa.
 The works were started and never completed, and time frames missed, Micallef said, insisting someone had to be held responsible for the delays. “We are not second-class citizens,” he said.
 Manikata was “no longer the quiet village I invested to live in”, said a person who has been residing there since 1998.
 Apart from the “uncontrollable” granting of building permits, the once peaceful hamlet has been turned into a “highway” linking Gozo and Mellieħa to the rest of Malta, with over 50,000 vehicles driving in and out daily, including polluting heavy vehicles that were prohibited by a legal notice but were not stopped due to a lack of enforcement.
  There is zero traffic management, with buses and heavy vehicles getting stuck in the narrow roads with oncoming traffic, the residents said.
 The roadworks have also led to problems for ambulances to reach homes due to the lack of signage and notifications of road closures. The ongoing infrastructure project involved the installation of new services by a number of service providers, prior to IM’s intervention.
 This consisted of road build-up and reconstruction of stretches of retaining structures along the route from Għajn Tuffieħa through the area known as Ħal Ferħ to Xemxija, covering a distance of five kilometres, the agency explained.
 Phase 2, on Triq Għajn Tuffieħa from Xemxija roundabout to tal-Palma and beyond, includes works managed by a service provider on the new potable main and second-class water for irrigation and farming – part of upgrades to the water network in the northwest region.
 IM is responsible for the rebuilding of the new retaining and boundary walls and road reconstruction, which it said were almost done.
 Phase 3, which is ongoing, includes work on the construction of a new roundabout, the reconstruction of boundary walls, and civil works for the reinforcement of electrical infrastructure.

PA approves rezoning of massive Nigret arable site into residential complex,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/pa-approves-rezoning-massive-nigret-arable-site-residential-complex.1097895,09-10-2024,001281.png,"The Planning Authority approved an application to transform a large stretch of arable land in Żurrieq into a residential complex on Tuesday. 
 The planning control application in the Nigret area would see the construction of five blocks across the 18,302-square-metre plot, equivalent to the size of 70 tennis courts. The development also includes the proposal of two new public schemed roads.
 Four of these three-and-a-half-storey blocks are earmarked for apartments, while one is designated for “social and community facilities”. The apartment blocks will cover 70 per cent of the site. 
 A tenth of the area will be taken up by a road, and a quarter will be allocated to open spaces, according to the zoning plans. The zoning parameters were established in the 2006 South Malta Local Plan.
 The site area is located at Triq Fra Gammari Zammit, Triq Zaccaria Roncali and Triq Fra Luca Zurki.
 The zoning application was proposed by Tum Invest, the same company that has another zoning application in the area. 
 The large development had been slated for approval by a Planning Authority case officer because the site is within the development zone and adheres to local plans. 
 In a hearing on Tuesday afternoon, the application was unanimously approved by members of the PA’s Executive Council, despite the ongoing archaeological investigations being carried out by the Superintendent of Cultural Heritage having not yet been concluded. 
 As detailed in the case officer's report, the Superintendent of Cultural Heritage had recommended the evaluation take place before the zoning decision, so that if any archaeological discoveries are made, the layout of the development is amended accordingly.
 Yet, the heritage watchdog also gave developers the option of conducting archaeological studies after the zoning permit was issued.
 During the meeting, the project's architect, Joseph Bondin said archaeological studies are currently ongoing. 
 One member of the Executive Board asked Bondin how the large development would be achieved, adding that ""to develop a site like this, you need millions of euros"".
 Bondin said there will be a phasing plan for the development, to ensure the project is achievable. 
 When asked what plans he has for the open space of the area, he said the open space will include trees and greenery which will be enjoyed by locals and residents. 
 He said the local council will be provided with 350 square metres of a building to be used for ""community space"".
 A building earmarked for a 'social and community facility' will be developed into an elderly home- satisfying the suggestion made by the council, Bondin added.
 Żurrieq, especially the Nigret area, has made headlines for several zoning changes. 
 This application’s site is across from another site undergoing a zoning change, which could lead to the development of an additional 12,000 square metres of arable land.

"Malta's local plans aren't up to scratch, Robert Abela admits",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/malta-local-plans-arent-scratch-robert-abela-admits.1101234,19-11-2024,001462.png,"Malta’s local plans “don’t meet today’s realities”, Robert Abela told developers on Tuesday, admitting that the time may soon be ripe for local plans to be revised.
 Abela had previously categorically ruled out a revision to Malta’s local plans, saying this would cause people to suffer  injustices.
 He recently softened his tone on the subject, telling Times of Malta last week that the discussion should move towards whether the country needs “a holistic review of the local plans for the entire country”.
 Abela doubled down on Tuesday, telling Malta’s real estate magnates at a KPMG conference on the property market that while a revision to local plans would be controversial, the government “should not postpone or shy away from controversial decisions”.
 “If you ask me whether the local plans from 18 years ago address today's reality, I would say no they don’t” he said.
 Abela stopped short of outlining what a revision of local plans would entail, saying that the nature of the revision “could be up for debate,” with different stakeholders likely to have opposing views.
 But those hoping that a local plan would mean that swathes of previously developable land receive protection may be disappointed.
 “There will be some who would argue that some properties that are now within the development zone should be taken out of the development zone. I believe that many developers and many families wouldn't agree with that view,” Abela said.
 Abela also questioned whether the revision should take place across the country or whether it should staggered across certain types of property or geographical zones, citing the example of Marsa, where local plans were amended as part of the area’s regeneration plans.
 Planning minister Clint Camilleri, also speaking at the event, was more reticent, steering clear of the subject altogether, instead pledging that Malta’s planning laws will give priority to projects that focus on quality of life.
 Unsurprisingly, given PN’s past calls to revise local plans, opposition planning spokesperson Stanley Zammit told conference delegates that a PN government would “undergo a holistic revision of the local plans”.
 Zammit suggested that this could include revising plans to facilitate more one-bedroom apartments and a discussion on the concept of shared accommodation, two issues listed by industry stakeholders during the conference.
 The need to revise local plans was first launched by Property Malta chair Sandro Chetcuti who, opening the conference, said that if the government wants to work towards its much vaunted vision for 2050, a revision of the local plans needs to be one of the first items on its agenda.
 “It's impossible to plan for the future with plans that were drawn up years ago,” Chetcuti said, urging the government to undertake a “cautious” revision.

Watch: Activists deface Portelli's illegal Qala pools in flash protest,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/watch-activists-face-police-protest-portelli-illegal-qala-pools.1094657,29-06-2024,"001567.png,001568.png,001569.png,001570.png,001571.png,001572.png","Updated 1.15pm
 Carrying flares and spray paint, Moviment Graffitti activists descended on a swimming pool built illegally in the Qala countryside on Saturday.
 Their mission was simple: to highlight the “rigged system” planners were perpetuating to help developers exploit planning loopholes.
 Led by a megaphone-carrying leader, activists chanted “Mill Qala sas-Sannat, il-liġi għal Allat [From Qala to Sannat, laws are for the Gods] and  Tizfnu għad-daqqa tal-izviluppaturi [You dance to the tune of developers] as they marched to the back of the apartment complex.
  They then walked into the empty pool, spray cans in hand, and sprayed the word ‘Illegali’ [Illegal] in bright red paint on the pool’s floor. Their activity was interrupted by police officers who reached the scene and ordered activists to leave the scene.
 “No police came when this swimming pool was being built illegally,” Moviment Graffitti Andre Callus told an inspector. “So this is vandalism. But destroying the countryside without a permit is not?”
  When police threatened to arrest them, activists sat down and continued to chant.
 Led by Callus, activists then agreed with police to hand over their personal details as they exited the site when their demonstration ended. 
   The swimming pool is one of two built by Gozitan mega-developer Joseph Portelli some years ago, as part of a massive apartment complex.
  Portelli excavated the pool site without a permit. Despite having breached the law, the Planning Authority and its appeals tribunal, the EPRT, both approved the ODZ development.
 Objectors persisted and in March, a court revoked the permit the PA had granted Portelli.
 But by then Portelli had already built the swimming pool, as planning laws allow developers to proceed with works while appeals processes are ongoing.
 In 2023, Prime Minister Robert Abela said that work was underway to reform that procedure to prevent developers from exploiting such loopholes. Despite that pledge and a  subsequent consultation period, the law remains in place.
 Moviment Graffitti said it wanted the appeals law reformed with immediate effect.
  “Communities and organisations are having to bear the burden of appealing the obscene decisions of the PA, only for them to then having to deal with illegal buildings that no authority takes any effective action against,” it said in a statement.
 The Qala site, activists said, “shows the tremendous power wielded by the developers in our country and how our planning system is essentially rotten to the core.”
 Portelli’s Qala swimming pools are just one example of several such developments constructed illegally.
 In May 2023, a court revoked a permit for an eight-storey Portelli hotel in Mellieħa. As in Qala, the hotel had already been built by the time the court issued that judgment.
 Other developments in Xewkija and Sannat were also built in a similar, illegal fashion. Similarly, in March 2023 a court declared an ODZ swimming pool which minister Ian Borg built at his Rabat countryside villa illegal. The pool had already been built and remains in place.
 Speaking at the Qala site on Saturday, Graffitti activist Andre Callus said the absurdity was “reaching ridiculous levels”.
 He noted that the PA’s appeals board, the EPRT, had this week rejected an appeal by residents in Mistra against a massive development at the former Mistra Village site.
 The EPRT concluded that the site was now “committed” to development because works had already started.
  “It is worth noting that it was the very same tribunal that had allowed the works to continue while the appeal was ongoing!” Callus exclaimed.
 “We are convinced that all this is not happening by chance. The environmental destruction that is ravaging Malta and Gozo is deliberate. We have a Government ruled by developers that is more intent on filling their pockets rather than safeguarding our common good and quality of life,” he said.
  Callus said that when faced with such a “rigged system”, activists had little choice but to resort to direct action like Saturday’s.
 “This will not end here,” he said.
 When contacted, Portelli dismissed the protest as the work of ""the same hundred people"". 
 ""These people have nothing better to do,"" he said.

PA shoots down complex for foreign workers in Qormi,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/pa-shoots-complex-foreign-workers-qormi.1092182,05-09-2024,001635.png,"The Planning Authority on Thursday shot down a proposed development of a residential complex atop a large Qormi warehouse comprising 142 rooms for shared living by people who travel to Malta for work.
 Proposed by the Vella Falzon Group - a firm involved in the bathroom, flooring, furniture, and building industry - the development would have provided rooms where expats could live at affordable prices, the PA board was told.
 However, the board was not convinced, particularly due to concerns that this proposed residential complex would not have provided decent living quarters for people travelling to Malta for work.
 The “assisted living residential accommodation” project aimed to provide “care to people in need” was proposed over a warehouse which was previously the GDL Building between Triq il-Furnar and Triq tal-Bajjada in Qormi.
 The outline application, which was immediately thrown out at the concept stage, would have included a reception and offices on the ground floor, a canteen, a games room, office space and a computer room at the first-floor level and 142 rooms from the second to the fourth level with laundry facilities.
 The size, with a total area of close to 3,200 square metres, would have seen each room built at an average area of just under 37 square metres.
 The PA’s Development Management Directorate noted that the site chosen for such a proposal was incompatible with planning policies. The area is characterised by different types of development, is dominated by commercial uses and is located at the edge of a mixed-use area. The site itself is covered by an approved permit for a warehouse.
 “The proposed facility is considered incompatible with the existing [industrial] use and cannot be considered acceptable in terms of amenity for the proposed use,” the case officer concluded in the report which recommended a refusal.
 Furthermore, the proposal failed to provide adequate parking provision on site and did not reach the requirements of the Sanitary Engineering Office and the Commission for the Rights of Persons with Disability, it added.
 An architect from firm A360 told the board the proposal included what he described as an ""atrium"" running through the entire depth of the property, consisting of 20 per cent of the site. He said this “flooded” the rooms with natural light and ventilation.
 He said the underlying warehouse was a store and did not have industrial uses and that the project aimed to serve those who came to Malta for work and were struggling to find decent accommodation.
 Applicant  Alex Vella Falzon said these people were coming to Malta for work but were not finding somewhere to live at an affordable rate.
 ""We are proposing a secure, guarded complex, providing food on-site, instead of allowing these workers to live in garages, stables or packed like sardines in apartments, he said.
 “We will rent at an extremely low price that no one can beat on the market. I already have two local companies who want to rent out all rooms for their employees because they understand that it’s better than having 17 people crammed in a three-bedroom apartment.
 ""What is their alternative with a salary of €900 a month? We are providing this alternative,” he told the PA board members.
 However, PA chairman Martin Camilleri expressed concern that the proposed rooms “do not seem like a decent accommodation with such small windows”.
 He also said that apart from the lack of parking, the site was not the right one for the proposed development.
 When he put the project to the vote, board members unanimously voted it down.

Builders’ high exam failure rate sparks alarm over construction standards,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/builders-high-exam-failure-rate-sparks-alarm-construction-standards.1101797,30-11-2024,001646.png,"The Malta Occupational Safety and Health Practitioners Association has expressed “grave concern” after more than two-thirds of builders failed a revamped theory exam required for their licence.
 The high failure rate highlights systemic issues in Malta’s construction sector and raises urgent questions about safety and professional standards, the association said. 
 Times of Malta reported that  seven in 10 builders failed the updated exam, despite some having worked as masons for up to 40 years. The exam forms part of the licensing process, which has existed for over 150 years but was updated in August and is now overseen by the Building and Construction Authority (BCA).
 Questions in the exam cover health and safety, construction law, geometry, concrete technology, and other technical aspects. The test includes multiple-choice and yes/no formats.
 To work in the construction industry, masons need a professional licence. Last year, this was supplemented by a contractors’ licence, introduced after the Jean Paul Sofia public inquiry, which underscored the need for greater oversight in the construction sector.
 The association described the situation as “untenable” and called for the immediate creation of a working group, including health and safety practitioners, to review the licensing process. 
 It has also demanded that the government and the BCA revise the examination framework, interim measures to bridge skill gaps, and greater transparency in the licensing process.
 The association also criticised the BCA’s comment that it was premature to discuss while the examination process is ongoing. 
 “This response is unacceptable. Matters of occupational health and safety, transparency, and timely action are imperative.”
 Recent building collapses, some resulting in fatalities, were cited by MOSHPA as evidence of the urgent need for reform. 
 “The safety of workers and the public must remain paramount, with urgent reforms to bolster the construction industry’s commitment to compliance, competence, and accountability,” it said.

Tigné belvedere and walkway closed for 'precautionary' repairs,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/tigne-belvedere-walkway-closed-precautionary-repairs.1099164,10-08-2024,"001685.png,001686.png","Two popular public areas in Tigné have been closed for repairs, and it remains unclear when they will be reopening.
 The Tigné belvedere - known for its love lockets and scenic views of Marsamxett Harbour and Manoel Island - and a pedestrian walkway from the seafront to Fort Tigné were blocked off on September 27.
 Passersby were met with signs that read, ""No access. Apologies for the inconvenience."" 
 More than two weeks later, they remain inaccessible. 
 MIDI, the developers responsible for the Tigné Point project, told Times of Malta the closures were precautionary.
 “There were no incidents that triggered this event. The closure was solely precautionary,” a spokesperson clarified.
  MIDI acknowledged that the areas will require repairs, saying the structure is now being inspected ""to determine the necessary remedial works.""
 No immediate details about these works were provided.
 Access between the Tigné seafront and Fort Tigné remains possible via Tigné Point Piazza, though the main pedestrian route is off-limits for now, MIDI said. 
 Two years ago, concerns were raised about the condition of the Tigné Point bridge, particularly the exposed steel reinforcement bars visible on its underside. Those concerns were first flagged by academic, activist and political candidate Arnold Cassola. 
 Both the developers and the Sliema mayor at the time dismissed these concerns as non-hazardous. It is unclear whether this new closure is related to those previous concerns or if new issues have emerged.

"Birguma quarry can be extended without major ecological impact, ERA rules",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/birguma-quarry-extended-major-ecological-impact-era-rules.1091933,05-04-2024,001869.png,"An application to extend a quarry in Birguma will not require an environmental impact assessment, according to the environmental watchdog, as the impact is unlikely to be significant.
 The Environment and Resources Authority (ERA) concluded that the extension by almost 5,000 square metres will not affect the most sensitive garigue in the area.
 “As long as the quarrying activities are carried out responsibly, and the quarry in its entirety is eventually backfilled and restored, there are no envisaged significant impacts on ecology,” it concluded.
 The ERA was commenting on an application filed by Anthony Ciappara, the owner of Hard Stone Quarry No. 28 in Triq John Adye, Naxxar. PA7575/22 seeks permission to extend the existing quarry on an adjacent piece of land and dig up to the same level of the existing quarry. It also proposes the rehabilitation of the same quarry over a number of phases.
 The total site footprint of the extension is approximately 4,900 square metres and will be excavated vertically down to around 45 metres from the existing ground level.
 A project description statement filed with the Planning Authority states that around 220,000 cubic metres of usable minerals will be excavated from the site.
 The site is located on top of the ridge at the Great Fault in a rural area known as in-Nigret between Naxxar and Għargħur. The site lies outside the development zone (ODZ) and is adjacent to Wied Anġlu, which is a tree protection area.
 The Victoria Lines, scheduled for Grade 1 protection, are located just a few metres north of the site. The top of the ridge where the site lies is scheduled as an area of high landscape value while the Birguma Anti-Aircraft Battery, to the south of the site, is scheduled with Grade 2 protection.
 Despite these historical features, the Superintendence for Cultural Heritage did not object to the proposed quarry extension.
 It stressed its concern about the site being within such a sensitive area and its further impact on the surrounding landscape which, it admitted, is characterised by numerous cultural heritage features, many of which are scheduled.
 However, it was pleased with the restoration and rehabilitation plan following the exhaustion of the quarries.
 “The Superintendence would be favourable to the restoration of this site following the end of quarrying activity on site,” it said as it requested more details on the projected timeframes for the exhaustion of both quarries and their respective rehabilitation.
 “Any eventual clearance from Superintendence will be subject to a condition for the conjoined rehabilitation of both quarries and on the recommendation of a suitable bank guarantee to ensure this aim,” it added.
 According to an environmental report filed as part of the planning process, the expansion of quarrying activities towards the residential area of Birguma was expected to result in an increased deposition of dust and increased levels of noise and vibrations, amplifying potential nuisances for residents.
 “This shift in operations heightens the significance of addressing and implementing effective measures to mitigate the adverse impacts on air quality and the well-being of the community,” the report recommended.

A three-day wait to pre-book a Bolt cab,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/a-threeday-wait-prebook-bolt-cab.1096850,17-08-2024,001998.png,"When Yasmin Lewis attempted to schedule a Bolt cab for the early hours of the next morning, she was shocked to discover the earliest available ride was in three days’ time.
 Lewis, a sales agent in iGaming, attempted to book a Bolt cab at 6pm on Tuesday for a ride to work at 3am the next morning.
 But when she tried to book the taxi at her preferred time, she received a notification stating: “You can’t schedule a time within that window.”
 The earliest available taxi was at 4am on Friday.
 Her experience comes after Bolt said it lost large numbers of drivers following a government crackdown on worker permits to non-EU workers in the industry, claiming it is “saturated”.
 The lack of notification or warning left Lewis feeling “really bad and worried”. She explained: “My car is with the mechanic, so I wouldn’t have been able to get to work without the taxi.”
 Lewis’s company has a deal with Bolt that covers employees’ rides but, due to the unexpected issue, she was forced to find another cab service and pay from her own pocket.
  When she contacted Bolt’s customer service, Lewis grew even more frustrated, saying she had to wait 12 hours for a reply. When she finally received a response, she was simply told to “be a bit patient” and wait for the issue to be resolved.
 With her car still in the shop and the company’s agreement with Bolt, Lewis tried using the service again a few days later, this time booking a cab for immediate pick-up instead of scheduling it in advance.
 The taxi arrived without any issues.
 When she shared her experience on social media this week, other frustrated cab users said they had similar experiences with the scheduling function.
 At least two people said they scheduled rides to the airport but, shortly before their taxi was due to arrive, it was cancelled.
 A spokesperson from Bolt said it was “not uncommon for the scheduling feature to be temporarily suspended for short periods when there is a spike in anticipated demand”.
 The spokesperson also emphasised that this does not affect their on-demand service, which remains available 24/7.
 
 This incident occurred a month after the government announced that new applications – or attempts to change employers – by third-country nationals for cab driving and food courier work permits were denied due to market saturation.
 Shortly after, service users began complaining about increased fares and longer waiting times for Bolt cabs. In response, Bolt claimed the price increases were a result of the government’s clampdown on work permits.

Over two-thirds of builders fail theory exam for licence,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/over-twothirds-builders-fail-theory-exam-licence.1101513,25-11-2024,002109.png,"Seven out of every 10 builders who sat for a revamped theory exam to obtain their builders’ licence have failed it, even though many of them have been working as masons for as long as four decades.
 Multiple frustrated builders who spoke to Times of Malta said that of the 183 applicants who sat for the theory exam earlier this month, fewer than 60 passed and qualified to progress to the practical exam. The others have no resit options and must wait for months before they can reapply in a fresh round of exams.
 The exam is part of the mason licensing process which has been in existence for more than a century and a half but which in August was revamped and transferred under the wing of the Building and Construction Authority (BCA).
 The questions asked are mostly multiple-choice and yes/no questions about health and safety, construction law, geometry, concrete technology and other aspects of the building trade.
 Masons need a professional licence to work in the construction industry. As of last year, they also need to follow that with a contractors’ licence, which was introduced in the wake of the Jean Paul Sofia public inquiry conclusions.
 Builders can work without a license so long as they are employed by a licensed mason. Most of the applicants who sat for this month’s exam had been working for another mason for as long as 40 years and applied to obtain a licence of their own.
 To obtain the mason’s licence, individuals must meet specific requirements and attend information sessions, practical assessments and theoretical exams.
  But their representative body, the Assoċjazzjoni Bennejja u Kuntratturi (ABK), says that builders, some of whom had never sat for an exam in their life before, said they were confused by the new format of the questions.
 “Was the paper too hard? Or were the individuals not prepared enough or did not show enough competence?” the association told the BCA in a letter expressing concern last week.
 Association president Michael Cutajar said the new procedure does not give applicants the opportunity to do a resit.
 “Applicants who did not pass the theory exam have not received their scores, nor have they been permitted to attempt the practical exam or resit the theory exam,” he told the BCA. “Until the last exam such feedback was given and was helpful for the applicants who struggle with the written part.”
 It remains unclear why so many builders failed the exam – whether it was because of the assessment’s poor design or applicants’ incompetence. Questions sent to the BCA hardly provided any answers, with the authority suggesting the subject should not even be discussed.
 “Discussing the licensing process while it is still in progress is premature and should be avoided,” it said.
 “It is premature to discuss the outcome of this important step towards higher standards in the construction industry, as the examination process is still ongoing.”
 Another issue raised by the association was the strict enforcement of mandatory induction session attendance.
 These sessions were held at short notice, hindering some applicants’ ability to attend, it said.
 Additionally, critical rules regarding the induction sessions were not clearly communicated, leading to confusion and some applicants being excluded from the sessions and the exams altogether.
 The BCA said that during the sessions it provided refresher lessons on health and safety, legal aspects related to licensing, concrete technology, geometry and construction techniques, provided by the Occupational Health and Safety Authority, Kamra tal-Periti, legal professionals and the builders’ and contractors’ association.
 “The BCA will announce the schedule for upcoming exams in the coming weeks. Furthermore, it is essential to note that builders without a licence must operate under the supervision of a licensed mason,” it said.
 In its letter to the BCA, the association also made several recommendations to improve the examination process. These include providing clear and timely information about exam requirements, offering feedback to applicants, implementing flexible induction session policies, providing resit opportunities, standardising examination procedures and clarifying exam questions.

Neighbours fume as Santa Luċija land is handed to Christian Borg franchise,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/neighbours-fume-santa-lucija-land-handed-car-rental-company.1097657,09-05-2024,"002196.png,002197.png,002198.png","Scores of cars have taken over an area of land in Santa Luċija after the local football club leased the site to rental company Sicily by Car. 
 Around 60 cars were parked at the site on Wednesday, with more turning up on Thursday. 
 Furious residents said the site was previously available for public parking and the move would inconvenience those living in the area.  
 They also questioned whether the land – which is administered by government entity SportsMalta and leased to Santa Luċija Football Club – should have been signed over to Sicily by Car in the first place.  
  The Italian car rental franchise is run in Malta by Princess Holdings Ltd, a company owned and directed by car rental entrepreneur Christian Borg, who appeared in court last month to face charges of money laundering and tax fraud.  Borg was also arrested last year and charged in connection with a botched abduction. A court heard how he and his associates allegedly threatened to torture their victim and rape his sister. 
 Santa Luċija football club president Adrian Gomez Blanco distanced himself from the agreement, saying it had been drawn up by a colleague, adding that he ""didn't know it was Sicily by Car.""
 ""I'm offended that people are calling me just because the tenant has a problem I didn't know about,"" he said, stressing ""all football clubs rent their premises to generate money.""
 A Sports Ministry spokesperson said the land was leased for “sports purposes,” and SportMalta was not notified or asked permission for any change of use. It said it was in contact with the football club “to ensure adherence to the contract.” 
 A spokesperson for SportMalta said the lease of land for the parking of rental cars was in breach of its agreement with the football club.
 Santa Luċija mayor Charmaine St John said the local council became aware of the arrangement around July and was checking to see if the site could be leased commercially. 
 Asked whether she thought it appropriate the site was being used by a company linked to Christian Borg, she stressed that “the issue is whether it should be leased in the first place, not to whom.” 
 In a Facebook post on Thursday, the Santa Luċija local council said it had asked the Planning Authority if there had been an application from the football club to commercialise the land. 
  When Times of Malta visited the site on Thursday, it found scores of rental cars packed together bumper-to-bumper on the patch of land which, while previously publicly accessible, was now blocked by a barrier at the entrance. 
  One resident said he was “very angry” at the cars' appearance.
 “Residents were ready to start a fight with the people from the company when they came the other day,” he said, stressing that many residents relied on the parking area.  
 ""It’s a housing estate... I have a child with special needs, and this means finding parking further away,” he said.  
 Santa Luċija football club was relegated from the Premier League after five seasons in May.

Watch: ‘We’re going to suffocate’ - Residents fear for St Julian’s village core,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/we-re-going-suffocate-residents-fear-st-julian-village-core.1096320,08-10-2024,"002350.png,002351.png,002352.png,002353.png","St Julian’s residents are concerned that new development plans threaten to transform their still village core into a busy, noisy area full of hotels and apartment blocks.
 The residents, mostly elderly, are worried that the last few years of their lives will be overshadowed by noise, dust, pollution and other effects of construction.
 “It’s quiet here, really quiet, and for us older people, it’s nice to live out the rest of our lives in peace and quiet,” Jenny Psaila told Times of Malta.
 Residing in a townhouse on Birkirkara Hill, Psaila’s mornings are spent on her small terrace, overlooking her garden and those of her neighbours, which acts as a hidden small green lung amid the urban environment.
  There she enjoys the sounds of chirping sparrows and the sight of small bats dancing in the early morning sky, returning to their dens in the gardens.
 But the 88-year-old’s peaceful routine is under threat.
 Psaila is one of three neighbours who share their garden boundary wall with the 19th-century townhouse, Sirdar House, which is set to be transformed into a four-storey, three-star hotel after an application was approved by the Planning Authority.
 Located just across from the popular City of London Bar and within the locality’s Urban Conservation Area, the applicants will construct three floors and a receded level, as well as excavating the ground for a swimming pool.
 The plans, submitted by Andrea Zammit Tabona and architect Edwin Mintoff, will retain the existing façade of the building.
 The 88-year-old was one of the many objectors against the application, saying she was “horrified” when she found out it had been approved.
  “We are worried about the garden walls, we don’t know where the swimming pool is going to be, and if it is going to be in (Sirdar’s) garden, it will be developed against our back wall,” she said.
 The digging and excavation for the pool could destroy the century-old back wall and it would be impossible to rebuild, she fears.
 She said she had known the previous owner, Joe Zammit Tabona, for over 60 years and she questioned whether he would have condoned the project.
 “Of course, the property owners can do what they like, but they should consider the neighbours.”
  Her husband, Winston Psaila, also expressed concern for the tree found in Sirdar House’s garden.
 “Are we going to destroy a part of Mother Nature for this project,” he asked.
 The Sirdar House application is not the residents’ only concern.
 Adding to their unease, the Planning Authority earlier this year approved the demolition of one of St Julian’s oldest houses to construct a new pedestrian street, which will include new residential units.
 The site is located between Elisa Street and Birkirkara Hill, facing the Psailas’ home, and is also located in the locality’s UCA.
 “Could you imagine, the development on this side (Birkirkara Hill) and the building behind us (Sirdar House),” Jenny said.
 Her husband pointed out that the projects will likely increase the traffic in the locality and bring more pollution.
 “When the two projects are going to be finalised, there are going to be more cars. You saw the width of this street; it’s going to allow for a huge flow of traffic which this street cannot take.”
 ""We are going to suffocate,""  he continued.
 The noise and dust from construction are not the only concerns. Once the hotel is operational, residents fear that their peace will be permanently disrupted by noise from guests and the hotel’s restaurant.
 “We already put up with noise pollution because youngsters coming from Paceville at night make a lot of noise and cause disturbance in this area, and this will increase when the hotel is finished,” he continued.
 “We don’t have much future left, but we have to think of our son, who will start his life here in St Julian’s,” Jenny said.
 The family is now considering contesting the Planning Authority’s decision.
 Lina Busuttil, 90, grew up and lived on Birkirkara Hill after her family moved to the village core in 1946.
  Sharing a boundary wall with Sirdar House, she too opposed the hotel project.  “We felt very angry. It is shameful that we have arrived at this situation,” she said, looking out into her garden.
 “Everything is going to wrack and ruin, and all we care about is money.”
 She fears her house will lose its natural sunlight and that the constant noise will degrade the area’s air quality.
 Another Birkirkara Hill resident who wished to remain anonymous said many people believed that living in St Julian’s must be a nightmare.
 “But here, it is a little bit of an oasis in a desert,” she said.
 “Often I see tourists walking around in the narrow streets of the village core, taking pictures of the colourful balconies and pretty houses. It is a shame if we spoil this area.”

‘I'm following PA rules': new Sliema block juts out on pavement,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/im-following-pa-rules-architect-new-sliema-block-jutting-pavement.1098129,20-09-2024,"002453.png,002454.png","The architect of a new apartment block in Sliema has said he was left with no choice but to build further forward than neighbouring properties to be in line with Planning Authority rules.
 Last week, concerns were raised about the development under construction on Triq Gianni Bencini which extends more than a metre out from the two neighbouring properties, forcing the pavement to snake around the front of the development.
 When contacted, the architect, Daniel Attard, said PA rules had left him with no choice but to build that far forward.
 Echoing developers of a Mellieħa apartment block that hit the headlines last week for taking up the pavement and part of the road, he said that while he was following the rules, other buildings in the street were set too far back.
 The head of the Chamber of Architects, Andre Pizzuto, backed Attard, saying architects had no choice but to obey official alignment rules, even if it meant the property looked out of place.
 In 2022, Johann Vella applied to demolish a terraced house on the Sliema street and replace it with a six-apartment block, including a penthouse with pool and terrace, equipped with underground parking.
 Residents contacted Times of Malta with concerns about the alignment of the property, observing how it jutted out.
 Attard said: “People didn’t always follow the official alignment, but we got the alignment plan from the PA and built according to that.” Other properties further up the street also followed the official alignment, he added.
  The neighbouring properties, meanwhile, had followed a “self-inflicted” recess of around 1.2 metres back from the official alignment.
 Pressed on the aesthetics, Attard said it was important to view the issue in the context of the country’s “ageing population”.
 “There is an elderly woman living there,” he said of one of the neighbouring properties, stressing that when she no longer lived in the house, the site would be redeveloped – like many others.
 “Eventually all the buildings will be redeveloped, and all the new properties will eventually meet the official alignment.”
 Failure to align to official rules would be “more irregular” than building in line with other recessed properties.
 He said many buildings with self-imposed setbacks had flourished in earlier decades before planning regulations were rolled out across the island, calling such properties “very irregular”.
 Pizzuto said that in such cases, architects’ hands were tied.
 “Even if they [architects] want to do it architecturally right, they can’t. It’s not their fault, this is the predicament of architecture generally; it’s about law, not aesthetics,” he said.
 Pizzuto explained the problem dated back to the 1980s, when many alignments and street plans “were done by students on work placements and not by professional planners.”
 
 And the issue was made worse when the plans were later scanned and digitised in the 2000s but not at the resolutions of today’s level of accuracy.
 Even the PA “doesn’t commit” to official alignments on its mapserver online service, he said, noting alignments were marked as “indicative” by the authority.
 He added that all planning applications were reviewed by the PA 'alignment interpretation section' to check they were in line with official rules.
 Pizzuto emphasised that while building heights were set in the context of the surrounding area, rules on alignments – which he said the chamber was against – appeared to have been more of a “desktop exercise” without taking the surroundings into account.
 “It’s not a new problem,” he said.

Enemalta's €37m emergency power plant finally installed,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/enemalta-37m-emergency-power-plant-finally-installed.1096964,20-08-2024,002469.png,"An emergency diesel power plant is ready to start operating should any of Malta's primary energy sources fail, Enemalta executive chairman Ryan Fava said on Tuesday.
 Installation of the 60-megawatt diesel-powered generation plant was completed on Monday.
 The plant, which will cost taxpayers €37 million, is expected to remain in operation until a second undersea interconnector linking Malta to the European power grid is completed. That project is likely to be completed towards the end of 2026 or the beginning of 2027.
 UNEC Ltd, the Bonnici Bros-owned firm that won the contract to provide the temporary power station, was obliged to have the plant ready by July. However, last month, Fava said the temporary plant would begin operating in mid-August.
 The plant arrived in Malta's freeport at the end of July. UNEC's contract stipulates that it must operate the plant - which has been set up in Delimara - for a 27-month period. 
 In a July interview, Fava said that generators like the one leased by Enemalta are in high demand across the Mediterranean.
 Enemalta has emphasised that Malta can source enough energy to meet demand, and said that power cut issues are related to inadequate distribution networks. 
 The UNEC-run emergency power plant is intended as a temporary fallback solution should one of Malta's primary power sources falter.

 Between August 12 to 18, the Gozo Channel, which operates car-carrying ferries between Ċirkewwa and Mġarr, carried almost 136,000 passengers while Gozo Highspeed carried almost 29,000 passengers on its catamaran-operated service between Valletta and Mġarr.
 Describing the Santa Marija period as a “great week for tourism in Gozo,” the island’s ministry said additional unscheduled crossings were added to the Ċirkewwa crossings to cope with demand.
 In addition to its passengers, the Gozo Channel service reported carrying almost 47,000 vehicles last week during its 700 trips between the Maltese islands.
 The Gozo Highspeed service, meanwhile, registered 220 journeys between Gozo and the country’s capital.
 Gozo Minister Clint Camilleri said the ministry had received ""very positive comments"" from tourism operators about the Santa Marija week, which was considered to be the “best week of the summer” for the island.
 Santa Marija, otherwise known as the Feast of the Assumption, is one of the most important feasts in Malta and celebrated in seven localities across the country. 
 The main day of the feast, August 15, also holds historical significance, marking the day in 1942 during World War II when a convoy of allied ships managed to break the Axis blockade, limping into Valletta's Grand Harbour to deliver desperately needed supplies. 
 Traditionally, many Maltese travel to Gozo for the celebrations in Victoria, often spending the week or a long weekend on the island.

Government forces council's hand on Mosta Square pedestrianisation,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/government-forces-council-hand-mosta-square-pedestrianisation.1097400,30-08-2024,"002558.png,002559.png","The Mosta square will remain pedestrianised on the weekends, despite the council’s decision to stop the arrangement back in July. 
 In a statement on Friday, the local council said it had been told by Transport Malta that the government would be closing off the square itself every Friday and Saturday evening, against the council's stated wishes. 
 The newly renovated square was partially pedestrianised and closed off to traffic during the weekends, yet in July, the newly elected council took a controversial decision to end this practice come September, after residents and business owners  complained about the current state of affairs in the square. 
 “The Local Council is disappointed with these actions from Transport Malta, who are passing over what the Local Council feels is the best for the residents of Mosta,” the statement read. 
  ""The Government’s policy, which is being called ‘pedestrianisation’, cannot be applied without planning and consultation because what will be happening is to the detriment of the residents.""
 The council said it will continue to work in the best interest of the residents and will not let any authority ""use its power"" to intimidate the council.
 In a notice in the Government Gazette on Friday, Transport Malta also confirmed it would be closing off the square to traffic on weekends, extending the pedestrianisation of the square until the end of October. 
  In a reply to questions, Transport Malta clarified that currently the square is closed off from Saturday evening till Sunday at midnight. 
 As of September, it will be closed on Fridays and Saturdays from 7.00 pm till midnight.
 The entity said the decision was based on ongoing evaluations of traffic flow and public benefit. 
 “Transport Malta discussed its policy with the local council earlier in the week before officially communicating its final decision. While the Authority respects the council’s views, it is important to remember that the square falls under the authority’s jurisdiction, not the local council.”
 The entity said the extension of the pedestrianisation of the square is intended to provide the community with a safer and more enjoyable environment. 
 “The main priority remains serving the community’s best interests through strategic urban planning.”
 It did not reply to questions asking how traffic would be managed after October. 
 In a Facebook post, Transport Minister Chris Bonett criticised the newly elected local council’s decision to stop pedestrianising the Square. 
 “It is useless to preach about open spaces before the election, and then the first thing you do is to push for a motion that goes in the opposite direction,” he said.
 “Transport Malta spoke with the mayor and the Mosta local council, and it was clearly explained what the government’s policy is and the council advised against it. From there the government decided according to its authority.”
 He said the government has the final word on the country’s traffic management and it believed the council made the wrong decision.
 “No one was intimidated,” he added. 
 He advised the council to present its proposals and to work with the government. 
 “It is not an easy decision and sometimes not a popular one, but we are here to make the best decisions, not what is most convenient.”
  The council’s attempt to reverse the decision received criticism from the government and architects. 
 Transport Minister Chris Bonett said Mosta should keep the square pedestrianised, while the  Chamber of Architects urged the council to make the partial pedestrianisation of the town's square a success rather than succumbing to commercial pressures by reversing it.
 Antoine Zammit, the architect who was involved with the re-design of the square, said he felt let down by the council’s decision to reconsider the partial pedestrianisation of the site. 
 
 The partial closure of the square to traffic was controversial from the outset. Some praised the initiative as good for the environment, removing traffic and harmful emissions from the town centre and creating an open space where the community could meet.
 Residents of streets which have taken the brunt of the diverted traffic have, however, complained of the traffic in their streets. Others have complained that it takes them too long to reach the centre of the town, while businesses have complained of a drop in business.
 In a statement, the PN slammed the government for ignoring the democratically elected local council, and the locality's residents.
 Spokespeople for transport and local councils Mark Anthony Sammut and Chris Said said the council had launched a consultation process with residents, NGOs and businesses about the pedestrianisation of the square. 
 The council had reopened the square to traffic while the consultation - and roadworks in the area - were ongoing. 
 Despite this, the government - through TM - disregarded the council's decision and the will of the residents, and closed the square to traffic on Fridays and Saturdays, they added.

 PN MPs Ivan Castillo, Darren Carabott, and Mark Anthony Sammut said a TM official at the centre of an internal investigation and an ongoing police investigation was given a work-from-home consultancy with the government entity worth €3,000.
 The investigations revolve around the purchase of faulty rigid hull inflatable boats (RHIBs) and abuse within TM's maritime enforcement section, where enforcement officers tampered with and deliberately ""lost"" fines.
 The allegation was, however, denied by Transport Malta, which said that no official was given any consultancy role worth €3,000 a month to work from home. 
 The authority added that an internal inquiry found no evidence of any wrongdoing. 
 “Even though the matter was passed on to police, it is clear that the allegations are without basis,” the authority said.   
 In their statement, the  PN called on the police to conclude investigations into the purchase of the RHIBs and that TM should publish the internal inquiry. 
 In April, TM said it would not publish an internal investigation it claims found no evidence of abuse within its maritime enforcement section, adding that it did not want to hinder an ongoing police investigation. 
 Transport Malta’s purchase of five RHIBs at a cost of €721,000 was flagged by a National Audit Office review for a series of failures in their procurement.

PA to allow 2cm deviation from current Health and Sanitary Regulations,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/pa-allow-2cm-deviation-current-health-sanitary-regulations.1098517,25-09-2024,002304.png,"The Planning Authority has announced plans for an amendment to the Sanitary Regulations to address situations where the dimensions of a development deviate by not more than 2 centimetres less than the minimum requirements.
 It explained that currently there is strict adherence to specific dimensions in accordance with the Development Planning (Health and Sanitary) Regulations to ensure health, safety, and usability standards.
 ""However, rigid enforcement of these dimensions has occasionally resulted in practical challenges during and after the construction phase,"" it said.
 ""This ‘de minimis’ rule of 2cm is also being suggested in view of the fact that in practice the structure normally adheres to the minimum dimensions required by the present legal notice, whilst the finishing (e.g. plastering and so forth) tends to deviate therefrom by about 1cm from each face of the structure,"" the PA said.
 ""One also must bear in mind the multiple cases where home buyers purchased a shell form apartment (which adhered to the present legal notice), only to find out that finishing works have rendered that very same apartment in breach of the present legal notice by a matter of millimetres.
 ""The PA deems that the slight deviation from the minimum dimensions is acceptable and is justifiable especially when considering that the development is already built, and such slight deviation does not undermine the integrity of sanitary laws.""

PA refuses apartments in Santa Luċija street after landmark judgement,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/pa-refuses-apartments-santa-lucija-street-sparked-landmark-judgement.1093978,14-06-2024,002405.png,"The Planning Authority has refused an application seeking to turn a terraced house into three apartments, in the same street where a landmark judgement previously stopped a pencil development from spoiling the streetscape. 
 The application, PA/05677/23, sought to demolish a terraced house in Triq il-Ġibjun in Santa Luċija and build a basement store, a garage on the ground floor level and three overlying apartments. 
 But just last year, a court of appeal ruled against a five-storey pencil development in the very same street, overturning the permit.
 The court said that the maximum height limitation for an area as set out in its local plan was not a guaranteed right, and that new buildings must respect the context in which they will be built. 
 The case officer for the most recent application in Triq il-Ġibjun recommended the application for refusal, citing the impact of the new building on the skyline and noting that uniform streetscapes must be preserved. 
 
 “The proposed receded floor does not respect the character of the area in which it is located, which is a comprehensive housing estate characterised by terraced houses with a predominant two-storey building height, and roof structures and which is also of low density facing ODZ,” the case officer said. 
 The planning commission ultimately took that recommendation to heart, with all three members voting to refuse the application. 
 Michael Pule, the Santa Luċija resident who spearheaded the fight to overturn the original Triq il-Ġibjun application, was also an objector against this new application. He celebrated the decision on Friday. 
 Pule said that had this terraced house been demolished, it would have not only destroyed the character of the street but that of the entire locality. 
  “I thank all those who supported me and the energetic team and residents who worked relentlessly to convince the local council and the planning authority. This time round, after the March 2023 court landmark judgement, we got the support of the local council also,” he said. 
 “We have to keep on watching this issue as it threatens our daily standard of living.”
 Civil society group il-Kolletiv also welcomed the decision and thanked all of those who had spoken up against the development, which included mayor Charmaine St John, councillor Liam Sciberras and Labour MP Katia Degiovanni. 
 “Il-Kollettiv congratulates the residents of Santa Luċija and promises to stand with them in the many battles yet to be faced by the village,” the group said in a statement. 
 “For today, however, a very well deserved well done to all those who did their best for their community.”

Gudja residents protest at residential parking scheme,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/gudja-residents-protest-residential-parking-scheme.1093717,06-10-2024,"002430.png,002431.png","Gudja residents have come out against a new residential parking scheme intended to ease their parking problems, saying it will only create new ones.
 With Gudja conveniently close to the airport, residents have for years complained that travellers were parking their vehicles in the town for days while they are abroad. 
 So from this month, non-Gudja residents are prohibited from parking on 14 of the town’s streets outside the hours of 7am to 8pm. Otherwise, parking on those streets is reserved for residents.
 Residents were provided with a permit card to affix to their car by the local council. Any unauthorised vehicles will be towed.
 However, the local council has received a backlash from unhappy residents, who say the scheme was not the right solution and that they and businesses will be badly hit. 
  The council has since informed residents it will include their family members in the scheme but details are still unclear.
 “I do not live in one of the 14 streets, but now I will be worse off because non-residents will be looking for parking spaces in my road to avoid the curfew,” one resident told Times of Malta. 
 She said her elderly parents will now struggle to find a place to park on her road and if they parked on one of the 14 designated streets, they would have to leave by 8pm. 
 “This scheme is a flop. It’s making us prisoners in our town,” she said.
 Gudja celebrates three feasts in summer so the situation will only get worse, she said.
 The scheme will also affect businesses, she added – with the UEFA European football competition around the corner, bars may see a dip in customers due to the 8pm curfew. 
 Another resident said it would now be difficult to invite friends over for the festa or for Christmas: “We can’t afford to close off our town this way.”
 One elderly resident said the council had “rushed” this decision, leading to this “ridiculous” situation. 
 He suggested it would have been better to prohibit parking for non-residents for over 24 hours.
 PN MP and Gudja resident Mark Anthony Sammut said on Facebook that the scheme would hinder his family from having friends or relatives over in the evening, unless they caught a cab or parked on the other side of town. 
 “I cannot host friends, I cannot have my in-laws visiting, I cannot have a constituent come to meet me in the evening,” the former local councillor told Times of Malta. 
 He also complained about the bureaucratic process of applying for a renewable pass, adding that it gives LESA officers access to each vehicle owner’s details.
 “My wife is required to renew her pass annually because the address on her vehicle’s log book shows her parents’ address, which is where she lived when she bought the car 10 years ago. Since when is the address on your log book any indication of where you live?”
 In 2018, the council had unanimously approved a by-law banning parking beyond 24 hours for non-residents, but Sammut and PN councillor Stefan Caruana said Labour councillors then changed their mind. 
  Following residents’ complaints, the local council has sent a letter to residents of the 14 streets informing them that their family members can apply for parking permits. Yet, details were vague on who will be applicable.
 Residents were asked to bring a copy of their family members’ ID card and log book to the local council.
 “How will this work? Who can apply? Can cousins apply, but not second cousins,” Sammut asked, criticising the council’s lack of consultation.
 Questions were sent to the PL mayor Marija Sara Vella Gafà.

Authorities increase their checks on Y-Plate cab drivers,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/authorities-increase-checks-yplate-cab-drivers.1096777,18-08-2024,002448.png,"The authorities have been conducting regular road checks on Y-plate drivers to ensure they have valid documents, a transport ministry spokesperson said. 
 The inspections come as part of the government’s crackdown on the industry in recent weeks, with hundreds of third-country nationals applying to work as cab drivers and food app couriers having work permit applications refused.
 Prime Minister Robert Abela later announced that new cab drivers and those changing employers will not be given a work permit.
 Abela said the cab and food courier industry is “saturated”, adding: “Having excess workers in these two industries will create a situation where the oversupply (of workers) is detrimental to the country’s infrastructure.”
 Transport Malta is conducting the inspections every day, while checks involving the police, Jobsplus and Identità are taking place weekly, according to the transport ministry spokesperson.
 “During these joint inspections, authorities involved are primarily verifying that Y-plate vehicle drivers possess the necessary documentation and permits required to operate in Malta. This includes checking for valid driving licences, work permits and compliance with employment regulations,” the spokesperson said.
 Transport Malta officials ask for driver tags, driver’s licence and the vehicle’s licence. Jobsplus personnel check employment and work permit status, Identità officials check the driver’s immigration status and the police provide enforcement support, the spokesperson said.
 Besides the driver’s papers, Transport Malta is also checking the vehicles for safety standards and to make sure they are legally registered for their intended use.
 “Apart from Y-plate vehicles, these road inspections are also focusing on private and commercial vehicles,” the transport ministry spokesperson said.
 
 Most of Malta’s cab drivers on apps like Bolt, Uber and e-Cabs are third-country nationals who work for fleets – companies that provide cars and drivers for the platforms.
 Bolt, Malta’s largest cab platform, said that its prices and waiting times have significantly increased as a result. It later added that it lost a fifth of its drivers when renewals and applications for new work permits were rejected.
 The transport ministry provided data on the checks of the last 10 days.
 The authorities found 21 people living in Malta illegally, 13 people driving without a licence, one dangerous vehicle, one Y-plate cab without a licence and insurance and one vehicle that was overloaded, the spokesperson said.
 The checks were conducted at Pender Gardens, Marsascala, Kennedy Grove and Kappara.

Chamber’s Msida park proposal called ‘impossible and dangerous’,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/chamber-msida-park-proposal-called-impossible-dangerous.1097494,09-03-2024,"002466.png,002467.png","Infrastructure Malta thinks the chamber of architects’ vision for a tree-filled alternative to its Msida Creek project is “impossible” and “dangerous”, according to a leaked report seen by Times of Malta. 
 In June, the chamber – Kamra tal-Periti – proposed ditching the agency’s planned flyover in favour of  a 20,000-square-metre park with more than 2,000 trees, saying it would enhance residents’ quality of life and even improve the traffic flow in the area.
 The agency rejected the proposal, however, with former Infrastructure Malta CEO Ivan Falzon calling it “too late” and a “desperate attempt to make the headlines”.
 A leaked IM report shows the agency met with the chamber to discuss the proposal and outlined a slew of alleged technical difficulties with the idea. The report was compiled following the meeting in late June, when the issues were discussed with the chamber. 
 According to the technical appraisal carried out by the agency, the proposed park and traffic rerouting are “impossible to implement due to substantial technical issues”.
 IM thinks the issues it has identified with the project “will result in a danger to the general public and road users,” potentially damage private property and leading to a “substantial increase in traffic, noise and pollution”.
 Responding to the issues identified in the report, KtP president André Pizzuto called them “excuses”, and offered the chamber’s help to realise its idea.  
 “If they don’t have the expertise to do it, we are very happy to assist them,” he said.  
 IM thinks the chamber’s plans to close Triq Mikiel Anton Vassalli (leading up to the skatepark) and divert traffic west around the junction close to Valley Road won’t work.
 The agency believes the road joining Msida to Valley Road is not large enough to make up for closing the four-lane Triq Mikiel Anton Vassalli and thinks the nearby junction is ill-equipped to handle the increased traffic. 
 Closing Triq Mikiel Anton Vassalli would lead to “substantial traffic pile-up... additional traffic, noise and pollution and overspill of traffic into residential roads,” the report says. 
 Meanwhile, KtP’s plans to remove parking around the planned park is “not considered acceptable” due to its impact on commercial activity, residents and road users.
 The report also highlights increased journey distances by diverting traffic around the area, noting a route from Pietà to Rue D’Argens, for example, would lengthen by more than 2,400% compared to the agency’s plans.
 Announcing the KtP’s idea in June, Pizzuto said that despite the longer routes, traffic would keep moving. The planned flyover, however, would simply move tailbacks from the existing traffic lights in Msida up to the skatepark and across the flyover, he said. 
 Meanwhile, the agency thinks the chamber’s proposal to build a new slip road leading down from the Regional Road into Msida is “unjustified”, arguing it would uproot trees and destroy landscaped areas, take up cultivated agricultural land and lead to “huge traffic pileup” on Regional Road.
  Pizzuto said the chamber welcomed IM’s “newfound concern for the uprooting of trees,” but stressed that building the slip road would not require trees to be removed. 
 He added that by promoting public transport in the area, the stretch of road between Msida and Valley Road would be quieter, with traffic flow “smaller than in IM’s proposal, which will increase traffic in the area by 31%, according to their own transport study”.
 
 The chamber argues that adding trees and grass will absorb rainwater, helping to alleviate the flooding regularly seen in the area during some periods of the year – but IM disagrees. 
 It says that because of the area’s proximity to the sea, the ground is already “saturated” and not able to absorb more water. 
 “Soak-aways only work in areas where the terrain is free draining and not saturated,” the report says, warning additional water could risk “structurally affecting” buildings close to the piazza. 
 Rainwater, meanwhile, would “run along the landscaped area, eroding the terrain and resulting in a danger to pedestrians... with soil and cars deposited in the sea”, the report says. 
 “Unless a water course is provided for the water levels will rise and adjacent buildings flooded... Mistakes from the past cannot be repeated.”
 Other issues identified in the report include disagreements about rerouting power, water and telecommunications pipes and cables, shadows being cast by walls supporting a proposed roof over Triq Mikiel Anton Vassalli, and the KtP not including some community buildings in its original proposal – while accepting the chamber said they can be accommodated. 
 Calling the issues raised by IM “excuses”, Pizzuto said the chamber stood ready to assist authorities but had concerns about the agency’s existing plans. 
 Pizzuto said the chamber had received reports that the flyover planned by infrastructure and transport officials was “in breach of EU standards”, adding the KtP was considering “asking for a risk assessment to ensure public safety as the regulator of the profession”.
 Questioning the reason for the project in the first place, Pizzuto called the “whole concept flawed”, stressing that congestion at peak hours was normal at busy junctions.
 He added that Msida did not feature in the list of “priority projects” agreed with the European Commission. 
 “Of the people we met at Transport Malta, none of them were transport planners, and I doubt the people who wrote this [report] were, either,” he said.

Fewer than 100 roads fixed in Gozo since 2018,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/fewer-100-roads-fixed-gozo-since-2018.1101928,12-10-2024,002590.png,"Fewer than 100 roads in Gozo were fixed over the past seven years, since the Labour party’s 2017 electoral pledge to repave all Malta and Gozo’s roads, according to data obtained by Times of Malta. 
 The data shows that 83 roads across the island were completed since 2018, with several others either undergoing works at the moment or set to start shortly.
 In October, Times of Malta  revealed that Infrastructure Malta had resurfaced almost 1,400 roads in Malta as part of the €700m electoral pledge.
 But this excludes Gozo’s roads, which fall squarely under the responsibility of the Gozo ministry, rather than Infrastructure Malta.
 The figures show that while authorities have been busy repaving some 200 roads a year in Malta, roadworks in Gozo have proceeded at a far more leisurely pace, with just a dozen roads completed each year.
 Unsurprisingly, the capital of Victoria is the locality where most roadworks took place, with 14 roads being fixed up in recent years. But almost half of these were partial fixes, with only certain parts of the road being resurfaced.
 Other towns which saw more roadworks than most include Xagħra, where 12 roads were re-done, including extensive works on the road leading to Marsalforn, and Xewkija, where 11 roads were repaved.
 Roadworks were also carried out in several other towns, including Nadur, Għasri and Kerċem.
 A Gozo ministry spokesperson told Times of Malta that several other roads are earmarked for repaving, with many of them in the throes of the government’s procurement procedures.
 Others, including roads Sannat road and Qala’s Triq il-Wardija, have been assigned to developers but work has yet to kick off.
 And a further 4.9 kilometres worth of roadworks across Kerċem, Munxar, Nadur, Qala and Għarb will be carried out with the help of EU funds, the spokesperson said.
 Meanwhile, the controversial roadworks between Victoria and Marsalforn are set to kick off in the upcoming months, after authorities said they had reached a compromise with environmental NGOs that previously objected to the project.
 The state of the roads in Gozo was a reflection of how Gozo had been forgotten by the present government, especially where the infrastructure was concerned, Nationalist MP and shadow minister for Gozo Alex Borg said.
 Reacting to the Times of Malta story, Borg observed that in recent years, every budget has seen a substantial decrease in capital investment, particularly in road infrastructure, except for 2022 – the election year – when there was a minimal increase. Since then, capital investment has dropped below 2013 levels.
 When inflation and rising construction costs were factored in, it became evident that Gozo had not only been neglected but completely forgotten.
 ""Infrastructure is the backbone of Gozo’s economic and tourism sectors. If the foundation is weak, everything starts to decline gradually,"" Borg said.
 He said the PN remained committed to working in coordination with Gozo’s local councils to identify and carry out the necessary roadworks, ensuring that Gozo no longer lagged in basic infrastructure that determined the quality of life for its residents and visitors.

'Żurrieq farmland will only be developed 'if it benefits community': government,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/zurrieq-farmland-developed-if-benefits-community-government.1092258,15-05-2024,002593.png,"Government-owned agricultural land in Żurrieq will be developed only if it benefits the community, the Lands Ministry said on Friday. 
 The statement was published following mounting pressure from Żurrieq residents, farmers and the council itself to rescind its consent for a stretch of publically owned land to be rezoned into a residential area. 
 The site, in an area known as Tal-Bebbux, is currently tilled by farmers whose families worked the land for generations. It was added to the development zone in 2006, when local plans were updated. 
 Times of Malta  reported last week that a planning control application is proposing the alignment of a new road through the arable land, connecting Triq il-Kanonku Vinċenz Balzan with Triq l-Imqabba. The application is also proposing residential zoning with a height limitation of three floors plus a semi-basement.
 The Lands Authority confirmed with Times of Malta that last year it “gave its consent so that the PA may evaluate the PC application”.
 The applicant is Francis Spiteri, who owns Tal-Karmnu Construction Company. His architect is Mauro Debono.
 Żurrieq’s PL-led local council also objected to the PC, saying the government had, in the past, committed to allocating at least half of the site for social and community facilities.
 On Friday, the Lands Ministry said the government-owned land ""will be used only for projects that benefit society and the needs of the Żurrieq community"".
 However, it did not say whether it would be drawing its consent for the PC.
 In the statement, the ministry said it will determine the best use of that land following talks with the local council and stakeholders.
 It will meanwhile inform the PA about the government's position over the matter.
 When news broke about the PC, Żurrieq residents stuck yellow stickers on their doorbells and letterboxes warning candidates for the European and local elections to stay away unless they were against the  Tal-Bebbux application and development plans for  In-Nigret. 
 Għaqda Residenti taż-Żurrieq and Moviment Graffitti have also planned a demonstration on Saturday against the application. 
 On Friday, Moviment Graffitti said the government's statement comes after the same ministry had given its go-ahead to the developer to submit an application ""to develop that land into blocks of apartments"".
 ""As a first step, the Lands Authority should officially withdraw the consent it had given to the developer when he submitted the application with the PA.""
  NGO Il-Kollettiv  and Għaqda Residenti taż-Żurrieq meanwhile said on Facebook they took note of the government's commitment against development at tal-Bebbux.
 However, for as long as conditions continued to allow development on virgin land, they would continue taking a stand against development in the locality.
 They commended the efforts of the local council but said the fight at tal-Bebbux was not over yet.

 A person who saw the incident estimated that the boat was only between 50 and 75 meters away when it ran aground, violating the law requiring vessels to stay at least 200 meters from the coast.
 He believes that the darkness likely limited the captain's visibility.
 CPD earlier told Times of Malta there were 14 people aboard.

 Police said the incident happened at around 6pm but that no injuries were reported.
 An onlooker said the air was ""thick with smoke and there were some noises that sounded like explosions"".
  Images captured of the incident show firefighters tackling the blaze onboard the vessel which Mediterranean Maritime Hub (MMH) executive chairperson Angelique Abela confirmed was 43 metres in length.
 ""It's a fibreglass vessel and the fire is contained to the vessel itself. We do not know how it happened but we know there was no casualties as nobody was on the vessel. No works were being carried out,"" said Abela.
  Contacted by Times of Malta, a spokesperson for the Home Affairs Ministry said the civil protection department was having difficulty containing the fire as it had spread close to the vessel's engine room, describing the fumes from the blaze as ""very toxic"" due to the burning fibreglass.
 When contacted, Superintendent of Public Health Charmaine Gauci said all residents were ""strongly advised"" to stay indoors and keep all windows and doors closed as a precautionary measure. 
 In a statement, the health department said anyone experiencing symptoms such as difficulty breathing, persistent cough, or chest pain should seek immediate medical attention.
  In a Facebook post earlier on Friday evening, Home Affairs minister Byron Camilleri said the fire developed in a ship that was set up for repair in a private shipyard in Marsa.
 “Firefighters from the Civil Protection are on the scene to control the fire. I have been informed that there are no reports of injured people,”he said, asking the public to avoid the area.

 Frank Frendo's boathouse had already been sanctioned through a 2017 application (PA 2319/17) but further work was carried out since.
 A second application - submitted in 2022 seeking to sanction alterations to the 42.6 square metre boathouse, including a rear extension of 8.7 square metre - had initially been refused.
  The PA had refused the application, citing that the proposed extension violated key objectives of the Strategic Plan for Environment and Development, including those intended to prevent illegitimate development in rural areas and protect the landscape's positive qualities.
 In his appeal, Frendo - represented by former MEPA CEO Ian Stafrace - argued that the PA had wrongly applied the policies and laws governing the site. 
 He emphasised that the extension was minimal and positioned at the rear of the boathouse, concealed by higher adjacent boathouses and built using weathered stone and timber apertures in keeping with the site's vernacular architecture. 
 Frendo also argued that other boathouses in the area had been similarly extended and sanctioned under the Dwejra Action Plan.
 The PA contended that the site in question was located within a protected area, designated as part of the Natura 2000 network. 
 It cited environmental concerns, including the potential degradation of the site and intensification of built development, which would set a negative precedent for similar development in the future. 
 The PA also referenced discrepancies between the approved configuration and the more recent alterations.
 But despite the PA’s objections, EPRT ruled in favour of Frendo.
 It noted that the extension was minor, hidden from view, and lower than neighbouring boathouses. 
 It also found that the extension did not cause environmental degradation.
 EPRT observed that while the extension had occurred after the issuance of the previous permit, this did not automatically make it unacceptable. 
 It also took into consideration the unique context of the site, stating, “The extension is minimal and does not result in environmental degradation”.
 EPRT ordered the PA to issue the development permit within 30 days, subject to the imposition of standard conditions and a planning obligation of €69.88 per square metre of the extension. 
 A fine is also to be imposed for sanctioning the development, to be paid within six months before the issuance of the full development permit.

‘I heard a big crashing noise’ - neighbour of collapse site unable to go home,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/i-heard-big-crashing-noise-neighbour-collapse-site-unable-go-home.1092680,20-05-2024,"003247.png,003248.png","Almost a month after the first-floor ceiling of a Sliema building collapsed, killing a worker, the elderly couple who live next door have been told it is still too dangerous for them to return home. 
 “I just want to go back,” said Antoinette Debono, 77, standing in front of the police tape cordoning off the home where she has lived with her husband for 53 years.
  Their property in Ignatius Street is next to the building where the fatal accident happened on April 20.
 At around 9.30am that morning, the ceiling of the building’s first floor collapsed, killing Albanian worker Bari Balla, a father of six. Another worker, a 31-year-old man, also from Albania, was injured. A magisterial inquiry is under way.
 Antoinette, a retired teacher, was preparing food in her kitchen with her dog Gaia when she realised something was seriously wrong.
 “I heard a big crashing noise. My dog came running to me. I heard the voice of a man calling a name. It was not a name that sounded familiar. Now I know it was Albanian. It was followed by words that sounded like they were meaning: ‘talk to me’. It’s reminiscent of the movies,” recalls Antoinette in vivid detail.
 Works at the site, a 1920s, three-storey townhouse, were illegal. The developer and architect had obtained planning permission on March 26 to add a receded floor and extend existing ones but that permit stated that no works could begin until a 30-day appeal period had lapsed.
 The site was being developed into a shared living space.
 On the Wednesday before the accident, the project manager informed the neighbours they would hear noises because they would be testing the load-bearing capacity of the walls.
 For the next few days, Antoinette heard drilling sounds – “as though someone was fixing frames to the walls around the house”.
 After the collapse, she recalls walking out into the yard, near the kitchen, and shouting to see if anyone needed help. 
 “I went upstairs onto a terrace that overlooks the other yard. I looked out and saw nothing. I started shouting again. A man opened the door to the yard. A dust cloud came out. He shouted: ‘come, come, help ambulance’,” she said.
  Antoinette ran to the front of the house. The man, covered in dust, opened the front door and another cloud dust gushed out. Another man walked out of the building, dusted himself, got his haversack and ran away, she said.
 After she called 112, neighbours and other people started gathering, including the owner of the grocery nearby, who went inside the dusty building.
 “When he came out, he said: ‘He’s dead. There’s no way he’s still alive’,” Antoinette said.
 The police, ambulance and civil protection arrived within minutes. The young man who was calling for help was given assistance and taken to hospital and the body of the dead worker was pulled out from under the rubble.
 Antoinette and her husband George have been out of their home ever since after being told it was too dangerous to
 stay. They were told that the staircase of the damaged building was attached to the wall of her house. There was the risk that, if the stairs collapsed further, they would pull down her wall. Her house and the accident site have since been cordoned off.
 The building on the other side of the site – a guest house – is also closed off.
 Antoinette and her husband have been able to enter their house three times so far – to gather some belongings. Each time they need permission and have to be escorted by police. They keep being told that works will “soon” start to secure the structure.
 “Each time I remember things I need, like the ironing board, the blood pressure machine and the glucose machine. Now I keep a list of what I need so I can get them the next time I go… I want to go home. But I want it to be safe. Why does it need to take so long to secure the structure? Our house risks getting damaged in the meantime,” she says.
 Next week the insurance company will be inspecting her home for damages before works can start.

 It was gridlock along much of the Marsa-Ħamrun bypass on Monday morning after a car caught fire, according to Transport Malta. 
 The transport watchdog said at 5 am a car was reported to have caught fire on the northbound Marsa-Ħamrun bypass. 
 Almost four hours later, the lane was still closed to traffic. A Transport Malta spokesperson told Times of Malta the lane reopened at 10.25 am.
  “Once it is certain that there is no danger left for drivers passing through this area, the road will be fully reopened to traffic,” Transport Malta said in a statement. 
 A Transport Malta spokesperson said no one was injured in the accident.
 The Civil Protection Department said the incident had caused large amounts of fuel and oil to disperse on the road, requiring the use of HAZMAT units to clean up.   
  Popular Facebook page Maltese Roads Traffic Updates reported traffic accumulating at 7 am, citing reports of an oil spill on the Northbound lane. 
 Two hours later, Transport Malta issued an official statement on social media, attributing delays to a fire. 
  It took one commuter over an hour to arrive in Marsa after leaving Żejtun at 7.10 am. 
 One driver said it took her 45 minutes to drive one kilometre. 
 Another said it took him 50 minutes to drive to Santa Venera from Gudja.

St Paul’s Bay residents to protest over privatisation of public beaches,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/st-paul-bay-residents-protest-privatisation-public-beaches.1098078,13-09-2024,"003150.png,003151.png","Frustrated St Paul’s Bay residents are set to protest this Sunday against the ongoing privatisation of public beaches, with Bugibba's Perched Beach at the centre of the controversy.
 The protest, which will take place at 5 pm at the popular beach, will be led by residents and supported by activist groups Moviment Graffitti and Flimkien għal Ambjent Aħjar (FAA).  ADPD Chairperson and St Paul’s Bay local councillor Sandra Gauci, a vocal critic of beach privatisation, is one of the main organisers.
 “We are losing our beaches, centimetre by centimetre. If we don’t act now, soon there will be nothing left,” Gauci told Times of Malta.
 She urged residents from across coastal areas to unite in the fight to keep public spaces accessible.
 “The coast belongs to the people, not private businesses,” she said.
 Sunday’s protest is a rallying cry to reclaim public beaches.
 “What we don’t fight for today, we lose tomorrow,” residents said in a statement, calling on the wider public to join them in their stand against beach privatisation.
  Perched Beach, initially approved in 2006 as a sandy retreat for tourists, has seen increasing encroachment by private enterprises.
 Tourism Minister at the time, Francis Zammit Dimech, wrote an article for the Times of Malta that same year in which he specified that the beach would remain  public: ""Once again, we shall ensure that the public area remains just that—public: for the free enjoyment of one and all,”
 However, local concerns have grown over recent years, with the latest plans from the Dolmen Hotel sparking fresh outrage.
 Proposals to build kiosks, restaurants, and pool decks along the Bugibba promenade have been criticised heavily by residents who fear even further loss of access to the beach.
 Adding fuel to the fire, the Planning Authority recently approved temporary beach furniture and a mobile bar at Perched Beach.
 Critics also pointed out that the Malta Tourism Authority had spent over €900,000 to replenish sand at Perched Beach and St George’s Bay. 
 In 2017, the Planning Authority approved DB Group's lido and tunnel development despite opposition from the local council, which argued that it would further restrict public access.
 This protest comes amidst a broader backlash against what residents describe as unchecked overdevelopment in St Paul’s Bay. Gauci and other local leaders last year expressed concern that public spaces are being sacrificed to developers, leaving the community in “dust, dirt, and noise.

 Mark Agius, a business partner of Gozitan property magnate Joseph Portelli, was granted permission to extend his Ħal Gelmus project on land previously occupied by the Magro Brothers tomato processing plant in Victoria.
 The PA Board approved, by seven votes to one, the addition of 50 garages, 35 residences, roof-level pools for penthouses, three commercial units and a gymnasium for the complex. Since the new development will result in a shortfall of four parking spaces, the PA imposed a contribution of €17,000 towards the Planning Authority’s Urban Improvements Fund for the locality.
 The original permit for the project was granted to Excel Investments Limited just three days before the last general election in March 2022.
 A month later, through his architect Maria Schembri Grima, who was previously the chairperson of the government’s Building and Construction Authority, Agius applied to expand the development and transform units into shops.
  The almost 6,500 square-metre site lies on Triq il-Wied and Triq Pawlu Portelli in Victoria, within the development boundary. Most of the project has already been built.
 The previous ex-Magro Brothers factory was demolished, while the adjacent two-storey old building was retained.
 The case officer concluded in his report that with the increase and the proposed residential, commercial and leisure development were acceptable since they complied with the specific policies and were also in line with the height limitation on both streets.
 The Superintendence for Cultural Heritage objected to the proposed extension of the project, noting that the previous application was approved despite its strong reservations regarding the building mass and its impact on views from the Ċittadella.
 This extension would increase the massing and volumes of the approved development, further encroaching upon the Urban Conservation Area, further engulfing a series of vernacular buildings and potentially exacerbating the negative impact on views from the Ċittadella, it said as it expressed its “strong reservations”.
 The SCH  said that the proposed development should include adequate terracing away from the vernacular buildings and the urban conservation area in an adequate transition that does not visually dominate the buildings.
 Despite these warnings and other objections, including from Din l-Art Ħelwa, the case officer recommended the project for approval.
 The board accepted this recommendation, with only NGO representative Romano Cassar, voting against.

 Residents were left fuming by the joint apartment block under construction on Triq it-Trill as it extends across the pavement and onto the road, forcing pedestrians onto the street.
 But, when contacted, architect Christian Spiteri said the new development was following the building line prescribed by law and that other buildings in the street had been built too far back.
 “The building is following the official alignment from the Planning Authority,” he said.
  Spiteri said the Planning Authority had contacted him following a complaint from a resident but “verified the development was being done in accordance with the legal alignment”.
 Stressing the importance of following the building line specified by law, the architect said properties would, otherwise, be placed “haphazardly”. 
 He said he “scrupulously” follows plans and the law, while confirming the owner would be “obliged” to provide a pavement round the property.
 Construction contractor Alexander Aquilina said the front of the building next door was “not good”, echoing Spiteri’s assertion that neighbouring properties were not built as far forward as they should have been.
 He said other properties would need to be extended, requiring the road to be narrowed by around two metres.
  Aquilina added that his work was done, however, and that another company would need to install the new pavement round the property. The building replaced a previous block of apartments on the site but historic Google images show the previous row of buildings were all aligned.
 In 2021, owner Erika Gialanze applied to demolish the two joined apartment blocks that used to occupy the site and excavate two floors below street level to “accommodate eight garages, two car spaces and construction of 10 residential units”, according to the PA website.
 The site, which lies within the development zone, was recommended for approval by the PA case officer later that year.

Swieqi bridge closed overnight after concrete falls off underpass ceiling,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/swieqi-bridge-closed-overnight-concrete-falls-off-underpass-ceiling.1093841,13-06-2024,003610.png,"The bridge connecting Swieqi and Paceville was closed to traffic on Tuesday night following spalling damage, Infrastructure Malta said on Wednesday.
 A spokesperson told Times of Malta that the bridge and underneath passageway were reopened for vehicular and pedestrian traffic by Wednesday morning.
 Spalling is the deterioration of steel-reinforced concrete  - in severe cases, concrete sections completely break away from the reinforcing rebar, exposing it to the elements.
 In March, independent MEP candidate Arnold Cassola had raised concern about the structure, questioning whether the bridge was on the “verge of collapsing”.
 But IM had said the bridge did not pose an ""imminent danger”, stressing plans to demolish the bridge were part of a wider project announced last January to improve the area.
 In April IM carried out works to repair cracks in the road surface of the bridge
 Late on Tuesday, Swieqi local council candidate Jordan Galea Pace posted photos of concrete on the ground in the underpass. 
 ""Utterly shocking. What was predicted to happen is happening. I brought this up a few weeks ago and no action has been taken since: they covered up the sinking bridge with a fresh layer of tarmac but ignored the foundation and haven’t answered the requests for clarification,"" he wrote on Facebook.
 ""Is anyone going to be held responsible? Is anyone going to take action? Or are we just going to sit and wait till Swieqi Bridge collapses on residents?""
 On Wednesday IM said in a statement that during scheduled maintenance on Triq Mikiel Anton Vassalli in St Julian's, which passes over the underpass connecting Triq is-Swieqi to Triq Santu Wistin, workers noticed that part of the concrete had cracked and fell off.
 ""The bridge was immediately closed, and an emergency intervention was carried out by workers under professional supervision to promptly remove any loose concrete sections.
 ""The bridge was safely reopened a few hours later after being certified by an architect.""

Authorities to discuss parking schemes with local councils,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/authorities-discuss-parking-schemes-local-councils.1093770,06-10-2024,003787.png,"The authorities are planning to hold a meeting with mayors to discuss residents’ parking schemes, Transport Minister Chris Bonett said on Monday.
 He said fresh interest in such parking schemes was raised after a pilot scheme was introduced for several streets in Gudja, near the airport, where residents had complained about travellers leaving their cars there for many days while they went abroad.
 The minister said that once the local councils were reconstituted, a meeting would be held with them to discuss parking schemes. He stressed that parking schemes would only be considered for localities which indicated particular, justifiable reasons.
 “There will be no blanket parking schemes,"" he stressed.  
 The Resident Priority Parking in Gudja was introduced last week. Non-residents are only being allowed to park in particular streets between 7am and 8pm.
 Nationalist MP Mark Anthony Sammut described the Gudja scheme as ""a mess"" and residents were up in arms about it. This amounted to a curfew, with residents needing to send any visitors away before 8pm.
 Sammut asked who the government had consulted since the council was not.
 The minister replied that if the MP considered this to be a mess, he should not have applied for a permit to park. The authorities, he said, had consulted and heeded the people whereas other governments ignored them for the past 14 years. He acknowledged it was not a perfect scheme, and said it could be improved.
 Parking schemes have long been controversial. In 2013, then Transport Minister Joe Mizzi said that an analysis into Residents' Parking Schemes indicated that they should be abolished.
 In 2016, the Sliema council filed a judicial protest after it was stopped from running its own residential parking scheme back in 2013 a few days into its introduction.
 In 2007, a court ruled against reserved parking zones for residents saying it was ultra vires the powers of local councils.
 But in 2016 the Constitutional Court gave such zones the green light, ruling that they were not discriminatory.
 This was the bone of contention in a hard-fought, drawn-out legal battle embarked upon by a Swieqi couple in 2002 when they received a ticket for parking their car in a bay reserved for Pietà residents only.

 The service was meant to start operating in late spring but was delayed because of permits issues. 
 The service will be run by a company owned by Paul Gauci, the local entrepreneur whose PG Group controls the Pavi and Pama supermarkets and the local branch of Spanish retailer Zara, among others.
 In January 2023, Gauci acquired the Marina di Ragusa, one of Sicily's largest marinas, in an undisclosed multi-million deal.
 The Ragusa Xpress will use a catamaran that is no newcomer on Sicily trips, having been previously operated by the company it will be competing with, Virtu Ferries.
 It can carry a maximum of 430 passengers and 21 cars and will take one hour and 45 minutes to cross between the Grand Harbour and Marina di Ragusa. Virtu had used the catamaran to evacuate people from Libya in 2011 and again in 2015 but then sold it to a German company, which used it to operate charter trips in the Caribbean.
 It has now returned to Grand Harbour after being acquired by Gauci to operate the new ferry service. 
 The Ragusa Xpress will vie for passengers with Virtu Ferries' long-standing ferry operation, which runs two trips a day between Malta and Pozzallo, in southern Sicily.  Virtu Ferries uses much larger vessels that can carry twice as many passengers, more cars and commercial vehicles of up 19 metres in length. 
 Another contender for a slice of the Malta-Sicily ferry market, Ponte Ferries, proved to be short-lived. The company started operating in late 2021 but called it quits last year, following multiple problems.

 The Planning Authority is set to decide on the application for the house in in Triq il-Ħemel on Friday. 
 In a statement, Swieqi Mayor Noel Muscat said that the council is opposing the application as it will see a street of good urban quality, made up of 17 two-storey terraced houses, destroyed forever if approved. 
 He said that the case officer's recommendation to approve the application is ""unacceptable"" and goes against the PA's own purpose for existing.  
 Muscat cited the landmark pencil development judgement which also took the PA to task for approving applications that go against policy. 
 The judgment has found that sparse and scattered developments did not constitute a commitment for higher buildings.
 ""This confirms that the commitment argument cannot be applied in this case. Thus, the case officer’s rash decision to recommend approval in this case, should be a non-starter and should be ignored by the board,"" Muscat said. 
 ""The Authority should instead go back to real planning principles in determining particularly sensitive applications and not jump into loopholes, just to encourage more development.""
 The council said that it is also supporting residents' claims that the project would be in breach of an agreement made with the Archbishop’s Curia.
 In their objections, the residents noted that the terraced house in question was built on a plot of land known as Art Tal-Kbira originally granted by the Archbishop’s Curia to engaged couples to construct terraced houses. This was a contractual obligation which remained when Church properties were transferred to the Joint Office, they argued.
 ""Their contract clearly forbade them from exploiting the property commercially, which would be the case were their houses to be developed into apartments - possibly more rentals and B&Bs - which would undoubtedly disturb the harmony of the area and the well-being of the residents,"" Muscat said. 
 ""We once more appeal to the Planning Authority to seriously take note of the above and live up to its name and “act on behalf of the community” in refusing this application.""

 Infrastructural work carried out in one of the Santa Venera tunnels which caused traffic jams stretching to the south of the island on Thursday morning needed to be carried out overnight to ensure motorists' safety.
 Infrastructure Malta and Transport Malta said in a statement the emergency works in the northbound tunnel are expected to be completed by Friday morning.
 Between Wednesday and Thursday, two layers of asphalt were stripped along the tunnel, before applying a base asphalt layer.
 Since the road was reopened at 5am without the final asphalt layer, commuters had to drive through cautiously, leading to heavier-than-usual traffic, IM and TM said. 
 The work will continue on Thursday at 9pm and should be completed by Friday 5am. 
 On Thursday morning, traffic jams built up on most main roads in the south of Malta when traffic from both ways was diverted through one Santa Venera tunnel.
 According to the Malta Roads Traffic Update website, Tal-Barrani Road and Vjal Santa Lucija, Triq Għajn Dwieli in Cospicua starting from near Verdala school were jammed with traffic continuing all the way to Marsa, Zabbar Road Fgura and surrounding areas.

 Infrastructure Malta said the entity has taken note of the danger and will start repair works ""in the coming days"".
 Parts of a wall along St Paul’s Bay bypass in Xemxija is visibly leaning outwards, with some large stone blocks dislodged. 
 Police tape and signs warning 'danger' have been placed around the wall.
 The wall has been in a precarious state for some time, but the police tape and sign are recent additions.
  A Times of Malta reader expressed concerns about the safety risks of the road. 
 ""The wall is about to crash over into the road, and the rocks could kill somebody, especially with the anticipated September heavy rains,"" the reader said.
 An Infrastructure Malta spokesperson said while the wall belongs to a ""third party"", the road is the responsibility of the agency.
 ""We will start with repair works in the coming days,"" the spokesperson said. 
 St Paul's Bay mayor Censu Galea said: ""If the wall collapses, there is no doubt it could be dangerous, and some of the stones on site will end up on the street.""
 On Wednesday, Infrastructure Malta announced it would be starting emergency works on the retaining wall. 
 To ensure safety, part of the lane in the direction from Burmarrad to Xemixijja will be closed while works are ongoing and only one lane will remain open to traffic. 
 The works are planned to be completed by the end of next week.

Portelli vs Stivala: developers divided on offices oversupply,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/portelli-vs-stivala-developers-divided-offices-oversupply.1097627,09-05-2024,"003788.png,003789.png,003790.png","Two of Malta’s largest developers disagree over whether the country is suffering from an oversupply of office spaces.
 Mercury Tower developer Joseph Portelli said he was “avoiding” office developments amid a decline in the market fuelled by lacklustre demand and a slew of vacant properties.
 But fellow developer and Malta Developers Association (MDA) head Michael Stivala thinks an oversupply of office space is not the issue, instead blaming any slowdown in the sector on a lack of investment and inadequate infrastructure.
 Six months ago, a leading real estate agent said the prices of commercial properties had fallen by a fifth, signalling a troubling time for the sector.
 And in a recent interview with Times of Malta, the head of the Malta Chamber,  Marthese Portelli said studies had pointed to an “oversupply of office space and yet the Planning Authority keeps issuing permits for office buildings”.
 She added that the “same applies to supermarkets and shopping malls,” while questioning if the country needed to build any more.
 Portelli agreed with the Chamber head, saying rents on office spaces had dropped in recent years due to an exodus of businesses during the pandemic, when working from home became normalised, and these businesses had not returned.
  And meanwhile, new offices were continuing to be built, the Gozitan property magnate said.
 “In reality, I’m avoiding offices – and even hotels, there’s such an oversupply,” he said, adding the same was true for supermarkets, in line with the Chamber head’s comments.
 He said he had left the office market, noting his recent Mercury Tower development has no office spaces, instead dedicated to shops – which he said were fully occupied – apartments and a hotel.
 Stivala said his offices were more than 90 per cent occupied, describing the market as “not as good as a few years ago but not catastrophic”.
 He stressed many of the new office blocks springing up were the result of building applications that had started years before, in some cases before the COVID-19 pandemic.
 “Many offices are from old permits; if an office is being built, in reality the project started three or four years ago. For example, I started the tower in Gżira 20 years ago – [and] it took about five to six years to get the permit,” he said.
 Portelli, meanwhile, would not be drawn on whether new office developments springing up were the lagged effect of permits submitted five or six years ago, but stressed it was “much easier” – and quicker – to get permits in the past.
 “Today, we spend a year to get a permit,” he said, partly attributing the delays to environmental and conservation NGOs, whom he said had “organised themselves in a way that makes getting permits very difficult”.
 Stivala thinks the issue is “not an oversupply of office space, but Malta not being attractive enough for some businesses.”
 Charging excessive bureaucracy with harming Malta’s competitiveness, the MDA head said, “red tape is affecting local businesses and foreign companies looking to invest in Malta,” adding banks were “reluctant” to lend to foreign companies.
  Rather than cutting back on offices, Stivala thinks the country should continue to invest in commercial real estate, provided it is of high enough quality.   “Office jobs are the highest paying in Malta. We need high-quality offices to attract high-quality companies and wages,” he said.
 “The offices we’re building now are of much better quality than before; when I started out, developers used to convert residential spaces to offices, now they’re purpose-built,” he said, pointing to developments in St Julian’s and Mrieħel as examples.
 Asked about other issues he thought were affecting the country’s attractiveness, Stivala pointed to overcrowding and issues with the country’s transport network. “The country needs more investment,” he said.
 On supermarkets, Stivala does not think there is an oversupply and argues their number should be left up to demand in the market.
 “The market will dictate how many supermarkets we need, and the minute we start to cap how many we have, the consumer will lose,” he said.
 Drawing parallels with hotels, the MDA head said, “as a hotelier, I should not want more to be granted permits, to cut competition – but then prices would go up and there would be a decrease in quality, because I would have less competition.”
 “The more competition there is, the more competitive prices will be. We saw this with the taxis; the government started refusing permits and prices shot up. At the end of the day, the customer suffered.”

"Cab fares and waiting times increase after work permit clampdown, Bolt confirms",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/cab-fares-waiting-times-increase-work-permit-clampdown-bolt-confirms.1096173,08-01-2024,003833.png,"Prices of cabs have increased since a government clampdown on work permits for third-country nationals, ride-hailing platform Bolt has confirmed. 
 A spokesperson for the company said fewer available drivers coupled with higher demand had led to “longer periods of surge prices and longer waiting times.” 
 Surge prices refer to higher prices that usually kick in at peak times to encourage drivers to work during busy periods.
 It comes a week after hundreds of people applying to work as cab drivers and food delivery couriers had their work permit applications refused.
 The government said new applications by third-country nationals for cab driving and food courier work permits were being turned down because the market had ""reached saturation"".
 Over the past several days, social media users have highlighted higher-than-expected prices and longer waiting times on the app for Bolt, the most popular ride-hailing platform in the country.  
 James Vella Clark said he was being quoted up to €15.50 on the platform for a cab ride from Mrieħel to Marsa on Wednesday. 
 ""This move to cut down on cab drivers is not only very badly timed at the height of summer but has already started pushing prices up,"" he said.
 Msida councillor Christine Amaira replied she had faced “almost double” the normal price for a journey from Msida to Valletta that week, while writer Iggy Fenech said he had been quoted more than €50 on rival platform eCabs for a journey from Birkirkara to Sliema the previous morning.  
 Many cab drivers work on both the Bolt and eCabs platforms, and Uber.  
 Meanwhile, in a post on Bolt’s Facebook page the same day, Isabel Danilovic asked why the company seemed to have been “charging double lately,” adding it had happened more than once.
 The company directed her to an article explaining ‘dynamic [surge] pricing’ in response.  
 A spokesperson for Bolt told Times of Malta that an “imbalance between the increasing demand and lower supply of cabs has resulted in longer periods of surge prices and longer waiting times.” 
 In a thinly veiled reference to the recent work permit clampdown, the spokesperson said the company had “reached out to government authorities to discuss the ongoing situation and find a solution.” 
 She added the situation should be seen “in context”, however, noting that “less than 5% of third-country nationals currently in the country are registered to operate as couriers or cab drivers in Malta via the Bolt platform.” 
 Workers in the ride-hailing and food delivery sectors have been in the spotlight recently following news the government’s visa and residency permit agency Identità had refused hundreds of work permit applications from TCNs applying from abroad or those in the country seeking to move to a new employer. 
 On Tuesday, Prime Minister Robert Abela said that TCNs whose labour was no longer needed must leave the country, and that “only those who are invited legitimately are welcome”. 
 “I understand their situation, but I also have a duty to the national interest and if our job market is indicating saturation, it means that workers who aren’t legitimate must leave the country,"" he said.  
 Questions were sent to eCabs on Thursday afternoon.

 The delay impacted early the flights KM478 to Paris, KM640 to Catania, FR1528 to Bratislava, FR6029 to Athens and FR9875 to Bari. 
 Readers who spoke to Times of Malta said that several passengers began to notice the delays in their early flights, in what appeared to be a dispute between the Malta International Airport and air traffic control.

 Passengers were boarded on the plane, she added, but at least 45 minutes later, it seemed that staff had still not been given the green light to leave. 
 Another man also said that passengers boarded the aircraft but faced long delays in leaving. 
 In reply to questions, an MIA spokesperson said that the delays occurred due to ""unadvised procedures"" by Malta Air Traffic Services, which imposed the provision of follow-me vehicles to guide aircraft movements on Apron 9.
 ""In the interest of mitigating a negative experience for its passengers, Malta International Airport undertook the necessary measures to alleviate delays on aircraft movements, which at the time were affected by the developing situation,"" she said.

"New building regulations must be based on updated studies, architects, PN say",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/new-building-regulations-based-updated-studies-architects-pn-say.1094064,17-06-2024,003972.png,"The Chamber of Architects and the Nationalist Party in separate statements on Monday urged the government to reform the planning system on the basis of  updated studies .
 The calls were made as environmental NGOs warned last week that revisions to the way that building heights are interpreted in the current regulations could give rise to additional floors being allowed. 
 The Planning Authority is currently running a public consultation to amend a policy in Development Control Design Policy, Guidance and Standards, a controversial document commonly known as the DC15.
 Previously, height limitations for buildings were set by the number of floors that could be built in any given area, as set out by the local plans. However, an annexe included in DC15, Annexe 2, laid out a table in which the maximum allowable heights of buildings previously indicated as floors, had now been converted into metres. 
 Should the amendments to policy 35 of DC15, which regulates allowable building height, be accepted, it will formalise this interpretation of the guidelines. 
 The Chamber of Architects said that the proposed amendment does not bring a material change to the status quo, provided that the building height for UCAs and villa/bungalow areas remains untouched.
 Nevertheless, it was of the firm opinion that the planning system required a major reform to move away from its dependence on development control policies to regulate development, and in favour of masterplans that produce comprehensive, researched, and thorough strategic plans for each of Malta's towns and villages.
 Moreover, the development control process itself required extensive reform. Poor quality buildings should not be approved, regardless of their compliance with the quantitative parameters in the various policy documents.
 The chamber called on the government to enter into discussions with it on reforming the practice of architecture by forming a joint initiative to: develop a national architecture policy; set up design review panels to allow for projects to be assessed purely on architecture merit; develop an urban design development strategy and mandatory architectural design competitions for all publicly funded projects
 The PN said DC15 had weakened the design process by opening policies to dangerous precedents and suspect interpretations. It was one of the reasons for an unplanned sharp increase in building density which harmed the environment and raised property prices.  
 
 The current exercise would make the current situation worse because it was based on an outdated spatial strategy that lacked important updated studies on the type of permissible development, carrying capacity, parallel infrastructure development and the social impact. 
 The government should therefore carry out and publish the necessary studies  and consequently review the Development Ċontrol Design Poliċy, Guidance and Standards 2015’ to reflect updated local plans. 
 The Malta Development Authority, meanwhile, said it rejected all allegations that the proposed amendment intensified development.
 ""The proposed amendment only seeks to clarify what was already established in the Local Plan of 2006 as followed by the DC15 document which reflects how the height of buildings is to be interpreted, i.e. in metres as opposed to floors. It is also completely untrue that Policy P35 of DC15 amends what was approved in the Local Plans established in 2006,"" the association said.
 ""What is perhaps commonly misinterpreted as intensification is the situation relating to the semi-basement maisonette which is nowadays no longer permitted as there has been a shift that habitable spaces have to be built at street level. With this shift in mind, the height of the floors had to be reduced accordingly so that the height limitations established in the aforementioned local plans are respected and so the overall height of the building remains the same,"" it said.
 The proposed changes should provide a clearer direction for the property market, benefiting all stakeholders by ensuring consistent and predictable development guidelines, it said.
 The MDA said it fully supports this amendment and looks forward to its implementation

 The Chamber said its president André Pizzuto met the minister on Tuesday and a meeting was held on Wednesday between members of the design team behind its alternative designs and Infrastructure Malta's civil engineers. 
 
 The purpose of the meeting was to explain the urban design and planning concepts behind the project to facilitate its development and implementation.
 The parties are to reconvene at a future date to provide Infrastructure Malta with the time necessary for the technical development of the new project, the Chamber said.
 The Chamber's alternative plans, reported in The Sunday Times of Malta, would see the busy Msida junction transformed into a tree-filled park.
 The Chamber is proposing that plans for a flayover should be ditched and traffic diverted from the area, with just one additional slip road to the Regional Road needed. 
  The chamber says its proposal could be completed in less time than the current plans, at no additional cost and with minimal impact to residents during construction, while providing a much-needed green lung in one of the worst-polluted areas of the country. 
 On Sunday, a spokesperson for the infrastructure ministry had said that while the ministry “appreciated” the chamber's interest in the project, the tendering and adjudication processes had been completed and works would begin next month.
 Speaking in parliament on Wednesday evening, the minister said the Chamber's proposal was visually attractive but there were various issues which needed to be discussed, such as dealing with potential flooding as well as traffic flow.
 One could not solve Msida's problem by shifting the issue elsewhere, he said.
 The plans, however, would be discussed further and he thanked the Chamber for its cooperation.

 Times of Malta has confirmed that restaurants are claiming ownership of several of the buoys and are offering them to patrons, arriving on boats, on reservation of a table.
 One source explained how non-booking boats are driven away from the bay and told that they cannot occupy that stretch of water as if it belongs to the restaurant.
 “They are acting as if the bay is a private car park that belongs to the restaurant but these are public waters and they cannot fill it up with moorings as it pleases them.”
 Another individual described how, last Saturday, four families on as many boats were harassed away from Marsalforn Bay.
 “A man approached us in a tender and told us in a menacing tone to “aqilgħu għax hawn tagħna” (“move because this area is reserved for us”).
 Reluctantly they had to sail away.
 “We didn’t want any trouble, especially since we were with families and children. We lifted our anchors and returned to Malta.”
 Sources said a similar situation has developed in Xlendi.
  Over the past 10 days, Times of Malta has received e-mails, Whatsapp messages and telephone calls from helpless private boaters who have been pushed away from  Għadira Bay by unidentified men on boats claiming to own the moorings. 
 A similar situation has been unfolding in Comino’s Santa Marija Bay where large boats are taking over all the space,  leaving no room for families on smaller boats.
 Another source pointed out how both bays have become littered with jerrycans tied to stones as weight.
 “Late at night, we have seen divers dropping large stones in the water out in the middle of the bay.
 “They are taking up as much space as they can to discourage private boaters from entering the bay without reservation and without making use of their facilities. But this is all illegal,” he said.
 
 Private boaters have also been complaining about a lack of action from the authorities.
 “We have called Transport Malta. They took down our report but nobody came back. Then, we turned to the police who told us they cannot do anything.
 “No matter how much or who you call, no one takes action.”
 Transport Malta has confirmed with Times of Malta that private operators cannot rent moorings in public bays.
 Transport Malta said that such illegal activities are monitored and passed on to the Maritime Enforcement Unit and the police for enforcement action as necessary.

Developers suspend plans for nursing home on Swieqi ODZ,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/developers-suspend-plans-nursing-home-swieqi-odz.1101475,28-11-2024,"004579.png,004580.png,004581.png","A developer has suspended plans to build a nursing home outside the development zone in Swieqi after a flurry of objections rose in opposition to the project. 
 Previously, new plans had been filed proposing an extension of the basement from one to three levels. 
 The proposed site is located at Triq Wied Mejxu on a lane off Triq Sant’Andrija at the bottom of Madliena Valley.
 While the local council and Swieqi residents highlighted the ecological sensitivity of the area, the architect described the site earmarked for the project as “wasted land caught in between development on all sides”.
 According to PA/01940/24 submitted by Joseph Mangion and signed by architect Joseph Bondin, the proposal is to excavate and construct a Class 2A nursing home on four floors and a recessed level from a new road. 
 The application marks the fifth attempt to secure permission for development on this site, following three refusals and one withdrawal of similar applications.
 The new plans include three basement levels as parking and ancillary facilities, including storage, a mortuary, a car lift, offices, a kitchen and a clinic. 
 The application validated last April saw a stream of objections.  On October 17, Mangion submitted fresh plans, triggering more objections.
 Speaking to Times of Malta on behalf of residents, Oliver Tanti said they are deeply concerned that the development would not only alter the character of the area but set a precedent for further ODZ encroachments.
 “This is not the place for a nursing home,” reads one representation filed with the Planning Authority on November 5.
 The Environment and Resources Authority joined the objections, making it clear that “urban-type developments unrelated to rural activities should remain confined to designated development zones”.
  On November 1, the Swieqi council also expressed its disapproval of the project, underlining the importance of safeguarding ODZ land from urban encroachment.
 Mayor Noel Muscat called the proposal “disgraceful”, saying “there is no innate need for a nursing home to be located in this area when other appropriate sites exist”.
 The rural landscape should remain protected for the community’s benefit, serving as a “green lung” for Swieqi, especially given the area’s significant recent residential developments, he insisted.
 Muscat said the applicants’ proposal to build six floors on the side of the lane off Triq Sant’Andrija and four floors on Triq Wied il-Mejxu, cannot be justified, “since no height limitations for ODZ spaces are established by the local plan”.
 “The local plan does not indicate building heights because there should be no building ODZ, and therefore the building height should be zero metres.”
 According to the council, this space should not be compromised for a commercial venture that could be situated within a designated urban area.
 Muscat highlighted that access to both sides of the proposed home would be detrimental to the quality of life of residents. 
 Lawyer and environmentalist Claire Bonello, representing the residents, pointed out that the site is mostly undeveloped and unspoiled, and any new construction would exceed the site’s minimal existing footprint, which covers only about 70 square metres.
  According to Bonello, this proposal would seal approximately 575 square metres of rural land, contravening the objective of preserving such spaces for agricultural or natural uses.
 Additionally, policies under the Strategic Plan for the Environment and Development (SPED) call for locating community facilities within urban zones unless no feasible alternatives exist – a criterion that Bonello and the council argue has not been met.
 The council and residents said the access routes for construction and service vehicles, as well as visitors, are narrow and inadequate for regular, two-way traffic, particularly for large vehicles such as ambulances.
 Bonello noted that granting this application would likely pave the way for similar projects, slowly eroding the rural landscape.
 The recent ecological restoration efforts by Project Green in Wied Mejxu would also be undermined, as the proposed building would essentially replace the native greenery with concrete.
  Speaking to Times of Malta, Bondin acknowledged the site’s contentious history.
 “Other applications for residential apartments on this site were previously rejected. However, if I were in the PA’s shoes, I would approve a home for the elderly on this land for two main reasons. Firstly, because this is wasted land, caught between buildings on both sides. Secondly, because there is a need for a nursing home in Swieqi.”
 He said the proposal addresses parking issues, and this is why the basement levels increased from one to three.
 “Additionally, we designed the upper part of the development to start level with the adjacent buildings but then step down gradually to blend more naturally with the surrounding structures,” he noted.
 Originally, in 1999, Mangion had sought the construction of a four-storey block of 28 flats with three over-lying penthouses, an underlying garage and an adjacent swimming pool. 
 Three years later, the application was linked to the construction of three further floors over a currently approved block of flats, while in 2005, he proposed an extension to an existing residential block. All applications were refused.
 In 2022, the developer submitted an outline application for a residential development on four floors with basement garages. 
 The application was eventually withdrawn but the developer introduced a new application for a home for the elderly in November 2023.

 TM has issued a notice informing owners they have until August 22 to remove their vehicles. Failure to do so will result in the vehicles being disposed of at an end-of-life treatment facility with no possibility of recourse.
 Joseph Bugeja, chairperson of the Association of Tractor and Trailer Operators (ATTO), welcomed the news.
 “The abandoned trailers at Corradino were adding to the pressure as parking spaces for empty trailers awaiting loading were becoming increasingly limited,” he said.
 Bugeja had first raised the issue in an interview with  Times of Malta explaining that the area can accommodate up to 45 trailers at a time and is constantly full.
 He pointed out that 12 trailers had been abandoned on the site for months, with no action taken to clear them.
 Bugeja also clarified that ATTO trailer operators do not own any of the abandoned trailers.
 “All ATTO members are fully compliant with all local and international rules and regulations,” he said.
 TM said that all trailers and vehicles, not just the abandoned ones, must be removed from Corradino and Ras Ħanżir with immediate effect.
 “Owners are to refrain from parking and/or placing them in any other place on the road in violation of the law.”
 TM said that the removal and disposal of the trailers will be carried out without further notice and that it reserves the right to take additional action against owners and other involved parties as necessary.
 Bugeja had previously called for the reorganisation of the site to ensure that parking spaces for empty trailers waiting to board remain exclusive. He reiterated the need for TM to proceed with the reorganisation of Corradino Hill, including the new signage. 
 The area in question lies a few hundred metres from the Tony Bezzina Stadium and stadium-goers drive and park their vehicles along the road lined up with trailers.
 It remains unclear whether the eviction order is connected to the opening round of fixtures of the newly-established 360Sports Malta Premier football league, which will be held at Corradino over this coming weekend.
 The stadium will also host matches on August 25, just three days after the eviction order takes effect.
 Bugeja had previously acknowledged the inconvenience the parked trailers cause to stadium-goers but insisted that the authorities have not provided adequate facilities for the operators.
 He disclosed that ATTO is in talks with the national authorities regarding the lack of parking facilities and adequate infrastructure for trailers.
 ATTO has identified two zones behind the Kordin Grain Terminal it believes can accommodate up to 50 trailers.
 “This issue is work in progress and we are confident that, with the support of the relevant ministries, ATTO will eventually achieve its legitimate objective,” he said.
 Bugeja thanked Chris Bonett, the minister for transport, who he said was instrumental in initiating progress.
 ATTO maintains that the harbour’s infrastructure has not developed in line with the increasing development of the import/export market, noting that approximately 1,300 trailers use the Grand Harbour facilities each week.

Robert Abela’s claim on shore-to-ship power grid strain disputed,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/prime-minister-robert-abela-claim-shoretoship-energy-drain-disputed.1095969,29-07-2024,"004562.png,004563.png","The shore-to-ship system cannot possibly be one of the factors leading to strains on the electricity distribution network and the recent spate of power cuts, according to the CEO of Valletta Cruise Port.
 Stephen Xuereb told Times of Malta that since its launch, only one cruise liner, the MSC  World Europa, has been plugging into Malta’s grid for seven hours one day a week. 
 The MSC World Europa uses the shore-to-ship system on Wednesdays between 9am and 4pm, during which time it consumes approximately 10 mega watts of electricity.
 The shore-to-ship system at Valletta Cruise Port was launched on July 10 and has been in operation for little more than two weeks. 
 
 Fielding questions about the recent power cuts, Prime Minister Robert Abela cited the ship-to-shore system and an increase in electric vehicles as  contributing to the strains on the power grid.
 Last week, power cuts were reported in several places around Malta and Gozo, but not in areas near Marsa and the Valletta Cruise Port. 
 Xuereb highlighted that the shore-to-ship system is connected to Malta’s power grid via a direct link.
  Ryan Fava, Enemalta’s executive chairman, confirmed this in comments to Times of Malta. 
 “The shore-to-ship system has a dedicated link to the grid via the Marsa North Distribution Centre and is designed in such a way that when the network experiences a surge in demand, we can completely cut it off to ensure we can first meet the demands of households,” Fava explained.
  Fava acknowledged another claim made by the prime minister that the increase in electric vehicles might be contributing to the rising demand for electricity.
 By the end of March, electric and plug-in hybrid motor vehicles totalled 16,490 or 3.8 per cent of the entire fleet on Maltese roads.
 “Our households are becoming increasingly dependent on electricity. We have induction ovens, air-conditioning units, and now even motor-vehicles that are power-hungry,” Fava said.
 “The network has to keep up with the times and with the ongoing economic development of the country.”
 A recent National Audit Office report shows that Enemalta spent less money on upgrading its distribution grid last year than it had a decade earlier, despite its infrastructure having to cater for a significantly larger and more power-hungry population.

Insurers' concern as accident investigation bureau hits another bump in the road,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/insurers-concern-accident-investigation-bureau-hits-another-bump-road.1097812,09-09-2024,004730.png,"The Insurance Association Malta has expressed concern that yet another setback has delayed the setting up of the Road Safety Bureau.
 The government first announced plans to establish the bureau in December 2022 as part of a wider reform to consolidate air, sea, and road safety investigations under one Transport Safety Investigation Commission.
 Currently, magisterial inquiries and police investigations are the only methods of investigating road accidents in Malta. These inquiries determine civil or criminal liabilities, and their conclusions generally remain confidential.
 Times of Malta reported earlier this month that the bureau's setting up had been delayed by the judiciary’s hesitancy to share the contents of magisterial inquiries owing to the confidentiality of investigations and the privacy of those involved.
 It is understood that the government and the judiciary are working towards a compromise on this issue.
 Three people died in separate traffic accidents on August 27.
 ""Behind every road fatality there is a shattered family mourning the premature loss of loved ones,"" the Insurance Association said. 
 ""The recent occurrence of three mid-week fatalities in a single day — and a number of accidents since — marked a tragic moment for Malta’s roads, underscoring the critical need for respect between road users and adherence to traffic rules.
 “This is a stark reminder that authorities must take decisive action to uphold road safety, including the swift implementation of an accident investigation agency and regular enforcement against drink-driving, drug-driving, speeding, and mobile phone distractions,” the association added.
 “No one can deny that Malta urgently needs a road accident investigation bureau, similar to those in the aviation and maritime sectors. This bureau would be a crucial element of a comprehensive road safety strategy that has long been promised but remains largely unaddressed.""
 It said road safety can only happen when both authorities and road users work in unison.

'Nine collisions caused Monday morning traffic gridlock': Transport Malta,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/nine-collisions-caused-monday-morning-traffic-gridlock.1097262,26-08-2024,004753.png,"Nine traffic collisions were the cause of severe gridlock and long tailbacks around Qormi and Marsa on Monday morning, according to Transport Malta.
 The transport watchdog said the collisions were reported between 5am and 10am on both northbound and southbound roads around the Marsa-Ħamrun bypass.
 The statement was issued hours after motorists complained of heavy traffic clogging junctions in Marsa and Qormi.
 The traffic woes kicked off with an accident involving a taxi and pedestrian at around 5am, prompting the closure of one carriageway and leading to southbound disruptions until the road was cleared a few hours later.
 “Further incidents, including another collision at 8.55am involving a pregnant woman, led to delays this time for traffic headed to northbound directions,"" TM said.
 TM published a map flagging the locations of the nine accidents in the area, showing collisions on the Mrieħel bypass (southbound), multiple sites along the Marsa-Ħamrun bypass (both directions), the Aldo Moro main road in Marsa in both directions and Vjal Garibaldi.
  The authority said that in order to deal with the collisions, it increased the number of traffic enforcement officers in affected areas, including the Qormi-Mrieħel roundabout, and put into place traffic control measures to help restore normal traffic flow.
 However, the area’s traffic problems did not appear to end with the morning rush.
 On Monday evening, motorists reported heavy rush-hour traffic in the area, with one motorist saying it took him around an hour to drive from Santa Venera to Vittoriosa.
 Meanwhile, others reported increased traffic because of roadworks in Qormi, including at the Tal-Imgħallaq roundabout and in front of the St Sebastian parish church.

San Pawl tat-Tarġa roadworks to be completed by end of July,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/san-pawl-tattarga-roadworks-completed-end-july.1091847,05-04-2024,005078.png,"Major roadworks in the San Pawl tat-Tarġa area of Naxxar and Mosta will be completed by the end of July, according to Infrastructure Malta.
 The works, to pass new electricity wires to be connected to a new distribution centre near the old trade fair grounds, started in December, and brought about considerable inconveniences to residents, especially during windy and rainy days when the area becomes “one big cloud of dust”.
 An Infrastructure Malta spokesperson explained that, while almost 75 per cent of the work has been completed, the entire project is expected to be concluded by the end of July.
 He explained that the agency was developing a new infrastructure to support the establishment of a dedicated distribution centre for Enemalta in Naxxar. This included constructing access roads to the facility, which will be situated close to the old trade fair grounds close to the site where Aġenzija Sapport has a permit for a mixed-use residential project for persons with disability.
 The spokesperson said the various projects in the San Pawl tat-Tarġa area are primarily focused on reinforcing Enemalta’s high-tension network. About 550 metres of Enemalta’s works are being carried out using a walk-through culvert system, with 30 per cent of the area already reinstated.
 Regarding works at Vjal Ragusa, which from Telgħa t’Alla w Ommu takes motorists to the Mosta bridge and which has been closed for several months, the spokesperson said that work there is nearing completion with the backfilling of the trench. While the work there is under way, a new potable water and wastewater system is being installed along with improvements to telecommunication services and new street lighting.
 “We are also constructing a new stormwater system and adding footpaths on both sides of the road. A cycle lane is also being introduced along with the upgrading of two junctions that will better organise traffic flows in the area. Furthermore, construction of overhangs at the end of Mosta Bridge is under way to ensure sufficient width for the new footpath and cycle lane. All these works are scheduled to be finished by the end of July,” the spokesperson said.
 The project is part of Enemalta’s fast-tracked efforts to lay 70 kilometres of electricity cables after a summer of power cuts. The planned two-year cable-laying project will take place over six months and is expected to be completed by summer.
 Last July, nine days of power cuts forced the closure of businesses as large swathes of the country were left without electricity when temperatures soared above 40°C.
 In the meantime, the company will continue with its six-year plan to upgrade Malta’s electricity network, including through a new 132-kilovolt link between the Magħtab interconnector terminal and the Mosta distribution centre, which will serve as one of the main connections for the planned second interconnector.
 Enemalta is also planning to build another new distribution centre in Siġġiewi and upgrade the ones in Msida and St Andrew’s.

‘Is Malta only for the rich?’: boaters harassed out of Comino bay,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/is-malta-rich-boaters-harassed-comino-bay.1096869,19-08-2024,005150.png,"Anchoring a small private boat at Santa Marija Bay in Comino has become increasingly difficult, with many reports of boaters being harassed out of the bay by unidentified private operators.
 In a situation similar to what is happening at Għadira Bay, people on small boats are being pressured to move from anchor and make way for large boats that had “reserved the moorings”.
 In response to questions by Times of Malta on how Għadira Bay has been taken over by several unregistered and illegal moorings, Transport Malta had confirmed that private operators are not permitted to rent moorings in public bays, although they can apply for mooring permits for their commercial vessels. 
 Boat owners in Comino who refuse to budge claim they face “threatening and abusive behaviour until we move”.
 One boat owner described how the situation in Comino “is even more subtle [than Għadira] as a diver hands a rope to tie up the incoming boat from the front”.
 Another said that to make sure the view is not disturbed, a chain is tied to the rocks at the rear of the boat, taking up more space than required.
 “The moorings at Santa Marija have no buoy and it is obvious that the diver is alerted beforehand to any paying incoming boats,” one irritated boat owner told Times of Malta.
 “Small boats like mine are expected to make way and we cannot do otherwise for fear of getting in trouble,” said another.
  Sources have also pointed to the damage that is being caused to the rocks.
 “When tied from the rear, no one cares if the chains damage the rocks. This is often the case because a loop is put around and, with the force of a large boat, the rocks are chipped.”
 The same source, with an air of resignation, asked “is Malta only for the rich?”
 Times of Malta is aware that reports of these illegalities have been filed with Transport Malta.
 “We contacted TM three weeks ago and followed up after 10 days with a second e-mail.  We were told ‘we passed on the email to the manager to investigate’,” he said.
 But one of the sources questioned whether action is being taken. 
 “We have called the Port Authority and Transport Malta who passed the buck between them.  Then we called the police who told us: ‘what can I do from the depot?’
 “It appears that nobody wishes to assume responsibility.”
 When previously questioned about the situation at Għadira Bay, Transport Malta had told Times of Malta that the Moorings and Berthings Unit monitors the situation and reports illegal activities to the Maritime Enforcement Unit and the police, who then take enforcement action as necessary.

"After years in limbo, cremation policy is finally signed off",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/policy-gives-families-option-cremate.1097802,09-09-2024,005224.png,"A long-awaited policy for the development of standalone crematoria got the planning minister’s final rubberstamp last week, paving the way for Maltese families to have a viable cremation option.
 Planning Minister Clint Camilleri confirmed to Times of Malta that he had signed the Planning Authority’s final version of the ‘Policy and design guidance for the development of standalone crematoria’ and said it would be published online “in the coming days”.
 “This was a promise of the Labour Party when we presented the electoral manifesto for the last general election,” he said.
 “Cremation will mean an alternative to the present funeral techniques which may reduce the pressure for cemetery extensions in the long term.”
 The policy, which is a partial review of the existing cemeteries policy, provides design guidance for the development of standalone crematoria.
 It lays out appropriate locations and how a crematorium should be designed sustainably and operate in compliance with environmental and health regulations.
 Malta legalised cremation in 2019, allowing for cremation services to be added to existing cemeteries. That bill was spearheaded by former parliamentary secretary Rosianne Cutajar.
 In 2022, Parliament then approved the Cremation Act, legalising standalone crematoria.
 While several applications for the development of standalone crematoria have been submitted to the PA since then, progress towards building one has been slow due to several planning and environmental concerns.
 Meanwhile, families who wanted to cremate their loved ones have been forced to take their corpse to Sicily or the UK – a service that can cost around €4,500.
 That option was not feasible for everyone, either.
 Last week, actor and singer Roger Tirazona told Times of Malta that his father’s dying wish was to be cremated and have his remains sent to the Philippines.
 But when, last January, Tirazona found his lifeless father at home, his body was already rapidly decomposing. Tirazona said it was logistically impractical to take the body overseas, so he could not honour his father’s dying wish.
 The delay was caused by the lack of specific guidelines, but the approved policy will now give the PA the green light to review applications.
 The policy specifies that a standalone crematorium must not be built in sensitive areas like industrial zones, scheduled sites or on agricultural land, should be easily accessible, and must meet emission standards and use the best available filtration and abatement technology.
 It also says the building must have a specific layout and include facilities like a mortuary, viewing room, cremation chamber and post-cremation room. It should also have a garden of remembrance with columbarium.
 It says: “The layout of the crematorium should accommodate three main functions: front of house, ceremony area and outdoor spaces. The front of house area is intended for hearse arrival, circulation and parking of the hearse/s and ceremonial vehicles, the ceremony area accommodates the building and facilities, including offices and servicing, and the outdoor spaces are aimed for the retention or disposal of cremated remains such as columbarium with garden of remembrance and designated area for scattering of ashes.”
 The building should not exceed a footprint of 500 square metres and “in any case, the overall height of the main structure shall not exceed 7.7 metres”.
 The crematorium must also be at least 183 metres away from any residential building.
 The policy went through two public consultation exercises and was amended in parliament’s environment and planning committee, at which stage the government agreed with the opposition to restrict the height of crematoria and prohibit their conversion into buildings with other uses.

Paola church drops plans for rooftop café after securing funding for restoration,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/paola-church-drops-plans-rooftop-cafe-securing-funding-restoration.1095954,27-07-2024,005284.png,"Updated 4.45 pm with government statement
 The Paola parish has dropped controversial plans to have a rooftop cafe on top of the Christ the King Basilica after securing government funding for urgent restoration work. 
 The cafeteria will instead be relocated to the ground floor level. 
 In a statement on Saturday, parish priest Fr Marc André Camilleri said that, following meetings with ministers Byron Camilleri and Owen Bonnici, the government has agreed to allocate €400,000 towards the project. 
 In view of this, the parish will be amending its plans to build a cafeteria on the rooftop and will instead keep the portico as a viewing platform for visitors, with the site also being used to host events or fundraising activities. 
 Camilleri said that the outcome is a “win-win” situation for all. 
 “The parish secures its objective of restoring the portico while visitors will get to enjoy the spectacular view from the roof. While the cafeteria will be located at ground level, we have achieved our overarching aim to make the maintenance of the church more sustainable,” he said. 
 Restoration works have already begun by the parish and they hope to complete the project by next year. 
 In a statement, the Culture and Home Affairs Ministry said it was funding restoration not only to preserve the building's “priceless” cultural heritage but also to allow part of the basilica to become a tourist attraction.  
 Culture minister Owen Bonnici said Paola’s parish church is unique because of its extraordinary size, while Home Affairs minister Byron Camilleri said the government has an obligation to maintain Malta’s cultural heritage in the best state possible.  
 Kommunita Malta and the Arts council are jointly funding the project.  
 News of the parish’s plans to build a rooftop café on top of the historic church building raised eyebrows in April, particularly as the permit type the parish initially applied for, which allowed cooking on site, led some to believe a restaurant was planned for the site. 
 However, the parish later clarified that it only planned to build a small cafeteria to accommodate visitors and later amended the permit type to reflect this. 
 The plans even prompted Prime Minister Robert Abela to speak out about the issue, as he publicly urged the parish to drop the plans. 
 Fr Camilleri later took Times of Malta on a  tour of the areas earmarked for restoration and highlighted the dire state some areas of the heritage building are in. 
 
 He also pointed out that managing one of the largest churches in the country came with a significant cost and the proceeds from the cafeteria would help to alleviate some of those expenses. 
 Previously, Camilleri confirmed that he had been in talks with the government to receive assistance with the church’s restoration and that as a result, the location of the café could be moved. 
 “The minister understood our plight, namely that we don’t have enough resources to keep up with a building of this magnitude,” Camilleri had said at the time.

Gozo NGOs request scheduling of  British barracks at Fort Chambray,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/gozo-ngos-request-scheduling-british-barracks-fort-chambray.1091370,27-04-2024,005287.png,"Three Gozitan NGOs have written to the authorities requesting the urgent scheduling of the 19th-century British barracks at Fort Chambray, in Għajnsielem due to their outstanding historical, cultural and architectural value.
 “This building is unique for Gozo, which is practically devoid of British military buildings of this or, indeed, any era. This building is also quite unique as far as Malta goes as well, as it appears to be the earliest Married Quarters built in the country as a whole,” Din l-Art Ħelwa Għawdex,  Għawdix and Wirt Għawdex said in their joint submission on behalf of  Koalizzjoni Għal Għawdex.
 The fort, overlooking Mġarr harbour, was built in the early 1700s by the Knights of St John as part of their defence strategy against attacks from the sea. It was meant to act as another Ċittadella – a fortified city in which Gozitan people could gather to seek refuge in the event of a siege.
 Fort Chambray served as a mental institution in the 1960s but the pre-1971 Nationalist government started plans to develop it into a tourism establishment with a 320-bed hotel.
 However, the 1971 Labour government scrapped those plans and refurbished the mental hospital.
 In 1979, the mental health patients were moved elsewhere and the fort was allocated for tourism again. However, hardly any development was carried out there.
 In the lead-up to the 1987 election, Labour Party activities were held there and, just before that election, the Labour government transferred the fort to the Zammit Tabone family. Still, the fort remained undeveloped.
 In 1993, a 99-year concession for the fort was granted to Fort Chambray Ltd, made up of a Monaco-registered company controlled by an Italian lawyer, Roberto Memmo.
 Works started but the project was stalled halfway, particularly due to a lack of funding, and the buildings remained in an unfinished state.
 In 2004, the government handed over the entire project to Michael Caruana, a Gozitan businessman who also owns the Calypso Hotel and other enterprises.
 The fort was eventually transformed into a hub of luxury apartments and became a residential area.
 Caruana has now set his sights on finishing the project and, last year, submitted two planning applications to take down more than 60 unfinished apartments and construct a hotel and new apartments in a resumption of a project that goes back decades.
  The 63 one-, two- and three-bedroomed apartments were built 20 years ago but were never used. Under the first application, PA3438/23, they will be dismantled block by block so that the construction material will be used for other parts of the project.
 The apartments cover an area of about 2,700 square metres. All the debris dumped there over the years will also be cleared.
 In a separate application, Caruana, on behalf of Fort Chambray Ltd, submitted amended plans to those approved in 2012 and 2017 covering the third phase of the project. This is for the construction of a hotel and more apartments and is not yet public.
 The third phase envisages a 63-room hotel with the British barracks serving as its base, 50 serviced apartments spread around the hotel and more apartments covering the rest of the area.
 The barracks will be carefully dismantled and rebuilt in another part of the site. This will be covered by a separate application.
 In the meantime, the Gozitan NGOs have requested the scheduling of the British military married quarters in Fort Chambray, a long two-storeyed south-facing building in the south-west area of the enceinte, characterised by its use of local limestone, which gives the building a warm, natural hue.
 The architecture is marked by a repetition of arched doorways on the ground floor and arched openings on the upper floor, suggesting a sense of rhythm and continuity in the facade.
 Each floor is defined by a collonaded arcade with evenly spaced columns supporting arches, a design feature providing shade and a semi-outdoor space for residents.
 The NGOs said the building is typical of others built by the British colonial powers in Malta having a similar function but is the only one of its type in Gozo and presents unique characteristics with its particular location and history.
 They said they were seeking Grade 1 protection for the building, given its significant architectural, historic and cultural merit.
 “Aside from its architectural merit, we must recognise that buildings of this type are an important link to our past and we cannot afford as a nation to destroy and throw them away if we want to maintain an understanding of who we are as a nation,” they said in their request.
 The British Army began providing married quarters for soldiers and their families in the second half of the 19th century. This initiative was part of broader reforms aimed at improving the living conditions and welfare of soldiers. Before this period, the accommodation provided to soldiers was generally very basic and often did not extend to family members.
 The introduction of married quarters was a significant step in recognising the importance of supporting soldiers’ families and stabilising their lives, contributing to the overall effectiveness and morale of the military.
 The NGOs noted that a large number of British barrack buildings in Malta have already been granted scheduling protection.
 “Destruction has already occurred at this site in the past. The Fort Chambray garrison cemetery, which was dedicated to the troops who were stationed at Fort Chambray during the British colonial period, was ruthlessly bulldozed and demolished in the mid-1980s to make way for a tourist complex.
 “The garrison cemetery was full of impressive monuments, including free-standing sarcophagi in neo-classical style so favoured by the British. Similar destruction has taken place on other monuments in Gozo. Such mistakes should not be repeated with the destruction of the British barracks,” the NGOs said.

Ministry to propose law that suspends planning applications under appeal,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/ministry-propose-law-suspends-planning-applications-appeal.1097391,30-08-2024,005309.png,"The planning ministry is set to propose a new law that will suspend planning applications until the entire appeals process has been concluded. 
 This would mean that when a planning application is disputed at the planning appeals tribunal or even the Court of Appeal, construction will not be allowed to go forward until these appeals are concluded. 
 The news comes just one day before a coalition of NGOs were set to hold a demonstration in front of the Office of the Prime Minister demanding urgent action after the Planning Authority sanctioned a development in Sannat that had been declared illegal on appeal. 
 In a press release on Friday, the Planning Ministry said that it had been working on revising the laws regulating appeals in the planning process. 
 ""This revision of the present law will ensure that there is no construction in cases where the permit is under appeal,"" Minister Clint Camilleri said. 
 ""Aside from this, the revision will also ensure that the appeals process will be expedited and enable decisions to be taken in the shortest time possible, to make the process more just for all."" 
 Earlier this week a PA decision to sanction a Joseph Portelli-linked development in Sannat sparked uproar, as the Court of Appeals had ordered the permit be revoked in March. 
 The sanctioning is linked to the development of apartment blocks with pools in rural Gozo which was proposed in two different applications in 2020 and 2021.
 Activists had insisted the applications could not be judged singularly and in a vacuum, as they formed part of an attempt to fragment a mega-development to avoid the scrutiny such a large project would require. 
 The court noted that the approved pool and penthouse floor level should not have been approved, and the permit for this part was revoked.
 However, by then both the pool and the penthouses had been constructed and an application (PA/03869/24) to sanction two of the illegal penthouses was filed by Tarlochan Singh.
 Independent politician Arnold Cassola has asked the Ombudsman to investigate the sanctioning, while Din L-Art Ħelwa has appealed the sanctioning application. 
 A group of 19 environmental NGOs and residents groups were set to hold a press conference in front of Castille on Saturday, calling on the prime minister to address planning shortcomings that allow whole buildings to be constructed even while the permits that regulate the are still under appeal.

 In a planning application (PA/06387/24), CPHCL Company Limited and architect Claire Bezzina seek to extend the existing hotel by some 35 to 40 rooms and build an additional two floors. 
 The hotel currently has 158 rooms and 280 beds. 
 Located just across the street from San Anton Palace, the Attard property is the birthplace of the now-international hotel group. The restored historic villa was opened up as a restaurant in 1962 and the hotel was built in the villa’s gardens in 1968. 
 The full design of the proposed new floors has yet to be revealed, as the group has filed an outline application rather than applying for a full development permit. 
 The outline permit sets the limits for the height and mass for any development to be built there in the future. 
 The Corinthia Attard is marked as a ‘tourist establishment’ site, which allows the hotel building to be extended, provided it meets certain established conditions, including one that no extension should exceed the height of the existing development. 
 However, the PA’s height limitation adjustment policy allows hotels to build two storeys above the limits set out in local plans. 
 In its consultation on the application, the Malta Tourism Authority recommended that the Corinthia be considered positively for the hotel height adjustment.

Bus service is not as bad as many people make it out to be - minister,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/the-bus-service-bad-many-people-make-minister.1091720,29-04-2024,005405.png,"Data shows that the bus service is not as bad as many people make it out to be, although more investment needs to be made to increase the number of buses, Transport Minister Chris Bonett said in parliament on Monday.
 In the year since the service was made free of charge, the number of user trips had risen by 17 million and a further increase was seen in the first quarter of this year.
 The challenge, he said, was to increase the number of buses and the frequency of trips. The operator added 30 electric buses in November, with financial assistance by the government, while  a further 30 buses were commissioned last month.
 A total of 120 more electric buses would be introduced by the end of 2025, replacing older, polluting buses.
 The minister said that given the population growth in the past few years, the time had come to review the routes, which were last revised in 2014.
 Various other measures were being taken including an increase of maritime services, he said, and measures to improve perceptions on the bus service, of which people should be proud. 
 The minister was replying to a question by Labour MP Randolph DeBattista.
 He later told Grazziella Attard Previ (PN) in reply to a written question that there are 124 buses which are more than 10 years old, but none are more than 15 years old.

Temporary road to PAMA now closed,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/temporary-road-pama-now-closed.1093720,13-06-2024,005429.png,"A controversial temporary access road to PAMA supermarket in Mosta has been closed, much to the relief of residents.
 In March, PAMA knocked down a section of wall running along the side of Triq il-Waqqafa behind the supermarket to open a temporary access route to the store. 
 While the supermarket insisted the route was necessary due to nearby infrastructure works and only a temporary measure, this did little to dampen the anger of residents who worried about increased noise and pollution.
 But by the end of last week, the wall had been rebuilt and trees planted in front of it, making good on a promise by the supermarket and Infrastructure Malta to close the route within four months.
 Resident Carmen Farrugia said she and other residents were very happy that the wall had been rebuilt “after all this hassle”. 
 “Hopefully it’s the end of the saga and we’re all very happy with the outcome,” she said, adding that traffic in the quiet residential street had “reduced a lot” and things in the neighbourhood were “back to normal”.
 Farrugia added that the trees planted next to the wall were a protected species called Evergreen Oak (siġra tal-ballut), giving her hope that the wall would not be knocked down again any time soon. 
 The saga began after Infrastructure Malta closed nearby Triq Pantar – an access road to the supermarket – to install a water culvert and replace electricity cables.
 
 Residents questioned the lack of consultation and asked why the supermarket appeared to be receiving special treatment from authorities. 
 They voiced concerns about the increased traffic in an area which is home to a football club and a childcare centre.
 Despite a joint declaration from Transport Malta, Infrastructure Malta and PAMA that the works would only last about four months, residents last month filed a judicial protest against the Planning Authority urging it to take enforcement action.

'Safety concerns' cited for four-hour delay in reopening of busy bypass,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/safety-concerns-cited-fourhour-delay-reopening-busy-bypass.1098166,16-09-2024,005675.png,"The Transport Ministry has attributed an hours-long delay for the reopening of part of the Marsa-Ħamrun bypass on Monday morning to “safety concerns”.
 Traffic was reduced to a crawl after a lane was closed when a car caught fire at around 5am.
 But by 9am, motorists were still reporting heavy traffic in the area and Transport Malta officials said all traffic congestion had cleared by 10:25am.
 Responding to questions about the delay, a Transport Ministry spokesperson said it was ""due to several safety concerns.""
 She said that although one lane of the bypass was reopened as early as 5:30am, and two lanes by 6:45am, CPD officials determined that the road was still unsafe for immediate use due to engine oil, fuel leakage and water used to extinguish the fire.
 The spokesperson said those hazards required extra caution, extending the time emergency services were on site.
 “By 8:45 am, all lanes were reopened, but traffic remained heavy  due to residual congestion”, she said.
 Civil Protection Department (CPD) director-general Peter Paul Coleiro said fire crews “responded normally” to the emergency arriving at the site in “between six to eight minutes.”
 He said they extinguished the fire and treated the road surface with sand and oil dispersant – which is used to stop the road surface being slippery after a spill – in under half an hour.
 After they left the site, however, authorities inspecting fire damage to the asphalt road surface discovered diesel seeping from the area, requiring CPD personnel to be called back to the scene, Coleiro said.
 “Realistically, we couldn’t have predicted it,” he said, adding that fire crews used “a lot” of dispersant after returning to the site.
 By this time, however, rush hour traffic had started, delaying fire crews from immediately reaching the area.
 Despite the delay, CPD personnel were on site within “around 25 minutes,” he said, adding that multiple fire engines were dispatched to the scene to increase the chances of a quick response – something he said was standard practice in emergencies.
 The CPD were called back to the site at around 7am and left the scene at 8:45am.
 Informed sources told Times of Malta the driver of the car that caught fire was a 17-year-old boy, who, it is understood was accompanied by passengers.
 They all managed to exit the vehicle before the fire got out of control.
 No injuries were reported and investigations are understood to be underway.

'Unsustainable' takeup of public land for tables and chairs in Marsascala,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/unsustainable-takeup-public-land-tables-chairs-marsascala.1096386,08-06-2024,005870.png,"The take-up of public spaces to accommodate businesses setting up outdoor tables and chairs has reached “unsustainable” levels in Marsascala, a residents group has said. 
 In a statement on Tuesday, the Marsascala Residents Network (MRN) claimed that several catering establishments are either “occupying space illegally or not abiding by the conditions of the permits”. 
 This, residents say, has led to a situation where pavements, ramps and public spaces have been blocked or rendered unusable by the general public, compromising public access and general safety in the area. 
 In the case of the playground of Marsascala Bay, this sprouting of tables and chairs has also ended up exposing children to passive smoking from restaurant patrons, the group said. 
 Despite repeated requests, the MRN’s requests to meet with the ministers responsible for the Lands Authority and the Planning Authority have been ignored. 
 “Instead of showing interest and goodwill in curbing these abuses, authorities are instead allowing owners/operators of catering establishments to continue with this illegal take-up of public spaces,” they said. 
 “Those who abuse public land are being allowed to apply for sanctioning of these illegalities, without being asked to remove them whilst awaiting a decision to be taken on whether permits can be issued or not.”
 The MRN also said it is disappointed by the actions of the PA, whom the group claims say that action in response to reported illegalities can only be taken after sanctioning applications filed by the restaurant owners are decided. 
 This is an unacceptable abuse of residents’ right to enjoy public spaces, the group said. 
 “Responsible ministers and relevant authorities and entities are expected to ensure that guidelines, regulations and civic principles are safeguarded,” they said. 
 “Instead, this drastic situation is being completely disregarded.”
 The group is encouraging residents to take the issue up with the local council as well as other relevant authorities including, the Planning Authority, the Lands Authority, the Malta Tourism Authority, the police, the Commission for the Rights of Persons with Disability, and Transport Malta.

 Plans have been submitted to convert the ground floor of the former Bank of Valletta branch in Fleur-De-Lys, near the Birkirkara bus terminus, into a restaurant and takeaway. 
 The bank branch closed in 2022.
 The applicant, Jonathan Francis Caruana, and architect Josef Zahra are requesting a change of use of the ground floor of the building from a Class 4A commercial bank to a Class 4D restaurant and takeaway including outdoor tables and chairs. 
 The application (PA/06634/24) also requests the reconfiguration of the common area serving the first and second-floor offices to incorporate a lift and a dedicated entrance door. The proposal is currently awaiting recommendation. 
 Once a Planning Authority case officer recommends the project – for refusal or to grant permit – the application will go before the Planning Authority board for a decision. 
 
 On examining the plans, the Malta Tourism Authority found no objection to the proposed change of use to class 4D provided that all necessary clearances are obtained from competent authorities. 
 “Should the proposal be approved, the applicant should also pursue a separate licence for a catering establishment. On the other hand, this application for outside tables and chairs should be strictly considered within the context of the OCA (outdoor catering areas) policy for tables and chairs,” the authority said, adding that safety measures for users should be always given a priority.

Fish farm exports nosedive as producers call for 'assistance',timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/fish-farm-exports-nosedive-producers-call-assistance.1101809,30-11-2024,005915.png,"Malta's fish farm sector wants the government to step in and provide assistance after the value of their exports nosedived by 40 per cent in 2023.
 The Maltese Aquaculture Producers Federation (FMAP) said the collapse in income came despite farms having produced high amounts of fish and was the result of international market prices and unspecified ""changes in seawater"". 
 Data published by the National Statistics Office for 2023 shows that the value of fish farming sector exports that year amounted to €199 million - a drop of almost 40 per cent when compared to the €320 million worth of exports registered in 2022.  
 That drop was even more dramatic when seen in the context of production, which rose. In 2023, local farms yielded over 20,800 kilograms of fish, compared to the just over 18,000 kilograms produced in 2022. 
 Aquaculture in Malta primarily consists of the farming of bluefin tuna fish, with the majority of its produce being exported to Japan. 
 The sector has sought to diversify its customer base and last year the government signed a deal with China to export bluefin tuna there. 
 In a statement on Saturday, the Maltese Aquaculture Producers Federation (FMAP) said the 2023 figures had to be viewed in an international context. 
 FMAP CEO Charlon Gouder said the sector was negatively impacted by currency fluctuations and geopolitical tensions in Japan and China, the two biggest imports of Malta-farmed tuna. 
 “These led to the value of products acquired from Malta decreasing by half (price paid for product per kilo fell from around €17.75 per kilo of produce in 2022 to €9.55 per kilo of produced in 2023),” he said.
 “This was happening while the pressure on the industry continued to increase, with a 12% rise in costs in 2023 compared to the previous year.”
 Gouder said the deal with China was well-timed and the value of Maltese tune exports to the country was poised to grow in the coming years. 
 He also alluded to ""changes in seawater"" making it tougher for fish farm producers to maintain the same levels of production. Outputs were down when compared to the amount of inputs, he said.
 Gouder did not specify what those ""changes"" were, though he may have been alluding to rising sea temperatures, which marine experts have said is to blame for the sudden drop in staple fish lampuki. 
 He said if Malta wants to be at the forefront of sustainability of the industry, the issues facing the sector need to be ""studied, addressed and managed."" 
 ""There had been one step back in 2023, but this industry was resilient and could take it. However, another step back would be disastrous. Hence, assistance is vital to sustain aquaculture in Malta,"" he said.

 A controversial 4,000 square metre, 109-unit apartment block in Mellieħa green lung was given the go-ahead by the Planning Authority on Wednesday.
 In a sitting held on Wednesday morning, the three-person PA board dismissed concerns raised by residents and the Mellieħa local council about the project’s massing and impact on the community’s quality of life, finding that the project was “in line with planning parameters”.
 The board unanimously approved the application, with chairperson Stephania Baldacchino and members Mireille Fsadni and Anthony Camilleri all voting in favour.
 Mellieħa mayor Gabriel Micallef later slammed ministers hailing from the locality's electoral district for their silence over the proposal.
 The PA’s decision on Wednesday brings the bitter dispute between residents and authorities over the plans for the plot to an end.
 Last month, residents and NGO group Il-Kollettiv took to the streets to demand plans be scrapped, describing it as a “concrete trophy” and saying that the project would rob them of a rare urban green space. 
 Both Mellieħa mayor Gabriel Micallef and deputy mayor Matthew Borg Cuschieri backed the residents’ protest.
 But developers T&S Property Holdings pushed on with plans to build 23 residential units on each of its ground, first, second and third floors, for a total of 92 apartments, together with 17 penthouses and 171 basement garages.
  The company insisted that the area had been designated for development since 1965, with the 2006 local plans also marking the area as available for development.
 T&S Holdings are a familiar face in the construction industry, headed by Paul Attard, director of GAP Property and Paul Vella, who leads Ballut Blocks.
 The project first caught public attention in 2023, when the government sold the plot of land, with an estimated market value of over €12m, to the developers on a 50-year perpetual revisable emphyteusis against an annual payment of €380,000.
 The deal stipulated that the winning bidder could redeem the emphyteusis within the first 15 years after a revision according to the rate of inflation
 Despite being outbid in the tender process, T&S emerged with the land’s title thanks to a right of first refusal they held because they owned an adjacent piece of land. This allowed them to match the highest bid and take over the entire plot.
 Shortly afterwards, residents filed a parliamentary petition urging the Lands Authority to reverse its decision to give the land away, with PN MPs Robert Cutajar and Ivan Castillo, as well as then-PL MEP Cyrus Engerer backing residents’ calls.
 Then-local councillor Gabriel Micallef, today the town’s mayor, had taken matters a step further, calling on the ombudsman to investigate the deal.
 On Wednesday Micallef took to Facebook to express his frustration at what he described as the “ease” with which the PA board approved the proposal, despite “the negative impact this development will bring”.
 “At a time when we yearn for more public spaces, the Planning Authority has approved this development, hidden in plain sight within the outdated 2006 Local Plan, as though it were of no consequence.”
 Pledging not to give up, Micallef slammed ministers hailing from Mellieħa’s electoral district for their silence over the proposal, describing it as “a betrayal of the community they are supposed to represent”. 
 Tourism minister Clayton Bartolo was elected from Mellieħa’s electoral district, while justice minister Jonathan Attard also stood as a candidate in the district.

Concerns raised for Mosta streetscape,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/concerns-raised-mosta-streetscape.1097502,09-02-2024,006110.png,"A planning application proposing the redevelopment of two Mosta townhouses, probably designed by famed architect Gustavo Vincenti, has raised fears that their unique features will be altered, permanently destroying the harmony of the streetscape. 
 The one and two-storey homes are located in Triq Gafà in a pristinely preserved streetscape and share several classical architectural features with two adjacent properties.
 David Ellul, an architect who has researched and written extensively about Vincenti, said the two houses possibly date back to the 1930s and are very similar to other buildings in Birkirkara and Sliema designed by Vincenti. 
 The planning application, PA/06935/23, proposes to retain their façade but demolish the rest to make way for up to five floors of apartments. The plans include garages to be excavated.
 Ellul noted that as proposed, the interventions on the façade do not “harmonise” well with the adjacent houses. 
 “For the proposal to respect the architecture of these three buildings, the roof parapet wall of the dwelling named Iris has to be retained in its totality while the cornice has to be extended to join all three dwellings as originally intended,” he said.
 “Furthermore, the proposed garage opening does not respect the architecture of the building as it punctures through the arched window and ruins the formation of the corbels as these flow vertically downwards along the ground floor elevation, thus destroying the architectural rhythm created.” 
 Architect Edward Said, who coordinates the heritage group Friends of Villa Frère, highlighted his own concern about potential alterations. 
 “While it is appreciated that the proposed façade attains an overall classical architecture, I feel that it should be more reverent to the existing façades in particular the pristinely preserved property next door,” he said.
 Din l-Art Ħelwa has objected to the development, saying the extension to the building “does not suit the character and distinctness of this streetscape”. 
 It also said that the application is in breach of planning policy and the local plans, as the site is designed for three floors and a basement, with the possibility of a recessed floor, but the application is proposing five floors.

 Speaking in an interview with Times of Malta, the prime minister disclosed that while a Sigma event will still take place in Malta in 2025, it will no longer be the biggest Sigma gathering. It will also shift from its usual November slot to September. 
 Highlighting the intense international competition for events of this calibre, Abela noted “the moment a country shows it does not want quality investment it will be taken by someone else”.
  “You cannot have the biggest Sigma conference move to Milan instead of staying in our country,” he insisted.
 Sigma Group describes itself as an events and media organisation focused on gaming, emerging tech, digital health  and affiliate marketing. It has been organising conferences and expos around the world since 2014.
 This year, according to Abela, Sigma attracted 27,000 delegates, injected an estimated €100 million into the Maltese economy and created 950 local job opportunities. 
 However, the event also drew criticism for exacerbating traffic congestion, particularly around the Marsa area, where the conference was held. 
 The prime minister admitted that the current venue, situated near the Malta Maritime Hub, is no longer viable. 
 “The government’s pledge to transform the site into a proper maritime hub effectively excludes it as a future conference location,” he said.
  This was the second consecutive year that MMH was used as the Sigma conference venue.
 Abela acknowledged the inconvenience for two years in a row.
 “This is why discussions are under way to identify a new venue capable of accommodating an event of Sigma’s scale while minimising disruption.”
 Nevertheless, Abela defended the decision to host the conference in Malta despite the logistical challenges, arguing that the income generated allows the government to reinvest in the people. 
 Abela stressed the broader economic benefits of the conference, including increased work for carpenters, hairdressers, beauticians, Y-plates and white taxi drivers, plus increased revenue for pensions, children’s allowances and disability support measures.
 “I want the Sigma conference to remain the biggest in our country. I cannot justify this simply by stating the amount of money the conference is leaving in our coffers. That is certainly an important point. But, at the same time, we need to have a venue where the issue of traffic can be more easily managed.”
 In the interview, the prime minister takes a swipe at the opposition, accusing it of fostering negativity while failing to present viable alternatives. 
  “If you ask them whether they want Sigma to remain in Malta, they will dodge the question,” he said.
 In his first sit-down interview with Times of Malta for two years, Abela answered questions on the breach of ethics by ministers Clayton Bartolo and Clint Camilleri, the Labour Migration Policy, which will soon be out for consultation, the review of the local plans and the much-maligned Villa Rosa project, traffic, Labour’s June electoral performance and discusses the possibility of an early election.  The first part of the interview will be published tomorrow.

New law mandates regular training for stone masons to renew licences,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/new-law-mandates-regular-training-stone-masons-renew-licenses.1096416,08-07-2024,"006202.png,006203.png","A new construction law now requires stone masons to receive regular training on safety and new building practices before they are able to renew their licences. 
 Previously, masons had to pass an exam once and were not required to receive continuous training when renewing their licences yearly.
 The law has now been amended to require masons to renew their licenses every two years, but must now pass new exams in order to do so. 
 The law, published on Tuesday in the Government Gazette, introduces a new committee under the Building and Construction Authority responsible for licencing masons.
 The committee will test masons' competencies through both theoretical and practical exams before granting a licence. 
 When renewing their licence, masons will have to undergo training the committee deems necessary.
 ""That can include anything from new building methods to best health and safety practices, construction reform minister,"" Justice Minister Jonathan Attard, who is responsible for construction reform, said. 
 The committee will also maintain a register of licenced masons.
 Announcing the legislation on Wednesday morning, Attard said the reform comes a year after a public consultation and discussions with stakeholders, including Kamra tal-Periti, the Malta Developers Association, and Assoċjazzjoni Bennejja u Kuntratturi.
 He said the new regulations were in the recommendation of the Jean Paul Sofia Public Inquiry and also the Labour Party's 2022 electoral manifesto.
 The legislation provides more details about the skills required for masons.
 A mason is now defined as someone who builds and/or repairs structures made of concrete, stone, brick, or steel.
  This means potential licensees must prove their skills in these areas before obtaining their licence.
 Previously, the law only stated that a mason was licenced after demonstrating skills in the sector.
 “The old law, part of police legislation, dates back over 100 years,” Attard said.
 If a licenced mason was found responsible for structural damage or deficiencies in a building, a magistrate's court had to revoke that person's license, chairman of the new committee Godwin Agius said. 
 Under the new law, the BCA has the power to revoke a mason’s licence which will be a much quicker process, Agius said. 
 Some 1,700 people are currently licenced masons, BCA CEO Roderick Bonnici said. They will still be able to use their licence until the end of the year.
 However, they must apply for the new licence 90 days before the year ends, he said.
 Construction minister Attard said that a new construction site safety helpline has already received 70 calls since launching on Monday. 
 A new helpline 138 has been set up to facilitate reporting of any potential safety issues on construction sites.
 It has been dedicated to the memory of Jean Paul Sofia, 20, who died when a building under construction collapsed in Coradino in December 2022. His birthday was on August 13, hence the number 138. 
 The helpline is available 24/7. It is a collaboration between Servizz.gov, the Building and Construction Authority (BCA), and the Occupational Health and Safety Authority (OHSA).
 On Wednesday, Attard said that more calls are expected in the future as the government ramps up publicity efforts for the helpline.

 A motorcyclist who smashed into a skip on the St Paul's Bay bypass this week has died, the police have said. 
 Dieter Vink, 54, was riding a Honda motorcycle on Wednesday evening when he crashed into a skip placed on the bypass' final curve leading to the Xemxija roundabout.
 Police and emergency responders rushed to the scene and took him to Mater Dei Hospital for treatment. On Saturday morning, the police issued a statement to inform the public that he had died while there.
 Vink was a British national who lived in Mellieħa. A hairdresser by training, he switched careers some years back and worked as a customer service specialist. 
  Transport Malta, Infrastructure Malta and the St Paul's Bay local council have all said they had not issued a permit to allow the skip to be parked on the busy thoroughfare on the day of the crash.  
 The skip is believed to have been placed there by a contractor carrying out works on a boundary wall in the area. 
 St Paul's Bay mayor Censu Galea said the skip had also been placed on the road a few months back, and that residents nearby had complained at the time about it being a danger.

Watch: Marsaxlokk power cuts hit lives and livelihoods,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/watchmarsaxlokk-power-cuts-hit-lives-livelihoods.1097218,26-08-2024,"006253.png,006254.png","Marsaxlokk residents and business owners are growing increasingly frustrated as unplanned power cuts become a regular occurrence this summer.
 The frequent outages, often happening multiple times a week, are disrupting daily life and impacting local businesses, especially restaurants during peak hours.
 Nicholas Delia, a Marsaxlokk resident, recently shared a video on social media that mocks Malta as being “the envy of the world” due to the frequent power outages. His video underscores a serious problem.
 In the footage, Delia can be seen pushing his nine-month-old son in a pram through the dark streets of Marsaxlokk at 9.30pm, trying to cool down after yet another power cut—the eighth in just 10 days.
  Delia’s home relies on an electric hob for cooking, forcing him to seek a restaurant for dinner when the power goes out. But even this solution proves unreliable. “We went out to eat, and just as we started our meal, the electricity went out in the entire street,” Delia said in frustration.
 “We live right near the power station, and yet we still don’t have power.”  
 The situation is difficult for local restaurant owners along the busy Triq Xatt is-Sajjieda. They report that the unplanned power cuts occur up to three times a week and usually coincide with their peak business hours between 6.30 and 10.30pm.
 “It has come to a point where I’m scared to accept large bookings on weekends because I can’t guarantee that we’ll have power to serve them,” one restaurant owner said.
  The power cuts not only disrupt service but also create a challenging working environment. With air conditioners and fans rendered useless, employees forced to work in the heat have threatened to quit.
 Meanwhile, customers don’t want to dine in the stifling interior. “I only have limited outdoor seating so I’m losing business,” the restaurateur said.
 Restaurant owners are particularly worried about damage to their equipment. “The sound my fridge makes now haunts me,” another owner said, adding that repairing or replacing a fridge could cost hundreds or even thousands of euros.
 On some occasions, the lack of refrigeration has forced them to discard food, with one owner recalling a day when he had to throw away €150 worth of meat.
  The uncertainty surrounding the power supply takes its toll on health too. “This has impacted my mental health more than you can imagine,” one owner confessed. “I worked so hard to get this business off the ground, and now I’m left wondering what it was all for.”
 When they contact Enemalta, they are often left without a clear answer about when power will be restored, leaving them feeling even more vulnerable.
 Both restaurant owners believe that the Marsaxlokk substation is being overloaded, causing a fuse to trip.
 A spokesperson for Enemalta confirmed their suspicion about the fuse, saying that Enemalta has a long-term plan to add more substations in the area to help relieve the pressure on the current infrastructure. In the short term, they are working to add feeders to alleviate the load, a solution expected to be implemented within four to five weeks.
 This timeline means Marsaxlokk residents and business owners face the prospect of continued power cuts for the rest of the summer.

"New construction directorate has one basic function, architects discover",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/new-construction-directorate-one-basic-function-architects-discover.1091696,21-06-2024,006023.png,"A new Construction Directorate, announced by the Prime Minister in the wake of the latest death on a building site, is nothing more than a civil service department “that would guarantee continuity”, according to the Kamra tal-Periti.
 Its president, Andre Pizzuto, had sought clarification on the nature and scope of the directorate after Prime Minister Robert Abela mentioned it in reaction to the fatal accident of an Albanian construction worker in Sliema nine days ago.
 “A civil service department is all it is, falling under the permanent secretary, to ensure there is continuity when the minister changes,” Pizzuto said, when asked whether it could serve to solve the rampant occupational health and safety issues on construction sites.
 The Jean Paul Sofia public inquiry report, which the Prime Minister had originally stalled, had recommended a single authority to regulate every aspect of the building and construction industry, because of failed self-regulation, as the chamber president had proposed.
 It pointed out that the Building and Construction Authority, the Planning Authority, the Occupational Health and Safety Authority and JobsPlus should have effective channels of information to work better together, and suggested that Malta Enterprise and INDIS Malta should be merged again into one entity.
 But the new directorate would not be merging all regulatory entities, Pizzuto was informed.
 “It is just a directorate within the permanent secretary’s office,” he said.
 The report, published two months ago, looked at how the government should revamp construction-related rules and processes.
 Compiled after the collapse of a building that killed Sofia, 20, the report highlighted issues of collaboration between the various related entities, including the BCA.
 It also pointed out a lack of inspectors in all relevant authorities, and said they also needed more training to be more effective.
 
 Asked whether he thought the directorate would serve to change anything, Pizzuto said he hoped it would help “not to have to start afresh whenever there is a cabinet reshuffle”.
 The Construction Directorate should also help facilitate the monitoring of EU affairs and directives about the sector, he said.
 Over half of workplace deaths in the last two years were in the construction industry, according to the National Statistics Office.
 Following the Sliema accident, which killed 51-year-old Bari Balla when the roof of a property he was working on caved in, the Prime Minister urged firm and speedy action over his death.
 “No one should avoid the course of justice because of technicalities,” Abela had insisted.
 While enforcement was improving and resources were being added in the construction area, ultimate responsibility also rested on developers and contractors, Abela said.
 A magisterial inquiry is under way, and Abela also said the committee tasked with implementing the Sofia inquiry recommendations was working to ensure they were adopted.
 But for newly appointed Din l-Art Ħelwa president Patrick Calleja, who gave up his architecture practice to take on the role, things could have been done differently.
 Speaking in his personal capacity and not that of the national trust he heads, which deals with heritage preservation and the environment, Calleja said had there been a serious, independent and quick inquiry by the State and the Chamber of Architects into the cause of every construction site accident, and the architects and contractors identified and punished accordingly, the situation today would have been different.
  But the additional bureaucracy had simply caused confusion, Calleja continued, adding there could be as many as eight architects with different tasks on one site, complicating matters of responsibility.
 More red tape meant property owners and developers had to wait too long and were more inclined to take risks, he believed.
 The BCA has been turned into a “monster”, Calleja said, adding he thought it was “crazy” that it was responsible to give clearance for all projects.
 While he did not know what the remit of the new Construction Directorate would be, Calleja said the way things are done today “does not help at all”.
 Everyone was tarnished with the same brush, and it was unfair on architects who were prepared to take on their responsibilities.
 All members of BCA board bar one were asked to resign last week. The news emerged as another construction incident, this time in Floriana, left two workers injured.

PA delays decision on 275-unit apartment complex in Naxxar,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/pa-delays-decision-275unit-apartment-complex-naxxar.1101320,21-11-2024,"006288.png,006289.png","A long-awaited decision on the building of a 275-unit apartment complex on the outskirts of Naxxar was delayed on Thursday, with a Planning Authority board telling the project architect that the plans need to include more refuse rooms to cater for waste generated by prospective residents.
 The development, submitted by developer Charles Camilleri, will consist of five separate seven-floor blocks on the site of an abandoned quarry, with three levels of basement garages on the corner of Triq Censu Muscat, Triq Manwel Magri and Triq it-Tin.
  The project has been in the works for the best part of 15 years, first getting outline approval in 2008, before a full planning application was submitted the following year.
 But the application lay dormant for several years, until it was resurrected in recent years.
 The plans received dozens of objections from residents, many of them concerned with the development’s impact on their quality of life.
 The Naxxar local council also objected to the project’s, saying that it would cause several problems to residents in the area, adding to congestion and traffic. The council is particularly concerned about the building height, a representative said.
 The plans were also turned down by the Superintendence of Cultural Heritage, which said that the development would negatively impact the town’s skyline.
  Distressed neighbours, speaking at the hearing, also raised a litany of concerns, saying that the complex would tower over their homes, blocking light, causing congestion and parking problems, and negatively impacting their wellbeing.
 The development will remove a series of buttresses that are part of the foundations of their homes, risking a tragedy.
 “We are terrified that our homes will collapse,” one resident told the board.
 Other objectors pointed to the absurdity of the application being recommended for approval because it abides by planning policies established in 2007, shortly before the plans were submitted, despite these policies having been updated in 2015.
  But the PA board brushed away many of these concerns.
 If the project were to follow current planning policies, its density would “increase dramatically,” one board member said.
 Meanwhile, the removal of buttresses causing damage to neighbouring homes is a matter for the Building and Construction Authority to deal with during the construction process, not a planning issue, another member said.
 The board also gave concerns over the building’s height short shrift.
 “If residents are unhappy with building heights, they should band together to request that the area’s building heights remain as is, rather than object to individual applications,” one board member said.
 NGO representative Romano Cassar was the only board member to give credence to residents’ concerns, saying that the proposal should have included a social impact assessment, as was the case for other projects of a similar size.
 Cassar was also the only board member to suggest that the objection filed by the Superintendence of Cultural Heritage should also be taken into consideration.
 Nevertheless, the board took issue with the project’s waste management plan, telling project architect Brian Ebejer that the single refuse room planned for the development will not suffice.
 Each of the five blocks should have a separate refuse room in which to store residential waste, the board said, asking the architect to submit new plans.
 A new hearing will take place on 12 December.

‘Abusive’ car hire company owner wants big complex in Gudja,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/abusive-car-hire-company-owner-wants-big-complex-gudja.1096042,08-03-2024,"006547.png,006548.png","One of the owners of a car hire company accused of countless deceptive practices and who is currently fighting an  eviction battle with Malta International Airport wants to build a massive new complex for the building slap bang in the middle of residential Gudja.
 Gerald Camilleri, one of the owners of Smart Car Rentals, is behind a planning application to convert two garages on the narrow Triq San Pawl into a large complex to accommodate his car hire business.
 The project would require extensive excavation to build three subterranean garage levels as shown in the plans. The drawings indicate that, apart from some office space on the ground floor, Camilleri is also planning to build an additional four floors set to be converted into apartments.
  Residents appear to be largely against the development, with the planning application receiving 122 objections, voicing concern about the project and opining that it is inappropriate to locate a commercial project within a street characterised by residences.
 Triq San Pawl is located in close proximity to the airport and residents say they already feel pressured by travellers who leave their cars parked there for days or weeks on end while they are overseas. The presence of a car-hire company on the street, they fear, would lead to this problem growing exponentially.
 Many also pointed to the design of the project itself as a cause for concern, with many objectors expressing fears of having to live close to a site that is excavating three floors underground.
 Others also said that the proposed five-floor building above ground is inappropriate in the area, which still enjoys the character of the village core. Some said the large blank party wall the building would create would be a huge eyesore.
 Nationalist MP Mark Anthony Sammut pointed out in his objection that the site of the project directly abuts the village’s urban conservation area (UCA) and, as such, the designs do not allow for an appropriate transition into the UCA, due to the height and density of the proposed building.
 Sammut said the building height must be reduced, otherwise the project would “scar and dominate the traditional streetscape”.
 The Gudja local council has also objected to the application, citing, among other things, the zoning of the area, the building height and the unmet parking requirements.
 The Planning Authority’s case officer has recommended that the application be refused, saying the proposal goes against planning policies that aim to protect the character of urban areas and that it will give rise to “unacceptable” additional on-street parking.
 The PA board was set to decide on the application on July 30, but decided to defer the application again to allow the architect to submit further changes. 
 The architect was asked to submit fresh drawings and ""consider"" reducing the footprint of the upper apramorta and adding a further setback to the 3rd and 4th floors. 
 The decision has been deferred to September 3. 
 Times of Malta reported in January that Smart Car Rentals offered ludicrously low prices for car rentals that severely undercut the rest of the market.
 However, it became clear that former clients of the company were far from pleased with their services, with many claiming that the low prices are a honey pot to lure people, only to burden them with absurdly high and unexpected hidden charges upon collection of the vehicle.
 The company’s online presence is marred by overwhelmingly negative reviews from people who claim that the company withheld hefty depositions over damage that they were not responsible for. Others said there were attempts to intimidate them into paying for wear-and-tear issues such as clutch damage after driving the car only for a short while.
 Malta International Airport told Times of Malta earlier this month it was taking legal action against the company, which operates from the airport, to have them evicted from Park East.
 In legal filings seen by Times of Malta, the airport cited complaints of “abusive and potentially fraudulent behaviour” as the reason for terminating the lease.

 The professional service launched on Wednesday was a pledge made by Prime Minister Robert Abela earlier this year, in the wake of the  Jean Paul Sofia public inquiry. 
 BCA CEO Roderick Bonnici said the new service complements the construction helpline 138, also set up following Sofia's death.
 Both services aim to help those negatively impacted by construction work, and will ensure citizens get both legal and technical assistance free of charge, he said.
  Bonnici provided a step-by-step explanation for those who need assistance. 
 The individual must first call the helpline, where a representative will take down the details of their case.
 They will then determine whether the case is of a legal or technical nature. 
 A meeting will be held between the individual requesting the service and the professional assigned to their case, so the individual fully understands their rights and to clarify what the development impacting them entails. 
 An architect will provide individuals with their legal rights and relevant details on the proposed work which is impacting them. 
 The architect will also explain the construction method the proposed work will involve and the risks and precautions the construction site will have.
 If the third party does not agree with the proposed procedure of the development impacting them, the relevant points will be listed by the architect on behalf of the third party and they will inform the BCA. 
 The BCA will contact the architect responsible for the proposed development  and share the citizen's concerns. The citizen will also be put in direct contact with the developer through the architect. 
 If a person's property is damaged due to neighbouring construction work, the assigned BCA architect will draft a report on the damages and send it to the developer. The report will include pictures of the damages and the estimated cost amounts of the damages. 
 The developer can accept or refuse the report.
 If they approve, a private agreement will be drawn up on when and how damages will be fixed. If they refuse, BCA will be a mediator between the two parties to seek a compromise.
 In the case there is an agreement between the two parties and the developer fails to keep his word, a lawyer will be assigned to notify the legal repercussions the individual impacted can obtain.
 The BCA can also involve other professionals, such as engineers, when necessary.
 Speaking during the press conference, Justice Minister Jonathan Attard said the health and safety of the people is ""non-negotiable"" and the service aims to help and safeguard people who are impacted by construction work.
 He said the ministry and BCA have had meetings with numerous people who have suffered from situations where their property was damaged due to construction work.
 He said such people, 'the weaker party' in this situation, but be provided with all the necessary assistance, to not only understand the construction works happening next door to them, but to also have their rights protected. 
 He also announced that by the end of last week, the 138 helpline received 1,600 calls- an average of 80 per day. 
 He said around 1,200 of the calls were related to reports or questions linked to the construction industry.

Pietà core under siege as applicants seek more floors,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/pieta-core-siege-applicants-seek-floors.1094363,24-06-2024,006699.png,"The traditional streetscapes and urban conservation areas of Pietà are increasingly threatened by a wave of planning applications that seek to build higher in the area.
 New applications will shadow historic buildings, ruin streetscapes and breach planning policies if they are approved, according to experts and activists who fear Pietà is next to suffer a construction onslaught.
 Heritage activist and architect Edward Said noted that the need for a revision of local plans has never been more pressing, as more traditional streetscapes face ruin with applications seeking to build up two-storey houses to blocks of four or more storeys.
 “While not all of these buildings may be directly in the urban conservation areas, some of them are on the border or well within the buffer zone of scheduled buildings, which should make them non-starters,” Said pointed out.
 Said, who is part of the conservation group Friends of Villa Frere, said many of the buildings in question are in the vicinity of Villa Frere and Villa Guardamangia, once the home of Queen Elizabeth II. Should they be built, they may overshadow and obscure the heritage buildings in their wake.
 “While all of these cases are still being processed by the Planning Authority, one questions how they even reach a certain stage,” he said.
 “It’s an assault on the traditional character of the area, as it is a series of owners of two-storey buildings that are asking to turn them into apartment blocks, in an area full of Grade 3 scheduled houses, not to mention Villa Guardamangia.”
 One such application is PA/4190/23 in Triq Santa Monika, Pietà , where applicant Gilbert Bugeja and architect Pierre Farrugia seek to demolish three townhouses and turn them into a five-floor apartment block.
 The three houses, named Charles House, Spring House and Summer House, are located across the road from the Guardamangia parish church. They will be turned into a maisonette, 16 apartments and two penthouses if the application is approved.
 Said noted that these are excellent examples of mid-20th century domestic Maltese architecture, with a pair of the houses being considered ‘twins’ with an art deco design sensibility.
 “I cannot but underscore how important it is that these three houses be preserved in their entirety so as to protect the integrity of one of Guardamangia’s most prominent streets on which stands the Grade 1 parish church,” Said pointed out in his objection letter, where he urged for the houses to be preserved.
 The Superintendence of Cultural Heritage said these houses have facades that are of significant cultural heritage value and contribute to a streetscape that is “worthy of preservation”.
 Meanwhile, on the Pietà seafront, the application PA/2681/24 seeks to add another three floors to a group of four dwellings that currently stand at three floors.
 Applicant Keith Attard Portughes and architect Maurizio Ascione have applied to turn this property into a block of seven apartments, with a penthouse, as well as two shops on the ground floor of the building.
 Din l-Art Ħelwa, which objected to this application, said the proposed extension to the building posed serious concerns about the way it will impact the existing urban landscape and fails to respect the rhythm and proportions on the nearby traditional streetscape within the UCA.
 “The site is highly visible, itself being a scheduled site and is surrounded by several distinct scheduled properties together attributing to the site’s unique heritage context. The proposed development will unquestionably detract from the context’s heritage value through the proposed massive volume that will tower over its surroundings,” they said.
 And just a few doors down, plans for the abandoned Sa Maison Retirement Home still hang in the balance, as its owners have applied to rebuild the facility up to nine floors.
 Former Superintendent of Cultural Heritage Joseph Magro Conti has written a detailed objection, saying that the proposal runs counter to several planning policies, will negatively impact scheduled heritage properties and will increase the building density in the area, as well as traffic and increased pressure on already overloaded infrastructure.
 Another application on the Pietà seafront, PA/06740/23, is proposing to rise to eight storeys, with Friends of Villa Frere saying the block threatens to mutilate views from Villa Frere to the Msida Bastion Gardens, severing an important visual and historical link bet­ween the two heritage sites.

  He said the government was committed to strong enforcement of laws and regulations in the construction sector. It would take some time to achieve the people's trust, he said, but seeing a government that was actively trying to improve the sector was a step in the right direction.
 Two other initiatives will be launched shortly to complement the helpline service - free assistance from lawyers and architects to people affected by construction works, and the licensing of builders.
 Attard noted that also as a result of the Sofia inquiry a new Health and Safety at Work Bill was unanimously agreed in parliament last month. The new law is aimed at significantly reducing workplace accidents by introducing higher penalties, mandating Health and Safety Regulation Officers, and enhancing OHSA governance.

White taxis defend geofencing: 'It will cut down on abuse by Y-Plate cabs',timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/white-taxis-defend-geofencing-it-cut-abuse-yplate-cabs.1093676,13-06-2024,006825.png,"The introduction of new measures preventing Y-plate cabs from accepting bookings within 250 metres of white taxi stands will “cut down on abuse”, according to the head of the white taxi association.
 “We agree that passengers should have the choice to pick which company they want to book a ride with. What we don’t want is for ride-hailing cabs to abuse the system and wait in taxi areas,” Malta Taxi CEO Malcolm Ciantar told Times of Malta.
 Malta Taxi is the only operator of Malta’s white taxis, a company licensed by Transport Malta.
 “Ride-hailing companies work with a pre-booking system and the passenger waits for the cab. The Y-plate cab should not be waiting around for passengers in white taxi stands,” he said, adding that geofencing will “cut down on abuse”.
 “This happens often in areas like Valletta and the airport, where Y-plate drivers approach tourists who need a ride when that is not what they (drivers) should be doing.”
  Earlier this week, Transport Malta requested operators including Bolt, eCabs and Uber to roll out geofencing technology, a measure to prevent their cabs from waiting for bookings in certain areas.
 Under the new measure, Y-plate-cabs cannot wait for bookings within 250 metres of white taxi stands and 15 metres from bus stops.
 Malta International Airport, the Valletta cruise terminal and the Ċirkewwa ferry terminal are among the locations earmarked for ride-hailing cabs not to be able to accept rides within 250 metres of a white taxi stand.
 While platforms criticised the move, saying it could kill the whole cab industry, Ciantar said the measure is not as strict as it is abroad.
 He said ride-hailing drivers can still pick up passengers in the designated geofenced area, they are just restricted from waiting in the same area.
 “Abroad, ride-hailing drivers cannot pick up passengers in certain geofencing areas,” he said.
 “In certain airports abroad, passengers need to walk around 20 minutes to get to the cab they ordered. In our case, Y-plate cabs will have to wait 250 metres outside the zone, which means the passenger will end up having to wait an extra two or three minutes for the cab to pick them up.”
 The measure also forbids Y-plate-cabs from waiting within a 15-metre radius of any bus stop, yet Ciantar said white taxis already follow this measure.
 “We cannot wait around at the Valletta bus terminal, for example, so now all cabs will be following the same laws,” he said.
 Ciantar said that, since the boom of ride-hailing platforms, white taxi drivers have struggled, with some even quitting the business.
 “When you consider how some taxi drivers paid between €70,000 and €100,000 for a permit and then Y-plate cabs steal your clients, it can be a very difficult situation,” he said.
 “We have no problem with competition. Those who want to order a Bolt, an eCab or Uber can order it, and those who want to ride with us can do so too. What we don’t accept is that Y-plate drivers don’t follow the rules.”
 Ciantar said white taxis are regulated by Transport Malta, which has the final say on ride fares.
 He said under a new committee, complaints have decreased “and we are very strict with our drivers”, adding how some drivers have been suspended for not following speed limit regulations.

Qrendi project developer wants extra floor after public objection period ends,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/qrendi-project-wants-extra-floor-public-objection-period-ends.1101111,17-11-2024,006750.png,"A controversial planning application in Qrendi, which has drawn hundreds of objections, is now seeking approval to include an additional floor.
 In March, Ciantar Properties Ltd applied to demolish an old vernacular building and construct two apartment blocks of four floors on Triq il-Kurat Mizzi and Triq il-Konvoj 1942, Qrendi. One apartment block will be built on four floors and another on five floors.
 After the plans were submitted, residents and organisations had until July to object by submitting their representations to PA/3299/24.
 Hundreds had already filed objections, citing that the project would demolish a historic building, lead to overbearing development in Qrendi’s core, disrupt the town’s roofscape, and create large blank walls adjacent to the Urban Conservation Area.
 Months after the representation period elapsed, the developer updated the plans.
 The developer, Darren Ciantar, said the application will be republished as per normal procedure.
 Architect Tara Cassar told the Planning Authority that on November 5, four months after the representation period closed, new drawings were filed indicating that the applicant now seeks to increase the number of floors from four to five on the portion of the site directly fronting Triq il-Kurat Mizzi.
 Writing on behalf of NGO Il-Kollettiv and the residents’ group  Għaqda Reżidenti Qrendi, Cassar asked the Planning Authority to reopen the representation period. The developer is also requesting an increase in the overall development height from 13.15m to 17.6m. The additional height is 1.30m over the limitation allowed for that area, Cassar said.
 She argued that the new drawings represent “material changes” in the plans and, therefore, the permit must be republished, and new representations should be allowed to be submitted.
 The PA replied saying that Cassar’s request has been forwarded to the case officer assigned to the case.

167-room hotel set to replace the Empire cinema,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/167room-hotel-set-replace-empire-cinema.1091723,30-04-2024,006759.png,"Buġibba’s Empire cinema is earmarked for demolition, to be replaced by a 167-bedroom hotel with a supermarket at groundfloor, according to a planning application that is still to be decided.
 According to the application, construction magnate Carmel Polidano, known as Iċ-Ċaqnu, applied to demolish the existing Empire Cinema Complex. The complex includes seven cinema auditoriums, restaurants, three levels of parking and an apartment block. These are located on Triq il-Bardnell and Triq il-Ġifen.
 The application (PA/03858/23) proposes the construction of a 167-bedroom hotel on 11 levels, including five levels of basement parking. The development will include a restaurant outlet at lower groundfloor and a supermarket at upper groundfloor.
 The Empire complex is owned and managed by the Polidano Group. The cinema closed down during the 2020 coronavirus pandemic and never reopened its doors. Over the past few years, there have been rumours that the cinema would be refurbished.
 In October 2023, Newsbook reported that there was an application to build a 144-bedroom hotel on 10 floors. Back then, the project was still undergoing initial screening.
 On April 17 this year, the project was validated for initial processing and the site notice was affixed. Objectors have until May 17 to make any representations.
 Among those which already objected to the plans was the St Paul’s Bay local council, which asked to be informed about updates to the application process.
 As of Monday morning, the site notice was still referring to the 144-bedroom option. A spokesperson from the architectural firm, Martin Xuereb & Associates, said this mistake was being addressed and the notice would be replaced with the updated version.

Żurrieq arable land spanning 70 tennis courts in size could become flats,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/zurrieq-arable-land-apartment-blocks-pa-recommends-approval.1097076,22-08-2024,006817.png,"A stretch of arable land Żurrieq, equivalent to the size of 70 tennis courts, could be converted into a residential complex following the Planning Authority’s recommendation to approve a zoning change.
 The Planning Control Application (PC/61/22), in the Nigret area, would open up the land to construct five blocks across the 18,302-square-metre plot.
 Four of these three-and-a-half-storey blocks are earmarked for apartments, while one is designated for “social and community facilities”.
 The new blocks will occupy approximately two-thirds of the entire plot. A tenth of the area will be taken up by a road, and a quarter will be allocated to open spaces, according to the zoning plans proposed by Tum Invest.
 The case officer assigned to evaluate the zoning application recommended that it be approved because the site is within the development zone and adheres to local plans.
 In a statement, the residents’ group Għaqda Residenti Żurrieq criticised both the zoning application and the Planning Authority's recommendation.
 “The Planning Authority cannot keep approving these applications as if the land will never run out,” they said in a statement.
 “We cannot continue to ignore this systematic destruction of Nigret and Żurrieq,” they said.
 They said Żurrieq will soon have nothing to be proud of because of overdevelopment.
 Żurrieq, particularly the Nigret area, has recently been the focus of several zoning changes.
 This application is located directly across from another site undergoing a zoning change, which could lead to the development of an additional 12,000 square metres of arable land.
 Tum Invest has had another zoning application in the area approved. That decision allowed the conversion of 9,745 square metres of arable land into apartments.
 A zoning application is a formal submission to the Planning Authority requesting approval to change the designated use of a piece of land.
 It is the first step in converting an arable field into a development.
 When the Planning Authority decides on re-zoning, they should take into account policies such as local plans and Malta’s overarching planning document, the Strategic Plan for the Environment and Development.
 After a piece of land is rezoned via a Planning Control Application, the Planning Authority would still need to approve a planning application before any construction work can begin.

 The application (PA/06147/24) proposes to build a three-storey, 70-room home on some 9,300sqm of undeveloped land, together with an underground parking area for 104 cars.
 Some 3,600sqm of the land will be built, with the remaining area set to be landscaped.
 The application is for an outline development permit, which would give the applicant the go-ahead to develop the land in principle but would need to be followed by a full development permit to flesh out the details.
 Although the application was submitted in April, it only came to people’s attention when the site notice informing the public of the works appeared this week.
 The application, submitted by Arthur Tonna, lists former Labour minister Charles Buhagiar as the project architect. Earlier this year, Buhagiar was appointed to chair the Building and Construction Consultative Council, a body set up to advise the government on construction-related issues.
 The PA has received dozens of objections to the project, many of them calling for the ODZ land to remain untouched. Several objectors point to the harm that the construction could have on the flora and fauna of the area, including a series of beehives in the vicinity.
 Others said that nearby land was used to let off fireworks during the village feast, questioning whether such developments would put the feasts’ UNESCO heritage status at risk.
 This is not the first time that this tract of land has been earmarked for development. A 1998 application to build villas on the site was eventually refused.
 In a statement later on Tuesday, the Għargħur local council said it has objected to the application. 
 ""The land should remain ODZ first and foremost,"" the council said in a Facebook post.

‘It’s now or never’: KTP proposes tree-filled park alternative to Msida flyover,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/it-now-never-ktp-proposes-treefilled-park-alternative-msida-flyover.1094339,23-06-2024,"007331.png,007332.png,007333.png","The Chamber of Architects has released plans for an alternative to the controversial Msida Creek Project that would instead see the busy junction transformed into a tree-filled park.
 It wants to ditch the planned flyover and instead transform Msida into a 20,000-square metre park with more than 2,000 trees, claiming it would even improve the traffic flow in the area.
 The Kamra tal-Periti (KTP) thinks it can help solve the traffic problems around Msida by instead adding just one slip road to the Regional Road and reorganising the existing road infrastructure to route traffic around the area.
 The chamber says its proposal could be completed in less time than the current plans, at no additional cost and with minimal impact to residents during construction, while providing a much-needed green lung in one of the worst-polluted areas of the country.
 Asked why it had not submitted the proposal earlier, KTP president Andre Pizzuto – who first raised concerns about the government’s plans for Msida back in 2020 – said the chamber wanted to be involved but had not been consulted.
 He stressed that the chamber had not been professionally engaged to work on the project and had worked on its own plans voluntarily, but that it was not too late to consider alternatives with works on the site yet to begin.
 “It’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity; it’s now or never,” he said, urging the government to consider the chamber’s ‘Msida Park Project’ idea.
 Work on the Msida Creek project is due to start late next month after the feast of St Joseph.
  Rather than building a flyover to connect Ix-Xatt Ta’ L-Imsida (the coast road around Pietà) to Triq Mikiel Anton Vassalli (leading up to the skatepark), the KTP instead wants to divert traffic further west around the junction close to Valley Road.
 Meanwhile, Triq Mikiel Anton Vassalli would be closed to cars, with only buses and taxis allowed to use the road in a southbound direction, with the road covered and used for sports grounds and a children’s play area.
  The chamber insists the proposal is a more elegant solution that will keep traffic moving, stressing the planned flyover will simply move tailbacks from the existing traffic lights in Msida up to the skatepark and across the flyover.
 “The flyover doesn’t solve the problem,” said Pizzuto, who specialises in urban design and planning and who believes that by removing traffic lights altogether traffic will flow quicker and avoid tailbacks.
 And by closing Triq Mikiel Anton Vassalli to cars, the chamber thinks the skatepark can be expanded and redesigned to offer better facilities to skating enthusiasts by reclaiming existing road surface.
 Stressing the KTP proposal “seeks to provide a more sustainable balance,” Pizzuto said the transport needs of the area would be met “while also enhancing the local community’s quality of life”.
 “The thrust of our project is about better, sustainable use of land and quality of life,” he said.
 Pizzuto said the KTP had spent hundreds of hours working on the plans it says offer a better alternative to those expected to be carried out by Infrastructure Malta next month, noting it was still possible for the government to change course by submitting new plans to the Planning Authority.
 He said the change in direction would only delay the start of the project by a few months, with the chamber’s plans realised in much less time, meaning the project could still be completed ahead of schedule.
 Asked why the chamber had not released its proposal earlier, Pizzuto said its efforts to be involved with the project had been ignored.
 “We wanted to contribute to the project, we wanted to meet and provide our insights but that never happened... they [authorities] met with ROTA, NGOs and local councils, but not us,” he said.
  Stressing the chamber had not been engaged to work on the project and that all its work on the alternative proposal had been carried out voluntarily, Pizzuto said it had continued to be disregarded even after producing its plans. 
 He said he had informed Infrastructure Minister Chris Bonett about the chamber’s plans but had not had the opportunity to present them to him.
 “We look forward to discussing our proposals with the government, Opposition, the newly elected local council, and any other interested parties. It is not too late to modify the instructions to the contractor to execute this more sustainable project.”
  He added that while the technical plans had been ready in April, the visualisations – which he said were necessary to properly understand the proposal – needed more time. “We had to go the extra mile to give the public an idea of what we’re proposing.”
 When contacted, Infrastructure Malta CEO Ivan Falzon said he had never been approached by the KTP and questioned why the chamber had approached the media with the idea.
 “Why would the KTP come to news outlets with this and not the authorities?” he said, calling the proposal a “desperate attempt to make the headlines”.
 Falzon stressed it was “not standard procedure” for the KTP to be formally brought in on infrastructure projects, asking “where do you draw the line? Why not the Chamber of Commerce or marina representatives?”
 Acknowledging that the original plans had found “strong opposition” from residents and NGOs, he said he had invited stakeholders to present their ideas in 2022. “I don’t know why this late awakening.”
 Falzon stressed there had been a “clear consultation process” and said Infrastructure Malta was “all ears” for future projects. 
 “This time it’s too late, but for the future our door is open,” he said.
 Responding to questions, a spokesperson for the Infrastructure Ministry said while the ministry “appreciated” the KTP’s interest in the project, the tendering and adjudication processes had been completed and works would begin next month.
 She emphasised that the government “whole-heartedly believes in this project that aims to improve the quality, efficiency, safety and sustainability of Malta’s infrastructure.”
  Noting that around 60 per cent of the project was dedicated to public spaces, the spokesperson said it gave a “major upgrade” to the area and was the first major road infrastructure project to include a “comprehensive 10-year operations and maintenance period.
 She said it would provide a “pleasant environment for the years to come in the centre of this locality.”
 The project first hit the headlines in 2019, when then Infrastructure Minister Ian Borg announced plans to build two flyovers at Msida junction.
 A tender for the project was issued by Infrastructure Malta the following year, drawing criticism from Pizzuto who slammed the plans as “outrageous” and not making sense from an urban planning point of view.
 
 Instead of building flyovers in the heart of Msida and along a traditional coastal town, authorities should be diverting traffic away from it, he said at the time.
 Three months later, a group of NGOs urged former Infrastructure Minister Aaron Farrugia to send the project back to the drawing board and ensure social and environmental impact assessments were carried out.
 The controversy prompted a radical redesign of the project the following year, adding a piazza in front of the parish church, parking spaces, solar panels, a canal, pedestrian walkways and bridges.
 A new tender for the revised project was issued in August and approved three months later.

Planning Commission sanctions db Group's tables and chairs in Mellieħa square,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/planning-commission-sanctions-db-group-tables-chairs-mellieha-square.1091878,05-03-2024,007343.png,"The Planning Commission has unanimously approved the sanctioning of tables, chairs and umbrellas in front of a Spanish cuisine restaurant on the Mellieħa square after doubling the fine for the illegalities.
 The Planning Authority's Urban Conservation Area Commission noted that db Group’s restaurant Espiral was in a protected area so it had the facility to double the fine if it deemed fit.
 Commission chairman Martin Camilleri proposed that the fine recommended by the case officer - €4,680 - be doubled to €9,360.  
 The restaurant is located in the pedestrian area right next to the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Mellieħa and has been operating since August.
 Last month, activists and six residents' groups occupied the restaurant’s tables and chairs, protesting what they said was an ""illegal land grab by db's catering establishments"".
 The company said that when it opened last summer, the restaurant already had tables and chairs clearance from the Lands Department.
 The decision was deferred last month because the document with clearance from the Lands Authority was missing from the list available to the public.
 When the clearance document was eventually uploaded, objectors said it did not allow for the placing of tables and chairs.
 ""This letter of consent is being issued for the sole purpose of allowing the submission of a Development Permission Application... and shall in no way be constructed as a final decision by the Lands Authority to award a concession by encroachment,"" the letter says.
 Camilleri noted that while the authority's consent was not a permit per se, it was required to allow the applicant to file the application with the Planning Authority.   
 He said the placing of tables and chairs was in line with local plan policies since the piazza was within a secondary town centre where tables and chairs were accepted.
 Commission members Frank Caruana Catania and Joel Fenech agreed to add a permit condition that unless otherwise indicated on the approved drawings, all existing planters, free-standing signs, service counters and street furniture had to be removed before the permit became executable, and only after the PA’s enforcement directorate visited the site.
 The applicant's architect Darren Sciberras urged the commission to reconsider one of the conditions that all tables, chairs and umbrellas had to be removed when the restaurant closes every evening.
 He argued that for this to happen, all the furniture would have to be stored inside, taking up almost a third of the inside space. The umbrellas were also very heavy, he said.
 He asked whether the commission would allow umbrellas to be closed and tables and chairs stacked on the side of the piazza.  
 However, Camilleri said this was a standard condition that could not be amended.
 Catering furniture taking public space is increasingly becoming a contentious topic.
 Residents took to the streets of Valletta last month to protest about restaurant tables and chairs encroaching ""pavements for citizens"", while stickers saying 'no pavement, no vote' have also appeared in Sliema, Mellieħa, Marsascala and Buġibba over the last few days.
 Meanwhile, in Gozo, the archpriest of Victoria slammed a land grab by restaurants outside the square in front of St George's Basilica.
 Last year, the Ombudsman called on parliament to demand proper rules and procedures for outdoor catering areas that take up public land, handing the House a set of recommendations for better enforcement.
 But a year later, those plans and recommendations have remained shelved, with the Ombudsman last month slamming the authorities for delaying tackling the issue.

Kirkop youth rally against project in community green space,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/kirkop-youth-rally-project-community-green-space.1097501,09-03-2024,007367.png,"Kirkop youth activists are leading a last-ditch charge against the Planning Authority’s approval of a 90-unit housing development, warning it will destroy one of the town centre’s few remaining green spaces and disrupt its unique character.
 In a widely shared video, Gabriel Cassar Tabone, 27, voiced his concerns about the ongoing development, highlighting the area slated for the project. “There isn’t another Kirkop,” he said, stressing the community’s unique character and the importance of preserving its environment.
  Standing in the field where the new units are planned – and where work has started to clear the site – Cassar Tabone pointed out that the locality has seen a surge in construction, with over 25 housing units completed in the past seven months. With the new project, the number will surpass 100.
 According to the latest census, Kirkop has a population of about 2,500. Cassar Tabone calculated that with 3.5 people per new unit, the population could increase by 16%.  
 Cassar Tabone, who has a background in social work and experience with the Housing Authority, was quick to clarify that his opposition was not to social housing. “The last thing I am is a ‘not in my backyard’ sort of person,” he said. His concerns reflect broader community frustrations. “This issue isn’t just about me –  it’s about the entire community.”
 The field in question, according to Cassar Tabone, is an unofficial community space where children play and residents walk their pets. “This is one of the only green spaces left in the town centre, and we need green spaces more than ever,” he said, proposing that the area be developed into an official community space instead of being built over. “With some creativity, this field could become a beautiful space for the community.”
 The young activists are calling for a thorough impact assessment that addresses social, environmental and infrastructural needs before any development proceeds, ensuring benefits for current residents and newcomers.
 The youth-led movement against the development is gaining momentum. A 15-year-old resident, who organised a petition against the project, said young people are particularly passionate about the issue because they are more civically aware and environmentally conscious.“One of the few typical Maltese villages left is facing overdevelopment,” the petition organiser told Times of Malta, stressing that this is not just a youth issue but one that impacts everyone. The petition, titled “Stop the Construction of a 90-Unit Major Housing Complex in Kirkop,” had gathered over 430 signatures by yesterday morning.
 In 2021, the Kirkop local council formally objected to the 90-unit development in a letter to the Planning Authority, raising concerns about the project’s impact on local parking, the anticipated increase in noise and air pollution, and the strain it would place on the area’s infrastructure. They also highlighted that the proposed buildings would significantly exceed the height of existing structures on the street. When contacted, the mayor declined comment.
 The ministry for social and affordable accommodation said the area had been earmarked for housing development for over 20 years, and it lies within a development zone and complies with the local plans. It said the necessary funds and tenders had been allocated, and the project would have garages and parking spaces.
 However, the young of Kirkop are not convinced. Expressing his disillusionment, Cassar Tabone added: “I am honestly tired of being promised a better future through attractive campaigns, only to have those hopes dashed a few months, if not weeks, later.”

 Farmers who till land in an area known as Tal-Bebbux expressed concern with  Times of Malta over a planning control application proposing the alignment of a new road connecting Triq il-Kanonku Vinċenz Balzan with Triq l-Imqabba. The application is also proposing residential zoning with a height limitation of three floors plus a semibasement.
 Farmers whose families have tilled the land for generations said they were aware that the area, once ODZ, had lost development protection in 2006 through the rationalisation exercise by the government. However, the arable land, which is also lined with trees, was still cultivated and the Strategic Plan for the Environment and Development mandates the protection of “good quality agricultural land from development”.
 “If anything, considering the increasingly limited arable land in Malta, this is proof that the 2006 local plans are outdated and need to be revised nearly 20 years on,” they added.
 The impacted land is split in five. The largest share is public land leased to farmers who are tilling it.
 According to Planning Control regulations, in the case of changes to the zoning of land, applicants need to submit a written declaration signed by the owners of at least 75% of the current potential floor area, indicating that they have no objection to the proposed change. In the case of changes to the alignment of roads and buildings in a local plan, the written declaration must be signed by the owners of all the land being affected by the application.
  Times of Malta asked the Lands Authority whether it had signed a declaration indicating it has no objection to the proposed change and what are the government’s plans for the area.
 A spokesperson said the application was meant to establish road formation and height limitation of buildings in an undeveloped property “earmarked for development as far back as 2006, with the approval of the Żurrieq local plan and the rationalisation exercise”.
  “The Lands Authority, last year, gave its consent so that the PA may evaluate the PC application being presented,” the spokesperson added.
 But the farmers are not the only ones concerned about the changes: nearly 350 objections have been filed since the end of March, with Moviment Graffitti and Għaqda Residenti taż-Żurrieq also objecting to the PC.
 Several objectors lamented the “loss of 10,886 square metres of arable and agricultural land” as well as rubble walls and soil.
 Others said the fields are at a strategic point between Żurrieq and Qrendi and any development there would remove the “rural boundary” between the two villages.
 Some locals, meanwhile, commented that, if developed, the Żrieraq will be deprived of an unbuilt place that, so far, has acted as a viewing point for the village’s fireworks display.
 One objector simply put it: “Kindly stop this madness all around Malta before it’s too late”. Another objector blamed an increase in mental health issues in Malta on the lack of clean air and rural areas.
 A Moviment Graffitti spokesperson told Times of Malta the government has long maintained that, though it disagrees with the 2006 rationalisation exercise, its hands are tied.
 “In the Tal-Bebbux case, this lie has become embarrassingly apparent since half of the area covered by this PC application is government-owned agricultural land tilled by farmers. This means that government pro-actively gave the go-ahead to the developer to submit his application, signalling its intention to give this land to speculators and throw out the farmers.”
 The government could stop this development simply by not giving this land to developers, he added.

Bus driver who 'tried to drive after branch smashed through window' suspended,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/bus-driver-tried-drive-branch-smashed-window-suspended.1093985,15-06-2024,007416.png,"A bus driver has been suspended and will face disciplinary action after a tree branch smashed through a window of the bus he was driving on Thursday night.
 The incident occurred on the northbound carriageway of the Regional Road close to Spinola at around 8.45pm, impacting the TD2 bus operated by Malta Public Transport (MPT) on route from the airport to St Julian’s.
 And matters were made worse when, according to one of the passengers onboard, the driver attempted to drive off afterwards with the tree still lodged in the vehicle.
 While the branch crashing through the window came as a shock to passengers, MPT has said nobody was hurt in the incident, which it blamed on overhanging trees it said it had already flagged to authorities.
 On Thursday night, a bus journey from Malta International Airport to St Julian’s was rudely interrupted when the branch of a tree extending over a wall running down the side of the road crashed through one of the bus windows.
 “It was a bit shocking to say the least,” said passenger Carolyne Okeijn, who was returning home from the airport after a holiday in Rome.
 “It was a real shock when it happened, and the driver didn’t even say anything to us after it happened,” she said.
 Okeijn said she and another passenger had almost been hit when the branch came through the window and described glass flying over her head.
 While she hadn’t noticed the bus being driven erratically or excessively quickly, Okeijn said she had been unimpressed by the reaction of the driver to the incident, who she said hadn’t issued advice to passengers following the crash.
  “You’d have thought they were trained to deal with emergencies,” she said, adding the driver had struggled to communicate in English to a tourist at the airport who had asked how to buy a ticket.
 “He even tried to drive off while the branch was still sticking through the window but couldn’t manage it,” said Okeijn, adding passengers had been “yelling at him to stop”.
 Soon after, she decided to call a taxi with a group of tourists who had also been onboard.
 While stressing she relied on the bus service and would continue to use it, Okeijn said the incident had made her feel less safe using the service. “It’s not every day a tree comes through the window,” she said.
 Responding to questions, Malta Public Transport apologised “for the inconvenience caused by the incident” and said it was investigating the matter.
 A spokesperson for the company said initial findings suggested the incident “may have been related to the road infrastructural design, specifically issues with bollards and overhanging trees”, which he said MPT had reported to authorities in January.
 “The driver involved has been removed from service and the company will follow its standard disciplinary procedures. In the meantime, the driver will also undergo retraining,” he said.
 “While we regret any inconvenience caused through lack of information provided to passengers, we are currently reviewing our communication processes to ensure better passenger information in the future.”
 The spokesperson added that all drivers were required to demonstrate “basic English skills” when interviewing for a job at the company.

Ministers must take responsibility for construction industry and resign - ADPD,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/ministers-take-responsibility-construction-industry-resign-adpd.1091658,27-04-2024,007548.png,"Green party ADPD has called for the resignation of three ministers for their failure to control the construction industry. 
 After a week which saw the death of one man and the serious injury of three more in  two separate incidents, party chairperson Sandra Gauci insisted that political responsibility must be shouldered for the government’s continuous failure to control the construction industry. 
 Resignations of the Building and Construction Agency as well as its board are simply reactionary measures and do not demonstrate the will to execute reform in the sector, she said. 
 “It appears that the state is far from showing any remorse or the will to change things.  The cowboys in the construction sector are still with us and the sense of impunity and zero-enforcement are still evident,” she said. 
 “Despite the resignations in the wake of the Sofia public inquiry, the problems are still there and those who have appointed these people in the first place are those that are truly responsible.  Until Ministers Stefan Zrinzo Azzopardi, Silvio Schembri and Miriam Dalli resign, the resignations of these CEOs are only a public relations exercise to maintain a public image with no substance to back this up.” 
 Ministers, Gauci continued, would do well to remember they are not simply kept around for ribbon-cutting ceremonies but must be held accountable for their choices. 
 “There is a need for political maturity and for them to resign to show that they are equal to us and not above us,” she added. 
 Pieta local council candidate Janet Zahra Walker, who herself was forced out of her home due to construction activity, said that owners of derelict buildings should do their utmost to address damage on their property that may pose serious risk to neighbours and people in the vicinity. 
 “Such repairs must be performed immediately as delays may lead to people suffering the consequences of an incompetent construction industry,” she said. 
 Turning to areas in Pieta that need immediate attention, she highlighted that passageways from St Luke’s Hospital leading to the Pieta primary school should be upgraded and made safe for users, recommending the installation of barriers to prevent accidents. 
  Zahra Walker also called for more accessible pavements that allow people with mobility aids to move freely, while calling for open spaces to be better maintained. 
  “There is the need for Pietà to have a new council that urgently takes action on such needs, and I am ready to work for this,” she said. 
 MEP candidate Mina Jack Tolu said that it was also time for local councils to take greater responsibility for the safety of the buildings in their locality. 
  “Local councils should be given the necessary funds for buildings and properties to be surveyed, and owners of derelict and abandoned buildings posing health and safety hazards to passers-by should be required to keep such properties in good condition,” he said. 
 “Unfortunately, it is clear that we have learnt nothing from the Sofia public inquiry because not a week passes by without an incident in the construction industry, and one of the latest has resulted in a fatality.  There is the need for urgent action in the construction sector and not a fake exercise pretending that something is being done.”

"Għajnsielem mayor defends Fort Chambray vote, despite past opposition",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/ghajnsielem-mayor-defends-fort-chambray-vote-despite-past-opposition.1102475,16-12-2024,"007687.png,007688.png,007689.png,007690.png","Għajnsielem mayor Kevin Cauchi has defended his shift in stance after a 2008 article resurfaced, showing his previous opposition to the demolition of the British barracks at Fort Chambray. This comes after the local council voted in favour of the controversial decision to demolish the structure and relocate it.
 “Let us hope that the new plans would not lead to further rape of Fort Chambray,” Cauchi wrote in an article from 2008.
 On Thursday, the Planning Authority gave the green light for the demolition and relocation of the British barracks, which is part of a wider redevelopment of the Għajnsielem landmark, including a five-star hotel and apartment blocks.
 The two applications filed by Gozitan developer Michael Caruana on behalf of Fort Chambray Ltd – one to dismantle the barracks and one for the masterplan – were approved in two separate votes, each passing with five votes in favour and two against.
 Only seven members were present to vote, as four were absent – Andrew Ellul, Joseph Zammit, Aimee Brincat, Saviour Debono Grech. Joseph Tabone declared a conflict of interest.
 PA chair Emanuel Camilleri, Marica Borg, Martin Camilleri, Charles Hili and the Għajnsielem local council voted in favour of the development. Mario Borg, of the Gozo Regional Development Authority, and NGO representative Romano Cassar were the only votes against the project. 
 “The easiest option would have been to vote against it. Although the decision would have passed anyway, we would have looked much better doing so,” Cauchi told Times of Malta.
 In 2008, Cauchi posted an article on ghajnsielem.com, a website he runs, about the history of Fort Chambray. At the end of the article, he referred to a statement that  Alternattiva Demokratika had made condemning the planning application.
  The application he refers to is the outline development permit approved in 2012, which allowed for the demolition of the barracks.
 “Unfortunately, the architectural and historical contexts seemed to be ignored once again. Let us hope that the new plans would not lead to further rape of Fort Chambray while leading economic growth in Gozo and restoring this prestige location to its former glory,” he wrote.
 Asked about the article, Cauchi first clarified that the barracks are not being demolished but “shifted”.
  “My opinion and my wish have been the same, that Chambray, as much as possible, remains preserved. But today I am the mayor, and I need to take positions. I need to take into consideration a number of different things, including the positions of my friends in the council,” Cauchi said.
 Given the fort was derelict and was a “construction area” for years, Cauchi said that as a council they decided to try to get the most out of this development.
 To get the most out of this, the council had many meetings with the developers to discuss concerns and ways in which the development could be used to benefit the local community.
 The council was also concerned about the potential collapse of the bastions, public open spaces, the proposed use of the ditch, and issues related to waste management.
 Cauchi said one thing discussed with the developers was how to make use of the ditch to benefit the locals of Għajnsielem.
 During the PA board meeting, council executive secretary Lucienne Haber mentioned that the council would like to be an interested party. She mentioned how the ditch can be used as a public space, how a planning gain should be established and that developers should consider including a space that displays the history of the fort.
 Despite meetings with developers, they never made any promises, Cauchi said.
 Although no promises were made, Cauchi saw the developers’ openness to sitting down with the council and listening to their suggestions as a positive sign.
 “History will judge,” Cauchi said, hoping that this development would take into account the issues the council raised.
 Back in June, the bipartisan parliamentary committee unanimously agreed to amend the Fort Chambray concession to allow extensive parts of the site to be transferred to new investors. This effectively means that the original concessionaire – Caruana – can sell the concession to a group of unnamed investors who are reportedly in negotiations over the site.
 PN MP Alex Borg was one of the committee members who voted in favour of the transfer of the concession. He later defended his decision in a post on Facebook where he explained that the government’s reluctance to restore the fort has left no choice but to involve private entities to carry out the restoration.
 Sources said Cauchi is a canvasser for Borg, but the mayor denied this, saying he simply offers his “support to anyone in the party who is a candidate”. 
 Asked whether there was any pressure from Borg to vote in favour of the development, Cauchi replied: “There was no pressure from Alex Borg.”
 He further clarified that, within the council, nobody was pressured by their respective political parties when it came to voting on both applications.

Coast Road traffic chaos as lanes closed without prior warning,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/coast-road-traffic-chaos-lanes-closed-prior-warning.1098732,28-09-2024,007571.png,"Motorists were left fuming on Saturday morning when they discovered southbound lanes on the Coast Road were closed without prior warning.
 The key road – which Transport Malta has previously dubbed as “Malta’s most beautiful” – links Swieqi and Pembroke to the northern town of St Paul’s Bay and is used by thousands of commuters every day.
 Traffic in the area rapidly built up on Saturday morning as southbound motorists were forced to seek alternative routes to reach their destinations.
 Images published by popular Facebook group Maltese Road Traffic Updates showed a sea of cars jammed in arterial roads as a result of the unannounced closure. 
 Southbound lanes will be intermittently closed throughout the weekend due to Europe Triathlon Youth Championship events, Transport Malta announced on Saturday morning.
 But the transport regulator drew users’ ire for its failure to announce the closure beforehand.
 Transport Malta only issued its warning to commuters at 10.49am – more than four hours after southbound lanes were closed to traffic.
  Lanes were reopened at 11.30am but will close once again between 2.30pm and 7pm. They will also be closed on Sunday between 6.30am and 1pm, Transport Malta said in its “important announcement”.  
 Road users were left unimpressed.
 “Closure of 5 hours and you post this 30 minutes before it reopens. You are all unfit for purpose,” one wrote in response to Transport Malta’s Facebook post.
 “Clowns. You should have advised this well beforehand,” another said.
 One user said his mother had nearly missed a chemotherapy session because of traffic caused by the unannounced closure. It had taken him one hour to get from Buġibba to the Salini roundabout and back, he noted. The two are roughly 2km apart.
 As critical comments flooded in, Transport Malta restricted comments beneath the post. 
 Questions have been sent to Transport Malta. 
 The Coast Road chaos marked the culmination of a difficult Saturday morning for Transport Malta road officials: crashes close to Mater Dei Hospital, in Mosta, southbound Santa Venera tunnels and Sliema's Triq ix-Xatt all led to significant road congestion in those areas, too.

"New airport scanners ‘are not a waste of money’, airport boss insists",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/new-airport-scanners-are-waste-money-airport-boss-insists.1096319,15-08-2024,007589.png,"The head of Malta International Airport has reaffirmed his commitment to installing new 3D baggage scanners, despite a recent European Commission decision to impose liquid limits for the devices.
 Last week, the Commission introduced a regulation restricting liquid containers larger than 100ml from being taken through the new C3 scanners being rolled out across Europe, bringing the devices in line with existing rules for older models.
 The new security scanners had been billed as more convenient, allowing passengers to leave electronics and liquids – including those larger than 100ml – in their hand luggage.
 For years, passengers have been required to remove laptops, tablets and liquids from hand luggage as part of pre-flight security checks, with containers over 100ml banned.
  But the new scanner introduced last June removes the need for these restrictions by allowing security staff to see 3D and more detailed images of baggage items.
 But from September 1, existing rules on liquids will need to apply to the new devices too.
 While the limitation is meant to be temporary, the EC has not given a timeline for when the new rule will be relaxed.
 Asked if he thought the new airport scanners, costing €3 million, represented a waste of money in light of the Commission’s decision, Malta International Airport CEO Alan Borg said they did not.
 “Absolutely not. We still believe in technology, and I feel this is just a challenge the Commission will overcome. The technology we have installed is the future of security,” he said, adding the new scanners had halved the time it takes to pass through security.
 “Either way, it’s still an improvement for passengers...  we’re still committed to doing this... The investment that Malta did is in line with large European airports.”
 Borg was speaking to Times of Malta following an MIA press conference on Friday when officials unveiled a plan to reduce the airport’s carbon footprint by the end of the decade and achieve net zero emissions by 2050.
 The airport boss would not enter into the merits of whether the Commission had made a mistake when introducing the rule.
 Borg said he was confident the 100ml limit would “eventually” be relaxed once again and that the airport was on track to deliver the remaining five new scanners by the end of the year.
 On Wednesday, the EC decision attracted criticism from an association representing airports in Europe.
 “The new restriction means those airports that have already invested in C3 scanners... are heavily penalised – as little of the benefits associated with the use of this cutting-edge technology will materialise,” said Airports Council International (ACI) Europe.
 Last month, Borg warned of overcrowding at MIA amid “staggering numbers” of passengers he said had pushed the airport to its “extreme limits”.
 Asked about the problem on Friday, the airport boss said it was “still an issue.”
 He said teams on the ground were trying to help passengers affected by the overcrowding, but disruptions could not be completely avoided.
 “I’d love to have the option to close the airport, double it and open it. This would be much more efficient and faster, but in reality, we don’t have that option. This is an operation that runs 24 hours per day... our focus is to develop the terminal as fast as possible.”
 Last month, Times of Malta reported that the government and the EC had agreed on an interim solution to Malta’s border woes after it emerged the country would not have the new technology required for Schengen countries by the October deadline.
 The Schengen area refers to a group of 29 countries that have agreed to abolish border controls within the area.
 Asked about the stopgap measure, about which to date the government has not yet provided further details, Borg said the project was solely within the remit of the police and that he did not have any information about it.
 He said the airport was working on infrastructure to better accommodate arrivals from outside the Schengen area, who Borg said would face longer processing times when arriving in Malta.
 “We’ll make sure we have more space for passengers going through this process,” he said, adding the project was due to be completed by next summer.
 “We’re all hands on deck to deliver this on time.”

Power outage strikes cruise liner while hooked to shore-to-ship,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/power-outage-strikes-cruise-liner-hooked-shiptoshore-power-system.1096269,08-03-2024,"007647.png,007648.png","Updated with TM statement 12.53pm
 Thousands of passengers aboard a massive cruise liner experienced a power cut last Wednesday while the cruise liner was berthed in the Grand Harbour and connected to the shore-to-ship power system.
 Industry sources confirmed to Times of Malta that the power outage lasted for a minute as the MSC  World Europa back-up generators kicked in, while the shore-to-ship power system returned to full operation half an hour later.
 “Power went out at around 3pm. blocking passengers in elevators and bringing all operations and services aboard the cruise liner to a halt,” a passenger said.
 A source close to Transport Malta explained that “power aboard the cruise liner went out during routine testing.  The system is designed to trip as soon as it detects a possible fault, acting much like any breaker panel in a typical household.”
 
 Currently, the MSC World Europa is the only vessel using the facilities at the Valletta Cruise Port, which can power up to five cruise liners simultaneously.
 The ship, which carries up to 6,700 passengers and 2,300 crew members, connects to the system every Wednesday for seven hours between 9am and 4pm.
 In a statement, Transport Malta explained that last Wednesday a pre-planned test was conducted on the newly installed flame detectors to ensure they were functioning properly.  
 It said the test was carried out 30 minutes before disconnection to the MSC World Europa, and the system designed for emergency fire situations, performed successfully. After cancelling the alarm, the system was ready for reconnection in less than a minute.
 TM said that the ship chose not to reconnect to the shore-to-shop system as it was already time for disconnection. 
 ""The ship's standby generator activated immediately, providing electricity to the ship again in less than a minute.""
 The shore-to-ship system was inaugurated by Prime Minister Robert Abela on 10 July.
 Enemalta executive chairman Ryan Fava said that the system is connected to Malta’s power grid via a direct link fed through the Marsa North Distribution Centre and is designed in such a way that it can operate autonomously.  
  It is currently one of a handful of such systems operational in Europe.
 Plans are underway to install shore power capabilities in other Mediterranean ports, including five Italian ports, Barcelona and Valencia in Spain, and Marseille in France, by the end of 2026.
 Work to equip Malta Freeport with shore-to-ship power facilities began last October.
 These installations are part of a broader effort to reduce emissions and improve air quality in ports by allowing ships to turn off their engines and use local electricity while docked.

183 trees to be uprooted for Gozo road project; NGO: 'Ministry can't be trusted',timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/183-trees-uprooted-road-widening-victoria-marsalforn.1101118,16-11-2024,007802.png,"A revised plan for the controversial road-widening project between Victoria and Marsalforn will uproot 183 trees, according to the Gozo Ministry. 
 Gozo Minister Clint Camilleri announced earlier this week in parliament that his ministry had reached a compromise with environmental NGOs and even thanked  Din l-Art Ħelwa (DLĦ) for its collaboration.
 However, DLĦ said that while an agreement had been reached “in principle”, it was still awaiting confirmation of the total number of trees affected.
 On Friday, the ministry informed DLĦ about the latest figures, which the NGO criticised as ""unacceptable"". In a social media post, the group said, “the proposal still includes the alarming removal of a significant number of trees, down from 195 to an unacceptable 183.”
  This reduction still exceeds the original estimate of 177.
 DLĦ president Patrick Calleja expressed further frustration, saying the revised plans did not reflect the spirit of previous discussions.
 Speaking to Times of Malta, he said the ministry ""cannot be trusted"".
 ""Uprooting nearly all the trees they had originally earmarked for uprooting is not in the spirit of what we had said at all.”
 The Gozo Ministry defended the revised plans, pointing out that about 79% of the trees to be removed are invasive or alien species, including Nerium oleander, Ricinus communis, Acacia, and Eucalyptus. It also highlighted plans to plant over 300 indigenous trees as part of new landscaped areas along the route.
 Other project changes include relocating most of the proposed cycling lanes to rural passageways. Only a short section of the cycling lanes will remain along the road.
 The ministry said this adjustment would allow for converting 2,564 square metres of land into a hard shoulder, a safe space where drivers can pull over.  The rest remains part of the surrounding agricultural field, resulting in a reduction of expropriated area by 881 square metres, said the ministry. 
 Additionally, the ministry also said that 500 square metres of asphalt will be transformed into landscaped areas. The road will remain with one lane in each direction.
 However, DLĦ argued that the removal of the proposed cycling lane, which was to be 1.5 metres wide over a 3.5-kilometre stretch, should have resulted in a reduction of at least 5,000 square meters of land take-up.
 The NGO also noted that cycling group ROTA, which wanted to propose an alternative mobility route, was unable to do so as a digital file needed to plot this alternative was never provided by the ministry.
 The total amount of agricultural land impacted by the project is still to be confirmed.

Watch: Luxury Porsche joins suitcases and frozen fish on flight to Dubai,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/watch-luxury-porsche-joins-suitcases-frozen-fish-flight-dubai.1096583,17-08-2024,007888.png,"When a plane left Malta for Dubai last week, it was carrying an unusual item of cargo: a €225,000 luxury sports car.
 The blue Porsche Panamera ‘Turbo S’ was loaded onto the Boeing 777 on Wednesday afternoon, with an Emirates loadmaster flown in specially to oversee the operation.
 The transportation of the car was a rare occurrence at Malta International Airport and the first such instance in years.
 “It’s not something that happens every day; carrying a car is quite an exceptional occasion,” said Emirates country manager for Malta, Paul Fleri Soler.
  Noting it was only the sixth such instance in his 26 years at the company, he called it a “special day” for the team. A busy operation was under way on the runway as a team of Emirates and ground handling staff loaded the luxury sports car into the 340-seat Boeing plane.
 The operation marked the start of the car’s 4,000-kilometre journey to Dubai, where it will blend in with the wealth of luxury cars cruising between the city’s glistening skyscrapers.
 Fleri Soler said the last time the airline sent a car from Malta was around 10 years ago, when it flew out a Ferrari,  but added that Emirates sent cars in planes almost daily across its global network.
 “Normally they’re high-end cars... People sometimes emigrate and take their car with them; it’s their baby.”
 Emirates staff told Times of Malta there had even been instances of passengers taking their cars with them on holiday.
 Sending a car on a flight costs around €7,000 – and requires special attention. But that’s nothing compared to the cost of a new Porsche Panamera ‘Turbo S’, which retails at over €225,000.
 “There are strict procedures to follow, but once you go by those it should be safe,” said Fleri Soler, adding it was important to secure the car and load it with as little fuel as possible for the trip.
 The man whose job it is to oversee such procedures is Emirates loadmaster Mohammed Fakhir. He is responsible for making sure cars are fully secured for flying and reach their destinations “without any scratches or other damage”.
 Fakhir has been in the role for around two years and flew to Malta specially for the occasion.
 “Car loading offers the opportunity to go around the world, meet different people and have different experiences,” he said.
 To get it into the hold, the Porsche was loaded onto a metal platform and carried by lift from the side of the plane.
 In total, the Boeing 777 – the largest twin jet plane in the world – carried around seven tonnes of cargo, including pharmaceuticals and fresh fish, on Wednesday’s flight, staff said.
 Whether the Porsche is prized by its owner for sentimental reasons or taken for another reason is not clear; Emirates staff were not allowed to divulge the information, citing confidentiality.

 St Paul’s bay kept its place as the most popular locality for approved new residences with 130 units. 
 This was closely followed by Żabbar with 128 units, and Mosta with 124 residences. Meanwhile, Birkirkara saw 114 newly approved dwllings and Gozo’s Sannat followed by 111 units.  ",Matthew Farrugia ,Infrastructure
Former minister Joe Mizzi wants public open space for front garden,theshiftnews,https://theshiftnews.com/2023/08/11/former-minister-joe-mizzi-wants-public-open-space-for-front-garden/,11-08-2023,000066.png,"Former minister Joe Mizzi is once again trying to claim a piece of public land in front of his residence for his front garden and has asked the Planning Authority for permission to do so.
 Various residents of the government housing estate, which is situated adjacent to the Rinella bypass, told The Shift they could not believe how someone could apply to claim public space enjoyed by their neighbours for years.
 This is Mizzi’s second bid for the area. The first was in 2018 when he was a minister. Neighbours said plans were withdrawn after objections the first time around.
 “He is now making his second attempt to deprive us of our open space,” one neighbour who lives close to the former minister said. “Is this the Project Green that the government is talking about?”
 Filed a few weeks ago through his architect Chris Cachia, the former Labour MP has asked the PA to approve the realignment of the public space in front of his house so his front garden could be extended.
 Neither Mizzi nor his architect have attempted to justify the request to appropriate public space for personal benefit. Mizzi admitted he did not own the area as it is part of the government housing estate’s common parts.
 According to PC 00034/23, Mizzi aims to extend his front garden by changing the open space his neighbours enjoy into a passageway.
 Formal objections to the PA have already been filed by several of Mizzi’s neighbours, saying the application must be immediately stopped.
 “Are we to expect that all the residents with their houses abutting this open space will be given the right to extend their front gardens, or is this going to be done only for one privileged individual?” one objector wrote.
 Mizzi’s architect in this case, Chris Cachia, was the architect used by the owners of a Zejtun villa to speedily sanction massive illegalities days before they sold it to Prime Minister Robert Abela and his wife, Lydia.

[WATCH] Metsola on leading the PN: ‘I will not speculate… I am a candidate like anybody else’,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/ewropej/129132/watch_metsola_on_leading_the_pn_i_will_not_speculate_i_am_a_candidate_like_anybody_else_,12-05-2024,000087.png,"Roberta Metsola will not sway either way when asked whether she intends captaining the Nationalist Party in the next general election. 
 “I will not speculate on what happens after 8 June. I am a PN candidate. It has been a privilege to be an MEP for 11 years. I am a candidate like anybody else,” the European Parliament president said. 
 She was being interviewed in Kyiv during a short visit to Ukraine to mark Europe Day. 
 Metsola said her job was to convince people to go out and vote on 8 June. “I will take it step by step and never speculate,” she added, avoiding a definitive answer and insisting the party is led by Bernard Grech and had a good team of candidates for the MEP election. 
 Metsola said she was “saddened” by the developments in the Vitals scandal, which saw former prime minister Joseph Muscat and several others face criminal charges. 
  She criticised Prime Minister Robert Abela over his reaction to the inquiry conclusions and the subsequent charges filed against the individuals. 
 “The Prime Minister is not showing leadership and instead is attacking the judiciary and journalists. I do not want to have a Prime Minister who calls our judiciary terrorists. The minimum we expect from a prime minister in a democratic country is to guide the country out of this crisis,” she said. 
  Metsola reflected on the different emotions the Vitals case has inspired. “There are some who feel vindicated by what has happened but there are people who voted for the Labour Party because they believed in a different political system and today feel betrayed… it is my job as a politician to work to ensure that people feel they are protected irrespective of who they are.” 
 Metsola insisted that everybody should feel that justice can be achieved irrespective of who the people accused of wrongdoing are. “Nobody should be above the law,” she said. 
 Talking about her role as president, Metsola said Malta’s small size should not be viewed as a limitation. Her two-and-a-half-year term as European Parliament president comes to an end on 8 June but she is touted as being a favourite to be given another mandate in the new parliament. 
 “Since I was elected president I have noticed in the Maltese people I meet, a sense of pride because a fellow Maltese has achieved so much… Malta’s small size should not limit how big we dream, or how far we go and I see this attitude in every Maltese person I meet,” she said. 
 Metsola reminisced on the 20 years since Malta joined the EU, adding that every individual has their own personal story to tell. “I meet people who obtained EU funds to improve their business and others who speak of the excessive burden from EU regulations; I meet people, each with their own story that is either good or bad and this beyond the political tribalism of red and blue, which I wish would end one day.” 
 Metsola added that Malta’s electoral system means that politicians have to be close to their constituents. Each person knows who they are voting for, or who they do not want to vote for, she added. “The contact between constituents and politicians is tangible and this is very important.” 
 Asked about the impression some hold that she is elitist, Metsola smiled. “I was born and bred in Gżira in a family that valued education as a tool to achieve your full potential; people who know me, know I am not elitist.”  ",Saviour Balzan ,Infrastructure
PA asks Gozo Ministry to ‘justify’ five-metre horse in the middle of nowhere,theshiftnews,https://theshiftnews.com/2023/06/24/pa-asks-gozo-ministry-to-justify-five-metre-horse-in-the-middle-of-nowhere/,24-06-2023,000079.png,"The Planning Authority has so far refused to grant the Gozo Ministry a permit to instal a five-metre-high bronze statue in the abstract form of a six-legged horse in the middle of nowhere.
 Before deciding on a permit application, the Planning Authority is asking the ministry and the artist it commissioned for the job, Austin Camilleri, to justify its request to place the “incompatible statue” in a bare and untouched location in Xwejni, Gozo.
 In the latest development on this controversial project, which has already cost taxpayers over €250,000, the PA’s Planning Commission did not abide by the ‘grant permission’ recommendation made by the PA’s directorate.
 Instead, it told the ministry and the artist that it needs more clarifications and justifications on why, out of all places, the ministry is aiming to erect the abstract statue in an untouched location in a protected and unique landscape.
 The Commission, led by Martin Camilleri, has postponed a decision and has asked the ministry’s architect Christina Said to “submit further clarifications and justifications with regards to the chosen site and to submit a works method statement to indicate the detailing of works being proposed and many mitigation measures to be taken.”
 The Commission also said that no artificial lighting is to be permitted, which would render the statue virtually invisible at night.
 The ministry’s proposal has ruffled the feathers of many a Gozitan, as well as frequenters of the Xwejni area and the owners of the nearby saltpans because of its “incompatibility”.
 It has also drawn objections from BirdLife Malta, which fears the incongruent structure, especially if it is to be lit up at night, would negatively impact the colonies of unique birds known to breed in the area, within the confines of the Wied il-Mielaħ u l-Inħawi tal-Madwar Natura 2000 site.
 “Where will the buck stop with development concessions?” BirdLife asked in a recent public social media post.
 “While we are of course in no way against artistic exhibits, one has to understand that with all the pressures that the limited natural areas are facing, such an installation should have been placed outside a Natura 2000 site. To date, we have not yet received answers on why was this site specifically chosen.
 “The applicant has failed to justify why out of all available the coastline in urban areas, this site within a Natura 2000 site had to be particularly selected. Our concerns are pretty much that this is the start of a roller coaster of ‘acceptable’ developments within ODZs.”
 But despite strong objections from all the regulatory authorities – including the Environment and Resources Authority, the Superintendence for Cultural Heritage and the PA’s own Design Advisory Committee – the ministry and Camilleri are digging in their heels and insisting on this particular location.
 Apart from the fact that the statue has been deemed by experts as unsuitable for the location, its installation will also involve digging into untouched rock and inserting concrete piles deep into the ground, which may cause further damage to the unique location.
 Camilleri is being paid handsomely to turn his ‘Wiehed’ six-legged abstract equestrian vision into a new Gozo landmark. But the prospect of making it a ‘landmark’ is what is concerning objectors, who fear more people will be attracted to the remote coastal area – damaging the untouched environment and the centuries-old saltpans that are still being worked.
 All regulatory authorities have suggested that once the statue has been commissioned and copious amounts of public funds have already been spent on it, another location in a more urban setting should be considered.
 In so doing, the art installation could be enjoyed and appreciated by more people while leaving the unspoiled Xwejni location untouched.
 The ministry and artist, however, have rejected what seems to be a logical compromise and inexplicably continue to insist on the Xwejni setting.

 Some houses in Triq San Nikola, Sliema have been without electricity since Monday evening, more than 40 hours.
 Enemalta was informed about this issue very early on and has since been updated about this ongoing situation by residents.
 Not all houses on this street have experienced a 40-hour power cut; some houses had electricity for short periods of time, whilst others only had access to a very low voltage, which meant they could not use any appliances as this would trip the circuit breaker.
 One resident who spoke to The Malta Independent said that they had to throw out around €300 worth of food, but they still felt that they were underestimating. They made it clear that they shall be listing down everything they lost to receive compensation from the government.
 Another resident said that they were able to salvage some of their food by moving it to another freezer in another house where there was electricity.
 Throughout the day and night, an alarm of one of the houses has gone off a number of times, supposedly due to the power cuts, which wakes up neighbours in the middle of the night, one resident said.
 On Monday night and Tuesday night, at the height of Malta’s heat wave, one resident said they resorted to sleeping close to the floor right next to a window, all residents said that they had sleepless nights. Others were lucky enough to leave their house and sleep elsewhere.
 Malta has been suffering from frequent and long power cuts all over the island for ten days.

Water Services Corporation and CPD sign MOU to enhance emergency response and public safety - The Malta Independent ,independent,https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2024-11-06/local-news/Water-Services-Corporation-and-CPD-sign-MOU-to-enhance-emergency-response-and-public-safety-6736265515,06-11-2024,000149.png,"
                
        

         The Water Services Corporation (WSC) and the Civil Protection Department (CPD) entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) aimed at bolstering public safety and improving emergency response capabilities across Malta and Gozo.
 The agreement focuses on two things: first, the installation and maintenance of fire hydrants, and second, specialised training for WSC personnel.
 The MOU establishes a framework for cooperation, with WSC committing to install and maintain fire hydrants at strategic locations to be operated by CPD, while CPD, in turn, will provide essential firefighting and safety training to WSC staff, a government statement read.  ""This partnership is a significant step towards ensuring that both organisations can effectively support each other in safeguarding the public.""
 Minister for the Environment, Energy and Regeneration of the Grand Harbour Miriam Dalli, who presided over the signing ceremony, highlighted the importance of this collaboration stating that: ""This agreement shows our commitment to enhancing public safety and operational efficiency. By working together, WSC and CPD are setting a new standard for emergency preparedness, ensuring that our communities are better protected in times of need.""
 Minister for Home Affairs, Security and Employment Byron Camilleri said: ""The agreement between the Civil Protection Department and the Water Services Corporation aligns with the government's plans to provide people with greater peace of mind while ensuring that the country is better prepared and safer for serious incidents.""
 WSC CEO Karl Cilia emphasised the value of the partnership, stating: ""Our collaboration with the Civil Protection Department is a testament to the power of partnership. Together, we are enhancing our infrastructure and equipping our teams with the necessary skills to handle emergencies effectively. This MOU reflects our shared dedication to public service and safety.""
 Director General of the Civil Protection Department Peter Paul Coleiro stated that an exercise has been conducted to install a fire hydrant in every locality so that, in case of need, a fire engine can quickly obtain water from it rather than going to a station, thus minimising response time.
 The MOU is set to commence immediately and will run for an initial term of two years, with provisions for automatic renewal. This collaboration aims to ensure a robust emergency response infrastructure, benefiting the country.

Portelli attempts to turn illegal ‘hotel’ into apartments in Mellieha,theshiftnews,https://theshiftnews.com/2024/11/06/portelli-attempts-to-turn-illegal-hotel-into-apartments-in-mellieha/,06-11-2024,"000168.png,000169.png","Developer Joseph Portelli and his associates are attempting to reverse a court decision revoking the granting of an illegal permit by the Planning Authority for a hotel in Mellieha through a new application to sanction the building and turn it into more flats.
 A new application, PA 06672/24, presented by Mark Agius, known as Ta’ Dirjanu, has been filed on behalf of Shopwise Development M Ltd.
 Instead of issuing an enforcement order against the development, the Planning Authority is now considering the application, calling for objections until its case officer issues the recommendation – despite a Court order.
 The illegal hotel was built on a plot next to the former Belleview Bistro in Mellieha as part of a larger development.
 The developers used the hotel policy to build an additional two floors when this was not supposed to be permitted in a residential area. The Court ordered the revocation of the hotel permit granted by the Planning Authority.
 Portelli and his associates turned the large plot, which the government originally promised to the Mellieha local council, into a large residential development comprising more than 100 apartments.
 While the Planning Authority supported Portelli’s development by issuing a permit that violated the rules, the Gozitan developers finished the building as the Mellieha local council and others appealed the decision through legal channels.
 In 2023, the Appeals court, led by Chief Justice Mark Chetcuti, declared the hotel part of the development illegal, as it went against the local plan, and revoked its permit.
 The Court declared that since the area was residential, Portelli could not run a hotel there, let alone use a new policy to build more floors.
 Instead of enforcing the Court’s ruling, forcing Portelli to remove the extra two floors he built through an illegal permit, the Planning Authority did not issue an enforcement order, only imposing a daily fine.
 The Shift reported that in 2023, the developers were trying to sell the illegal hotel for over €4 million.
 After their pitch failed, they devised a new plan: to regulate their illegalities through a fresh sanctioning application.
 The Planning Authority still needs to issue its recommendation. Still, several objectors, including Din l-Art Helwa, have already told the Authority that this went against the court decision.
 This is not the first time Portelli has ignored a decision by the Chief Justice. Earlier this year, following another court decision declaring part of a development in Sannat illegal, Portelli, hiding behind some of his foreign workers, applied to sanction an illegal row of penthouses.
 Once again, the Planning Authority accepted his application and is considering issuing a permit, contrary to the Court’s decision. Portelli has already managed to get a Planning Authority permit in one case, openly defying the Court’s ruling.
 In the case of the Mellieha hotel, Portelli’s co-shareholders in the illegal building include his usual associates, Mark Agius and Daniel Refalo, as well as Peter Borg, the co-owner of the Welbees supermarket chain, which has one of its supermarkets next to the illegal development.

Further delays anticipated as surprise bids submitted for interconnector,theshiftnews,https://theshiftnews.com/2024/06/22/further-delays-anticipated-as-surprise-bids-submitted-for-interconnector/,22-06-2024,"000172.png,000173.png","The installation of a second electricity interconnector between Malta and Sicily, already delayed by a year, is expected to be delayed further.
 A multi-million-euro tender issued by the government has unexpectedly attracted bidders with no track record in the industry who submitted unrealistic bids in an attempt to be awarded the massive contract.
 While the tender has an indicative value of €68 million, a Sardinia-based Italian company, SELT S.P.A. – sistemi elettrici telefonici – has submitted a bid for just half the tender’s value – €34 million.
 The Shift is informed that this has raised eyebrows among the top executives of Interconnect Malta – the government entity responsible for the project’s execution.
 While the bid may look attractive to the Maltese taxpayer at first glance, sources at Interconnect Malta described it as “very suspicious” not only because the price is commercially unfeasible but also because of the company’s lack of experience in the field.
 They also said the bid is too low and impossible to achieve, and it may further delay the completion of the project given that the evaluation will take time and thorough due diligence will be required.
 According to the sources, SELT has never completed a project of the magnitude required for Malta’s interconnector.
 Meanwhile, another low bid was submitted by a Chinese company, Hengtong Optic-Electric Co Ltd – which, if chosen, may put Malta at loggerheads with the EU since the project is financed through EU funds.
 The tender is for laying some 25 kilometres of underground cable, both in Malta leading to the Maghtab land base and in Sicily leading to the base station in Ragusa.
 Although the work should be easier than when the first interconnector was laid, as the foundations for a second cable were already prepared by the PN administration in 2012, the job is of significant complexity.
 Five companies have submitted bids, with Bonnici Brothers being the only Maltese company in the competitive process. However, the company’s bid, at €64.3 million, is the most expensive, making it unlikely to be declared the winner.
 Enemalta has already awarded the same company a lucrative tender to install a temporary diesel-fired power plant in Delimara to compensate for the lack of energy availability caused by the delay in installing the second interconnector.
 In 2021, Energy Minister Miriam Dalli announced the government’s decision to increase Malta’s electricity capacity in response to rising demand. The chosen expansion option was the implementation of a second interconnector.
 Dalli had stated that the second interconnector was to be up and running by the summer of 2025.
 However, the Energy Minister’s plans have already gone awry. The installation of the interconnector is already 12 months behind schedule, and the latest complications with the new onshore works tender are expected to complicate matters further.
 Following last summer’s debacle, when the country was caught unprepared for increased demand, with consistent power cuts across the country for many days, Enemalta awarded a rushed €37 million tender to install a temporary power plant this summer.
 The emergency power plant, leased until the new interconnector is ready, will be supplied by Bonnici Brothers through a Saudi company and used only when the electricity produced locally and through the interconnector is insufficient to meet the demand.
 Instead of choosing a cleaner solution, including Liquified Natural Gas (LNG), already available at Delimara, the government opted for Bonnici’s diesel-fired plant, using one of the most polluting fuels on the market.
 Bonnici, who has no experience in the area, is closely connected to Prime Minister Robert Abela, who served as the company’s lawyer and was also in  business with its managing director, Gilbert Bonnici.
 Enemalta Chair Ryan Fava said the temporary plant had to be installed by last May, but this has not yet happened.
 In the meantime, Malta experienced its first nationwide power cut of the summer a few days ago, which, according to Minister Miriam Dalli, was caused by maintenance on the current interconnector.

"Valletta shop façade to be retained, years after being declared illegal",timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/valletta-shop-facade-stay-years-declared-illegal.1098562,26-09-2024,000194.png,"A Luqa man’s almost decade-long quest to have an illegally-built façade next door to his Valletta property removed has hit a new stumbling block, after courts decreed that the Planning Authority is not yet obliged to enforce its removal.
 The court’s decision, handed down by Mr Justice Giovanni Grixti on Tuesday, is the latest twist in a dispute between Anton Spiteri, a 64-year-old man from Luqa and Antoine Debono, who runs a jewellery shop in Valletta’s Zachary Street.
 In 2014, Debono was granted a planning permit to carry out some alterations to a small shop that he was renting from the Lands Authority. These changes included replacing the wooden shop front, a move that the case officer noted “would not normally be allowed in Valletta”, but was being approved in this case.
 Debono duly carried out the works, cladding the shop front in marble, but matters soon hit a stumbling block, when it emerged that the cladding encroached on Spiteri’s property next door, beyond what was allowed by the permit.
 What’s more, Debono had listed himself as the sole owner of the property when applying for a permit, failing to disclose that the land was owned by the government.
 After these breaches emerged, the PA imposed an enforcement notice, months after the works were carried out.
 Undeterred, Debono applied to have the already-built works sanctioned, with the case officer finding that the development ran counter to planning regulations.
 The sanctioning was initially refused in a November 2016 decision, only for the decision to later be overturned by the Environment and Planning Tribunal, which found that the difference between what was granted in the original permit and the works being sanctioned were “minimal”.
 Spiteri refused to take the matter lying down, opening court proceedings to have the permit declared illegal.
 Chief Justice Mark Chetcuti, who was overseeing the case, agreed, finding that Debono had never obtained permission from the Lands Authority to carry out the works.
 The permit was revoked in January 2020 but, as the months crept by, the illegally-built façade remained in place, despite Spiteri’s protestations.
 Spiteri once again took to the courts for a remedy, filing proceedings against the Planning Authority in January 2021 calling on it to enforce the court’s initial decision and have the façade removed.
 Throughout these new proceedings, PA officials argued that although an enforcement order against the development had been in place since 2016, with daily fines against Debono piling up, direct action such as the façade’s removal is a “last resort”.
 The PA is unable to resort to this direct action, PA officials argued, because of a pending civil case between Spiteri and Debono, this time over works in the property’s interior.
 Judge Grixti agreed, saying that although the courts had already declared the development illegal, they had not explicitly instructed the removal of the works “at this stage”.
 Meanwhile, the marble façade lives to see another day, almost five years after it was declared illegal.

Air Malta says delays were due to plane being withdrawn from service because of technical issue - The Malta Independent ,independent,https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2023-04-11/local-news/Air-Malta-says-delays-were-due-to-plane-being-withdrawn-from-service-because-of-technical-issue-6736251021,11-04-2023,000195.png,"

 Significant delays on some flights over the past days were due to an aircraft having to be withdrawn from service due to a technical issue, Air Malta said.
 ""Air Malta currently has one of its own aircraft in heavy maintenance through until mid-May 2023. Air Malta has planned to take delivery of two A320neo aircraft in early 2023. During this transition period of aircraft moving in and out of its fleet, it has been necessary to wet-lease two alternative aircraft to cover the scheduled flying. One of these wet-leased aircraft experienced a technical issue on the morning of Sunday 9th April, which resulted in it being withdrawn from service. Due to it being the peak Easter weekend, it was not possible to source a replacement aircraft from elsewhere, at such short timescales.""
 ""This shortage of one aircraft in the flying program unfortunately resulted in significant delays to the Zurich service on Sunday 9 April and also the Rome and Brussels services on Monday 10 April as well as the London Gatwick service on Tuesday 11 April,"" the airline said. As an example of one of the delays, it was reported in the press that a flight from Brussels landed in Malta at 7.25am on Tuesday, having been due at 10.40pm on Monday.
 The Air Malta 2023 Summer schedule has been designed to operate with eight aircraft units, all of which are fully crewed with the required number of pilots and cabin crew, the airline said.
 ""During Summer 2023 Air Malta will operate a very intense and expanded flying program of 155 weekly return direct services to 23 destinations. The withdrawal of an aircraft from the fleet for any period of time will have a knock-on effect on the rest of the flying program. At no point in time were the disruptions over Easter caused by either a shortage of pilots or cabin crew as reported in certain sections of the media. Air Malta has the correct flight deck and cabin crew complement to operate its entire Summer 2023 program.""
 ""Air Malta would like to apologise for any inconvenience caused to its customers during this very busy holiday period and is working hard to rectify the situation.""

Mistra site boundary walls dismantled as works hasten ahead of EPRT review,theshiftnews,https://theshiftnews.com/2023/09/09/mistra-site-boundary-walls-dismantled-as-works-hasten-ahead-of-eprt-review/,09-09-2023,000213.png,"Works at Mistra Village, Xemxija, to develop a nine-storey residential complex have been stepped up a notch as contractors have started dismantling boundary walls while cordoning off a three-metre buffer from the site for “safety” despite an ongoing planning appeal.
 The Planning Authority’s decision to renew permits for the 2008 project is still under review by the Environment and Planning Review Tribunal (EPRT) after the Court of Appeals revoked an earlier EPRT decision to dismiss residents’ objections.
 The project will now take up residents’ parking spaces in a move which independent politician Arnold Cassola has said is “really for the convenience of the contractor” in a post on social media.
 
 Speaking to The Shift, St Paul’s Bay Mayor Alfred Grima said the local council granted requests for hoarding permits – used when part of a public access way or council property needs fencing off for building works – in the area for “safety” reasons as requested by the contractors, Charles Camilleri’s Gemxija Crown Ltd.
 Grima said that the local council granted the permits, allowing for a “three-metre safety buffer” only once the Planning Authority assured them that all necessary permits for the works were in place.
 “Aside from whether we agree with the development itself or not, the law allows for it, so we granted the permits,” he said.
 The St Paul’s Bay Mayor also said that Camilleri was claiming that a substantial section of Triq Raddett ir-Roti on which the development was taking place was actually his private property.
 He also said the developer was previously open to negotiations to increase the height of his project in return for a section of the land to be given back as public space in line with the floor-to-area ratio policy.
 Last month, The Shift reported how ongoing excavation works at the Mistra Village site are causing “constant mental stress” for people in neighbouring areas. The Shift also reported how a Malta Tourism Authority scheme banning excavation and construction works in touristic areas was  amended this year to allow the Mistra Village works to continue.
 Last May, Chief Justice Mark Chetcuti ruled at the Court of Appeal that an EPRT decision to dismiss an appeal by residents contesting the renewal of the development’s permit must be re-evaluated.
 The EPRT was to look at whether the area was already committed to high-rise developments and if it was compatible with current laws and planning policies. The tribunal accepted a site visit requested by the residents in July, but it has not yet been done.
 The residents’ lawyer told The Shift that the developers have expedited works on the site before the visit to prove the commitment called for by the courts, placing residents in “a fight against time”.
 Last week, The Shift reported how Prime Minister Robert Abela refused to answer questions on a commitment made in his Worker’s Day speech in May to address the issue of construction and excavation works continuing while under court appeal or being heard by the EPRT.
 Abela kept mum on whether the promised change would be introduced despite rhetorically asking his supporters whether it “makes sense that planning laws allow developments to continue when the permit for that development is still being contested at the tribunal or courts”.

         Malta International Airport has released its flight schedule for the upcoming autumn-winter season, offering 109 direct connections to destinations across Europe and the Middle East.
 The most notable additions to the schedule, which may be accessed here, include the commencement of thrice-weekly operations to Dublin by a new airline for our airport, Irish flag carrier Aer Lingus, and the extension of Eurowings' Dusseldorf route into winter.  The launch of the schedule comes on the back of another strong month for Malta International airport, as passenger traffic continued to exhibit an upward trend in September to total 896,471 arrivals and departures, increasing by 10.4 per cent over 2023. Travel peaked early in the month, with the busiest day falling on Sunday 1
 While seat capacity deployed by airlines climbed 9.1 per cent over the preceding year, the seat load factor (SLF) stood at an all-time high for September at 90.2 per cent, reflecting strong occupancy rates on flights to and from Malta.
 With a market share of over 23 per cent, Italy continued to top the market leaderboard, with the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Poland following suit. While four out of the five top-performing markets for September outperformed their respective 2023 results, France was the only market to fall just 2.9 per cent short of reaching last year's levels, due to aircraft operating with fewer seats and a minimal drop in SLF.

"PN welcomes second interconnector plans, says its long-term vision vindicated - The Malta Independent ",independent,https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2023-08-26/local-news/PN-welcomes-second-interconnector-plans-says-its-long-term-vision-vindicated-6736254383,26-08-2023,000289.png,"

 The Nationalist Party has welcomed the approval of plans for a second energy interconnectors that links Malta to Sicily.
 It confirms the long-term vision the PN had had when it worked to install the first interconnector, the party said through its spokesman on energy Mark Anthony Sammut.
 The second interconnector was also listed as part of the PN’s strategy for energy in a document it compiled in 2021.
 The Labour government had not chosen the “road of corruption” when it came to improving the energy supply, as it had done when it was elected in 2013 with the LNG project.

 Earlier this year, MaltaToday revealed that a planning application for a restaurant on top of the Basilica had been filed, sparking controversy and leading to a  scaling back of the project.  The Superintendence for Cultural Heritage also filed an objection to the plans last month.
  In a statement issued by the Archdiocese this morning, it was announced that the project could continue thanks to a substantial cash injection from the government.
 Fr Marc André Camilleri said that following meetings with ministers Byron Camilleri and Owen Bonnici, it was agreed that the government would commit €400,000 to the project.
 The parish priest said that since funding had been secured, the parish church would be using the portico as a viewing platform for visitors and as a location for events and other fundraising activities.
 The planned cafeteria will now be located at ground level.
 Fr Camilleri said: “This agreement is a win-win. The parish secures its objective of restoring the portico while visitors will get to enjoy the spectacular view from the roof. While the cafeteria will be located at ground level, we have achieved our overarching aim to make the maintenance of the church more sustainable”.
 The parish has already embarked upon restoration works and intends to complete the project next year.

Plans filed for 66-unit residential block on undeveloped land in Fgura - The Malta Independent ,independent,https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2024-11-20/local-news/Plans-filed-for-66-unit-residential-block-on-undeveloped-land-in-Fgura-6736265886,20-11-2024,000309.png,"
                
        

         Plans have been filed with the Planning Authority for the development of a 66-unit residential block on undeveloped land on the outskirts of Fgura.
 The development is situated in a vacant plot of land off Triq id-Dejma and Triq il-Merhba in Fgura. 
 The site used to be an Outside Development Zone, but it was included within the rationalisation process in 2006 that saw ODZ land become developable.
 18 years later though it still remains vacant, with the developer listing its use as a ""scrapyard."" This would be the first development to take place in the rationalised area after a Planning Control application establishing the zoning, building heights and land use was approved last July.  The applicant Christian Brincat is seeking permission to excavate and construct 74 basement garages at basement level -2 and -1, 8 maisonettes, 48 apartments split across ground, first, second and third floor level and 10 penthouses at a receded floor level.
 The site in question measures 1,548 square metres and it is situated between Fgura's residential zone and an industrial area.
 The Fgura Local Council registered its objection to the plans, noting that it had also objected to the original Planning Control application as well.
 The council said that ""the area is predominantly terraced houses which do not exceed three floors (including the washrooms and ground floor) and this development is proposing to go two further floors above.""
 It did note however that in another street close by there are similar existing developments at the same height of what is being proposed in the application.
 The Superintendence of Cultural Heritage noted that a pre-1968 military grade hut exists on the site, but observed that it ""is in a very advanced stage of deterioration and is no longer within its related context.""
 It observed that it would generally request that such cultural heritage features be retained or relocated - and if feasible particularly that the hut should be kept on site and restored.  If it is deemed unfeasible though, the applicant must settle a Heritage Obligation to compensate for its loss.
 ""The Superintendence is only considering the latter solution in view that the context of the site has been lost and in view of the hut's deteriorated state,"" it said.
 The application is currently awaiting a recommendation from the Planning Authority's case officer, after which point it will be considered by the authority.

Y-plate regulations to be reviewed after less than a year,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/national/128913/yplate_regulations_to_be_reviewed_after_less_than_a_year,29-04-2024,000310.png,"The Y-plate law will be revisited to ensure a fairer system for commuters and drivers, Transport Minister Chris Bonnet told parliament on Monday.
 “Where needed we will revisit the law to ensure there is more respect on our roads, be them users or not of Y-plate vehicles,” the minister told the House.
 The minister was replying to a parliamentary question by Nationalist MP Mark Anthony Sammut on a MaltaToday report which revealed drivers of Y-plate cars are using the parking facilities of Lidl supermarkets to park their vehicles in what appears to be a way of circumventing existing rules.
  The minister said the transport authority is aware of what is happening and is investigating the case. He said that “while it is not an excuse” Transport Malta enforcement officials work within the parameters of the law.
 He stated the ministry finds no issue with going back to the law and ensuring it is finetuned to ensure a fairer and more respectful system.
 Last October, Transport Malta (TM) announced new regulations aimed at operators who have five or more vehicles in their fleet in a bid to curb abuse in the sector. These operators must keep their vehicles garaged in a commercial garage when not in use, not a residential garage.
 Last year, MaltaToday reported that scores of operators within the cab industry were illegally parking their vehicles overnight in a variety of public locations across Malta. Others were also parking their cars in fields and supermarket parking spaces, a practice that does not conform to the law.
 Operators must prove that the off-street parking space or garage used by them is reserved solely for their registered vehicles.
 TM gave operators 12 months from the commencement date to abide by the regulations if they hold a valid operator licence or an application for the issuance of a licence is still pending.
 MaltaToday understands that the Y-plate vehicles found in supermarket parking lots belong to various operators. Most of the vehicles belong to fleet operators with more than five vehicles.  ",Karl Azzopardi ,Infrastructure

 The restored structures were jointly inaugurated by Health Minister Jo Etienne Abela and Archbishop Charles Scicluna.
 The Addolorata Cemetery is Malta’s largest cemetery and was designed by architect Emmanuele Luigi Galizia. It was inaugurated in 1869. While it is open to burials of all religions, the vast majority of graves are Catholic ones.
  Restoration works began in 2019 and targeted all of its main structures, from its principal chapel to the Gatt Chapel, a private family chapel that was left for the government to maintain by the last heir of the Gatt family.
 A fountain, well and various monuments within the cemetery, including one dedicated to the Sette Giugno riots, were also restored.
  Minister Abela thanked workers from the Foundation of Medical Services and Superintendence of Public Health, which jointly coordinated the restoration works.
 
 Archbishop Scicluna said he hoped all those who visit the restored cemetery “will feel the relief of our faith in the resurrection. I thank the government and Foundation for Medical Services for the investment and work they have done here.”

New National Archives building at Ta’ Qali scuppered for car park despite deed,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/national/129869/new_national_archives_building_at_ta_qali_scuppered_for_car_park_despite_deed,29-06-2024,000341.png,"An electoral manifesto pledge to site a new National Archives institute at Ta’ Qali – uncommonly supported by both sides of the political divide – was brusquely swept into the trashcan, despite a land deed transferring the land to the National Archives.
 The National Archives was accorded the land in a 2019 deed signed by three ministers, but since then the planned project was overtaken by the Ta’ Qali concert venue built in place of an old concrete factory.
  Now the government has been forced to seek new storage space that can guarantee 5,000 linear metres of shelving for the National Archives’ holdings, which are currently held at the Santu Spirtu in Rabat, a premises that is not suitable for the storage of such precious archives, and six other buildings.
 A preliminary market consultation is requesting proposals from the private sector for the loading and transportation of the archives, as well as barcoding and storage of 3,000 linear metres of shelving, which could increase to a maximum 5,000 metres.
 It is a tall order for the service provider, who will have to also provide the National Archives with an online portal that provides real-time information on the status of the archived records, apart from the facility of requesting records through the same.
 Nobody is more disappointed about the foiled plans for the new National Archives, than Chief Archivist Charles J. Farrugia, who rued the time and energy spent at arriving at a concept and design for the Ta’ Qali archives hub, in collaboration with the French national archives.
 The prospective new National Archives building would have centralised all services in a state-of-the-art and purposely built repository, housing also the National Audio-Visual Institute (NAVI) for Malta’s audio-visual heritage.
 “All these dreams faded away when the Ta’ Qali site was unceremoniously ‘taken over’,” Farrugia noted in an annual report for the National Archives, which came with a severe warning.
 “The future of the new national archive building depends on the identification by government of a new site for the project. Until then, we will continue investing in our network of current buildings that with the notarial registers’ archive will comprise seven repositories. We may keep adding to the repositories but in the long run the system risks collapsing.”
 Farrugia said that the physical and intellectual control, or the development of IT services for patrons could never be fully achieved through the current fragmentation of the archives into buildings that do not even offer the basic minimum climatic conditions.
 “The need of a new national archives is not in any way inspired by a desire for an architectural statement. Obviously, it would be a pity if our country does not invest in a design that makes a clear statement towards culture, openness, and accountability in building its national archives.
 “But independently of this, the new national archives premises, building on the new records management culture instilled in this country, is crucial for our country’s soul, memory, and identity,” Farrugia said.
 As things stand, the Maltese national archives are now supported by public departments and entities who are applying retention policies on their documents. But such is the scale of the public administration system, that Farrugia says every new year brings with it the need for 1 kilometre of additional storage space.
 “Fragmented space is not only costly but risky and will hamper the process of adequate cataloguing and opening to the public,” Farrugia said.
 Original plans for the new National Archives were started with the transfer of public land in Ta’ Qali in 2019, by then-education minister Evarist Bartolo and infrastructure minister Ian Borg. The Santu Spirtu building, where the National Archives are currently situated, was to be turned into the first museum on the history of medicine in Malta.
 Despite lip service towards the “historic” step in conserving the country’s national memory, much of these plans fell instantly by the wayside when the same Ta’ Qali site started being developed into a 500-car multi-level parking site near the basketball pavilion.
 Malta now lacks a proper centralised national archives system that can guarantee longevity to the many public records stored in various buildings, a problem that itself has a long history: in 1944, the British archivist Sir Hilary Jenkinson arrived in Malta after having assessed the state of archives in Italy during the Second World War. His recommendations for Malta’s public records system included the building of appropriate premises for the documents.
 Charles J. Farrugia notes just one silver lining in this episode of an 80-year saga for a new building.
 “The silver lining in this story is that the current government is still committed to deliver on its electoral promise of building a national archive that will cater for the traditional and new media and that it will cater for current and future needs. We will keep insisting for this to happen and prepare all the reporting needed to have a state-of-the art facility,” he noted in his last annual report.  ",Matthew Vella ,Infrastructure

         The Gozo Chamber of Advocates is insisting that the relevant authorities should take the appropriate decisions without further delay and identify a suitable site to host the Gozo Court building, the Chamber said in a statement on Monday.
 It said that lawyers in Gozo have noted with regret that another forensic year is beginning without a solution having been found for what it described as the acute problem of lack of space in the present Gozo Courts. It also spoke of how the current building is inaccessible for certain people, such as the elderly and persons with disabilities.  The Chamber said that several proposals have been made over the years for an alternative site, and it remarked that the Planning Authority has even issued permits ""at a great cost to the public treasury"", but that no proposal has ever been carried out.
 It said that in January 2023, the Court Services Agency had made a call for proposals to identify an alternative location for the Gozo Court, but that no one knows what the outcome of the call was. The Chamber continued that it does not seem as if any particular site has been identified to serve the function of a court building.
 The Gozo Chamber of Advocates added that a site in a central location at Rabat, Gozo which had been identified as a space for the court building will now be developed only as a parking lot. It commented that the original proposal included extensive facilities for parking.
 The Chamber concluded that a new Gozo Court building would provide better and more dignified service for the people of Gozo and all others who would make use of the building.

PA refuses to renew permit close to Grade 2 building in Marsaxlokk - The Malta Independent ,independent,https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2023-08-09/local-news/PA-refuses-to-renew-permit-close-to-Grade-2-building-in-Marsaxlokk-6736253978,09-08-2023,000401.png,"

 The Planning Authority said Wednesday it has refused to renew a development permit for the construction of a residential block for 8 apartments and underlying garages on a vacant plot of land in Triq Abdosir in Marsaxlokk which is near a Grade 2 Protected Building.
 The Planning Commission cited that the site’s constraints had changed since the development permit had been issued in July 2018.
 In fact, in 2020, the Authority had issued clear guidelines calling for special attention to be given when evaluating development proposals in close proximity to scheduled buildings. These guidelines now became mandatory with the renewal of this development permission since the site is only 10 metres away from Villa Agius Catania which is a scheduled at Grade 2.
 The authority said it believes that the setting around a protected building is an essential part of the building and the way in which it is experienced. It is the area in which the building is perceived and is therefore a constituent part of the building’s value.
 Built as a neoclassical residential property, the authority had scheduled Villa Agius Catania as a Grade 2 building back in 1994.

Government faces backlash in Birzebbuga over development of LPG plant,theshiftnews,https://theshiftnews.com/2023/11/09/government-faces-backlash-in-birzebbuga-over-development-of-lpg-plant/,09-11-2023,"000403.png,000404.png","The government is facing strong opposition from local council members and hundreds of residents over plans to turn public land on the Birzebbuga seafront into private residential and commercial units.
 The Shift recently revealed that Paul Attard, a shareholder of GAP Developments and secretary at the Malta Developer’s Association (MDA), applied for the re-zoning of the former Enemalta LPG facilitate in Qajjenza to turn it into six blocks of apartments and commercial premises.
 The application was made without Attard owning the plot of land the proposed development will occupy.
 The Labour-led Birzebbuga Local Council said they would oppose the development, and comments on social media have warned Ministers Miriam Dalli and Stefan Zrinzo Azzopardi, elected from that locality, that they will lose votes if they do not consider the needs of their constituents.
 Following an urgent meeting, the council released a statement saying it will formally oppose PC0022/23 submitted by Attard and his architect Stephen Vancell, as this will have detrimental consequences on the locality.
 The council insisted that the public land be kept for general use and transformed into an open green space, as no more flats are needed in the locality.
 Warning that it would vehemently oppose the application, the council called upon the government to shelve the idea.
 Hundreds of objections from residents have already been submitted to the Planning Authority, many calling on Dalli, responsible for the environment, to stop what some have called “an atrocity”.
 Many also questioned how this public land could be included in an application for private development when it was the property of the state entity, Enemalta.
 So far, Dalli, also responsible for Enemalta, has been silent on the matter and has not answered any questions posed by the media.
 Instead, in a reply to a parliamentary question by Nationalist Party MP Stanley Zammit, Dalli insisted that “Enemalta has no intention of selling the land”.
 She did not mention to parliament that for Attard’s application to proceed, he must have Enemalta and Dalli’s approval.
 Lands Minister Silvio Schembri was more straightforward in his answer, admitting that the Lands Authority, which owns 14% of the plot, has given its consent to the MDA’s secretary general to file his application.
 However, he insisted that the land had not been transferred to Attard.
 Sources at the Lands Authority told The Shift that for Attard to take over public land, he must either participate in a tender or a parliamentary motion, which parliament should approve.
 A tender can be issued with a “right of first refusal” clause so that those who already own land adjacent to the public lot will have the right to purchase it.
 Sources said that this will “probably happen again to accommodate Attard”.
 The developer, who has applied through his company Katari Developments, told The Shift that his application is not for development but for re-zoning, recognising that he does not currently own the land.
 According to the local plan, the area can only be developed up to a height of four storeys. However, Attard wants the Planning Authority to permit him to build blocks totalling eight floors.
 Attard is considered close to the current administration, particularly to Prime Minister Robert Abela and members of his private secretariat.
 The property development businessman was already the recipient of questionable deals involving public land in the past years, most recently involving a large public green lung in the area of il-Qortin in Mellieha, which he will turn into apartments.
 The Lands Authority tender was awarded to Attard despite his bid being far below current market prices.

Naxxar local council objects to ‘outrageous’ application for elderly home on ODZ farmland - The Malta Independent ,independent,https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2024-09-26/local-news/Naxxar-local-council-objects-to-outrageous-application-for-elderly-home-on-ODZ-farmland-6736264395,26-09-2024,000442.png,"
                
        

         The Naxxar Local Council has vehemently objected to an ""outrageous"" application for an elderly home and 104-car parking area to be built on rural, Outside Development Zone farmland.
 The application proposes an elderly care home on 9,325 square metres of farmland along Triq Wied Anglu and Triq il-Vittmi tan-Nar in Naxxar, in an area which is close to the Victoria Lines and Birguma Quarry and overlooks the Gharghur countryside.
 The home is proposed to consist of 70 rooms spread across three above ground floors and two basement levels, together with underground parking.  The application was filed by Arthur Tonna, with Charles Buhagiar - who is a former Labour MP and currently the chair of the Building and Construction Consultative Council, which advises the government on construction-related issues - as the project architect.
 The application has attracted hundreds of objections, with the Naxxar Local Council among them.
 ""This application egregiously disregards national and international environmental protection policies, violates fundamental planning laws, and breaches procedural safeguards established to protect Malta's rural landscape from unsustainable development,"" the local council said in its objection letter, filed with the Planning Authority on Wednesday.
 The council said that the application breaches the Strategic Plan for the Environment and Development (SPED), the Central Malta Local Plan, the Rural Policy and Design Guidance, several procedural requirements of Development Planning Regulations, and European Union and International Environmental Regulations.
 The council argued that it breached the SPED because the policy mandates the protection of rural areas from urban encroachment and the applicant ""has not provided any site selection exercise, nor have they justified why this development, typically suited for an urban area, is being proposed in an ODZ.""
 It further argued that the SPED dictates that elderly care facilities must be sited in urban locations to ensure accessibility to essential services and transport.  ""The proposed development's location in a remote rural area, far removed from services, undermines this policy, contributing to urban sprawl and placing undue pressure on Malta's rural landscape"" the council observed.
 The council stated that the plans will ""significantly alter the rural character of the area, introducing urban features that are incompatible with the surrounding environment"" and also risking an urban sprawl which will threaten the preservation of rural land that is ""critical for both agriculture and biodiversity.""
 The council continued by saying that the applicant had not presented all the necessary documentation - such as a site selection exercise, environmental impact assessment, or biodiversity surveys, had not presented a justification as to why the application is being planned for ODZ land, and had not notified and engaged with stakeholders - such as the council itself - about the development.
 The council said that as a result of the aforementioned reasons it ""unequivocally opposes"" the development.
 ""The proposed elderly care home in ODZ not only represents an unjustified intrusion into a protected rural area but also undermines the very foundations of sustainable development and environmental protection that Malta is committed to upholding,"" it said.
 The council reserved the right to challenge the application at the Planning Tribunal, in Malta's courts and, if necessary ""in international fora to ensure that the integrity of Malta's planning laws and environmental obligations are upheld.""
 Besides the Naxxar Local Council's objection, over 500 representations have been filed by members of the public against the proposed project as well.
 The Planning Authority has already approved two elderly homes in ODZ areas in Naxxar in the last seven years, with the most recent being one proposed by PL local councillor Marlon Brincat instead of an abandoned far, less than half a kilometre away from this application.
 That application was approved, but the decision has been appealed by environmental NGOs.

Third party vote: Strong but not enough to break the ceiling,maltatoday,https://maltatoday.com/news/ewropej/129667/third_party_vote_strong_but_not_enough_to_break_the_ceiling,10-06-2024,000456.png,"More than a tenth of voters in MEP elections opted for an assortment of independent candidates and third parties, denying an absolute majority to the two dominant parties.
 Compared to 2019 the third-party vote has increased from 20,334 votes (7.8%) to 33,498 votes (12.7%)
 Arnold Cassola also emerged as the clear front runner in the third-party camp with the support of nearly 13,000 voters, a result which placed him in third place in terms of first count votes but which was not enough to break the ceiling to get elected in the final count. 
 This was a significant improvement for Cassola over 2019 when he first contested as an independent garnering 2,127 votes. But the result was still a far cry from the 23,000 he garnered as an AD candidate in 2004 in a less crowded third party field one year after the EU membership referendum in which his party was a protagonist.
 It remains to be seen whether Cassola’s strong showing will serve as a catalyst for the creation of a new effective third party or whether his failure to get elected would further demoralise voters whose dream was shattered by the unbreakable block vote in both major parties when it comes to vote transfers. Despite failing to break the ceiling, Cassola managed to increase his vote to 22,941 before being eliminated on the 34th count.
 And despite not inheriting enough votes to get elected, Cassola has left a definitive mark in these elections, thanks to a slick campaign which projected him as a competent and inspiring politician who appeals to middle of the road voters, greens and progressives. Cassola’s ability to appeal to a broad church may be one of the reasons behind his success.
 From socialist rebel to conservative voice
 The other surprise of this election was Conrad Borg Manche who on his own garnered 5,936 votes and has nearly the same level of support as Norman Lowell.
 Manche, a former Labour mayor of Gzira, had shot to fame first by teaming up with Graffitti to reclaim the coastline of Manoel island for bathers and then by standing up against the central government’s attempt to transfer the public ownership of garden space for the development of a fuel station. In this way he may well have attracted Labour voters disgusted by their party’s subservience to the business lobby.
 But his  regressive  stance on various social issues, which ultimately pushed him to declare allegiance to the European Conservative and Reformist grouping, could have also endeared him to a segment of traditional conservative voters including Labour voters who never wholly accepted Labour’s progressive platform.
 Still, it remains to be seen whether Manche owes his support to his well-known environmental militancy and popularity in Gzira or to his conservative positions with which most people became acquainted during the past few weeks of the campaign.
 Eggs on their face
 With the exception of Manche, MEP elections turned out to be a big disappointment for other conservative candidates, including conspiracy theorists like Simon Mercieca (232 votes) and the Ivan Grech Mintoff (220 votes) whose egg throwing stunts and odd cocktail of anti LGBTIQ  and pro neutrality agenda failed to pay off.
 It was an equally disappointing night for Edwin Vassallo, a former PN junior minister and Mosta mayor best known for being the only MP to vote against marriage equality in 2017. Vassallo's solo run in the MEP election saw him obtain 717 votes.  
 One reason for this could be that traditionalist voters are also less inclined to vote for a third party. This also explains why Norman Lowell, a self-avowed racialist and white supremacist who appeals to anti-establishment voters, remains the most popular right wing candidate.
 However, this time around Lowell saw his vote shrink from a record 8,238 votes in 2019 to 6,816 votes. The 2024 result is just a bit higher than the 6,761 votes he garnered in 2014. It is the first time Lowell has experienced a decrease in votes ever since contesting the first MEP election in 2004.
 This year, despite presenting himself as some sort of prophet who predicted the influx of migrants, Lowell failed to capitalise on public concern over foreign workers. This may be an indication that the appeal of Lowell’s bizarre extremism is limited to a small segment of the population. This raises the question whether Lowell’s extremism is actually an impediment for the growth of a more mainstream right wing party.
 Minus 3,637 for AD+PD
 On the left side of the spectrum, it was another disappointing night for AD+PD whose four candidates collectively garnered 3,505 votes. This represents 3,637 less than the total sum of AD and PD in 2019 when the parties ran separately. The party was eclipsed by Cassola’s stature and ability to keep the dream of a third party breakthrough alive.  
 In the past, the greens have shown a remarkable ability to ignore negative results and press ahead from one disappointment to the next but some serious thinking is now due on the future of a party whose brand may be well past its expiry date. Much will depend on whether the party will manage to elect any councillors in local elections held concurrently with the MEP election. Nonetheless, the writing is on the wall for a tired and uninspiring Green Party.  ",James Debono ,Infrastructure
