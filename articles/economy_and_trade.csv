Non-EU workers applying for tourism skills pass 'not up to standard': ITS boss,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/noneu-workers-applying-tourism-skills-pass-not-standard-its-boss.1096249,08-02-2024,000270.png,"Non-EU workers applying for a tourism skills pass to work in the hospitality sector are “not up to standard” and many fail the course, the head of the Institute of Tourism Studies said on Friday.
 Pierre Fenech told a conference on tourism that the performance of non-EU workers at tests needed to obtain the sills cards was “shocking”. 
 “Some [candidates] pass phase one of the test but a large number fail phase two,” he said.
 Fenech was referring to skills cards that cost non-EU workers applying for jobs within the tourism sector €474.
 To obtain it, candidates need to enrol for a course. While the first part of the course consists of a hospitality online course, for the second part they have to sit for an in-person test. 
 
 “The candidates are not up to standard. If I were running a hotel or catering establishment, and one of these people applied to work for me, they would not last two minutes,” he continued. 
 “The situation after COVID was desperate and we needed more human resources, however, we cannot continue like this, especially if we want to attract high-quality tourists.”
 When Times of Malta asked for more details about the applicants, Fenech said ITS would reveal the full figures in a press conference in the coming weeks 
 He clarified that applicants who were already working in Malta have already passed the first phase of the course.
 Originally due to be launched in January, the introduction of the pass had been postponed to May over concern by the  Malta Hotels and Restaurants Association.
 On Friday, hoteliers and employers said the course might push away workers from a sector that needed them.
 One employer said the questions were more adequate for management students rather than those applying for housekeeping and dishwashing jobs.
 “These workers are in a state of panic. I feel sorry for them as they cannot answer the questions,” she said. 
 Fenech said the course was “simple” and students could answer questions after spending a couple of hours following the course.

 The biggest group was made up of tourists aged up to 24 (39.9 per cent), followed by those in the 25-44 age bracket (33.0 per cent). In 2023 the biggest age group was between 25-44 years old while the two lower age groups were about equal in 2022.
 Italian, British, and French tourists made up 48.5 per cent of total arrivals.
 Total nights spent went up by 9.8 per cent when compared to July 2023, reaching almost 2.8 million nights. The largest share of guest nights (89.2 per cent) was spent in rented accommodation establishments .
 The average length of stay of total inbound tourists was  7.2 nights.
 Total tourist expenditure amounted to almost €403.9 million, an increase of 20.7 per cent over the corresponding month in 2023. The average expenditure per night was estimated at €145.2.

 As of May, non-EU hotel, bar, and restaurant workers have been required to hold a skills card that costs €475 to work in the sector. 
 On Monday, the head of ITS, Pierre Fenech gave an overview of the candidates and results of the Skills Pass tests in the past three months.
  He told a press conference that up to last week, the biggest percentage of candidates who applied for the Skills Card were from Nepal (29%), followed by  India (25%). There were 9% from Colombia, 8% from Philippines and 4% from Pakistan. The rest came from various other countries. 
 44% of those who applied for the Skills Pass had been working in Malta for over a year. The rest are not currently working here.
 
 To obtain the pass, candidates must sit through two examinations. 
 Phase 1 consists of an English test, including ‘Essential English for hospitality’ and a ‘basic Maltese tourism product’ test, where the candidates are tested about Maltese history, culture, traditions and tourist attractions. 
 887 certificates have been issued so far for phase 1 and 885 candidates are sitting for their Phase 1 exam.
 In Phase 2, candidates must sit through interviews, either held virtually at ITS or in a centre in their home country. During the interview, the candidate must pass an English language test and practical skills assessments tailored to the candidate’s chosen job. 
 The exam is 30 minutes long, and the assessor is provided a set of questions at the beginning of the exam. Questions are chosen randomly by computer and candidates are questioned on the topics taught in Phase 1 and basic general questions.
 Candidates who have been living in Malta for more than one year are excluded from sitting for Phase 2.
 According to the data, 99% of candidates passed Phase 1, unlike the 50% of candidates who failed Phase 2. .
  When asked about the failure rate, Fenech said this was due to candidates not knowing the language or their chosen occupation well enough. 
 Overall, 1,233 Skills Pass certificates have been issued in the past three months. That includes certificates issued for candidates who only sat for Phase 1 and those who sat for both phases.  
 Fenech said that 6% of candidates were suspended after they were caught cheating. Some tried to do the test with someone else, looked up answers on their phone or blocked the camera monitoring them. They will need to reapply.
 When asked what feedback ITS has received, Fenech said candidates had commented positively on the Maltese Tourism Product course, and that many said they found it useful for living and working in Malta.

Malta is planning to regulate Airbnb rentals. What have other places done?,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/malta-planning-regulate-airbnb-rentals-what-places-done.1101160,19-11-2024,002223.png,"This week marked Malta’s first foray into the struggle to rein in short-term tourist rentals, with the tourism authority hinting at plans that would require would-be tenants to seek approval from their condominium neighbours.
 Reactions to the news were predictably mixed, ranging from those arguing that the move will hurt homeowners and the housing market, to others saying the plans do not go far enough to solve the problems caused by short-term rentals.
 As Malta finally begins to grapple with the question of how to balance its tourism industry with the peace of mind of its residents, it would do well to look into how some of its European neighbours are trying to tackle the situation.
 MTA’s plans appear to be modelled on Turkey, which introduced new rules late last year in the hope of clamping down on unregulated rentals.
 The rules say that anybody thinking of renting out a property first needs to get unanimous approval from all the other apartment owners in their block before they are given a permit.
 Even if they are given a permit, they can only rent the property out for a maximum of 100 days in a year.
 They would also need to stick a sign at the property’s entrance, clearly marking it out as a rental property.
 And if other apartments in the block are already being used as short-term rentals, they may be out of luck entirely – only 25 per cent of apartments in buildings with more than three units can be used for tourist accommodation (unless a single person owns the entire block).
 Other countries have adopted altogether more draconian measures.
 Barcelona famously vowed to ban Airbnb altogether over the next five years, promising to stop renewing the licences for its 10,000 tourist apartments until there are none left in 2029.
 Several other Spanish tourism hotspots, including Mallorca and  Malaga, will be keeping a close eye on Barcelona, as their own residents push back against overtourism, with the latter now only issuing licences to properties that have their own separate street entrance.
 Florence, where every third home in the city centre is listed on Airbnb, is also following in Barcelona’s footsteps, banning all new listings altogether, with  Venice also likely to follow suit.
 Meanwhile, residents in a neighbourhood in Budapest recently voted to ban short-term rentals in the district from 2026, with the national government saying it is mulling a moratorium on all Airbnb licences while it gets its thoughts in order.
 But outright bans are notoriously difficult to implement.
 Berlin, the first European city to introduce a city-wide Airbnb ban back in 2016, had to row back on its plans just two years later, despite studies showing that the ban successfully cut down on tourism rentals and increased housing supply.
 In place of the ban, Berlin introduced a series of rules that allowed people to rent out their second property for up to 90 days in a year, upping fines for rule-breakers to a staggering €500,000.
 Portugal, too, reversed its plans to stop issuing licences for short-term rentals in many urban areas. The plans had been introduced after local communities piled pressure on authorities to tackle the issue but, just a few months (and one change in government) later, the rules were scrapped altogether, much to Airbnb’s delight.
 Several other cities and countries around the world have tiptoed their way around a blanket ban, instead implementing rules that make it increasingly difficult for landlords to list their property on Airbnb.
 Some have gone down the route of introducing upper limits on for how long a property can be rented out, ranging from just 30 days in a year in Amsterdam, to 90 days in  London and  Austria, and 120 days in Paris.
 Others have gone in the opposite direction, imposing a minimum rental period in a bid to effectively kill off short-term rentals.
 In Singapore, a property can now only be rented out for a minimum three-month period, effectively killing the short-term rental market entirely. The Hawaiian city of  Honolulu introduced a similar 90-day minimum rental period in its tourist hotspots.
 Some, such as New York, have adopted a more creative approach.
 The city introduced a controversial new law last year saying that a property can only be registered for rental if the owner physically shares the living quarters for the duration of the rent and, even then, to no more than two guests at any one time.
 But whether or not the rules have been successful in improving the city’s housing market remains up for debate. Critics say that although short-term rentals plummeted as soon as the rules were introduced, long-term rental prices continued to increase, with the city’s hotels licking their lips as they watch their profits rise.
 Meanwhile, Marseille’s mayor is pushing for laws which would oblige Airbnb landlords to buy another property in the city which they would then put up for long-term rental to increase housing supply in the city.
 How Malta will implement its own short-term rentals rules remains to be seen.
 Current rules state that anybody who wants to rent out their property as a holiday home needs to be licensed by the Malta Tourism Authority.
 Last summer, MTA had over 6,000 licensed properties on its books, a little over a fifth of them in Gozo.
 But MTA figures suggest that this is likely to increase, with over 1,100 new applications for licences received in the first eight months of 2024 alone, as many as in all of 2023.

Skills Pass tax credit for employers who want to retain non-EU workers,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/skills-pass-tax-credit-employers-want-retain-noneu-workers.1093166,29-05-2024,002298.png,"Tourism and hospitality employers can apply for a 'subsidy' that covers up to 50% of the fee linked to the Skills Pass card for non-EU workers. 
 Non-EU workers in hotels, bars, and restaurants need a skills card costing €475 to work in the tourism sector. As of this month, the Skills Pass is mandatory.
 The 'subsidy' scheme, called Skills Pass Support, was launched on Tuesday through a collaboration between Malta Enterprise and the Institute of Tourism Studies (ITS).
 The initiative is meant to make the Skills Pass more accessible to existing employees in the high-demand industry.
 The 'subsidy' will take the form of a tax credit for employers who apply for the card on behalf of their non-EU workers.
 “By covering part of the financial obligation associated with the Skills Pass, this scheme seeks to foster a more competent and competitive workforce, ultimately contributing to the overall growth, sustainability and quality of this key local industry,” Malta Enterprise and ITS said in a statement. 
 ITS and Malta Enterprise will host an information session about the scheme on June 4 at 10am.
 The session will provide insights into the application process, eligibility criteria and benefits of the scheme.
 Business owners and managers interested in attending the webinar can register by June 3.
 
 The pass, which was originally due for introduction in January, was postponed following concern by the  Malta Hotels and Restaurants Association.
 MHRA had said there was too little time for the industry to comply with the requirements.
 Meanwhile, according to a survey by the Gozo Tourism Association, two-thirds of Gozitan employers said they were not prepared to fork out the costs for the skills card. 
 Non-EU workers seeking jobs in the tourism and hospitality industry can apply for the mandatory online course in English language proficiency, customer care, hospitality and what Malta offers tourists. 
 It will be taught by two artificial intelligence personas called 'Ryan' and 'Clara' and will be needed for work in hotels, bars, restaurants, kitchen staff, housekeeping and front office posts.
 Candidates will also need to be approved by Jobsplus and the police before receiving a one-year work permit.
 By January 2025, any tourism and hospitality workers already working in Malta, and who want to renew their work permit will also need to apply for a skills pass.
 The scheme will then be rolled out to all EU and Maltese workers in the tourism and hospitality industry from January 2026.

Charmaine Gauci confirms: no evidence to back dog and cat butcher rumours,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/charmaine-gauci-confirms-no-evidence-back-dog-cat-butcher-rumours.1094321,22-06-2024,003180.png,"Public health superintendent Charmaine Gauci said authorities found no evidence to corroborate claims that a Gozitan butcher was using dog and cat meat to produce Maltese sausage. 
 Gauci's statement, which was further corroborated by a statement from the Animal Welfare Ministry, confirms what Times of Malta reported on Friday.
 The public health chief was speaking after rumours about the butcher went viral, causing panic and disgust in equal measure. Some also claimed that people had fallen sick over the weekend after eating sausages from the butcher. 
 Various media outlets reported the claims and one NGO claimed on social media that the claims about the butcher were confirmed as ""true"".  
 But on Friday evening health authorities told Times of Malta they had no evidence to back the rumours, despite having inspected the butcher and probd the claims. 
 Speaking on Saturday on an RTK103 radio show, Gauci reiterated that.
 ""If there is any hint of information, we begin investigating,"" Gauci said. 
 The butcher shop in question was listed as no longer operating, but health authorities still visited the location more than once and at different times of the day to confirm. 
 Authorities also investigated claims that the sausages were being made at another location, Gauci said. 
 ""We went to several places that could be related to the owner of the butcher shop"". 
 In joint investigations involving the police and veterinary department, health authorities found no evidence that Maltese sausage was even being made, Gauci said. 
 Furthermore, there were no reports from any hospitals of food poisoning that could lead to the case. 
 In a separate statement, the agriculture ministry confirmed that no evidence was found to support the claims but added that investigations into the case are still ongoing. 
 ""This is what happens in every case related to food safety or animal abuse,"" the ministry said.  
 The veterinary health directorate and health authorities regularly conduct inspections to ensure food safety, the ministry said. 
 The agriculture ministry urged consumers to only buy from authorised establishments. 
 They said people should report illegalities but avoid making false reports. 
 Such reports ""may put Maltese food and the important work of Maltese and Gozitan Farmers in a negative light,"" the statement said.

Mandatory union membership will be reality ‘well before’ election - Andy Ellul,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/mandatory-unionisation-well-before-election.1098766,30-09-2024,003155.png,"The government plans to implement some form of mandatory union membership “well before” the end of its term in office, junior minister Andy Ellul said.
 The Labour Party proposed introducing the measure in its last general election manifesto, declaring it agrees with the principle of mandatory trade union membership and “will begin discussions with social partners about the implementation of this measure”.
  The parliamentary secretary for social dialogue said the government has indeed been discussing the matter with social partners.
 “We started from a point where some stakeholders didn’t even want to discuss the issue. We have made advances in the discussion since then,” Ellul said.
 The junior minister said he will announce the way forward in the coming days.
 Ellul said the government is looking at four models of ways to implement the measure and will discuss them in an “open manner” through a public consultation or some other way.
 The four models described by Ellul are: a system in which every employee is a union member; mandatory union membership only for low-wage earners; obliging third-country nationals to be in a trade union; a sectoral system where mandatory membership applies to just some industries.
 He said several organisations are on board, including the General Workers’ Union, UĦM Voice of the Workers, Moviment Graffitti,  Solidarjetà, and  Żminijietna.
 
 As to the timing when legislation on the issue will be enacted, Ellul said: “I think it will be much before the end of the legislature.”
 The General Workers’ Union has been among the most vocal supporters of introducing a mandatory union law, having floated the idea in their 2019 pre-budget document.
 The union had justified its proposal by saying it would boost the fight against precarious employment and exploitation in sectors where unionisation is very low or non-existent, such as construction and tourism.
 The UĦM called for mandatory union membership for low-income workers in spring 2022. 
 The Malta Employers’ Association, the Malta Chamber of Commerce and the Chamber of SMEs had jointly declared themselves against the proposal.

 “The classification to Malta Marriott Resort & Spa presents an opportunity to invite new and loyal travellers of Marriott Bonvoy’s flagship hotel brand to embark on their next journey of relaxation and exploration. Furthermore, the launch of Cala Lido is designed to meet and exceed the evolving needs of multi-generational travellers, creating a space that is met by comfort, connection, and excitement"",  general manager Alex Incorvaja said.

  The conclusion of the project was celebrated on Monday with a reception attended by Prime Minister Robert Abela, who said this was another vote of confidence in Malta's tourism industry.
  He said such an investment was made possible because Malta's tourism sector had grown and seasonality had become something of the past.
 The prime minister was taken on a tour of the complex and met workers and the local and overseas management, including David Marriott, chairman of Mariott International.
 He promised the government's continued support for the tourism industry and further efforts to raise standards.

New Airbnb rules would affect three-quarters of Malta’s licenced holiday homes,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/new-airbnb-rules-affect-threequarters-malta-licenced-holiday-homes.1101286,25-11-2024,"003314.png,003315.png,003316.png","As many as three out of every four licenced holiday homes in Malta and Gozo could be impacted by new regulations for short-term lets, according to an exercise carried out by Times of Malta.
 The plans, floated by MTA CEO Carlo Micallef last week, would see landlords who rent out short-let apartments required to get the go-ahead from their condominium neighbours before being granted a licence.
  Landlords currently need a licence from MTA to rent out their property as a holiday home.
 According to MTA data, there were just over 6,000 licenced short-let holiday homes across the Maltese islands as of this summer, 4,625 in Malta and 1,379 in Gozo.
 Nevertheless, the true number of properties on the rental market is likely to be higher. A 2019 Central Bank study found that there were a little under 9,000 properties in Malta listed on Airbnb, going for an average of €80 per night.
 More recently a study commissioned by Malta’s hoteliers found that there were just over 10,000 properties listed on Airbnb and fellow short-let platform VRBO, suggesting that almost half of all holiday homes in Malta operate without a licence.
 An analysis of MTA’s licenced properties suggests that as many as three-quarters of them form part of an apartment block or condominium.
 The remaining quarter are mostly made up of farmhouses, villas and townhouses.
 Holiday homes in Malta, where more than four of every five short-lets are believed to be situated in an apartment block, would be particularly hard-hit.
 Those in Gozo, on the other hand, are less likely to bear the brunt of the plans, with fewer than half the holiday homes on the island believed to be apartments.
  The data shows that of Malta’s 6,004 licenced holiday homes, over three-quarters (4,625) are in Malta.
 Almost half, 1,920, can be found in just three of Malta’s tourist hotspots, namely Sliema, St Julian’s and St Paul’s Bay.
 Valletta is home to over 400 properties with an MTA licence, with Mellieħa, Swieqi and Marsascala also proving popular.
 Meanwhile, Xagħra’s 190 holiday homes tops Gozo’s list, with Għarb trailing closely behind.
 
 Only three towns across Malta and Gozo – Marsa, Mtarfa and Santa Luċija – remain untouched by the Airbnb phenomenon, without a single licenced holiday home.  
 In total, Malta’s licenced holiday homes provide almost 25,000 bed spaces. 
 Tourists staying in holiday homes are frequently blamed for a myriad of problems in tourist hotspots, from littering and excessive noise, to all manners of  unruly behaviour.
 Details on how Malta plans to manage the ever-increasing Airbnb rental market remain scarce.
 Robert Abela has seemingly ruled out a Barcelona-style blanket ban,  telling  Times of Malta that the government will protect the investment of anyone who bought a property to rent it out as a holiday home.
 Meanwhile, reactions to the proposal floated by Micallef were mixed, with estate agents describing them as misguided, while others say the proposal doesn’t go far enough.

Watch: ‘This is crazy. We cannot continue building more hotels’ - MHRA president,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/watch-this-crazy-we-cannot-continue-building-hotels-mhra-president.1096233,08-02-2024,003492.png,"Malta can no longer cope with ""excessive development of hotels"", the head of the Malta Hotels and Restaurants Association warned a tourism conference on Friday, describing the situation as ""crazy"".
 Tony Zahra was reacting to a comment that hotels needed more workers to cope with growing demand.
 “The whole of Malta is going up in flames because our power distribution system is not working,” Zahra said, referring to hours-long power cuts across Malta and Gozo in recent weeks.
 “We cannot go on building more hotels and more rooms. It’s crazy,” he said, as the audience remained silent during his intervention.
  Over the weekend, the MHRA already urged the government to stop encouraging the development of new hotel rooms and review rented accommodation and catering licensing protocols.
 The association warned that the rapid growth has led to overcrowded destinations and anti-social behaviour.
 If Malta continued building more hotels, the island would need more tourists and more arrivals. 
 “How will we handle it? Are we going to have more sewage in the sea? Are we going to have more foreign [workers]? Are we going to have to build another hospital?” Zahra reiterated on Friday.
 He said the government was “crazy” to expand the economy the way it did, however, businesses must now focus on improving the situation.
 “If we do not do that, there won’t be any industry left,” he said. 
 “How many times are we going to have people coming to Malta and say, ‘we cannot go swimming’,” he asked.
 Over the past weeks, tourists expressed their frustration over the two-month closure of the popular Balluta Bay, due to E-coli contamination.
 Zahra said the MHRA’s 2022 carrying capacity study, which claimed that Malta would need 4.7 million tourists to sustain its current occupancy availability, had been ignored. 
 “You know what people did with [the study]? They put it in the bin. If you read that report, you would see that we have reached overcapacity.”
 Addressing the conference earlier, Zahra said one of his main concerns was the country’s shift in the tourists it was attracting. 
 He said instead of seeing more families and elderly tourists coming to Malta, the airport arrivals were full of younger visitors.
 “This is a good thing, and we don’t mind it of course, but we must focus on the tourist profiles that will contribute the most to the economy,” he said. 
 ""We have the numbers and we cannot take more. If we take more tourists, we will have more problems than we already have.""
 Zahra also reacted to the decision by the popular ride-hailing platform Bolt decision to increase the fares as a result of the government's clampdown on work permits for third-country nationals. 
 “Mr Bolt, by going against our government (...) you are turning people into slaves,” he said. 
 “Bolt, please remember that you are a guest in Malta, and this is not our traditional way of doing business.”
 The Employment Minister Byron Camilleri has also warned Bolt to stop inflating prices in an attempt to import more workers. 
 According to data published at the conference, the second quarter saw an increase in tourist arrivals and their expenditure, when compared to the same months last year.
 Close to one million tourists arrived in Malta during these months, an increase of 152,000.
 They spent around €850 million, a 17 percent increase from the comparable period of 2023.
 When it comes to occupancy levels, four and five-star hotels saw a slight decrease over 2023.

 Tourist Alan Brooks said the Windsor Hotel refused to refund the May booking and that its management repeatedly failed to show up to meetings about the issue.
 He said he reported the hotel to the Malta Tourism Authority (MTA) only to be told the authority was investigating but provided no further details.
 Calling the hotel a “total scam”, Brooks said he was shocked at the way the authority handled the case, saying “they couldn’t care in the slightest... They’ve failed in every way”.
 Meanwhile, the hotel manager said the floor Brooks and his partner stayed on was closed for refurbishment – including the fitting of new locks – and should not have been sold by the booking agent.
 He said the lock issue had been resolved “way back in May”, the month of the booking, and that he was “shocked” to hear of the incident.
 The manager added that he would have booked Brooks and his partner into an alternative hotel had he known in advance or been present when they arrived.
 A spokesperson for the tourism ministry said the MTA had “thoroughly investigated” the complaint but could not provide further details for legal reasons.
 The spokesperson said the ministry and the MTA believed the complaint had been “misrepresented”, but stressed they took such incidents seriously.
 Brooks and his partner travelled to Malta in May to visit his sister, who has lived in the country for around 10 years. He said he “loves Malta” and, although he had stayed with his sister in the past, he decided to book into a hotel to give her family more space.
  After reading positive reviews of the Sliema hotel, he and his partner decided to book a room for their week in Malta.
 However, after checking in, things took a turn for the worse.
 Upon getting to their room, Brooks and his partner found a gaping hole in their door where the lock should have been. And when they checked other doors on the same floor, it was the same story, he said.
 Brooks said he spoke to around 25 other people at the hotel stuck in the same situation – some, he said, did not even have a door to their room – describing the hotel lobby as being full of angry guests when he went to complain.
 “People said strangers were walking into their room in the middle of the night and some had things stolen... they wanted to leave but most couldn’t afford to book a new hotel,” he said.
 Asked about the general conditions at the hotel, he said “that was the bizarre thing; the rooms were fine”.
 Brooks and his partner left the hotel but kept returning daily after repeatedly being promised meetings with the manager to address the issue. But the manager never showed up, he said.
 Brooks showed Times of Malta a signed document appearing to show the hotel’s management company Sovereign Hotels Ltd promising to refund him for the booking – a refund Brooks said was later refused when requested by booking agent trip.com, which ended up refunding the couple instead.
 Speaking from his home in Dublin, Brooks said he was left feeling “angry and really sad” by his experience at the hotel. “We just hated that this would happen in Malta.”
 Times of Malta found numerous mentions of issues with door locks in online reviews about the Windsor Hotel posted on Google, TripAdvisor and Booking.com.
 The hotel manager said the floor the couple stayed on was closed due to refurbishment works, “but guests apparently went to the floor and used the rooms”.
 Asked about claims of people entering rooms at night and thefts of personal property, the manager reiterated the rooms “weren’t ready to accommodate guests”.
 Confirming the MTA had investigated the incident, he said the issue was resolved “way back in May” when “only a few rooms” did not have locks. He said all rooms were now fitted with “smart locks”.
 The manager added that despite parts of the hotel being closed for bookings due to the refurbishment, some third-party booking agents had allowed guests to book rooms anyway, leaving the hotel overbooked.
 Calling the idea of allocating rooms to guests without a lock “ridiculous”, he stressed the situation was not the fault of the hotel and that he would have found alternative accommodation – if necessary, at a different hotel – for those affected had he known in advance or been present when they checked in.
 He said he was “not aware” of the meetings to discuss the issue, stressing “of course I would have met the guests personally”.
 While still in Malta, Brooks complained to the MTA about his experience and asked the authority to “urgently intervene” describing the hotel as “woefully inadequate in terms of safety and security measures”.
 The authority responded that day, promising him they would investigate and informing him that, should he “wish to follow up on the case”, he should contact the MTA enforcement department.
 But, over the following couple of months, Brooks said he received no updates on his case, apart from repeatedly being told the authority was investigating.
 Two months after his original complaint, he finally received a response from the MTA saying it “together with its legal advisers has determined the best way forward and taken action as deemed necessary” but was provided with no further information.
 Commenting on the MTA’s response to his case, Brooks said the authority had “failed in every way; the regulator has a moral and legal responsibility to tourists in Malta – the buck stops with them”.
 But a tourism ministry spokesperson said the hotel management was “already implementing measures to address the concerns raised” when the MTA inspected the premises “immediately” after receiving Brooks’ complaint.
 He said the authority was “continuously monitoring the situation and will take further action if necessary”.
 Noting there were “discrepancies” between Brooks’ and the hotel’s version of events, the spokesperson said Brooks had been advised to seek a refund privately, noting the MTA “does not have jurisdiction in such matters”.

Gozo Tourism Association stress sustainability in 2025 budget proposals,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/gozo-tourism-association-stress-sustainability-2025-budget-proposals.1097318,28-08-2024,004653.png,"Policy in Gozo should be focused on keeping tourism levels on the sister island sustainable, the Gozo Tourism Association said in its 2025 budget proposals. 
 This comes after association members said they are seeing a drop in revenue despite an increase in tourists visiting Gozo. 
 “Gozo as a tourist destination has to be prepared to offer the advertised and marketed touristic product. The upkeep, cleanliness and organisation of Gozo as well as that of the touristic establishments are to reflect and match the expectations of the visitors to the Island. Furthermore, Gozo has to remain competitive in the product and services on offer, whilst ensuring that the visitors get the value for money spent,” they said. 
 To improve connectivity between Malta and Gozo, the group proposed a fourth ferry to replace the Nikolaus and the introduction of a smart ticketing system which will allow people to commute on different transport modes with a common ticket. 
 Discussing the environment, the association said it does not want Gozo to become a small Malta and therefore Malta’s planning policies are not necessarily appropriate to keep in Gozo. 
 To this end, they called for a new regional plan and planning policies specifically designed for Gozo to be preserved as an “island of villages”. 
 Incentives to purchase UCA property should be retained, they said, while those which benefit vernacular and post-war properties where buyers pledge to maintain the integrity of the property should be extended. 
 They also proposed a new fiscal incentive encouraging the restoration of traditional properties and converting them into boutique hotels. 
 A marine reserve should also be established around the Gozitan coast and this should be enforced similarly to the Ċirkewwa marine reserve. 
 In order to promote Gozo as a distinct destination, the GTA also made a series of proposals suggesting upgrades to the island’s tourism product. 
 ECO contribution collected from Gozitan accommodations should be reinvested in strategic upgrading, like kiting areas for the diving community. 
 VAT that is applied to tickets for shows, theatres, fairs amusement parks, concerts, museums and other similar events and facilities should be reduced from 18% to 7%, they said. 
 A new underground multi-level car park to alleviate the lack of parking spaces in Victoria is also needed, they said. 
 A tailor-made tourism investment support scheme should also be implemented to entice local entrepreneurs to upgrade their Gozitan establishments. 
 They also urged the authorities to amend the summer construction break and prohibit all excavation and demolition works from taking place within a 50-meter radius of any MTA-licensed premises. 
 The association also made other proposals aimed at improving marketing Gozo overseas and improving human resources challenges. 
 “Tourism on the Island region of Gozo is also facing several challenges. While all National and Regional policies and strategies are pointing and directing towards a distinct destination, focusing on particular niche markets based on the island’s unique selling propositions, the tourism sector is very much concerned that the overdevelopment of Gozo is jeopardising and lambasting the core of these tourism values, the GTA said in its conclusion. 
 “These overdevelopments, mostly for residential purposes are impacting negatively the character of our little island, a proposition on which the tourism sector has been for years marketing and promoting Gozo with, as well as creating trends which are not naturally touristic.”

Watch: Tourist credits receptionist for saving her life during Sliema stay,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/watchbritish-tourist-thanks-receptionist-saving-life-sliema-stay.1101122,17-11-2024,"005141.png,005142.png,005143.png","A tourist has credited the quick thinking of a night receptionist at a Sliema hotel with saving her life, enabling her to celebrate her 90th birthday this year.
 Ruth Burton, a British national, expressed heartfelt gratitude to John Cuschieri, 66, the night receptionist at the Preluna Hotel, for his swift actions when she suffered a heart attack in November last year.
 “It’s all thanks to John’s quick thinking that I am here again this November,” Burton said.
  Burton, who turned 90 in May, has been a loyal visitor to the Preluna since 2001. Every November, she travels to Malta to escape Lincolnshire’s cold winters and attend the Remembrance Sunday services. These trips are part of an annual tradition that holds sentimental value, rooted in the memory of her late husband, Alexander Burton, a Navy serviceman.
 However, last year’s visit took an unexpected turn.
 On the evening of November 14, following a game of Uno with her daughter Anne and son-in-law Peter, Burton began feeling unwell.
  “I went to bed and began to feel ill, and then I started to feel even worse,” she recounted.
 At around 2 am, feeling hot, sweaty, and experiencing pain in her shoulders, Burton called reception to request medical assistance.
 “Her voice was very emotional, and I could feel something was wrong,” Cuschieri said.
 Recognising the urgency, Cuschieri promptly arranged for another staff member to cover the front desk and rushed to her room. There, he found Burton shaking in bed and acted quickly to manage the situation.
 “I rushed back down and called the ambulance,” Cuschieri recalls. He also informed Burton’s family, who were staying at the same hotel, ensuring they could accompany her to the hospital.
 An ambulance arrived within minutes. Tests confirmed Burton was having a heart attack, but timely intervention saved her and eventually allowed her to recover.
 Cuschieri, who has worked at the Preluna Hotel for 46 years, says he was just doing his job. 
 “I am positive my colleagues would have done the same thing. I am not special,” he said, crediting only his ability to remain calm in emergencies.
 “This happens quite often – at least once every two months,” he said.
 But Burton remains deeply grateful for the receptionist’s quick thinking, which allowed her to continue her long-standing tradition of visiting Malta for Remembrance Sunday.
 The Preluna Hotel is a popular choice for older tourists during the winter months. Many, like Burton, consider it a second home. Burton and her late husband began visiting Malta each November to attend Remembrance Day services, forging a deep connection with the island.
 Although Alexander did not serve in Malta during his Navy career, he had stopped there during World War II. Over time, the couple developed a strong affection for the island, making it their sole holiday destination.
  “I don’t do any other holidays, just Malta. It feels like you come to live here for three to four weeks,” Burton said.
 Dressed in a vibrant red shirt, a poppy-print skirt and a Maltese cross necklace, Burton proudly displayed her husband’s medals. Since her husband’s passing in 2018, she has continued the tradition, often attending the commemorations with her daughter, son-in-law and grandson Steven who wear’s Alexander’s medals.
 
 For Cuschieri, the heart attack episode was all in a day’s work but over the last year kept thinking whatever had happened to her. 
 “It was like winning the lottery”, said Cuschieri when he saw Burton walking through the doors of the Sliema hotel.
 For Burton, his actions meant the world, and she repeatedly thanked him. A lifetime of memories on the island now includes the moment it gave her another chance at life.
 “I’ll keep coming back as long as I can, and even then, they might have to carry me out!” Burton said.

Jobsplus directed to update plans on employment of TCNs – Robert Abela,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/jobsplus-directed-update-plans-employment-tcns-robert-abela.1095991,28-07-2024,005213.png,"The government has directed Jobsplus to review its plans on the employment of third-country nationals (TCNs) in Malta. 
 Speaking on One Radio on Sunday morning, Prime Minister Robert Abela said that the government will take all the decisions that are required in the interests of the country.
 “In a few weeks, following extensive consultation, we will have updated plans. These decisions will be ambitious rather than cosmetic because I believe that Malta should have only the required number of foreign workers,” Abela said.
 He highlighted the need for more health and care workers, while noting that the cab and food courier markets are saturated, necessitating strategic decisions.
 “It is clear that the country has enough foreign workers employed in these two sectors, and a decision to refuse new applications for work permits has already been made,” he added.
 The prime minister warned employment agencies that any attempts to circumvent the system would result in rejections.
 “We will not allow the many to suffer for the benefit of the few. While the few may make the most noise and apply more pressure, we know well what the needs of the many are and will act accordingly,” he stated.
 Last week, Times of Malta reported that hundreds of third-country nationals were having their work permit applications refused. 
 On Friday the government confirmed that new applications for cab drivers and food courier work permits by third-country nationals were being turned down due to market saturation.
 The prime minister assured that these decisions will not affect workers who are already legally employed. 
 “Through our actions, employers will be incentivised to treat their workers with dignity. The high turnover of workers is not in their interest because from now on they will not be able to replace their workers at will,” Abela explained.
 On the issue of enforcement regarding tables and chairs, the prime minister emphasised that coordination measures have been implemented between the competent authorities.
 An exercise is being conducted to establish which permits are in place, and where those permits are not observed, actions will be taken.
 “One must understand that every village has its character, and we need to preserve it. In each village, there are also different players, so we need to consult while presenting updated plans,” he said.
 In mid-July, the Lands Authority, the Planning Authority, the Malta Tourism Authority, and the Police took action to remove tables and chairs from St George’s Square in Victoria following months of protests by the archpriest of St George Parish.
 Similar enforcement action was carried out this week in Valletta.
 Abela made no mention in the interview on the ongoing controversy over whether Central Bank Governor Edward Scicluna should resign or be removed over his arraignment in connection with the Vitals hospitals case,

MHRA says almost half Malta's Airbnb rentals have no licence,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/almost-half-malta-private-holiday-rentals-operate-licence-mhra.1101103,16-11-2024,005297.png,"A significant proportion of private holiday rental accommodations in Malta is operating without the required licenses, according to new data published by the Malta Hotels and Restaurants Association.
 The data, presented as part of a carrying capacity study commissioned by the MHRA and conducted by Deloitte, highlights a disparity between licenced and unlicenced private holiday rentals.
 As of 2023, the Malta Tourism Authority issued 5,771 permits for these units, referred to as holiday-furnished premises.
 However, an analysis of the platforms Airbnb and VRBO found there are some 10,043 properties of this nature listed on the local market. 
 The study suggests that nearly half of private rental properties are unlicenced and operate outside the scope of regulatory oversight.
 The data also suggests that private holiday rentals continue to grow in popularity, with the sector accounting for just under a third of all tourist guest nights in Malta in 2023. 
 A slight jump in popularity has also been observed, with the sector climbing from 31.9% to 32.4% between 2019 and 2023. 
 However, the study also pointed out that private rentals appear to be heavily impacted by seasonality, with properties surging in the summer months but drastically reduced during the winter period. 
 Airbnb data shows that 6,000 entire homes are available for rent in summer, but only around 3,000 are available between January and March.
 The report says this allows operators to keep their occupancy levels comparable to collective accommodation - such as hotels - and redeploy the same properties for longer-term rental during the shoulder months. 
 “The trends observed suggest that this segment is being used opportunistically by individual property owners to maximise on the tourist segment in the summer peak by acting as a spillover to collective accommodation while exiting the market in the shoulder period,” the report said. 
 While the report also highlights a need for tighter regulations around the industry and level the playing field between short lets and traditional hotels, the findings come only days after the MTA announced its plans to introduce new restrictions on Airbnb rentals. 
 The proposed rules will require apartment owners who wish to rent out their property as an Airbnb to get the go-ahead of their condominium neighbours first. 
 Failure to do so will bar a landlord from being able to licence the property as a short-term rental.

 ""A small percentage of that sand turns to dust, which washes into the sea,"" he said.  “I want to emphasize that this is not contamination, and the water is still safe for swimming.”  
  St George's Bay was extended with imported sand in 2004 and the sand has been replenished every few years since by the Malta Tourism Authority.  
 “The sand is made from broken granite with similar characteristics to what was placed in the same beach in 2004, 2007, and 2015,” Bartolo said. The murky colour may remain for a few days until the sand settles. 
  “This phenomenon happens at every (sandy) beach, but natural sand has a lighter colour, so it is not as visible in the water,” Bartolo said.  
 Meanwhile, the Nationalist Party demanded an explanation on Tuesday over seawater contamination in various bays which, in some cases had stretched into weeks. 
 It pointed out that Balluta and St George's Bay were closed for weeks, and no explanation had been given about the cause. 
 The government, the PN said, needed to explain and rectify such problems without delay.

Putting a price on a housewife,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/putting-price-housewife.1093185,06-01-2024,005829.png,"Chef, cleaner, driver, tutor, mentor, manager. These are among the roles that stay-at-home parents fulfil daily as part of their unpaid work – that often comes with night shifts.
 Many would agree that their role is “priceless”. They are investing in the future generation. But can a price be put on this work? What is the cost of a stay-at-home parent?
 The subject came up last month when a woman was awarded almost €28,000 in compensation after doctors left a surgical gauze inside her abdomen following an intervention at Mater Dei Hospital 10 years ago.
 The court noted she was a housewife so there was no loss of employment but this did not mean that her role had no value. It pegged the repayment to the minimum wage.
 This is a common practice in Maltese courts. In 2012, a housewife who was seriously injured when the Save-On supermarket collapsed in Paola in 1990 was awarded €34,000 in damages. The court used the minimum wage as a yardstick.
 In 2010, a court ordered the payment of €69,000 in compensation to the husband and children of a 46-year-old housewife who was killed in a traffic accident 10 years before. The earnings of the woman, who also had a medical condition, were considered as equivalent to a minimum wage.
 But should the worth of a stay-at-home parent be calculated based on minimum wage? The first step is understanding what housework entails.
 “We wake up at work and sleep at work. The hours are long. It’s a lot of jobs rolled into one: cleaning, cooking, driving around and there is the mental juggling of the diverse work that is very draining,” said a woman who shelved her teaching career to focus on her four children.
 She feels there is “no genuine respect” for what stay-at-home parents do.
 “When I was working, I never had time for my children. I did not like that. The care we are giving our children is irreplaceable,” she said.
 Apart from the physical work, she added: “There is the burden of psychologically nurturing the children while you are, yourself, being challenged psychologically.”
 This burden has been named the “emotional labour”, or putting another’s feelings and desires before your own.
 Housework is defined as the unremunerated work of maintaining a household. The European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) lists the categories that involve shopping for groceries, household chores (cleaning, cooking, caring for dependent children and adults) and maintenance, financial and administrative matters and management and planning tasks.
 The next step is understanding who carries out these jobs. According to the Gender Equality Index 2023, issued by the EIGE last October, women across most EU countries still take on the bulk of the responsibilities at home.
 Data on women’s and men’s involvement in unpaid care in Malta show that more women (32%) than men (16%) engage in everyday caring for others. This includes caring for children and sick and elderly relatives. When it comes to cooking and housework activities, 78% of women and 63% of men report doing such tasks every day.
 So how can the value of housework be quantified? Economist Kirsten Cutajar Miller notes that measuring the economic value of these productive activities may be difficult as these are often undertaken outside the market and do not always have an assigned market value.
 The alternative to this assessment is to look at the value of wage rates used to derive these activities – the opportunity cost approach.
 “Using this approach, we look at the value the person undertaking the housework would have earned had they engaged in paid labour. However, this method may be flawed as it implies that the value of the housework changes with the person doing it. For example, the value of the housework undertaken by a high-income earner would be greater than that earned by a low-income earner,” she says.
 Cutajar Miller notes that the EIGE states that 91% of women with children spend at least an hour per day on housework, compared with 30% of men with children, while employed women spend about 2.3 hours daily on housework compared to 1.6 hours for employed men.
 “Using the average wage rate for employed women and men for Malta, which for Q4 2023 was €1,747 for women and €1,905 for men, we might value the monthly average value of housework at €753.40 and €571.5 for women and men, respectively. For a two-adult household (one woman, one man) this represents 46% of the average disposable household income,” she says.
 With this in mind, would it make sense to offer compensation to housewives?
 In 2016, experts forming the Parliamentary Committee for Family Affairs recommended that compensation should be given to housewives.
 This was shot down by experts who said it would backfire by discouraging women to enter the labour market – where they were needed. The Malta Employers’ Association said that implications for employers were that it could potentially lead to a fall in labour supply and increase government expenditure.
 In many cases, couples choose who, if anyone, will slow down on work to handle the children. They find a way to work it out. But issues crop up if the relationship breaks down. The person who slowed down their career ends up at a financial disadvantage.
 The courts in various countries are taking note of this. In Britain, a woman was awarded £400,000 (€470,000) for “sacrificing” her career as a solicitor so she could look after her two children. She won the compensation on top of an equal share of the family’s wealth after her divorce.
 A Chinese divorce court ordered a man to pay his wife the equivalent of $7,700 (€7,000) as compensation for housework during their five-year marriage.
 Financial compensation can help. But it is not necessarily the long-term solution to these situations.
 In a recent article, The Economist wrote: “Many women have no option but to leave the workforce when they start a family – the cost of childcare might outweigh the benefits of a second salary, particularly if working hours and earnings are reduced to accommodate family responsibilities. Legal and financial recognition of unpaid domestic work would change this calculation.
 “But it would be simpler (and fairer) to share domestic burdens more evenly. The division of housework is also unequal in the West, with women shouldering most domestic chores and childcare responsibilities. And family-leave policies are similarly disproportionate, with paternity leave being an average of just 1.7 weeks across the European Union’s 27 countries.”
 Malta is at the lower end of the spectrum. In August 2022, fathers got 10 days’ paternity leave on full pay as opposed to the previous one day. This contrasts to mothers who benefit from 18 weeks, 14 of which are paid.

Michael Falzon: 'I chose to resign. Others make their own choices',timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/michael-falzon-dodges-questions-calls-bartolo-camilleri-resignations.1101231,19-11-2024,006358.png,"Eight years after resigning over a government scandal, Minister Michael Falzon repeatedly dodged questions on whether his colleagues, Clayton Bartolo and Clint Camilleri, should follow in his footsteps and resign. 
 The two ministers are under increasing pressure to resign after they abused their power and breached ministerial ethics when they orchestrated getting Bartolo's now-wife employed in a job she was not qualified for and did not do 
 Falzon, who served as lands junior minister in 2016, stepped down after the Auditor General found irregularities in a property deal that left businessman  Mark Gaffarena with a hefty profit.
 The government paid €1.65 million for half ownership of a property in Valletta that Gaffarena had purchased for a fraction of the price just weeks earlier.
 “What I did (resign) was my decision. That’s Michael Falzon, and if people don’t like that, everyone is free to judge,” Falzon, who is currently Social Policy Minister, said.
 When asked whether Bartolo and Camilleri should resign over the lucrative consultancy contracts given to Bartolo’s then-girlfriend and now wife, Falzon said, “It’s not about what I think.”
  Tourism Minister Bartolo and Gozo Minister Camilleri have faced pressure to step down after the Standards Commissioner found that the two abused their power and breached ministerial ethics when Amanda Muscat was employed in a role she was not qualified for and did not perform.
 Muscat, who previously served as Bartolo’s secretary, was given a €62,000-a-year job as a policy consultant in Bartolo’s ministry. She was later transferred to Camilleri’s ministry, where her salary was increased to €68,000. However, the Standards Commissioner only found evidence of her performing secretarial work and stated that Muscat was unqualified to serve as a consultant.
 Prime Minister Robert Abela has repeatedly defended his two ministers, describing them as among his staunchest allies in Cabinet.
 “The circumstances do not warrant Clayton Bartolo or Clint Camilleri stepping down from their ministerial duties,” Abela said in a recent interview with the Times of Malta.
 “[Muscat] worked her full hours, and the Standards Commissioner confirmed this was not a phantom job. The discrepancy lay in the transition from her role as a private secretary to that of a consultant,” he added.
 On Tuesday morning, Falzon was asked if good governance standards had declined in the last eight years.
 “I look to the future so we can continue doing good for this country,” he replied.
 
 Falzon also condemned the “mob” (marmalja) that gathered in front of Parliament on Monday.
 Falzon was referring to a protest called by the Nationalist Party over the issue. 
 “Some in the crowd were cursing MPs as we left Parliament, and some were even cursing our deceased family members,” he said.
 Falzon was speaking on the sidelines of a Foundation for Social Welfare Services press conference about the entity’s budget estimates.
 FSWS CEO Alfred Grixti highlighted that investment in the entity had grown significantly over the years, emphasizing improved pay and conditions for the 1,000 workers employed within it.
 Social Policy Minister Falzon said the government prioritizes inclusion.
 “A successful government reaches out to those at the bottom and does not allow people to be discarded,” he said.

‘No swimwear on our streets’: Sliema locals frustrated by 'inappropriate wear',timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/no-swimwear-streets-sliema-locals-frustrated-inappropriate-wear.1097093,23-08-2024,007014.png,"A lifelong resident of Sliema has launched a campaign urging people not to wear swimwear on the seaside town’s streets.
 David Pace O’Shea has put up around 60 small signs across Sliema with the message, ‘No swimwear on our streets’, hoping to encourage more appropriate attire in residential areas.
 Pace O’Shea explained that the problem has been growing for years, with residents increasingly frustrated by the sight of people walking around in swimwear far from the beach.
 “Decency is relative. That’s why my signs specifically mention swimwear. Swimwear should be just for the beach,” he said.
 During the summer, many Sliema residents have taken to social media to vent their frustrations about people strolling through residential streets or shopping in swimwear, sometimes creating tension between locals and tourists.
 Pace O’Shea noted that this tension came to a head recently when he witnessed a heated argument over someone’s attire.
 “Have frustrations been raised so much that it might lead to fights?” he said.
 Motivated by this incident, Pace O’Shea decided to act two weeks ago, believing that individuals can enact change without always waiting for the authorities to step in. “Sometimes, you have to do it yourself – while remaining within the law,” he added.
  In addition to placing the signs, Pace O’Shea has written to the Sliema mayor and police commissioner.
 He requested more official signage like his, a social media campaign targeting tourists and language students, and stricter enforcement of public decency laws.
 According to Section 338 of the Criminal Code, it is an offence for anyone in public to “expose himself naked or be indecently dressed”.
 This issue has not gone unnoticed by others in the community.
 Last month, St Gregory’s parish priest, Etienne Sciberras, expressed similar concerns at a community meeting. However, when he raised the issue with the police, he was told that enforcing such rules could harm tourism.
 Sliema mayor John Pillow also shares these concerns: “It is too much, and I am against it”.
 He added that people often confuse being in a residential area with still being at the beach, even going as far as wearing swimwear in supermarkets.
 Pillow believes that signs alone are not enough.
 “We need more enforcement on the streets,” he said, noting that Rangers have recently been deployed to address the issue.

GWU calls out exploitation of workers in May 1 speech,timesofmalta,https://timesofmalta.com/article/gwu-calls-exploitation-workers-may-1-speech.1091785,21-06-2024,006935.png,"Workers continue to be abused, exploited and in some cases underpaid, General Workers Union boss Josef Bugeja said in a speech to mark Workers' Day.
 “Time and again workers are being subjected to unjust treatment, unsuitable working conditions, and low wages,” Bugeja said. “Their rights are being ignored, and their voices silenced. This exploitation is unjust, illegal, and fundamentally opposed to the principles of solidarity, social justice, dignity, and equality.”
 Bugeja said the union would be steadfast in fighting for just wages that give workers and their families a dignified life, policies that promote work-life balance and which safeguard mental as well as physical health, as well as continued investment in lifelong skills.
 “We are fighting for the principle of equal pay for jobs of equal value in every workplace, because this is a foundation of social justice, for all workers, be they sub-contracted or directly employed,” Bugeja said. “It is unacceptable that the former are being paid less than other workers, a disparity that devalues their contribution and leads to an unequal society.”
 The GWU is Malta’s largest union and Bugeja effectively leads it as its secretary general. May 1 marks International Labour Day. 
 He said the union was disgusted to see foreign, non-EU workers disrespected and ill-treated.
 “These workers contribute to our culture, our society, and our economy. Yet they face a disgusting, discriminatory and abusive treatment. We need to foster a society that embraces diversity, and which respects the rights of all workers, irrespectively of their nationality,” the GWU Secretary General said. “Our solidarity must extend to all workers... their fight for a better life is part of our fight for social justice.”
 
 Bugeja reaffirmed the GWU’s belief that mandatory union membership was the key to ensuring better wages, occupational safety, and a strong voice for workers.
 Workers were the victims when employers did not respect occupational health and safety standards in workplaces, he said, adding that the union would hold abusive employers responsible for their actions.
 Bugeja’s speech also touched on the importance of ensuring green economy reforms did not leave workers behind, and the need to ensure workers’ dignity was upheld in upskilling processes.
 He also said the union would not back down in its legal quest to retain its Valletta headquarters after Nationalist MPs filed a civil case to have the premises’ land returned to the State.

 In a letter to Animal Rights Minister Anton Refalo, the Breeds of Origin Conservancy and Koperattiva Maltija tal-Mogħoż u n-Nagħaġ called for official recognition of the local indigenous goat as ""a critically endangered traditional population and local breed that is at risk"".
  Darryl Grech, on behalf of the voluntary organisation and the cooperative said the local breed would classify as such in line with guidelines issued by the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization.
 
 In a statement, Grech said that despite its cultural and historical contribution to the Maltese islands, the goat unjustly remained without the recognition it deserved.
 Grech notes that the population of the breed dropped at ""an alarming rate"" over the past five decades. 
 There were now under 1,000 indigenous goats in Malta.
  ""This indigenous population should be valued and maintained for the benefit of biodiversity.
 ""Considering the growing consensus on the need to safeguard native breeds, this is an attempt to retrieve, analyse and combine information to characterise the remaining indigenous goats of the Maltese islands, identify the current status and size of the population, and develop comprehensive criteria that may serve as a basis for future breeding and selection programs.""

New study: Development permits used as political tool in Malta,theshiftnews,https://theshiftnews.com/2023/11/18/new-study-development-permits-used-as-political-tool-in-malta/,18-11-2023,"000098.png,000099.png","The number of granted development permits has skyrocketed since 2013, contributing to a significant increase in urban sprawl, a new study published by the environmental peer-reviewed journal Sustainability shows.
 The study charts urban growth in Malta using planning application data from the past 30 years. Besides increased approved permits coinciding with economic and population growth, its findings support the notion that their permit-granting may have been used as a political vote-buying tool.
 Authored by four Maltese researchers from the University of Malta, the study used data mining techniques to analyse thousands of development planning applications between 1993 and 2019 to chart trends and urban sprawl.
 The study found a particular increase in granted development applications resulting in urban growth since the post-2013 construction boom. It also found that outside development zone permits and permits granted despite a case officer report for their refusal increased before elections.
 Discussing the latter findings, the researchers said the results “support the hypothesis that land development and the institutions regulating it are used as a political mechanism by the incumbent government to garner votes during elections.”
 The researchers found that while there was a decrease in the share of granted permits that contributed to urban sprawl, “the absolute number of granted development planning applications resulting in growth has increased, particularly in the last construction boom (post-2013).”
 It concluded that urban growth shows that “the construction industry is closely linked to the islands’ economic cycles and changes in population,” noting a particular slump in 2011.
 “The spike in development-planning application permits in the last few years corroborates the observed construction boom,” they said. They noted how economic and population growth alongside a relaxation in planning policies had been identified as contributing to the trend.
 The study also looked at the number of planning applications granted in ODZ areas, using linguistic and data analysis to determine the ones contributing to urban growth. Since the 90s, a steady share of over 10% of applications were granted on ODZ.
 In particular, 2017 and 2018 were identified as the years with the highest numbers of such permits. The findings led the researchers to suggest a study into “the effectiveness of the ODZ designation and assessing whether this zone is fulfilling its raison d’ être in conserving rural areas has become a transitional zone for development.”
 Additionally, the study recommended a “standardisation of descriptors in development-planning applications” for improved transparency. The researchers hoped for a more data-driven approach to studying current and future urban planning policy.
 The study published in  Sustainability was conducted by Andrea Pace, Maria Attard, Michel Camilleri and Gianluca Valentino.
 The researchers hail from the Department of Geography, Insitute for Climate Change and Sustainable Development, Department of Computer Information Systems and Department of Communications and Computer Engineering at the University of Malta.

Plans filed to replace Qawra White Dolphin Hotel complex with 144-room hotel - The Malta Independent ,independent,https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2024-10-22/local-news/Plans-filed-to-replace-Qawra-White-Dolphin-Hotel-complex-with-144-room-hotel-6736265102,22-10-2024,000291.png,"
                
        

         Plans have been filed to demolish the existing White Dolphin Hotel complex in Qawra and replace it with a 10-storey, 144-room budget hotel.
 Situated on Triq Dawret il-Qawra a stone's throw away from the coast, the White Dolphin is a complex of budget self-catered apartments with a restaurant and pool area included at ground floor level.
 The plans, which have been filed by Louis Gauci who listed himself as an owner of the site, envision the total demolition of the current site and its replacement with a new hotel with three underground levels and 10 over-ground levels, the topmost being a receded floor.  This would see the site rise higher than was previously approved. In 2017, a planning application was approved that permitted the site to rise to 7 levels.
 The applicant is proposing a three-star hotel which will contain 144 rooms with a total of 288 beds.  Although not formally written down, plans filed with the Planning Authority indicate that the hotel will be part of French megabrand ibis Hotels.
 The ibis logo is in fact presented on one of the hotel's walls in elevations presented in the planning application.  Ibis is a global franchise and has over 2,000 hotels worldwide under its name.  There is already an ibis Styles hotel in St Paul's Bay, a stone's throw away from the Bugibba Square.
 The currently existing White Dolphin Hotel is something of a holiday complex more than a hotel.  It is made up of 45 self-catered apartments with a communal pool at ground level and a bar and restaurant open in peak seasons.
 The new project will include 49 parking spaces split across three newly excavated basement levels, together with amenities such as a restaurant, an indoor pool with a spa, a gym, a coffee shop, a rooftop bar and a 95 square metre outdoor infinity pool at roof level.
 The Malta Tourism Authority said in planning consultations that it has no objection to the application, and the Environment & Resources Authority, similarly, said it has no problems with the plans either.
 More planning consultations must take place with varying entities, before a Planning Authority case officer will issue a recommendation on whether the project should be granted approval or not.

 Tributes poured in on social media on Sunday, along with messages of shock, disbelief and condolences, as her family and friends learned about her death.
 They hailed her as a ""fantastic person who was always smiling"" and as a volleyball player and coach who had ""a brilliant career"" and who loved animals and coaching children.
 Others said her intelligence was unmatched, her soul gentle, and described her as ""an excellent human and professional"".
  Bertolino died when a quad bike she was riding crashed off a cliff and into the sea along one side of scenic Wied il-Mielaħ in Għarb at around 8pm on Saturday.
 The vehicle was being driven by a 47-year-old Italian man who, police said, lost control of it. He managed to jump to safety as the quad bike crashed over the cliff edge and into the sea but Bertolino, who was a passenger, fell into the sea.
 Her body was recovered after a search, but she succumbed to her injuries.
 It is understood she was in Malta on vacation.
 Many heartbreaking messages came from the Sicilian town of Marsala, where Oriana hailed from.
  Mayor Massimo Grillo announced the news on social media on Sunday, saying her death leaves an ""empty void in the hearts of all who knew her"".
 ""In these moments of pain I would like to express, on behalf of the municipal administration and all the citizens of Marsala, our most felt condolences and our closeness to Oriana's family,"" he wrote.
 ""May Oriana rest in peace and her family find the strength to deal with this enormous pain.""
 Two weeks ago, on her Facebook page, Bertolino posted a message about life choices, saying everyone should be peaceful in their own way.
 ""And that's all. Friends get married, live together and start families. I play the PlayStation, read a fantasy book a day, and save the animals. There is no such thing as ""right"" that goes for everyone. Everyone should be peaceful in their own way,"" she wrote.
  Sources close to the investigation told Times of Malta on Sunday that the police and the Italian embassy in Malta informed her family about their daughter's tragic death and they are expected to come to Malta in the coming days.

"Staff shortages, unfair competition most pressing issues among businesses – SME Barometer for Q3 - The Malta Independent ",independent,https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2024-10-30/local-news/Staff-shortages-unfair-competition-most-pressing-issues-among-businesses-SME-Barometer-for-Q3-6736265333,30-10-2024,000429.png,"
                
        

         The Chamber of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) on Wednesday published its SME Barometer for the third quarter of 2024, where staff shortages and unfair competition remain the most pressing issues small Maltese businesses are facing.
 The SME Chamber also urged government to fulfil its 2022 electoral promise to reduce corporate tax paid by local businesses from 35%, to 25%, as businesses continuously find it difficult to compete in the market with large foreign businesses opened in Malta.  In a presentation given to the media on Monday, President Paul Abela, Chief Operating Officer Andrew Aquilina, Deputy President Philip Fenech and Co-Founder of MISCO Lawrence Zammit presented the SME Barometer for the third quarter of this year, where an outstanding 432 people responded to the online survey, each with a unique code to avoid double submissions.
 The margin of error was that of 4.9%, and the survey was conducted between 9 October and 18 October of this year, covering quarter 3 of 2024.
 Abela said that SMEs were displeased with Monday's Budget for 2025, as it did not avidly focus on small businesses, and none of the proposals put forth by the chamber were considered for the budget, despite consultation.
 ""It seems like we wasted time, and nothing was done,"" Abela said.
 The majority of participants (50.5%) were micro-companies, employing from around one to nine employees, followed by small businesses employing between 10-49 employees (31%), and 16% of respondents said their business size was that of 50+ employees.
 2.5% of respondents were businesses employing more than 249 workers, the Barometer showed.
 36% of respondents came from the Retail, Import, Distribution and Wholesale (goods and services) line of business, followed by 23.5% from the Tourism, Accommodation, Catering and Entertainment Services sector.
 14.5% of respondents are from the Transport, Services and Logistics (Land, Sea, Air) sector, while 14% come from the Legal, Professional and Other Services business line.
 The SME Barometer asked respondents for what they believe are the two most important issues their business is currently facing.
 43% named employee shortage as the most pressing issue, followed by 22% who responded with unfair competition. 18% said that traffic congestion was one of the most important issues their business faces, followed by 16% who responded with increase in inflation.
 15% of respondents also named the processing of TCN VISA Applications are on the issues their business currently faces, the SME Barometer showed.
 Aquilina said that there is still the need for human resources in all sectors, while unfair competition is being created due to the ""discrimination"" small businesses experience in their rate of corporate tax, compared to that paid by foreign companies basing themselves in Malta, which is that of 5%.
 He mentioned an unfair playing field, where issues of competition arose from businesses who are not operating within their own legal limit - unlicensed and unregistered operators. The lack of enforcement on this is also felt, Aquilina said.
 Zammit said that there is the need for a strategy and investment to reduce the amount of people needed for a business, without removing the business altogether.
 Compared to the previous quarters, the issue of increase in inflation has reduced, while the issue of traffic congestion has shot up, the SME Barometer showed.
 Respondents were also asked to name the two most important issues the country is facing, and would like government to do something about it. 41% named a lack of good governance as one of the issues, followed by overpopulation (39%).
 The third most pressing issue businesses want government to act upon is the level of corruption (32%), followed by the increase in inflation (23%).
 Compared to previous quarters, overpopulation was the issue which shot up in importance the most, with businesses who think there is a lack of good governance also increasing. Zammit said that the general public is feeling this issue, as the country's services and infrastructure cannot keep up.
 ""No doubt that we are in between a rock and a hard place in the country, and we need new solutions,"" Zammit said.
 Asked if Malta is moving in the right, or wrong direction, 80% of respondents for the third quarter of 2024 responded that the country is moving in the wrong direction, a 1% increase compared to the second quarter of this year.
 Only 20% believe Malta is moving in the right direction, compared to the previous quarter, where 21% of respondents replied so, the SME Barometer showed.
 Small businesses were asked to say whether they believe that it will be a good time to invest in the country during the next 12 months, to which 57% said that they were not sure, a 4% increase compared to this year's second quarter results.
 The percentage of those who said ""yes"" decreased by 1% compared to 2024's second quarter results, from 14% to 13% in the third quarter. The percentage of those who replied with ""no"" also decreased by 3% compared to the previous quarter, from 33% to 30%.
 Zammit said that the private sector and small businesses are worried about this trend.
 The SME Barometer asked respondents to name the issue which is most hindering their day to day operation as a business, and 28% responded with staff shortages.
 16% named traffic congestion as their business' daily hinderance, followed by 12% who responded with cashflow. 11% named low client demand as their daily hindrance in operation.
 On lower cash flow, the SME Chamber said that this issue is the most alarming one, as it could indicate further credit issues where the business does not collect its money on time.
 Fenech said that productive management in the government Ministries and departments must be calculated in terms of output and expenditure, and government must be more efficient in investing the money paid from taxes by the private sector, better into the population.
 He continued that in terms of traffic congestion, there will be a consultation process on the implementation of a Transport masterplan with the Transport Minister, to see what measures will be impacting small businesses.
 Fenech also pointed out that there is a fragmentation in deliveries by suppliers, which increases fuel costs on the distribution chain, where the business would then have to increase product prices to compensate.
 Abela said that the lower client demand is mostly affect micro-companies, describing the matter as ""worrying."" This is due to the opening of larger supermarkets and establishments in the vicinity of local businesses, he said.
 ""The demand for small shops is decreasing. The fear is that these businesses will finish, family businesses will die, and it will be in the hands of foreign businesses,"" Abela said.
 He said that government must be more aggressive in corporate tax for larger foreign businesses in Malta, and consider the concerns of small businesses. Aquilina continued that small Maltese businesses are suffering discrimination in this tax discrepancy, and urged government to fulfil its promise.
 Asked what issues are hindering growth for their businesses, 21% mentioned high operational costs, followed by 18.5% naming the lack of staff, and 16% naming unfair competition as their business' growth hinderance.
 Zammit and Fenech said that there is ""poaching"" happening by larger businesses on smaller businesses, where the employee is offered greater salaries. The small business would then have to offer more to keep their employees, increasing operational costs.
 ""These are growing pains, not dying pains, but there will certainly be casualties because of competition. The most efficient and best positioned will survive, but if we are efficient in the other problems businesses are facing, then the casualties will decrease,"" Fenech said.
 Respondents were asked to name which specific skills their workforce is lacking in, to which 21% answered that technical skills are the most lacking. 16% named adaptability and flexibility as lacking, and 13.5% named critical thinking as a skill its workforce is lacking.
 Aquilina said that the micro-companies are suffering the most from this, but commended the fact that digital literacy scored low on the list of skills which are lacking in their business workforce.
 Zammit said that the particular skills for a particular job is the most difficult thing to find for small business workforce, and said that nowadays, small businesses seek the same particular skills larger companies seek for.
 In its recommendations, the SME Chamber said that government must focus on regaining trust in the economy and in building a positive business sentiment in general.
 It urged government to fulfil its electoral manifesto of 2022, which contained a promise to reduce the income tax rate for businesses from 35% to 25%. It said that this corporate tax rate reduction was also proposed by the Opposition.
 The Chamber also recommended a Public Procurement Ombudsman that would be independent and be able to scrutinize tenders that are presented to it through formal presentation. The Ombudsman would also carry out independent checks and reviews of adjudication or non-performance.
 The SME Chamber recommended the development of comprehensive strategies to address overpopulation, including urban planning initiatives, investment in infrastructure, and measures to promote sustainable development and balanced demographic growth.
 It also recommended an increase the MicroInvest aid scheme intensity, from 45% to 65% for micro-enterprises, whilst for small enterprises the threshold for the maximum credit to be claimed would be increased from €50,000 to €70,000.
 The SME Chamber said that unfair competition and inadequate governance practices hinder a fair market. It recommended the enhancement of law enforcement measures to target these issues directly, ensuring that businesses operate on a level playing field and uphold transparency.
 The Chamber said that micro-enterprises often lack the resources to invest in employee training and development programs. To address this challenge, it proposed making training grants more attractive and accessible to self-employed and micro-businesses.
 Abela and Zammit said that government must examine its workforce to determine its productivity, as is done in the private sector, to address overpopulation.
 He said that the ongoing police raids, and them finding 30, or 40 irregular workers in the country, shows that there are unskilled, unregistered workers who are contributing to the country's overpopulation.
 ""There is no enforcement, this must be regular,"" Abela said, adding that the SME Chamber is prepared to participate with government to tackle overpopulation.
 Zammit said that investment in technology and other advances to reduce the amount of workers needed and influence the economy, where productivity would then increase.
 Abela also mentioned government's Vision 2050 document, saying that there was already one for 2030, and all government is doing is pushing the responsibility onto the next governments and societies.
 He recommended that the Vision should not be a government one, but for the country, to provide security for generations.
